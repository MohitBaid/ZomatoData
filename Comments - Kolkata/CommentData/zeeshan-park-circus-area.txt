One of the feasible places to try mughlai dishes. With its early morning opening breakfasts are a must to try. The quality of biryani was worth the price and so was the kebabs. The firni ended the meal quite well with its quality. Rolls here are very good for quick bites. Alongwith the service the overall experience of this place is pretty good to catch up for dinner or lunch and now breakfasts even.

Below average Mutton Biriyani, not at all juicy nor is the mutton succulent. Complete waste of money having Biriyani here. Shall stick to the rolls in this place.

Took egg chicken roll as parcel. 
The taste is amazing but the size is a bit small compared to the prices. 
Likes the taste a lot. 
Looking forward to visit soon again to check the other dishes.

I had ordered mutton special biriyani. First they keep me waiting for countless minutes, then they cancel my order. But finally when they took our order they sent us chicken special biriyani. You guys can at least check what you are sending. You take the order of one and deliver a different thing. Really not expected from a restaurant like yours. Totally disappointed.

Popularly known for serving mughlai food.
The decor isn't much great. The place is really small though it has got two floors. It's isn't decorated much so don't expect much on that aspect.
Food is good. I won't say it's delicious. The quantity is also good. Worth the money though.
It's located near the park circus crossing.
Visit this place to experience mughlai food at cheap prices. Happy fooding 😊

Chicken pieces were soft and the gravy were very tasty.. they have both ac and non ac seating zone.. pricing is good and servicing is okay..

And if you love Kolkata style Biriyani you should try their chicken egg biriyani...
Their chicken Reshmi kebab is really so yummy dish...
We tried their chicken angara as side dish which is really good if you love spicy foods ...
I am giving them 4.5* just becz their raita... everything tastes great except the raita...it's too watery...

Ordered Chicken biryani and chicken malai kebab butter masala today! I was a bit disappointed with the chicken piece of the biryani, it was absolutely boney with very less flesh, otherwise I liked it. The kebab masala was alright, a bit bland but not bad, the chicken pieces were tender and delectable! Looking forward to ordering some more items in future!

Zeeshan has been one of the oldest Mughlai joints in the area of Park Circus. However with the passage of time and new competitors, it has succumb much to the competition. The ambience is okayish. 
Their Biryani is pretty basic & so is the mutton chaap. What really is good about the place are their rolls, be it Mutton Tikka or Chicken Roll & also their Tandoori Rotis that are pretty huge & soft.

It is the biggest Zeeshan in Kolkata, near Quest Mall.On various occassions I have tried their Biryani,Rumali Roli, Mutton Tikia,Malai Kofta, Mixed Veg,Mutton Chaap, Firni,Shahi Tukda and Rolls.
Food -Now Zeeshan is primarily known for its rolls and they do make great rolls. The biryani is average and not as good as some of its competitors that swarm the area.I have been left disappointed by the potato and the piece of chicken/mutton in terms of flavour and tenderness on both the occasions I have visited.The Mutton Tikia and the mutton chaap is decent but like all Zeeshan dishes, are rich but not entirely flavourful. The less said about the vegetarian dishes the better. I love their desserts though, they're creamy and not too sweet.
Ambience- Its quite stiff and feels dated. Interiors are an eye sore.
Service- Waiters are not too friendly but service is functional. Food arrives quickly.
All in all, a pretty average place. Go there for the rolls and the desserts. If you are looking for a more than satisfactory dining experience that is not too expensive, honestly there are better places nearby.

Have been going to this one since childhood...
Nowadays i mostly order online...
Their LACCHA PARATHAs are to die fir...Arguably the best in kolkata...That is why their Rolls are my favourite...

Their MUTTON CHAAP surely deserves special mention...finger-lickin good...compliments the laccha paratha perfectly.
Another recent discovery of mine from their menu is CHICKEN MALAI KEBAB BUTTER MASALA...OMG...Its heavenly in taste...Have it with BUTTER NAN and you're gonna get clean bowled.. ;)

They also make good CHICKEN RESHMI KEBAB as well as CHICKEN RESHMI BUTTER MASALA...

Their BIRYANI was my constant when i was a child...now i feel its oily and there are better options nearby(Arsalan)...Nevertheless biriyani is quite good(just feels oily) and quantity is also great ...

My Mom's favourite dishes here are CHICKEN REZALA along with RUMALI ROTI...and FIRNI for the perfect ending.. :)

During the Ramzaan month...Their MUTTON HALEEM is a must try...Certainly one of the best in Kolkata... :)

So all the items in blocks are the ones you can surely try out here and have a happy meal...Enjoy...CHEERS!!!

Biryani is amazingly perfect with a little taste of spiciness and a glass of ghol along with it makes the perfect combination. Rolls are great and the crispy paratha is mouth watering. Chaaamp also tastes good. The moment you walk past the restaurant the tasty aroma of the chaamp tempts you. Good service.
This is one spot where we often go after college when hungry tummy craves for biryani.

Do not ever visit this filthy piece of shit restro (doesn't even deserve to call it so) ever. Not even on gunpoint. 
We had the most unfortunate incident of visiting this place just coz we had no other option and as we were stuck at ballygaunge and we decided to try this one out. 
But it turned out worse. Not only the food was absolute third class, the atmosphere is cheap, the behaviour of the staff and the waiters are ignorant and to sum it up this is by far the worst food joint I ever had to dine in. 
The only good thing about this joint is the firni which is at par with Arsalan. Rest IT SUCKS. 
If you do see this review, trust me chuck out this restro from your list. 
If you wish to be healthy the very next morning, do not dine here. 
It looks like a cheap joint where all you get is SHIT. 
I've had meals at almost all the restros in and around park street and park circus, but this has got to be the worst experience of all time.
Stay away from this crappy joint.

With the unfortunate incident of our original lunch destination being closed due to eid,we decided to visit zeeshan to satiate our craving for north indian food. Ideally situated near quest mall,the outlet is quite popular amongst the heavyweights arsalan & haji saheb nearby to it. If i'm not wrong this outlet is the main of zeeshan group in kolkata(i might be wrong).

This place has 2 sections of dining i.e. ground floor being non a.c & upper floor being the a.c section. The a.c section has low ceiling which creates a problem in moving around so be careful. The sitting capacity is adequate of around 25. Ambience is decent,nothing extraordinary!!

Now coming to the food,we had the following dishes:-

1. Chicken boti kebabs - 6pcs of juicy tender chicken kebabs coated in spicy tikka masala accompanied by chopped onions and charred tomatoes & capsicums along with their in house mint chutney. The dish was just delicious, flavours were spot on & made our tastebuds happy.

2. Butter nan - 2 fluffy nans coated in fresh butter. This was taken by my friend.

3. Hyderabadi chicken biryani - There are very few places in kolkata serving hyderabadi biryani. Previously i have never had this version of biryani,so being sceptical i opted for this with the oppurtunity of trying something new. A wholesome plate of mild spicy biryani consisting of kurry pattas,jujube(kul) along with 1 egg,1 potato & chicken piece. The biryani was certainly different from the regular ones which i liked. The chicken & potato were cooked to perfection. The quality of rice was also good.

4. Hyderabadi mutton biryani - Same as above with the only inclusion of mutton piece in place of chicken. The mutton was fresh & tender.

5. Chicken tikka butter masala - If you love a spicy side dish,then go for this one. 6pcs of generous tikka chicken in spicy gravy. The oil content was moderate in the dish. The chicken tikkas were absolutely great to eat. The gravy also gave a great kick of flavours with our nans & biryani.

6. Shahi tukda - How can a great meal be ended without some desserts? So we opted to have shahi tukda & firni. The shahi tukda was served in a takeaway box which was odd. The dish was however lukewarm which was kind of disappointing since shahi tukdas are always served hot. The dessert was fresh to consume but it was too sweet for our liking.

7. Firni - The firni just won our hearts as compared to the shahi tukda. The firni was not too cold since they don't keep in the freezer. The texture was absolutely fantastic. Recommended.

The service was however a let down & could be improved upon. The pocket pinch was moderate with around Rs 430 per head. They charge GST of 18% in the a.c section(cannot comment for non ac section).

Ordered chicken malai kebab butter masala , chicken tikka butter masala , mutton quorma, chicken biriyani , naan , rezalla , tandoor roti ... Everything except the quorma was really good. 
Biriyani  .. . Well we get everywhere n even the big names nowadays serve biriyani as mithe aator, food color, n chicken aloo n excess oil.. you don't get the flavours of the beautiful spices n originality of the recipe isn't maintained , Zeeshan to my surprise was perfect with chicken aloo egg , perfect balance of flavours, not excess oil , n you get the taste of all the beautiful spices. 
Next the chicken dishes both were really good with tender meat n perfect taste , the malai kebab butter masala needs a special mention where the gravy is sweet n creamy n ....ok I started salivating 
The naan also was impressive not like the nearby mughlai joints where they give you either a burnt leather which is so difficult to tear or a paapar in the name of naan ... soft, spongy not burnt perfect naan 
N the rezalla chicken piece is also decent not like some places where they serve you a big piece of bone from which most of the meat has been removed for some other boneless chicken preparation.  
Also not heavy on your pocket n courteous staff .

An all time classic for every Calcuttan where they have a perfect rendezvous with their beloved mughlai dishes. Biriyani, butter naans, rezalas, bhartas, kebabs, mutton, chicken you name it and they serve it all with near perfection. 
Price quite reasonable.
Interiors and ambience are well off... I mean that you'll be intoxicated with the aroma of the food that you'll hardly give a damn about your surroundings.
Definitely visit.

What can I say about it that Calcutta does not know. It is famous for it's chicken roll. I would die for their biryani. It is so economic and convenient. I go there everyday and have at least a chicken roll. One of those places in Calcutta without which Calcutta wouldn't be CALCUTTA.

Good food..Good ambience.. Love their Mutton Pasinda and Tandoori Roti.. But the quality of Biriyani is really not up to the quality we expect or rather they use to provide previously..

Just another nice biriyani place. It might not be the best biriyani in the city but the food is decent. You have a outside roll counter  which just like the rest it's also decent .

One of my favorites. 

Starting from rolls to biriyani to mutton chaap,, chicken rezala, mutton pasinda, romali roti loved each of them.. Personal favorite being the kebab rolls and firni

My friend and I popped in here for lunch today. We ordered Mutton Biryani and Mutton Special Kosha.
All three dishes were served together. The biryani tasted good and the meat, egg and potato combo in it were really good. Enjoyable, but the quantity of rice was fairly less as per my personal opinion.
But the three pieces of mutton in it were fairly small.
We were served a separate salad, which we hadn't ordered. Strange indeed.
I believe Zeeshan can do it better and should start walking that path soon.

Mutton tikia roll is the snack to munch on even better is egg tikia roll. The best in tikia roll in Kolkata without a doubt. A request is to stand there and munch on it, don't let sit for long cause it would not taste the same.

I have ordered chicken biryani, chichen reshmi kebab, chicken tikka kebab several times for takeaway. I would recommend the kebabs more than the biryani which was just about okay. Once during the Ramzan season, I had also tried out the chicken haleem......somehow, I felt the taste of lentils got the better of meat.

I can almost swear by the kebabs they make here, so juicy and tender. The Chicken rezala, mutton brain curry - absolutely relishing. I tried the haleem last year during Ramzaan, honestly, it made me feel haleem was such an exquisite thing to eat! The service is pretty decent, the staff co-operative. Hoping to visit yet again, once I'm in town.

Pretty much a old iconic place near park circus. Ordered a chicken roll and a mutton botti kebab. The boti kebab was amazing. Spicy but super tasty. I have had real good mutton experiences in Kolkata.

Zeeshan is an authentic name in the field of biryani . This outlet is located very close to quest mall , at a walking distance of 3-4 minutes . The ground floor is non AC and so sitting there does not cost you any extra tax. But the ambience is noisy and a bit disturbing when crowded.
The first floor has AC but the ceiling is so low we had to stoop and reach our table in order to avoid collision with the roof .
We had chicken biryani, firni and shahi tukra.
Biryani was tasty ,no doubt, but one of my friends found a small hair in the plate after having finished almost all his biryani. This killed my apetite. Totally unacceptable when u r paying so much taxes, at least you can expect a bit of hygiene .
Nevertheless the firni was ok but the quantity was too less for 55rs . The spoons were not washed properly . They had scars on them of previously dried detergents .
The shahi tukra was another dessert we ordered. The quantity was good and there r no complaints with it.
Staffs were courteous and polite . Decent management.

On another occasion had haleem from there as a takeaway . Mutton Haleem was pretty average and tasted rather flat .
I mostly go there to have rolls nowadays coz they make awesome rolls there . The rolls are pretty cheap too and you get a lot of varieties . My favourite is the Mutton Tikka Roll . If you visit there , the rolls are highly recommended .
UPDATE AS ON 29.09.2017 - Went dere on Navami night dz time...they were no place for two..n we were made to sit in a far off table which was not reserved for normal use .. we were provided a PUJA SPECIAL MENU ( new business in town!) with price of each item +20..we ordered chicken reshmi butter masala and tandoori roti... The gravy was tasty but the chicken pieces were not soft ..had difficulty tearing dem at times ..tandoori roti also bcm stale within minutes... Was much DISAPPOINTED with the staff's behaviour who came and handed us the BILL even when I was eating d last piece ... Wen I asked y so soon dey said ok eat ... My qstn is den WHY ON EARTH DID U HAND OVER THE BILL IF U HAD NO PROBLRM WITH ME EATING...?? Den more staffs came and shouted on dem saying why you allowed customers on this table ... Simply SLACKY management !!! Untrained staffs who dznt Kno how to handle customers !!! They rly need to improve on diz ..odrwz it wont take long for people to find out far better restaurants nearby offering much better food and service at d same price!!!!
OH YEAH forgot to mention ...please CARRY UR HAND SANITIZER ..the wash basin of the AC section dznt work ( u ll need ages to wash ur hands with the lil water oozing out from the faulty tap!)

One of the best (sometimes underrated) Mughlai joints of Kolkata.
On my opinion, their Mutton Chaap is the second best in town, apart from The Royal Indian Hotel at Chitpur (specifically).
During the holy month of Ramadan, I consider their Haleem to be also one of frontrunners to be the best ones available in Kolkata. Kolkata Haleem, is technically more of a Dal Gosht, where Zeeshan does dish out something which stays with you.
Apart from these, the Biryanis, Mutton Kassa, Mutton Rezala & Kebabs are also their speciality.
So hop in and have a gala gastronomic time!

Zeeshan was in my bucket-list for a long tym & Today
Me and One of my friend finally decided to celebrate Ramadan Here & Guess What there was iftaar special offers are going on.
So, Basically this offers gives you 9 items at 349(including Tax) ->
1) Mutton Haleem ( Average )
2) Chicken Tikka Biryani ( Delicious )
3) Chicken Makhni ( Very Good )
4) Chicken Lolipop (4pcs) ( Mouthwatering )
5) Lacha Paratha ( 1pc ) ( Soft )
6) 2 Softy Kebab with Cone Paratha ( Mine favourite )
7) Fresh Cut Fruits
8) 500ML Coke
9) 500ML Mineral Water

I Must tell that this is the best deal i have ever got.
The quality of food and quantity both were perfect.. the quantity was enough for 2 people.
Every dish they served was perfect in taste. 
I personally impressed a lot & I'll give this restaurant 5star for their food taste and quantity but i was little disappointed about hygienic issue. Washroom was not that much clean.. That's why i rate this restaurant 4.5 .
Interior was very normal and ground floor section was non AC & Service was a little bit slow but not a big deal for me.
It is highly recommended for North indian food lovers. Go and give a Try..
I'll come back for sure 😊

Follow Me If Possible It Will Encourage Me A Lot 😍

Rolls. This place offers my favorite Kolkata Chicken Rolls. Amazing flavor. I have been going to this place since my childhood. It has amazing dinner dishes. It is wonderful for family get-togethers. Try the Chicken Bharta, Butter Chicken, Biryani, Seekh kebab, and yes the Chicken rolls. Amongst the many places lined around Park Street, this is a good option.
They could upgrade the décor etc. But I'm all it is a nice venue.
Prices are moderate.

The place serves one of the best Biriyani. I love visiting this place for Biriyani. It is served with aloo and egg which i personally love. The chicken /mutton piece is also good. 
Apart from Biriyani,  i tried the different tandoor items which were also tasty. 
Tasted Haleem,  which is served during Ramzan month which was good. I didn't find it so tasty. It's a one time try. 
Shahi tukra is a MUST TRY when it comes to deserts. 
Service is good but ambience is not upto the mark.

T'was a special day for me & my better half. After a hot summer day we decided to end our special day at Zeeshan. I am a regular here, whenever I am near park circus, i always pay a visit to Zeeshan . We started off with Chicken Reshmi Kabab, which was very moist and delectable. The accompanying dip was delicious. We decided to go for another round of Kebabs, this time Chicken Sheekh Kebab. The Kebabs was just as I  had  remembered having numerous times, soft on the inside and a good char on the outside. After the second round of Kebabs we ordered Mutton Handi and Tandoori Roti, The spice on the mutton was balanced well to my expectations. The crunchy bell peppers and the crispy fried onions were married to the thick gravy and was great. The mutton pieces were cooked to perfection. We finished off with Sahi Tukra I had for the first time. It wasn't too sweet but rightly balanced. Zeeshan has always served me and other patrons with great food and extraordinary staff . I thank you for making this day more special to me.

P.S. I could not take photos of the food as light was not adequate. (But appropriate for our special day).

This place is located near Quest Mall. Being very far from my area , i am not able to visit this particular outlet too often but whenever i get a chance to visit Quest Mall , i try it out here. The biryanis are tasty but not in par with Arsalan. The place is less crowded as compared to Arsalan outlets and hence the food items are served/packed quickly. The items that needs to be tried out while you are here are rolls, Chap, Kababs, Lachcha Paratha.

Sasta Sundar aur tikau!!! If you are in Calcutta (I don't know why i hate saying Kolkata) and looking for place which would offer great food and at the same time won't burn your pocket. This is the place. Biryani, Kebabs are good in that price range. While everyone else write 'Shahi Tukra' and 'Firni' on their menu but they actually happen to serve it, which also tastes good. But I find the place (park circus) a bit spooky and dirty.

This outlet is located near Quest mall & Park circus seven point crossing. Visited with my office colleagues.
We had Chicken tandoori, Chicken tikka kabab in starter. The Chicken tandoori, Chicken tikka kabab were top notch. In main course we ordered Tandoori roti, Lacha partha, Chicken malai kebab butter masala and Chicken amritsari butter masala. Chicken malai kebab butter masala was awesome it comes with six pieces of chicken and the gravy was so tasty, chicken pieces were tender, just got melt in mouth. Chicken malai kebab butter masala was also delicious. At the end, we had firni, which was thick & too good.
Ambiance is not that great :-( 
The best part is pricing here is kept reasonable.

We were on our way to quest mall , in the meantime, to fill up our tummy, we went to Zeeshan to have a quick lunch. Naturally we opted for mutton biriyani to have  our food as soon as possible.
It is  a purely Kolkata style Biriyani served with egg, one large pototao piece, and a mutton. It did not disappoint us. It is quite satisfying in terms of quality and quantity. The ceiling of the Ac room was very low, that was the only turn off but, as far as the food is concerned , this joint is up to the mark.

My experience is pathetic with Zeeshan, I always eat  biryani from arslaan. So , this time I make my plan to eat biryani from Zeeshan . I ordered online from zomato and order for chicken biryani and mutton chaap. Instead of chicken biryani they give me mutton biryani, I always make my combination with chicken biryani and mutton gravy dish but I am disappointed with Zeeshan home delivery. May be they give good biryani at their resturant but in home delivery they do not give their proper service and disappoint me.

This was our frequent hangout place during University days. This was sort of within walking distance from our Ballygung Science college Campus and it was always less crowded than Arsalan. Biryaini, mutton chap, murg malai kabab and sahi tukda, these 4 items are my all time favorite. This place is one of the gem that still holding up city's long tradition in Mughlai cuisine.

Nothing comes close to my all time favourite mughlai joint Royal India Hotel but for a change its not so bad. Laccha paratha was full of oil but tasty and sweet. Mutton chaap was good bit as i said nothing beats the king of chaap-Royal India mutton chaap. Very reasonable pricing and service was also top notch as u can expect in such joints. Will visit again to try their biryani.

This place serves you amazing biryani and in good amounts and still does not burn a hole in your pocket. I always visit this place whenever i crave biryani and simultaneously broke. Located near the park circus crossing, this restaurant is neat and moderately decorated. There is a roll and kabab counter right beside the entrance and people are always flocking around, be it whatever time of the day. Service is superfast. I've never waited more than 5-6 minutes.

Coming to the food, i've not yet been disappointed by any item i've ordered till date. The mutton biryani is so good and so is the chicken biryani. The reshmi butter masala is absolutely delicious. The chicken rezala and chicken kassa follows up. The array of kababs will never be enough and you'll end up ordering them again. Also the Phirni is a must try. 

Pocket pinch: 800 for two. Plus no taxes.

One of the legendary mughlai restaurant situated in park circus. The food use to be delicious. I personally loved their biryani and chicken bara kebab but With rise in the number of competitors and quality not being uniform it has led to less food fan following for this place. Would advice the management to improve the quality of food in order to regain the name in the game.

The unsung hero of Park Circus Mughlai food joints. I have been coming here for about seven years now. The rates of food have almost doubled, and Arsalan might have stolen its thunder, but I still believe that Zeeshan's biriyani has a certain je ne sais quoi to it. No, it's not only about the boiled egg they provide with the biriyani, or about the huge quantity of rice. It's about that faintly aromatic al dente slightly greasy rice that has been cooked to perfection, and that piece of tender mutton with perfect flavouring. I also am a die hard fan of their kebabs and butter nun. Their mutton rezala, though a little sweet for my taste, is a dish that has its share of fans in my group of friends. I personally stay away from their mutton tikia, as it's a little too strong for my palate.

Once upon a time, I was a resident of Park Circus and naturally well acquaint of the realm in and around Zeeshan. It is located on Syed Amir Ali Avenue and in the junction popularly known as Zeeshan Morh, being a landmark in itself.

This particular outlet has been taking a roller coaster ride. Around half a decade ago, it's popularity was on the lower side but has now slowly and steadily revived it's image.

I have had tasted its kebabs, rumali roti, various kinds of rolls as well as biryani. However, the dine in facility was rarely used. The kebabs are great, the rotis are just like it has to be, biryani is okayish but the rolls are excellent and my heart goes out for it!

A definite visit at least for rolls.

Its situated in between park circus 7-point crossing and recent Quest mall and is a landmak in itself. Just like Siraz, Zeeshan operates from morning 6 AM to 1030 PM at night. 
The Zeeshan Biryani is like making a 30-ish woman. Hot and full-bodied. It takes on the palate immediately and subtlety is not her cup of tea. The taste is definitely good and little rich in taste.

Earlier they used to serve as per client request of Sukha cut biryani (the dry, less spicy rice portion from the biryani handi with meat) and Gila cut (rich, more aromatic portion from the handi) but now like all good things, they’ve stopped it. But, if you tip the waiter well enough, who knows what might happen. The make a surprisingly well Chicken rashmi kabab also, worth a try.

Located near Park Circus Seven Point Crossing. Though many more comepetitives available in that area, this restaurant offers mughlai dishes at moderate reasonable prices. Biryani test is good. the special thinks is egg with biryani. chicken preparation is not good as my test . The service was a little slow and we found an insect in our water jug. Other than that, if you're a biryani lover, it is a must visit.

If you haven't had Zeeshan ever, what exactly are you doing with your life? Harsh words, but none of them are true. 
Kolkata's most popular Mughlai place famous for its biriyanis and chaaps, Zeeshan is something you can not miss out on. 
While the decor may need an update, food and hospitality should definitely remain the same.

Zeeshan has many outlets. This outlet is located at Park Circus seven point crossing which mainly serves Mughlai and North Indian delicacies.

Ambience is nice with good sitting arrangements.

Service is bit slow but staffs are friendly.

Tried Mutton special Biriyani , it contained sufficient quantity with 2 pieces of mutton and 1 egg, was awesome and well cooked. Meat pieces were tender. 

Chicken tandoori was very impressive. It was soft, juicy and flavourful .

At last had firni. Which was thick & creamy and enjoyable.

Pocket pinch is reasonable with sufficient quantity.

A must visit place.

Zeeshan is situated in the very prime location of park circus seven point crossing and is very easily accessible. It is a traditional Kolkata eatery serves one of the best biryani in town. It has a AC family section as well as a Non AC sit-out in the front. Mutton Tikka kebab, Mutton Boti Kebab and Chicken Hariyali Kebab are just awesome. The service is slow but the staffs are polite. In dessert section Firni is a must try. Ambiance is nice. Good place to hangout with friends and family. Pocket friendly.

Had haleem from this place for the first time so definitely I had high expectations before tasting it.
Well my tummy was completely satisfied with the preparation.
Just loved the gooey thing teamed up with soft mutton pieces and garnished with coriander leaves.
I feel like having it right now rather while recalling its physical pleasure 😂
Biryanis of this place are great as well 👍

I recently visited the Park Circus branch of Zeeshan with my friends. There was no occasion as such which influenced our dinner plan. We just felt like spending a good time with each other. In this context, it’s important to mention that I have visited Zeeshan’s Park Circus branch once before in the year 2015. However, this time Zeeshan disappointed me to a great extent. I ordered chicken biryani and chicken rezala. The rest of my friends opted for mutton biryani and chicken dopiaza. Now, the service was not prompt by any stretch of imagination, and I am saying this taking into consideration that the restaurant was quite empty at that point of time. I felt that the quantity for the biryani served was fair enough, but the taste was not delicious at all. It was a bit on the spicy side, and the aroma associated with biryani failed to make any sort of impression in our minds as well. On the other hand, my chicken rezala was tasteless and a bit on the harder side. My friends also complained that the quality of mutton pieces in their biryani were not up to the mark. However, they felt that the chicken dopiaza was kind of okay. Interestingly, as far as I can remember, the food and service quality were much better in the year 2015 when I last visited this restaurant. Finally, if you take into consideration the price rates, the food quality is definitely not up there or nowhere near the desired standard. Therefore, I would not like to recommend Zeeshan to anyone.

Let me be honest, I'm slightly partial to this resturant because it is my favorite biriyani spot in this city. 
If you do get a chance to visit the place, please avail of thier a.c sitting arrangement on the ground floor and ask for 'Munna' to wait at your table. 
Fantastic staff, even better food and promt service adds up to an amazing dining environment experience. 
I have no suggestions for this resturant..  You guys are amazing, keep doing what your doing.

As for suggestions for the diners. Chicken-egg biriyani with a side of Mutton tikya is what you should order. And If you aren't a fan of biriyani. Go for the Mutton chaanp with butter rotis. 
You won't regret trying this place if you haven't tried it already :)

You will get a good quality of biriyani here, specially if you are both calorie conscious and biriyani lovers. They use less oil than Arsalaan, Royal, Shiraz in biriyani. 
Other gravy items like Chaap, Rezala are also good. But every time I felt that they should have use a little more salt in the gravies. 
Kebabs are good.
Overall it can be good and affordable  destination for the Mughlai lovers.

Near to my office, went with a group of friends to celebrate a friend's birthday. This restaurant serves tasty food at affordable prices.
We ordered chicken bharta, mutton special biriyani, paneer do pyaza, peas polao, paneer polao, green salad and firni.
Paneer do pyaza and paneer polao were well cooked and delectable. Mutton special biriyani comes with two pieces of mutton and an egg. It was awesome, meat pieces were tender, just got melt in mouth. Chicken bharta was average. They serve boneless chicken pieces in rezala gravy.
At the end, we had firni, which was too good.
Service was slow but staffs were well behaved. Pocket pinch is affordable compare to quality and quantity. Come and enjoy.

Visited with Subham on 7th of December 2016,we ordered Butter Nan,Mutton shami kabab and chicken chaap.The service was too slow,we waited about 20 minutes there after ordering.
Butter Nan-The nan was not so soft,it was little hard and not so good in taste,a bit more salty than usual,and the mild smell of yeast was coming from the nan was not good.
Mutton shami ksbab & chicken chaap-both the gravies were good,as they give same gravies in chap and kabab which really goes well with biriyani.The chicken was good tender juicy.
Mutton shami kabab was too spicy in every bite and a little raw smell of spices were coming from the motton kabab,there was too much motton fat in the kabab which is unchewable.
Overall ok,No tax in non A.C and reasonable.

The location is very strategic. The place is surrounded by different mughlai restaurants like Royal, Arsalan, Haji Saheb. 
We ordered the chicken tandoori and Chicken Biryani. 
The Chicken tandoori was soft, tender and full of flavour,served with fresh mint chutney and onions. 
The Biryani never fails to impress me and is delicious. 
The service was a little slow and we found an insect in our water jug. Other than that, if you're a biryani lover, it is a must visit.

There was a time when their biryani was one of the most famous. We always preferred Zeeshan for the quality of mutton. 15 years ago when I first visited, I was over whelmed by taste. The rolls are quite good too of you are not fitness freak. Though the ambiance is not good that good but still a very good place for food.

This Outlet of Zeeshan is located near Quest mall. Easy to locate. I tried only their Rolls and Biryani. Biryani was good in taste. Not too oily. But their Rolls disappointed me. Egg Rolls were good But in case of chicken Roll, the amount of chicken in the roll is very less in quantity. Otherwise It's good.

It's impossible to visit kolkata n not end up picking the rolls from Zeeshan. Its been a favourite for a long time n happy to see that the taste is still maintained.
The best is the simple chicken rolls n the egg chicken rolls. The lachha parathas in which they roll is awesome and this taste makes them stand out. The chicken content is just appropriate n not too much ir too less. Its the simplicity of the chicken n paratha without any major additions that makes it perfect.
At the price they offer, nowhere in the world you can get a stomachful of rolls. Keep it up guys.
Service is fast and they push to their limits when pressed hard.

So I revisited this nostalgic place almost after 9 years, only to be disappointed to the core. The grandeur is much lost, I & my friend being the only two clients in the evening for as long as we were there, yet the waiter almost had to be requested to take the order. We stepped in only to have a couple of firnis, a pang in the sweet tooth I guess. Things went spiralling down just after the first spoonful, the memories of that once enticing Zeeshan are too valuable to squander about with a taste like this...

A 3⭐ for what you have been for all these years...peace

The quantity is plenty for 2 and too my surprise the chilly chicken was tasty. 
Then again I had rumali roti and chicken and mutton rezala..... I am a chicken person so chicken rezala was a thumbs up .

zeeshan does not fall into my favourite biriyani places but due to high demand during the pujas i had to have it there. The biriyani is nothing out of the world, it is okay.  There is nothing to talk about the ambience because there is no such ambience at all. 
we had ordered chicken korma along with the biriyani and both had a lot of dalda in it. 

but one thing i must say is that i had tried their variety of rolls and i am completely in love with them. They make amazing rolls. Any body who has missed out on their chicken roll and mutton tikia roll must try those you will not be disappointed.
so for me a no to the biriyani but a big high five for the rolls section.

Only one question - for both their service and their biryani - why? Why is it so oily and full of dalda? Why is it so unhygienic? I've had biryani from street food shops as well, and Zeeshan fails to compete even with those stalls. Not only is the quality pathetic, their hygiene level needs a serious check. My girlfriend had to go though a serious phase of stomach upset after having biryani from zeeshan. Even I've had the same issue. They seriously need to improve big time.

Only one question - for both their service and their biryani - why? Why is it so oily and full of dalda? Why is it so unhygienic? I've had biryani from street food shops as well, and Zeeshan fails to compete even with those stalls. Not only is the quality pathetic, their hygiene level needs a serious check. My girlfriend had to go though a serious phase of stomach upset after having biryani from zeeshan. Even I've had the same issue. They seriously need to improve big time.

Zeeshan is located in a popular area at Park Circus. So need not to give any location description. The Hyderabadi Biriyani I loved. Also murgh malai tikka masala also very good. Also once I was on Kolkata tried their Roll too. That was also good in taste. I like the crispy ness of the paratha.

Legend for Kolkata style Hyderabad Biriyani n mutton rezala.

Comparatively a bit less crowded and low priced.

The roll over here? I'm sorry, but you don't want to try that. The quality of the paratha was not fresh, chicken was also not properly cooked. After reaching home, I fell ill, stomach upset made me more weak. 
Such a type of quality from an eatery is not expected at all.

One of the great Biriyani place around Park Circus ( Arsalan, Shiraz, Rahmania and now Royal as well). No complaints about the Biriyani - does the hype justice. But have to specially mention the Chicken Bharta ( Specify the spicy red kind while ordering) - team it up with roomalis and I guarantee foodgasms with each bite !!

Came here because The Dhaba has closed down. Picked up rolls from here - Chicken , Egg Chicken and Mutton. I liked the quality of the parathas and the meat was delicious. Only thing is , they make the parathas a bit too sweet for my liking. Otherwise, good option for quick comfort food.

had been a favourite place since college days. recently went there with cousins,  ordered butter nun, reshmi chicken butter masala and an egg chicken biriyani. food was tasty and sumptuous. but biriyani was a little too oily as oil dripped on the serving plate.  pocket pinch was 535/-  which is pretty reasonable!

My partner and I visit this place quite often for dinners on our way back home from office.

I quite like their biriyani, which isn't too staid nor too over the top and spicy.
The kebabs are good, very moist and tender.

One of our absolute favourites is the Chicken Malai kebab butter masala, a must try !!
            

Service is quick, pocket pinch approx. 500 INR for two.

I have just tried rolls from this outlet..
All the zeeshan outlets provide more or less the same quality of rolls.. crisp and heavy laccha paratha and nice chunks of roasted or kababs of meats as fillings..
I also like their egg rolls.. they are not soggy and u can feel the distinct flavor of egg..
My favorite will be the chicken roll , followed by mutton and egg.. their egg chicken rolls are a hit too..but i prefer having normal chicken roll in order to enjoy taste of the chicken filling..
Location is beside the quest mall and more appropriately the parkcircus trum depot.. well this place itself is a land mark!! Kudos for the zeeshan roll!!

Located in the Biriyani Central of Kolkata, Park circus Area this is one of the oldest and popular moglai joints. But In case of food quality and taste this place does not stand out at all. We ordered the Chicken reshmi Kabab and Chicken Bharta with Laccha Paratha. All dough the kabab was good the bharta was truly not. With excess oil both the bharta and the paratha was a little disappointing. 

Overall rating Average. :)

We tend to judge a Mughlai restaurant by it's Biryani. And Zeeshan fails 100 times in that. Their Biryani is pretty much disgusting. Not sure about their other stuffs, may be good or else.

I was literally in love with Zeeshan in my college days back when I studied in a college near by. There are many more Mughlai restaurants in the are but Zeeshan still is a stand out, the naans are soft and sweet , the biriyanis equally delicious, paneer butter masala was one of our regular orders .

The place is located in the hottest biriyani destination in Kolkata, Park Circus. Easy to find. The a.c. part of the restaurant is average. The roof is so low. The ambiance is moderate. I ordered Chicken Boti Kabab, Egg Biriyani, Masala Kulcha and Chicken Tikka Kabab Bt Masala. The kabab was great, the biriyani was a bit flat with the ingredients not making their presence felt, the kulcha was not that good, the chicken bt masala was good. The waiter was very polite. Overall a good experience.

Food has the power to take you back in time. Makes you nostalgic!! The earliest memory of me going to Zeeshan is many many years ago, during Durga Puja and having Firni, that was the very first time I had Firni and just fell in love with it. 

Fast forward around 20 years, this place has made quite a name for itself in the busy Park Circus area. The rolls are really famous and in the evening you'll have to wait for a good 15-20 minutes before you get your hands on them. I love the Egg chicken roll. The biriyani is delicious as well, so are the kebabs. The prices are pretty reasonable.

Though Zeeshan has many outlets in Kolkata, their main outlet is located in our city's very own Biryani den i.e. Park Circus. At a stone throw distance from Park Circus crossing, the outlet is located on the main road and is hard to miss because of the kebab and tandoor aroma from the store. The restaurant is not very sizable therefore becomes overcrowded during festive seasons.

Food I've had when I visited there with a friend was as follows. Chicken Biryani, Chicken Malai Kebab, Chicken Bharta and Firni. It was an odd time dinner hence we did not order any more items. The Chicken Biryani was pretty good. It was accompanied with a leg piece of chicken and a medium sized potato, rice wasn't very fragrant but they got all the spices right, the chicken piece was a slender one though.

Chicken Malai Kebab was nothing more than Reshmi Kebab topped with melted cheese, not a lot cheesy but tasted descent enough. Chicken Bharta was oily, wasn't the worst I have ever tasted but they could surely improve on that one. And boy, can we complete a Biryani meal without Firni? Firni was good, would melt in the mouth straightaway. Overall the quality of food was pretty good, very less oily except for the bharta.

Pricing was average, a bill for two would come around ~₹900 considering two biryani, one kebab, one gravy and two desserts. Quantity was good, kebabs were sizable and each platter serves six pieces. Biryani is equally quantitative.

Ambiance of the place is really dull. There are two floors in the restaurant, the ground floor is non-A/C and the first floor is air-conditioned. The ceiling of the first floor is very low and one can easily manage to bump their head on the ceiling, thankfully they have covered it with some sort of rubberized cushioning. Lighting was dim (1st floor), not serene sort of dim but literally dark. Servers were unresponsive, they did not bother to even serve the food, they just left it on the table. No one came to re-fill the empty glasses even though we were the only customers on the 1st floor. Food was served in 20 minutes and they served the starters and main course altogether. Billing was quick though.

In conclusion, their food is not bad but they could surely improve on their services and ambiance. Waiters need more training.

For me this a very old restaurant as I have been visiting this place for a long time and the only reason being it is bang opposite to where some of my family members stay. In terms of the location, near the park circus crossing towards gariahat. On this review I will not go ahead and tell you about the smaller aspects but will only mention the best of the lot. 

Double mutton roll, don't miss it if you are a mutton lover, Mutton tikka roll will stay with you for a while. Chicken tandoori slightly on a dry side but you will love the taste of it, Mutton boti kebab if you are mutton lover. Chicken Chaap and biryani thats all one can expect from Zeeshan.

I have grown up eating Zeeshan's food. Quality is not good as it was earlier. Ambience was never upto the mark. Taking about the specialty.  I would say they have the best mutton tikka roll in Kolkata (must try). Other than that I love mutton chap or chicken bharta with tandoori roti. Biriyani quality and taste  both I would say at par. Only the quality of rice is good. I would say can be an option but after Arsalan or Shiraz

First of all I would like to apologize about the accompanying photos. Apparently everytime I go out to eat the sight of food makes me forget that after going back home from each such occasion I would regret not having clicked the food before digging in. This time too I realized mid way that I had again forgotten to take a snap of all the food that we ordered. So I had heard about zeeshan from my dad,  saw it on the way to a couple of places (most recently quest mall) . The restaurant is located just a few meters before Quest mall. It's hard to miss. There is a non AC dining area quite spacious but we opted for the AC one. One of the AC area is located downstairs and one upstairs. First things first the upper dining area has a very low ceiling and you have to move around bending your body.. The taller you are the tougher it gets. So we took a corner table for four. AC wasn't sufficiently cooling the place. Ambience is nothing much. Very minimalistic decor too. Waiter brought is the menus. We ordered chicken kasturi kebab, chicken barra kebab, mutton biriyani, tandoori roti, lacchas , salad, mutton qourma , mutton handi. Order was delivered in about 15 minutes. 
Coming to the food. The kebabs were delicious specially the kasturi kebab. Perfectly cooked. Quite pocket friendly given the portions.  Next comes the biriyani. It was a tad dry to my liking, didn't have that flavour that is expected of the dish. One thing I must mention here is that first I received a mutton piece which let's just say was more fat than mutton. I showed the waiter and he brought a plate asked me to place the piece on it which he took downstairs and swapped with another piece. Yes the fat was put back in to the biriyani from my half eaten plate. Some might say it's me making a fuss but not many would like to eat from other people's leftovers. The mutton they got me wasn't to my liking either. It was chewy. So biriyani was a bland nothing. Tandoori rotis were good but I have had better at dhabas and other mughlai joints. Mutton qourma was good but it lacked something which I'm not sure about. Mutton handi, the dish that was the best of the lot in the gravy items. Spicy gravy mutton 4 pcs cooked with capsicums and onion. Went beautifully with the rotis. Tasted a firni ... It was okay. The bill came written on a piece of paper(no recipts) amounting to 1255. Quite cheap. 
Zeeshan failed to live up to the hype. I would still like to visit the outlet again and try out some of their other items before fully deciding on it. 

Pro tip: Don't go for the upstairs dining area. Don't order biriyani here.

The biriyani was really good!! 
I guess that's obvious...
Although a pointer, chicken biriyani doesn't include that boiled egg you normally get elsewhere.
And although i agree that the firni is readily good, it's not worth The money it costs.

Overall, a good restaurant.

Whenever I feel urge for having a Roll (mainly double egg-mutton I prefer)  there's no other place on earth I could imagine except Zeeshan. It's a mystery to me how could they insinuate such a heavenly taste in a mere roll !!! Their egg-mutton,egg-chicken and even a paltry egg roll is a must try!!! The taste of Briyani here however is average.

If you are a biriyani lover than its a preferable place indeed.
Their biriyani is just wow.unlike other restauranta they give more quantity of rice and the meat and potato pieces are larger.
Quality is good also.just its a bit oily.
Other items like kababs and chicken are also good.

Yet another place in the City of Joy where I would recommend people to go and have a bite. It really surprises me how many of such places are here in Kolkata and doubt that any other city can match up to it. Anyway, back to Zeeshan.... a familiar name of Kolkata residents. Lets talk about a few things on the menu-

1. Roll- The kind of roll you fall in love with. The kathi as well as the tikia roll, they are fabulous. 
2. Biriyani- I personally like their neighbour's biriyani a bit more. But saying so, even this one has a real punch to it. A bit more spicy than other places. The flavours blend well and the texture of the rice is perfect.
3. Kebabs- The kebabs are spicy. Very well cooked, tender
4. Halim- Probably the best mutton halim in the city, hands down

Rating it 4, as the other items in the menu are good but not at par with the ones I mentioned.

Earlier tried it's famous chicken roll but this time tried the main course. Tasty and soft kebabs are made to melt in ur mouth. Biriyani is equally good. But the most disappointing part was 'Shahi tukra', it tastes nothing but an unauthentic bread pudding and naturally it creates a comparison with another famous  destination (Arsalan).

The mother to all Mughlai take out joints in kolkata , Zeeshan has been ruling the hearts of mughlai lovers since the beginning of its days. Known for having  one of the busiest roll counters in the city, these roll makers wrap the best mughlai rolls around. The biryani they serve are loved by many, haven't tried it myself ( not much of a biryani person ) so it won’t be wise to comment on it. The paratha they make is piece of art though,
having tender layers of skin with a crunchy crust. If you ever find yourself at the Outlet make sure to parcel some chaamp and mughlai paratha, having saying so I highly recommend the seikh kebab rolls for quick grabs.

The sole reason that forces me to drop into this place is their fresh, hot, greasy, flaky mutton tikia rolls. They are continuously making these mutton tikias on a forever heating chaanp tawa. Breaking them, frying them with chopped chillies and onions, to order and then stuffing them in flaky, crusty laccha parathas for us to savor. Must, must have.

For me Halim and beef were always synonymous. Today, however, I had to go out with a friend who doesn't eat beef. So we tried out mutton Halim at Zeeshan.

Previously I had grabbed chicken rolls and tikka rolls from the takeaway section of Zeeshan, on the go, however this is the first time I paid a visit. They have separate AC and non AC sections. The AC section is on the first floor and has a very low ceiling, with thick exhaust ducts passing all over. The tables are laid a bit too close to each other in a way that the diners of one table have to stand up and push their seats in order to give space to the diners behind them to take a seat or leave. The service was very prompt and the waiters were well aware of their job.

The Halim was totally scrumptious. I really did not expect it to be so good. Rich golden-yellow, smooth texture with a perfect balance of flavour from various whole and ground spices. The mutton used wasn't mince, but cubes with a hint of fatty layer on them. The meat was cooked to perfection. Each bowl of Halim contained 8-9 cubes of mutton, which was indeed sufficient.

Next we ordered Shahi Tukra. It came within a sealed box. A smooth golden bread pudding with flakes of almond tossed on top. The Shahi Tukra was so well prepared that you can't really differentiate between the bread part and the pudding layer, yet it was not at all mashy. The crust added a crunch to the smoothness of Shahi Tukra, which I loved.

Though the place might not appear very visually appealing, yet the food stood out absolutely, covering up all the other points. Would love to try kebabs sometime.

Though the place might not appear very visually appealing, yet the food stood out absolutely, covering up all the other points. Would love to try kebabs sometime.

We had a plan to taste the biriyani of Zeeshan since long. Finally got the chance today. We ordered Mutton biriyani, Haleem and Firni. Haleem was a treat for our taste buds I must say. Mutton Biriyani and Firni were also good. 
A must try for foodies.

I have to write a love saga if I write about zeeshan here. I have grown up eating biriyani at Zeeshan, Well for the last 12-15 years at least I don't think I have gone by a week without eating at Zeeshan. From the cashier, to the waiters and every staff members knows us as and my cousin used to visit this place every now an then. . Now that I don't live in Kolkata anymore the only think I miss in food is the mutton biriyani, mutton chaap chicken tikka kababs and halims in the months of Ramadan. 
The mutton in the biriyani is always soft and tender and it come with a delicious piece of flavor soaked aloo and boiled aloo. The mutton in the chaap is cut into small pieces and lovely and juicy.
For me visit to Kolkata is incomplete without having biriyani and mutton chaap from Zeeshan. 

Ambience - 4/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 5/5
Value for money - 5/5

Earlier, when Arsalan had not emerged, Zeeshan was the targeted place for biryani-lovers in this park circus area.
I used to visit this place often with my family. The biryani is good to taste but it gets inferior when compared to its rival Arsalan.
Their chicken rolls & egg-chicken rolls are still a hit within the crowd.

Who doesn't know or have seen thus Zeeshan outlet at park circus. It is a landmark of that area which is very near to the quest Mall.

Coming on to their food which has always been an outstanding affair for the people which really live mughlai cuisine and rich preparation specially. They prepare one of the Exclusive style Biriyani in the city.

Chicken gravies are decent and quality is also good but they really excel in the mutton dishes specially which is their forte I believe. 
If you still don't know or haven't tried them do drop in. Coincidentally it is a special ramzan time and I am sure you will get something unique and special here for sure.

One outlet which has been ruling the heart and tummies of Moghlai lovers since long. And rightly so, they still dish out some delicious food unparalleled and unchallenged anywhere else. Located bang opposite to Kohinoor and in between Park Circus 7 point crossing and Quest Mall, this place is legendary in itself and often serves as a landmark. One could see the gathering of people trying to receive their order of the hot and tasty rolls, again something which has made Zeeshan popular.

I have passed by this place many-a-times, but never really got the chance to drop in here. One fine evening, while I was nearby, I decided to take some parcel for my late night dinner. Ended up ordering the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Roti. The Chicken were soft and the gravy had large chunks of chicken with the beautiful texture of well-marinated Kebabs. The gravy was sweet, but I really liked it with the Rotis. The Rotis on the other hand, had gone a bit chewy by then, and hence I had to resort to hand-made Rotis made at home. 

The overall experience wasn't that bad. I have heard mixed reviews of their Biryani and Chaap. So, definitely eager to try those as well for a full fare at Zeeshan. Pocket pinch was decent and the packing was okayish as well. Definitely recommended if you are craving for some Moghlai food at decent prices!

one of the hyped heritage mughlai food centre of kolkata. been there twice . mostly for the love of kebabs and biryani.
I have tried chicken tandoori, tangri kebabs,  khuska rice, mutton biryani,  mutton handi, chicken masala, rumali roti . the food is more than good but not up to my expectation level. little bit less tasty than other heritage biryani places in kolkata. the mutton handi tasting lazawab(superb).  plz try to maintain as it was hyped among the old people. overall a good place to try spicy heavy dine in food.

Zeeshan known for its exquisite Biryani and Mughlai Dishes was one of the places I took some time to visit. Located in the crossing which connects to AJC Bose Flyover this place is really easy to locate. Had heard a lot about this place from friends, but this place gave me a disappointing experience all together.

Service:
The service was not up to the mark. Not even a greet or a smile from the staffs. They had their own unpleasant attitude. The service was slow and they lacked proper communication skill. A popular restaurant lacks this basic thing.

Food:
The food again did not click right. I ordered Chicken Biryani and it was not up to the mark. The expectation fell down very quickly. The Chicken Kassa was too ordinary and not all worth its price. The only thing which was nice was the Firni. 
Things which I heard not at all matched with my taste buds.

Last Words:
This place has a great name but not great food. I didn't have a very good experience and I can't recommend this place. A lot to improve on every department.


2.5/5 for this place.

A quintessential eatery in the heart of the city. Right beside Park Circus nestled at the corner sits this place offering almost every form of NonVeg. Veg menu isn't as tasteful as it looks but the Nonveg just makes you ignore that fact. Upper floor is cramped for anyone of normal Indian stature. Still always manages to put an end to that feasty cravings dingling in your gut.

Biryani is good. Oil usage on the higher side. Cleanliness is a thumbs down. Specially the basin area is yuck. Parking is a super issue. Takeaway seems a better idea rather than sitting and having food. Staff is always busy chatting. So, not a place if other places are open to serve.

One of the spiciest biryanis are served at Zeeshan... If you are in the mood to have something heavy nd spicy,,, which stays on with you for a considerable period of time,,, this is the place where you should be.... You should,,, along with having the Biryani platter,,, try the reshmi kebabs too. The chaap here also tastes brilliant,,, be it chicken or mutton.... It is very spicy nd too tasty to forget.... Prices are mediocre which will leave you with enough to splurge on..... One suggestion would be to order the special Biryani....

Zeeshan is the second most popular casual dining restaurant in the Park Circus area. A must try for rich mughlai food and biryani lovers. The restaurant has both non-airconditioned and airconditioned sections. The airconditioned section is as usual on the first floor. One might feel crammed for space, with almost no head space. The waiters are good at suggesting dishes and well mannered. The food is good to be honest considering the rates. They serve a large variety of dishes for both non-veg and veg eaters. For take away, one must try their Chicken rolls. Biryani is extremely tasty. The khuska rice (biryani rice) is not exceedingly oily but wonderfully coloured with very nice flavours. They give you two pieces of eggs in the Egg Biryani. We tried Chicken Reshmi Kabab Butter Masala, which was sweet, with super kabab pieces. They definitely need to serve better and bigger pieces of mutton, as I was not entirely satisfied with the Mutton Spl Kassa. Butter Naan was good. Recommended.

Their quality of food is very inconsistent esp when it comes to their biryani. Sometimes its really good, but sometimes its very oily and spicy. But their mutton chaanp is really very tasty. Among the kebabs i usually prefer to have chicken tikka or tangri kebab. But (for me) the 'X" factor of this restaurant is the Mutton Brain Fry. It is yummy and goes well with paratha. You can also try their Mutton Brain roll. They have got both an Ac and non Ac section, so if you are looking for a proper ambience then sit in the AC section. Their service is satisfactory & the prices are not cheap but affordable.

On occasion of a colleague's farewell , i was invited for a treat at zeeshan , my third time to this legendary mughlai restaurant in the heart of the city, we occupied a table at the  ground floor air conditioned section, which had a basic set up with glass tables black chairs and hanging lamps , nothing charming about the interiors no music too . Food was good to say shortly, we tried MUTTON BOTI KEBABS , MUTTON BIRYANI , CHICKEN SPECIAL BIRYANI , CHICKEN TIKKA BUTTER MASALA , CHICKEN CHAP , NAAN and PHIRNI. We had no complains with the food , everything was very well cooked and served efficiently in a short span of time. Probably a better interior set up would have fetched them some more points!

Zeeshan is among the most popular food joints in Kolkata. Revered for its magical Biryani and Mughlai food, Zeeshan also goes a fair way when it comes to naan. The problem is with the pricing.

I've had equally good biryani at cheaper rates. This is not to say that their Biryani isn't good -- it's very good actually -- but they're a tad bit overpriced I would think. Biryani and Chaap is always a safe bet here.

Zeeshan is only challenged when you order Paratha or Naan. Anything which isn't Biryani isn't fantastic. It's edible, but it doesn't make you lust for more. 

Their service is fine, and so is their ambience. Nothing out of the ordinary, but good enough.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

I have been to Zeeshan a couple of times with large groups of people, all of who enjoyed the pocket friendly food. While the food and the service here is good, I am not sure about the ambiance. I understand it is difficult to do much in the specified area, but a little renovation would do wonders. Coming to the food, I like the biriyani, kebabs (both chicken tangri and hariyali kebabs were good) and most of all, the phirni.

Zeeshan, a younger brother always hidden under the shadow of the greatness of the older brother. That is how I like to describe Zeeshan. If Arsalan were not present at Park Circus, Zeeshan could have taken over. But not in the presence of Arsalan. 

I find Zeeshan's biriyani the 2nd best after Arsalan. Their specialities are kebabs, rezala & Chicken Handy.  And peraonally, it's mutton tikia roll is my favourite.

Decoration of the A.C. section is good.  In the non A.C. section, many local muslims come for having evening tea. Evening snacks are also available. You can just sit there at that time to enjoy the real feel of the locality.

Go, give it a try.

2 hours passed. Finally i called up the restaurant and the person there claimed that they didnt receive any order.

Now i am sitting hungry :D

Further on the zomato page , its showing that the order is delivered - what a foolish system.

Completely hopeless system - if there is an issue, zomato doesnt provide any phone number to contact for sorting out potential issues.

This is a place that has much nostalgic value. This is one place that you could eat out of your pocket money even as a student. But the good news is that presently the place has had a makeover, which makes it more inviting. We are a little conservative while ordering from here. We keep going back for biryani and chicken chanp. However, on days when we are not in a mood for rice, we go for naan. The roll and kebab counter facilitates quick pickup in an area where parking is a menace.

Zeeshan is a very old restaurant ,currently given a makeover which makes it looks new however its been in beckbagan and park circus area for years as for me personally this reminds me of my school period where I would always head to this restaurant for their delicious biryani after school along with my couple of friends and some times I would sneak in all by myself .
The two most food items I used to order was always Biryani and chicken chaap cause I would always end up ordering the same because it was always well prepared and I never had a bad day at Zeeshan with the food.
I used to have other chicken dishes also and naan was my second option if I wanted to skip biryani sometimes and this is also made so nice and fresh that the flavours would just linger around your mouth for a while which is quite a nice feeling .
There is roll and kebab counters also available which is a plus point cause park circus area is ruled by roll lovers and this becomes a saviour at times of hunger.
And after everthing that I keep trying i used to always finish my meal with a nice dessert and the Firni would always do wonders which absolutely completes my lovely eating moments in Zeeshan .

the reason for giving 5 stars to this outlet is -there fab biryaniz. this goes from my skul days where my frnd used 2 live nearby...and whenever i used 2 visit her place, she used 2 order chicken or mutton biryani from zeeshan, and that particular single dish used 2 make my day. the best part is - the biryaniz are super fresh no matter what time u order them, the potatoes are juicy and flavourful (generally nowadays many famous biryani outlets lack flavour in the potato), the quantity is wholesome, its non-greasy, not too much of rose water smell, not much of oozing oil (unlike arsalan), and the chicken or the mutton piece is soft and tender, yet big in size (they dont compromise in quantity as i sed earlier). all in all - this outlet is the best outlet for good biryaniz. sure shot drop by there soon if u are a biryani lover :D

A legend in mughlai food needs no introduction. Located at the famed crossing of park circus tram depot is an iconic landmark which defined Mughal foods in kolkata.Biriyani both mutton or chicken are the best that u get.They still serve biriyani with a boiled potato n boiled egg.But the taste has dipped over the years which people visiting place since past can make out.Mutton chap tastes heavenly, chicken rezala n kadhai chicken is awesome. And do st u may don't missout on the exquisite firni which melts in the mouth. Ambience is why they loose out n service is ok.

Now coming to the biriyani... its nice but i didn't find anything special about... maybe its my taste buds that treats all Kolkatan biriyani a common one. But Kebabs is the is the place where they score most of my points... just love the variety, soft and tender kebabs melts amidst your tongue and teeth... yummy! A must try... any of the kebabs you like. 
Anyways, a must visit at least for once and try SHAHI TUKDA if you want anything for dessert! Happy eating 😃

Went to this wonderful restaurant few days back to have some great mughlai food. We ordered Ch.Tikka Butter Masala and Butter naan...The Tikka masala consisted of Kebab pieces cooked with a thick gravy. It was delicious. Do not go by the interior of this food joint. Nothing glamorous about the looks but we are primarily visiting Zeeshan for quality food. Zeeshan is by far a great Gastronomical Delight over other mughlai cuisine food chains.

Because it is a culture of addictive Biryanis. One of the best Mughlai experiences in its class. Tested well over a decade now; even though the restaurant used to be much cleaner during its early days. 
Service is on the better side for a restaurant in this price range. 
Almost a must for food buffs.

I have been a regular here for a long time now...right from the days when there was just the roll shop at the corner of the pavement. The roll shop expanded into Zeeshan restaurant and from there on there has been further steady expansion with Zeeshan opening many outlets all over Kolkata. They do make really good biriyani, chaanp , kebabs and rezalas. The firni is quite good too. Being a regular here, I feel sorry to say that the taste of the food items here have seen a steady decline. By this I do not mean to suggest that it's bad...but the brilliant biriyanis and chaanp that they served in the yesteryears are nowhere to be found in the Zeeshan of today. Somehow the 'X' factor is missing and this, I believe has led to them falling behind in the pecking order.
One good aspect is the quality of meat served in the various dishes. Not only is it soft and tender but the portions of meat are also quite healthy. The menu has good variation too.
Don't keep great expectations from the service....nonchalant attitude as always.
I hope they buck up because they have all that it takes, to be in the top three in the list of restaurants serving brilliant biriyanis.

This restaurant has successfully achieved constant degradation. In my three visits each approximately ~3 months apart my view of this restaurant has gone from "definitely visit again" to "nope". From good food & decent service now it has reached Okay-ish food & poor service.

One of the places where I had my first biriyani as a child. The outlet remains quite the same. Variety have increased with time. It was quite nostalgic and delightful to visit after 2 decades. I tried mutton biriyani this time a slight departure from the mughlai roti I had 2 decades ago. Mutton biriyani quality was upto the mark but lagged behind than that of arsalaan. Quantity was more than one can have. The mutton was tender and succulent. Over-all good.

During my last visit to kolkata i decided to try place out after a long time. I was in the park circus area and as a Biriyani lover i thought Lets try Zeeshan. Please note that this is my visit to this place after 4-5 years. As usual we were hungry and decided to directly hit the main course. We ordered both chicken and mutton biriyanis along with chicken chaanp. The biriyani was sufficient in quantity and as the weather was a little hot in the afternoon we asked them to switch on the fan (their AC sitting area was not open for unknown reasons). We were not even half way through our meal and by this time my fingers started to feel "Sticky". To confirm i checked the bottom of the plate and there was already a half inch layer of "Dalda" in solidified form. 
This sight completely spoiled my meal and when i asked the manager, he simply said that this is the way they make the biriyani. 
How can a outlet like Zeeshan which was famousfor Mughlai fodd turn a blind eye to quality and simply run after Profit and make biriyanis pathically with such material of Dalda-which is very very detrimental for health.  It contains all the bad cholesterol and is very bad for the heart. 
After this I m never visiting Zeeshan again and would never recommend anyone to visit even. Very poor management and pathetic food quality.

Value for money. Try butter nan and mutton sammi kabab. Both are fantastic and heavy just for rupees 90 only. No extra taxes. I want to try sahi tukra but I was so full that I must have to visit next time. Service and billing very first and simple. Nice decors & ambience.

Usually it's very rare to give a full fiver on rating but this was a rare case. One day we went to dine there and after great biryanis and kababs we gave our debit card to pay the bill. The machine wasn't working to swipe the debit card and we didn't had full amount on us. The manager or the owner I don't know who that was said sir its OK, you can pay us the next time you come. This show of trust to its customers and guest is an example why customers become loyal.

One of the landmark food destination of park circus and Kolkata on the whole as well. One of the pioneers of biriyani and is equally responsible to make the Kolkata biriyani in the world food map along with other similar brands like Arsalan and Shiraz. However, although I like the food over here, I still rate them second to arsalan.

For me zeeshan is the best for shahi tukra. Park Circus zeeshan sitting arrangements at the top floor is not upto the mark as it is very short in space n it has low ceiling which doesn't offer a restaurant facility. But food quality is medium. They need to come up with more menus as it has become very monotonous.

Fantastic sumptuous kebabs and biriyanis! Zeeshan has been my personal fave from the time I was just 5-6 years old. Being a foodie, Zeeshan is a must whenever I go to the Park Circus area. Their rolls are the best you can get in town. The ambience is average but attendance is high. Their food has been cherished by the whole of our family for quite some time ow. Their Bharta, rezala and Roghanjosh are also swell.

Went there with my friend for dinner. Now coming to the ambience nothing that special to notify. It is a very big restro hence a lot of seats for the customers.
We had chicken reshmi butter masala with tandoori roti.
The chicken item was really very good. It contains 6 big sized kabab pieces which were very soft and juicy. 
But on the other hand although the rotis were very big and well prepared but still it was a little too hard to chew.

Some of The staffs were little bit rude and unfriendly hence when we asked for an extra plate one of them didn't bother to listen while another simply denied. But another staff finhelped us.

This is the main reason why i gave them 3.5 otherwise based on their food i could have given them 4.....

A trip to Calcutta is a waste, until you go to Zeeshan and have a taste !
Wah. I'm a poet after eating at this place. And a glutton. And a fan. And Also been christened a "true Calcutta-wala " by my husband. Well I almost did argue as to why I hadn't been brought to this wonderful heaven-for-meat lovers on earth till now.
So just like an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Daily Zeeshan roll will make you gol matol . It's bloody unhealthy. And that is what makes it so bloody tasty.
Let me describe layer by layer the experience I had. Picture this double egg double mutton tikia roll.
Outer layer- A parotha. Fried in oil. Nay! Lard I think. Atleast dalda for sure. And for the North Indians, this ain't not ordinary parantha.... It's a parotha.
Next layer-  fluffy omelette, made to perfection. 
Next and the best layer- soft, yummy mutton tikia overload. It tasted like a brilliant shammi kebab multiplied by a hundred.
Next- a few onions.
Chutney- ketchup (I opted out of it). After all the roll was already juicy enough.
The first bite and I was hooked. I was also sad. With each passing bite that my roll was getting smaller. Tears of joy streamed down, immediately followed by anger. My husband was scolded for not having taken me to Zeeshan before and I just wanted more rolls. 
I was anyway too full, but it's the "ankhon ki bhuk" u sometimes want to eat for. Anyway I didn't. Realising I would visit again soon.
Big smile. Full tummy. No complains. Great experience.

I found another hidden gem of mughal cuisines today. Nothing fancy about the interior of the restaurant but who cares when you are among the best dishes. I have ordered mutton boti kebab, chicken tikka kebab, mutton jalfrezi, lachha paratha and firni as dessert. Kebab's are awesome melt on your mouth. I have tried new mutton side dish that is rarely available in other mughal joints. That is mutton jalfrezi and now a must try for this joint.
Though the price that is showing its for the earlier days, now add 10 to 20 rupees with every dish.And never the less it is a tax free joint. One major thing that I really want to mention and that is the behavior that overwhelmed us. Never expect such polite and helpful behavior from a waiter from this sort of joint.
Expect to visit soon for their biryani ....

With zeeshan its a hassle free decision.. U don't have to think what to order.. It's simple.. Chicken tandoori.. Biriyani.. Any mutton side dish and yessss my beloved firni.. The service is like super fast.. U  r really hungry and want quick food this is the place to be.. The food is really good and its a value for money place.. The tandoori is nice soft and succulent.. Biriyani is pretty good and normal (order the extra egg.)I have tried a lot of side dishes and never disliked one.. But for me the best thing is firni..this place grew my love for firni.. I literally wait for dessert.the rotis are also decent. The food they serve is of good quantity and quality the ambience is nothing special ( try the ac section). But who needs ambience when you have tasty food in front of you.. Definitely not me..

My quest for the perfect Kolkata biryani kind of ended with Zeeshan. Having lived in Hyderabad and having tasted a lot of different kinds of biryanis there, i would act like a typical bengali foodie and say biryani without that big piece of potato is kinda incomplete.

Zeeshan had eluded us the first time we tried to get in with a 1.5 hours long waiting queue. But the next time we were in the vicinity, we made sure that our spirits did not get dampened due to the waiting time. 

After waiting for 15 minutes, we finally found ourselves ushered in. There isnt much of an ambience at the place. Its quite minimalist. But these are the places where you find the best food.

Anyway, we ordered  for boti kabab, mutton biryani and chicken rezala. While the kabab was quite average, the biryani completely blew me away. The mild spices coupled with the mutton chunks and potato, i wished i had a bigger stomach capacity. The rezala was top class too and really complemented the biryani.

We ended the meal with the phirni which was delicious too. They served the phirni in earthern pots. Two thumbs up.

I am giving 4.5 to the place just because the wait can be annoying and because of the ambience. Would love to go back soon.

Zeeshan is amazing when it comes to rich cuisine. The aroma of the mouth watering dishes like their famous biryanis and handi chicken or a chicken kasha or even better oil soaked spicy mutton dishes is enough to leave one craving for more . When it comes to plating of food as well, Zeeshan does not disappoint . Tasty food at affordable prices, Zeeshan is a famous hub for food lovers who doesn't want to maintain their calorie counts.
The only problem is the shabby sitting arrangements and absence of ACs.
Overall, worth a try for some good food.

The service in this restaurant located near quest mall one I would go so far as to term horrendous. With the waiters confused as to whether they are waiters or athletes training for the 400 metre races, the staff is incredibly rude. Based on the service alone I would give them a 1, but they make up for the abominable service with excellent food. The biriyani and chicken masala preparation were both outstanding. Being in the par circus area it has competition from several leading restaurants, but as long as I could have take away, I would go back to this restaurant above others.

The day of Eid, a holiday! Had been to New Market for my shopping. It was a hot and humid day and new market was in average crowd.
Aminia and Biriyani House was closed due to the occasion and thus, 2 of us traveled to Park Circus for lunch.
Shiraz was heavenly crowded but Zeeshan wasn't as empty as hell.
Due to Eid, there weren't many staff/waiters to attend.
Orders:
1 Mutton Special Biriyani
1 Laccha Paratha
1 Chicken Bharta
1 7up (drink).

Biriyani wasn't up to the mark. It wasn't rich. The rice and meat was well cooked and were huge. The staff said it would be enough fpr 2 as it had 2 pcs of mutton, an egg and a potato, but the quantity of rice wasn't enough. No use paying for the 'Special' thing if there are even number of people.The potato was partly raw. It been long since I've had a fully cooked potato in Biriyani (not even in Arsalan where I visited a few months back read my review to know better). It had the Biriyani's smell and taste but not what we've paid for. (6/10)

Chicken Bharta(7.5/10): It was good and the quantity was sufficient. It was a perfect blend of spices, in oil. The richness and aroma just flatters the taste buds even without eating it. Very well cooked chicken just melts in your mouth. But, the main dish was Biriyani and it wasn't up to our expectations.

Laccha Paratha(5.5/10): One side wasn't fried at all, 20% hardly. No no this won't do.

Salad(0/10): Yes ZERO.. Due to lack of manpower they were unable to serve a simple thing called SALAD.

Cold Drinks(10/10): Credits goes to the Manufacturer. The best dish you can get here.
DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.

Have been a loyal customer of zeeshan for a long time now.this review is for the newly opened zeeshan branch on prince anwar shah road.as they don't have their page listed as of now I'm stating my problem here.had placed an order for 4 mutton biriyani,1 chicken biriyani,4 mutton chap and 1 chicken chap.it was specifically said that the order will be taken via flight to Bangalore so the packing needs to be done carefully.yesterday i took my delivery around 4 pm and payed the bill for an amount of 1350 rupess precisely.then when i reached Bangalore and opened the parcel around 9 pm to eat, the biriyani had gone sour by then.if the food was cooked yesterday itself then how can it go sour within a span of 5 hours??my friends have fallen sick after consuming it.zeeshan itself is a brand name and they ought to serve quality food.having said that receiving stale food from either of their outlets is shocking for us.i did complain regarding this to the shop owner but they're not ready to listen.pathetic behaviour.moreover for chicken chap i had been given chicken kasa.and just previous day I took another order for that in place of chicken rezala I was given chicken Kashmiri.if you can't deliver whatever I need then at least say it out it's highly annoying after going back home and getting something else.highly disappointed with zeeshan this time around.i'm never going to this outlet again.bloody cheaters.all my money went for waste and people falling sick is an add on to it.please take note the zeeshan prince Anwar shah road branch serve stale food and robb you off.worst ever experience of my life.their franchise should be taken away or at least i deserve a compensation.it should be given a 0 rating.

Zeeshan being an epitome of indian food (atleast according to me after arsalan and shiraz),i was taken aback by the quality of food that was served.No doubt the biryani was as usual good but what about the others specially the mutton dishes.Badly cooked,the taste is just awful.
Being an almost regular visitor i was saddened by the experience..
Need to improve on other items rather than the signature biryani.

The mutton biriyani is good, taste and qty wise both. Ordered mutton angara, kadhai chicken with roomali roti which were equally good to taste. The restaurant doesnt have quality seating ambience. Light on the pocket. A good experience.

Contrary to most, I prefer their rolls, kebabs and desserts over their biryani. 

I also have had a bad experience when I had ordered a plate of Hydrabadi Biryani and while hogging on the meat I found blood. The staff however insited it was the spice. I beg to differ. 

Nevertheless in addition to the list above, they serve some amazing Haleem during Ramadan.

Being located near to my school, visits to this place was a consistent affair, especially for its dainty rolls. Zeeshan is undoubtedly the proprietor of one of the best rolls in the city.

For repasts Biriyani and Chicken Chaap are a staple. The Biriyani is less spicy and oily as compared to its contemporaries. The Chicken Tikka Kabab served here is a fine recommendation, juicy, hot and spicy, much to my liking. The Haleem they serve is also top grade. But apart from the conventional dishes, they fail to live up to expectations.

The ambience is uninspiring and the service is a bit curt. The downstairs of the restaurant is inelegant but upstairs it's congenial and comfortable. A really good place for treats and parties, but not so much for dates or romantic escapades.

Zeeshan is one of the famous Mughlai food joints located in Park Circus area, close to Quest Mall, Kolkata. I have visited this place often since my childhood days. One should try their Chicken Maharaja together with their Biryani.

At present, probably the best among three big names - Arsalan, Zeeshan and Aminia. Although, this is my personal opinion, but it can easily be the favorite destination for Biriyani lovers. And don't forget to try the Shahi Tukda. That is something you don't want to miss at all.

I have visited this restro more than 2 years ago when it was not so famous like now. It was a sudden visit, I was passing this area after attending a sick daughter of one of my friend who was admitted on a child hospital near Park Circuss 4 no. bridge. We all were hungry, entered this shop and ordered for Paratha & Chicken. Noting special ambiance, but food was well. they made spicy items like biriyani,tandoor, meat etc. Overall was good experience. 

Willing to visit this place again.

It was a sudden visit with my college friends. We planned to have chicken roll but ended up having a mutton biryani and an egg chicken biryani, and I've to say they taste awesome, especially for those who like less oily or spicy biryani. 
However the next day I went to taste their chicken roll which is highly recommended by many. But here, in this particular outlet their rolls are not at all up to the mark. Many local fast food centres have far better rolls than what I had here. Though the other do prepare better rolls than these.

So me and two friends of mine decided to hit this place to try their rolls as had heard a lot about zeeshan and it's rolls. We ended up having their biryani, both chicken and mutton, and let me say, it was much much better than arsalan's. Not so greasy, tasty, flavoursome, and with good portions too. 
Even tried their so-popular rolls, and it was an uttet disappointment. Chicken roll contained almost negligible chicken that too along with small pieces of bones.

There hasn't been any occasion which I haven't celebrated here.  Starting from post exam stress relief, to dinner dates and birthdays, I have always checked in to Zeeshan with my near and dear ones. My favorite order here is Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Chaanp. The food quality is superb here, with the availability of both a/c and non-a/c. The service is good as well.

1.Tandoori ruti - size big enough for one person.
2. Mutton haleem - haleem one of the most popular dish during festive season.tried lots of places but this one is avarage.
3. Firni - served in a clay pot.taste was ok n quantity too.

kababs are good here. . bt the gravy (chicken or Mutton) is not up to the mark. 
when we compare the price of the food, it is more or less similar to that of Arsalan bt the service and food quality is far behind Arsalan.

We went here thrice. The place is located at Park Circus Area Kolkata. Good place to eat just to eat. Enjoy the food n ignore all other things. You will not regret it. We ordered kebabs, bhaji with naan & Biryani. The bhaji was good naan nice n soft but frankly didn't like the Biryani. I want my biryani with a little gravy or masala like Hydrabadi Biryani. The Biryani they served was dry maybe it is their style of cooking. 
But the star of the meal was the chicken tikka kebabs, they were just too good. I have had kebabs at many places in Mumbai but nothing like this. The kebabs juicy, hot & spicy to my liking. 
Next time will defintly visit again just to eat kebabs.

I was here couple of times. I have started coming to this place since it was first established. But its taste and quality have been going downwards with time. I used to order here chicken biryani and chicken chaap. At the initial phase, they served the biryani with a piece of aloo, boiled egg and a big piece of chicken. Do not know what they serve currently. It was used to be a great place for all biryani lovers of Kolkata. Hope they will improve their taste and quality of food to get back their old status.

Went to Zeeshan today with school friends, looking for Haleem. Zeeshan did not disappoint. Had the best Haleem this year at Zeeshan.

The Haleem served here is really good, not too heavy or spicy, really good in taste with ample mutton pieces. 

The Ambience is just ok, the air conditioned part of the restaurant is in the mezzanine floor and the ceiling is very low.

Zeeshan is one of the leading franchises serving Kolkata Biriyani. It is popular and correctly so. This one is by far my favourite outlet. The air conditioned seating is on the first floor. The decor is nice though the ceiling is dangerously low at some places. However seating is not congested and well managed in such a limited space. 
I have had their Chicken Biriyani, Egg Biriyani, and Mutton Biriyani. All moist and well flavoured, meat usually tender. The Biriyani can be devoured on its own without any gravy since it is not dry. I prefer my Biriyani with a plate of Mutton Chaanp. The mutton chaanp served by Zeeshan is one of the best I have had, it is rich and the mutton pieces are all tender and easily edible, unlike some places that serve mostly bones. On bowl of Raita comes in huge quantity more than enough for three people. I prefer my Raita sweet and Salty and Zeeshan Raita serves my purpose. The Firni is great too. Intend to try the Shahi Tukda and the rest of the menu when I stop obsessing over their Biriyani. 
It is a reasonable place and well worth its budget. Do visit.

Hands down they r the best regarding the haleem! The mutton haleem is awesomely amazing.. They have the chicken version too in which they just add the chicken kabab which is used in rolls..

Zeeshan, a traditional Kolkata eatery serves one of the best biriyanis in town. While you can stop by for a quick bite of mutton/chicken rolls. The atmosphere isn't excellent but bearable. However the food is oily and spicy, so don't try if you can't digest spicy food. You can avail their takeaway service to carry home some delicious biriyani !

Being right next to my school i have been here lots of times but mostly for the rolls. I was in the area recently and so decided to drop in for some usual fare. I did a takeaway of course so i cannot comment on the service. Coming to the food the chicken chaap outdid itself. There was odles of taste and the right blend of flavours. The mutton rezala however fell way short of my expectations. The naan and rumali roti were the usual fare. I swear by its rolls which are pretty cheap, really good and light on the stomach. Go for the egg mutton roll for a delight! Bon apetit.

I've been eating here since I was a kid! Yeah, I know, their mutton biryani could do with some work sometimes, and they're *very* resistant about jumping on board the cheese kabab craze that India Restaurant started, but my usual orders are still spectacular:

Reshmi kabab butter masala
...dumped on top of a biryani
Mutton seekh
Mutton shami
Double egg double mutton tikka rolls (best in the city, made with that shami kabab and those insanely slightly sweet buttery parathas)
The best parathas in the city
Sometimes tandori roti, if I've had too many parathas recently
Chicken bhartha
Fish tikka kababs
Chicken tikka kababs, sometimes in butter masala
I occasionally stray (India Restaurant for cheese kababs and biryani, Afza for laal tikka kababs in garlic mayo, Arsalan for biryani / kabab things, Ali Baba when I'm lazy and need home delivery in salt lake), but somehow, I always find myself back at Zeeshan.

A couple of years back, it was a heaven for us biriyani lovers. At times the rush was so much, we had to stand in queues.
Used to celebrate every birthday here...

But over the years, its standard of food have reached so low, that we don't even lookup at it!! :(

The mutton in the biriyani feels rubbery, rice seems partially cooked....
Can't connect with the memory of the ZEESHAN I used to know.. :(

Better avoid the place now..

But if you are looking for a quick bite with rolls, the snack bar of the outlet's quite good. :)

After grabbing a couple of rolls from the Snacks Corner of Zeeshan, we decided that we'd visit this place sometime. We had tried the chicken and mutton rolls here and they are quite nice with flaky, seasoned, soft parathas and a filling of chicken or mutton pieces, fresh onion, a dash of lime and some chilli (optional). However, I once found a strand of hair in my roll and that was after I had consumed more than half of it. I was extremely disgusted and couldn't finish the rest. Still, I decided I'd give this place another chance and thus, yesterday ended up at their outlet once again.
The extremely hot weather made us choose the AC section, otherwise I'm quite comfortable eating in non-AC areas. The decor was quite simple but what struck us was the exceptionally low height of the ceiling. They had thoughtfully cushioned it though, so that's a plus.
Coming to the food, we ordered a Chicken Special Biriyani and a Mutton Masala. The biriyani arrived with a breast and a leg piece, an egg and half a potato. They said they'll provide us with more potato if we ask for. The gravy of the masala was good, but the oil content was very high. The pieces were also a little hard and fibrous. The biriyani was above average, but nothing exceptional.
The server was polite, and service was extremely fast.
The bill came to 441 with added VAT and service tax.

For those complaining it has lost its charm, it is because of you all that it is in this shabby condition. Suddenly all people started going to Arsalan and I am clueless as to why. I still feel it makes better biryani than Arsalan. And no kidding it makes the best mutton chaanp and firni in the state. I still frequent the joint and force all my friends to come here and make them realise the speciality of this place.

Zeeshan used to be one of my favourite biriyani joints before the advent of Arsalan..but honestly in recent times this place has lost its charm..It used to serve one of the delicious biriyani with a tastefull aloo and a generous chunk of mutton,but lately I have found the flavours of biriyani to be quite inconsistent..it can't stir up the foody inside me anymore..Still it serves some pretty decent mughlai dishes..Love the Mutton Chaap,Mutton Achari,Chicken Jhalfrezi to name a few..Also used to love their Chicken Tandoori and Mutton Tikia..Sadly their service have also deteriorated recently..the ambiance is also average..on the whole its better for a take away than a dine-in with your family..Also forgot to mention their Roll is quite a hotpick..even if u dont want to go for their biriyani,surely you can give their Roll a try..Cost for 2 approx Rs.600/-..

This restaurant has two sections..while the non ac section is quite large and spacious but on entering the ac section we saw it had such a low ceiling dat we had to bend down and still den I accidentally hit my head twice. My friend and I seated ourselves at d corner table. We ordered 2mutton biriyanis and 1firni. Maybe the price of d ac section is more Dan the non ac. The mutton biriyani was something around 160₹ and the firni was 50₹. The total bill including tax and vat came to 415₹. So neither very cheap not quite expensive.
Now coming to the most important part the biriyani was served cold. The potato was soft and the mutton piece was big enough. However it was mainly a bony piece. The quantity was sufficient for a single person..taste was okay. The rice was quite dry..a side dish would have had helped. The firni was quite yummy.
Overall a very okay kind of restaurant but when the king of biriyani Arsallan is so close by one should not make the mistake of visiting zeeshan. Lastly if it ever has to bounce back to its past glory d restaurant should really pull up its level because it has tough competitors like arsallan,shiraz and aminia.

Disappointed is an understatement. Apparently this place was once in competition with Arsalan, Shiraz etc... But it seems it chose to move back in time and into culinary dark age whereas the rest are moving forward. The Mutton Kassa curry was too thin, the roomali roti + the potato in the biryani half cooked and the shahi tukda seemed to have been taken out of cyro!! To top it all, the food had hair all over it!! I literally took out 4 of them myself. First time in life where I didn't finish my biryani...

Okay! So I am about to write my 50th review in Zomato and I thought this one should be a little special ! And it is! 
Since my college days I have been visiting this place ...which has gone through lot of face lifts recently. Back in the days the decor was modest ( let's just say no decor just a couple of tables and chairs ) but so was the pricing! ₹70 for mutton biriyani! Whoa! 
But nowadays this family restaurant has become quite a spot! Nice and cozy little joint complete with mood lighting, new wall paint and lots of renovation here and there. 

I absolutely dig this place and am completely biased about this one and even after all these years I cannot get over their Mutton Biriyani! Flawless! Each and every time. 
Their staff who have been serving delicacies to my friends,family and me over the many many years has been around for a long time and just like their biriyani their service is top notch and super fast! No complaints there too! 
I think for most of the biriyani lovers in Kolkata Zeeshan needs no introduction! Some of their vegetarian items are amazing too - Matar paneer being one of my favourite dishes. The phirni they serve isn't fancy but again filled with pure and authentic taste! 
I think no amount of bad reviews can ever stop me from visiting this place, this place is rather close to my heart, reminds me of the time when I survived on mere pocket money! 
It's not fancy, neither it is high end, there's no blaring EDM ( thank you God! ) no Ambani living room type decor nor do they offer any luxury dining, very humble cutlery not at all scratch free! But all I can say is that every time I visit Zeeshan I come out as a happier person! And every time I leave Calcutta the only restaurant I keep missing is this one! Kudos to you guys! ?✌️

Zeeshan is losing its goodwill day by day. The once upon a Muglai king is nowdays loosing its customers since the quality of food is deteriorating. The Biryani used to be too good here but the last biryani I had was not upto the mark and i believe i will not be having anymore biryani s from zeeshan in the near future atleast.

Visited with my sisters... Such a disappointment... Biriyani was less in quantity... And the quality too was not upto the mark... The mutton was fibre! My teeth failed to tear it! 
The only good thing was the mutton chap that we ordered. Place upstairs is also very small and stuffy.

Good food , good menu , good and pocket friendly price .. but what kills zeeshan is the quality of staff and their ambience..not at all good for family outings..biriyani is tasty , zeeshan still has its own customer base , other than many others .. if you are for some adda with your friends , place is awesome..

Zeeshan is located at the Syed Amir Ali avenue at Park Circus. This is a very ordinary restaurant as far as decorum is concerned. They have a non ac dining area as you enter and also an ac dining space upstairs which is pretty small and cramped. But when it comes to food, Zeeshan never disappoints you. I am head over heels in love with the biriyani here. It is always beautifully done. I love the chicken tikka kebab, tengri kebab, seekh kebabs here! I have tried nearly all the kebab specialities from here. The chicken tandoori is great too. But your dining here should always end with their phirnis which is the one of the best phirnis I have ever had in town. They have a roll corner too which makes exquisite rolls! One should definitely try the double chicken and mutton rolls. This is a cheap outlet so eat your heart out without worrying much about your pocket. If ambience is not an issue to you, go for Zeeshan anyday. :)

I had visited this place numerous times, since 2001. Last week we visit there again to celebrate Biswadeep‘s birthday and found them, still serving tasty food at very affordable prices. We ordered ‘Chicken Bharta’, ‘Mutton Special Biryani’, ‘Paneer Do Pyaza’, ‘Peas Pulao’, ‘Paneer Pulao’, ‘Green Salad’ and ‘Firni’. Paneer Do Pyaza and Paneer Pulao were very well cooked and really tasty. Mutton Special Biryani comes with two pieces of mutton and one egg. It tastes just awesome, mutton pieces were soft enough to melt in our mouth but Chicken Bharta was big letdown. They serve boneless chicken pieces in rezala’s gravy. This tastes nowhere near usual Chicken Bharta, real disappointment.

In dessert part Firni was just too good to end your meal. The service is slow but the staffs are polite. This is an ideal place for coming with a group of friends and enjoy foods. So to sum up I would like to say it’s a place where you can visit more than once and the best part is that pocket pinch is almost nothing compared to the quality & quantity of the food.

Have dined there like a zillion times since childhood, and boy o boy its still that same good old stuff- Cant get enough of their Biriyani, reshmi kebabs, tandoori chicken, murgh musallams! In the vicinity of my another fav restru in  Park Circus,Arsalan, this place beckons you each time you are around.Its open chaap and rumali roti counter facing the street is sure to lure you in :D 
At present there are a lot of outlets of Zeeshan, but for old times sake, this one is a winner.
Hail Mughlai khana, Hail Zeeshan

Zeeshan is a fully established Mughlai restaurant at Park Circus. They serve rolls at their snacks counter which is located slightly off the main entrance of their restaurant. Their culinary skill as a Mughlai restaurant results in some excellent Mutton Tikias (similar to Galauti Kebab in form and texture). These tikiasmashed and stuffed inside soft _ porottas_ make excellent Mutton Tikia Rolls, perhaps the best in town.
I had one of the best firnis here at Zeeshan and I love every other dish they have on offer. The prices are reasonable and competitive among the similar line of places in the area.

I still remember Zeeshan as Akhtar Bhai’s fabulous roll corner at the junction of Congress Exhibition Road and Syed Amir Ali Avenue , which suddenly turned into the sprawling restaurant in 1995 !

The mezzanine floor was the premium dining zone with foam cushion placed along the ceiling lest someone bumped his/her head on the ceiling.

It’s nostalgic to remember the fantastic biryani – juicy , full of fragrance, the potato sauted and cooked to perfection ; chicken bharta with rich creamy gravy , mutton boti kabab with meat almost falling off from the pieces !

But , gone are those days. Today’s Zeeshan is a pale shadow of it’s former self. With Arsalan within 100 meters distance , Zeeshan has lost a lotof it’s SHAAN !

Mutton Tikia , Garlic Naan , Mutton Chaanp , Chicken Rezala are no longer the dishes used to be !

Though , surprisingly the roll corner almost serves the same quality rolls. Bheja Fry Rolls , Egg-Tikia Roll , Egg-Chicken rolls are still superb ! Lachcha parathas still has that light sweet taste with a lot of fragrance of ATAAR.

Wish somebody strong-willed took up the challenge of facing Arsalan and fight out the local challenges like Kohinoor for the rolls !

This is a place I have visited a lot of times. I mostly go for home delivery purpose but yes I've eaten in the restaurant as well. I have tired the Chicken Biriyani a lot of times even tried the Chicken Tandoori, Firni, rolls, etc. Zeeshan is known for amazing biriyanis so it doesn't disappoint you on that front.. The biriyani is brilliant.. The Tandooris and Kebabs are good as well. The Firni is quite good. The ambience of this restaurant sucks big time. The atmosphere around the restaurant is not at all good. But you go there for the food not the ambience and In the food department they doesn't disappoint you at all.

Food: This is one of the very old restaurants of Kolkata, mainly known for their rolls and kebabs. However, they do provide a good variety of other items like North Indian main course and dessert. I have only tried their rolls and malai. So, won't be commenting on the rest of the items. The roll was one of the best I have tasted in Kolkata. It was huge and tasty but slightly oily unlike the rolls of Hot Kathi Rolls, Park Street. The waiters might insist you to have the "malai" but do not have it. It isn't the kind of malai you are thinking it is. In all probability you won't like it at all. I rate it 3.5/5.

Ambience: Pretty basic. Simple chairs and tables with no decoration as such. Good for a hangout with friends. I rate it 3/5.

Service: Speed is very good and so is the behaviour of the staff. They are very polite and always smiling. I rate it 4/5.

Price: One of the economical places for a quick bite.

Overall I give it 3.5/5.

If you are thinking of Rolls,think of Zeeshan only.
Kolkata is famous for Zeeshan and Rahmania Rolls...and whenever I think of them,it brings water to my mouth.

Being a resident of the city for more than two decades I have tasted the local roll(which makes me famous amongst the rollwallas),but nothing like Zeeshan.

You visit this place at the peak hours you get all you need.But after 8pm it is all finished.
What surprises me is that even with the growing number of roll outlets all over Kolkata,all the Poltuda's and Montuda's Roll Corners,people will still visit Zeeshan for the roll.And it is really good to see how the restaurant has maintained their named in the good books over the years.

Situated in the crossing of Park Circus and AJC Bose Road,Zeeshan is a Mughlai Restaurant that has a huge name.Not so fancy interiors,but the inside looks good when the crowd is present.

Apart from the Rolls if you go for food hunting at this place,try out their Biryani and Raita.The tandoori chicken roast is equally delicious and will keep you really busy.
Service is very good and the people at the counters hardly get time to take a good look at your face.

Gulp down everything with some cola.Else if you wish,try out the Falooda they serve.

Be it chicken or mutton....I swear Zeeshan is one place that will leave a mark in your memory.And every time I visit Kolkata,a Zeeshan Roll is a must....

#Zeeshan have always been popular with their wraps/rolls but to be precise,they have been the best when it comes to their mutton Tikia Roll..
The soft and soothing,well seasoned and rich in taste with the tinge of lemon sprinkles and the perfectly made lachha parathha serves a great wrap.
Mmm..Though lot of work has to be done when its about the #Tea they offer..We expect it to be a more thicker and rich.

But let the critics be kept aside,because the price they charge for their rolls makes them the matchwinner.
Way to go #Zeeshan

Located near Seven point , this restaurant is a must destination for Biryani lovers. It feels like the syllabus of eating remains unfulfilled , if U ate at Arsalan and dont give Zeeshan a try. The KEBABS , CHICKEN BIRYANI , MUTTON PASINDA , CHICKEN CHAP and FIRNI must be tried before judging them. The food is in general very oily , but that is okay for mughlai fans like me. The waiters are clumsy and yet asks for tips all the time . Biryani lovers , do try.

the 1st word came to mind when it was zeeshan ,  basis of quality or ambience or quantity or pricing , specially when " the arsalan " was in the corner. though visited just one time , me and my friend ordered two mutton biriani, and chicken maharaja , biriani was ordinary, mutton piece was very hard and chewy , rice taste wise good though, but chicken maharaja- the preparation just not justify the word * maharaja *.  chicken was properly cooked but i really did'nt like the gravy , onion all over , absolutely no no -_- overall average experience, may be it was not my day .
price - 2 biriani with one side dish is cost about rs-600

Um. Heard a lot of praises about the place so maybe the review is a bit biased as my expectations were on the higher side for this restaurant. However being Durga pujo, I guess none of these outlets could serve their best to customers. The Biriyani was a bit too dry, however the chicken kebabs were nice. They've got 3 sections in the restaurant and we had to wait for a bit to get place to sit. The staff isn't too courteous. We didn't have any issues with them but they had a tiff with one of their female customers who came to the restaurant with her family for dinner. Raised voices do not go well with the best kebabs, trust me. Apart from that, it's a no frills restaurant. Nothing about the ambiance or anything. Just visit if you're craving good kebabs and Zeeshan is around the corner.

Its been years that Zeeshan has been carrying its own reputation and it does justice to that each and every time I visit the place. They have never degraded the quality or quantity of their Biriyani nd dats y i like this place so much. The side dishes are also mouth-watering, maybe only second to Arsalan which is a 2 minute walk away from this place. Sometimes, even it wont be wrong to think of it as a tad bit cheaper version of Arsalan ( specifically 10-20 bucks cheaper i guess, which doesnt matter to me in case of having biriyani ). Imagine the Park Circus deprived of Arsalan, and it would have been the king of all biriyani outlets in that area. But, the service is not that satisfying at times because they take quite a bit of time to prepare the side dishes to be precise, because the Biriyani is already prepared as in most other places. But still the food can make you forget about all the negatives about ds place and dats why it deserves a 4 out of 5.

Well zeeshan another name in the legendary biryani maker's so shld I say my rating is totally on the service provided and not about the food ???? 
Well as far as the food is concerned I think it's quite yummy ???? and there rolls are superb a bit oily but not complaining coz if you want a subtatudee then mite as well eat boiled food ???? or shawarma (without mayo that is) there biryani is good but if leave it to get cold then there's a problem rest all is good 
Now coming to the major concern there service well agree ???? that there service needs to be worked on a lot , the staff need to be more bothered about.the customers rather than them self's 
I had ordered the usual for my self (biryani ) the staff who took my order did not take much time to get the food ???? , after about 10 mins I thought ???? of having a cold drink so I look around to see where was the guy who served me to my surprise ???? he was on the diagonally opposite table sitting and enjoying a cup of tea ☕ (which is not bad ) I so I asked him for a cold drink he took exactly 15min to get me that why coz he had to finish his tea 
I mean seriously was I really sitting at the zeeshan the legendary biryani place it's really pathetic to get this kind of service when your paying for it 
After this I guess it was not enough just coz I sat in. The non-ac section no finger bowl ???? was even offered so I went to the wash basin well yet again I was not surprised no soap only empty liquid soap  bottles well I did manage to get sum soap after all
The last but not the least wen I go to the counter to pay the staff was there but after me came a family ???? who I guess we're paying a good tip so the guy did not even bother to attend to me for atleast 10 to 12 mins. .......
It's really sad ???? where you get such good food ???? you can't get the service a customer deserve 
I hope sumthin is done abt the service coz that is the only disadvantage this restaurant ???? has and a few minor changes towards there rest-rooms and wash basins

They have two floors, one air conditioned and the other without it. Everybody is intelligent enough to guess which one’s what and every one opts for the quite obvious. The top floor has a very low ceiling of around 6ft. It’s very difficult to walk around but they have made a genuine effort to prevent getting hit by cushioning the ceiling. Music, décor greetings are far-fetched thoughts over here. Although the waiter poured two glass of water as soon as we were seated at the table.

I ordered CHICKEN MALAI KABAB for starters. They warned us that it would take a while for the kebabs to arrive but the wait was not too long. They didn’t bother to ask us to serve the kebabs. The pieces were very soft and tender with a hint of sweetness. MUTTON BIRIYANI and CHICKEN HANDI was what we chose for the main course. The biriyani had enough rice and a satisfying piece of mutton a piece of potato which is the specialty of biriyani in KOLKATA and a boiled egg. The plate was very small and it was difficult to manage. The chicken dish was spicy to taste. The piece was surely put into tandoor before putting into the gravy since it had that smoky flavor.

My favourite biriyani destination untill Arsalan came up.Good biriyani...wonderful kebabs...and my favourite...their Firni....its just awesome.
Although they should expand the place.....its a bit clumsy.....else, once you cant get inside arsalan....try it out.

Zeeshan is one of the very few restaurants in Kolkata which offer a very pleasant ambiance, especially in the air-conditioned section, and excellent Mughlai food, which one can only expect from the traditional Mughlai chefs who have inherited the skill and knowledge from their ancestors. We keep going back to this restaurant as we know we can never be disappointed by the taste and service once we are seated in the spick-and-span but narrow AC section of the restaurant. Most of the kababs offered here are mouth-watering, and cooked to just the right extent, preserving the softness while infusing the meat with delicious spices, smoothly ground. Chicken Shammi Kabab, Chicken Tangri Kabab, Boti Kabab were all delicious, and it was difficult to stop once we started. Then came the absolutely delectable Chicken Biryani, which had a very generous serving of rice, and was perfect in every way possible. The only kabab which has been a bit of a disappointment so far is the Chicken Seekh Kabab, which was a little too grainy due to excess of flour used, and though good, hardly matched up to the expectations the other dishes had set for us. However, in all, Zeeshan has always been a favourite and will continue to be so in the times to come.

I've never been to the place. However the chicken egg roll is a favourite that we order every time we visit Kolkata. It's fantastic and like many places in the city, tremendous value for money. 

The topic, "Who makes the best rolls in Kolkata" shall certainly evoke a hectic debate, with the passion one can expect from ones belonging to this city. I do believe Zeeshan will be one name tossed around in that cauldron

I had paid a visit to this outlet of Zeeshan recently mainly to sample the haleem they have on offer during this Ramzan month.This is located conveniently right at the Park circus 7 point crossing.It has a non ac section downstairs and an ac one upstairs.My friend and I seated ourselves in the ac section.The first thing you would notice about this section is the unbelievably low height of the ceiling.
Anyway,coming to the food,we ordered mutton haleem,chicken butter masala,tandoori roti and kabuli nan.The food arrived in about 10 mins.The Mutton haleem was one of the better versions of the haleem I have had.The consistency of it was quite the way I like.The mutton was perfectly cooked in it.The corianders and the squeeze of lime as usual added to the taste.The only negative was that the chunks of mutton contained far too much bone than what I would have preferred.The Chicken Butter Masala was too rich and oily for our liking.We had to waste most of the gravy.The kabuli nan which is one of my favourites was pretty good too.The toppings( if I can call them that!) were generous.But it was bit thicker than the versions of the kabuli nan that is available elsewhere.I felt it was a tad too thick and floury.
The service was pretty swift.The ambience is simple and like I mentioned the height of the ceilings are terribly low.The prices are moderate.Overall a decent place to try out and we were more or less satisfied with the haleem which was actually the main purpose of our visit.

On my way back from a shopping fiesta at Quest, I decided to pack haleem from Zeeshan. They serve in the evening from 7 and I was a tad ten minutes early with my hungry soul in their shop demanding food ravenously. I was politely asked to take a seat and wait my turn as soon as the man at the counter arrives. Without wasting any time, I had placed my orders of a mutton biryani, chicken malai kebab and mutton haleem by 7:02 p.m. I was informed that the malai kebabs would take some time and therefore I must wait. My parcel got ready in about fifteen to twenty minutes during which I stared at everyone's food with greed and lust. :D

Back home, I delved into all the dishes almost at a go. The kebabs were perfectly soft and succulent with a lovely cheesy malai covering. The biryani, as per Zeeshan standards, was light, not too oily and quite an amount for one to finish. The haleem was in fact the revelation of the evening. I have tasted haleem from some shops in the area and quite disliked the soup like oily texture. The one at Zeeshan was quite balanced - the mutton juicy, tasty and soft, and the dal not too thick, not too watery catering to my palate beautifully. I loved sprinkling a lot of coriander, chillies and lemon juice to make it all the more delectable. 

And oh, everything was packed impeccably. Over auto, bus rides and shoving people, not a single drop of haleem spilled in the polythene packet. I was unquestionably happy, of course.

====MOST DETAILED REVIEWS====================================
There are 5 Zeeshan in Kolkata - if I am not so wrong. This Zeeshan is located in between Park Circus 7 Point Crossing and Beckbagan Stoppage. Though this outlet seems better than others according to Zomato, I recommend the Sarat Bose Road Outlet. I think, the 2nd one is better in many ways.   

FOODS:
Only Mughlai & North Indian. 
PRO- 
1) Almost all the products are average. 
2) They are well spicy and tasty. 
3) All the veg dishes are okay.  
4) Firni is very good. Recommended.
5) The quantity of Biriyani is pretty good. 

CON- Rolls are very oily and lacks in spicy taste. 
There is something missing in their Biriyani , Chap and Kebabs. 
{rating: 3.0/5}

SERVICE:
PRO: In house sitting arrangement is there. AC and Non AC sections are available. Food is served at an affordable time gap in almost all the cases. They have no Car (4 wheeler) parking area separately. But you can park your car near the shop.  

CON: All the stuffs are quite polish-less , they are not trained, their behavior is sometimes rude and they maintenance of  the chain of hygiene is average. 
{rating: 3.0/5}

AMBIANCE:
PRO:  Its okay , not very nice. If you have to finish some personal discussions then you can do it here. You can hang out here with friends or family.

CON: Non AC section is not that appealing :P  
{rating: 3.3/5}

PRICE: Price is standard & slightly lesser than Arsalan n Shiraj. 
{Rating: 4.5/5}

Nearby Alternative:
Arsalan, Park Circus
Shiraj Park Street.


ENJOY.
Happy Monsoon.

Now where to start. The service is awful, the upper floor is AC, but you will feel so damn claustrophobic. And i was even denied service there because of lack of employees. I had to sit outside, where it was so dirty that....wait for it.....a cockroach crawled over our table. Didn't really taste the food. Left from there at that moment only. Zeeshan is good for rolls only

The murg reshmi tikka gravy and the tandoori rotis are super yum and really nice. This place is not high on ambience or interiors, but the food is reasonable and delicious. The mutton tikia roll, chicken roll and egg rolls are quite tasty and this is a choice for me whenever I feel like indulging in Indian food.

Ok to start with I must say that my brother is so fond of ths restaurant that whenever he was to give a treat or sumthng, he would take us to Zeeshan.. So needless to say, it was because of him that I came to know about ths place 6-7yrz ago.. Well, the 1st time I'd visited I remember having mutton biriyani, chicken chaap and firni.. I simply loved all of them.. The ambience was not so great though.. Last year too my brother had taken us there but sorry to say that I didnt get that same taste in those items ths time.. In short, the quality of food is no longer the same.. But sumhow I try to visit zeeshan every year atleast once due to several reasons.. :-)

zeeshan is among the top biriyani restaurant in kolkata. but their quality is decreasing day by day.Really congested place, if your height is above 5'10" then you will have a bad time in the AC section.
the biriyani was also very dry. but quantity is good. taste can be better.

I love the biriyani and chicken chap of this place. I always loved it, since I tasted it. They also have made imorovements in interior deco and all. It's not a place where you should expect a quiet meal, but you can definitely look forward to good food and decent service. Though the joint is most famous for the two items I mentioned before, the other stuff is also worth a try.

One of the worst restaurants I've ever visited. I don't know why its so famous.
We ordered Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Bharta & Mixed Raita. And, I didn't like either of them. I had great expectations from the Biriyani but when it was served with Egg, it reminded me of the roadside Biriyani stalls. In terms of taste, its worse than those roadside stalls.

We sat on the so-called "air-conditioned first floor" which is so small that even a person with standard height will have to duck to walk around.

Zeeshan,hmmm,the name is all!Well,is it?Not at all,or may be it is.This place is solely surviving on its name,the quality as well as the quantity it used to serve,have faded a long away.It is sticky,filled with dalda,heavy on the heart,heavy on the stomach and unnecessarily heavy on our pockets.Yes,i will not pay even 350 bucks for two,if they continue to serve such appalling ones,i just hope they realize their flaws,and go back to what their biriyanis earlier was,a delight.

Zeeshan has been on my wishlist since quite a long time and I got an opportunity to visit them yesterday for their mutton biryani....Though after geeting into the restaurant we were supposed to leave the place becuase of its stinky environment....but then a waiter showed us the AC dining area....which was totally empty....and the decorations were quite impressive with those black wooden table and comfortable chairs....I was quite happy with it..... :-) 
Now coming to the food....I loved their mutton biryani....the mutton piece in the biryani was so tender....
The chicken chanp and laccha paratha was pretty good too....
The service was very impressive...the biryani was served within 5 minutes....the waiter was so polite and generous....!!
overall I would definitely visit this place again because of their awesome food and their the service....!

It was one of those days when two people who had anyways met for lunch went separate ways met again for coffee and then chatted till dinner time. Now normally eating out twice on one single day is not really what I prefer but we were near Park Circus and I badly wanted some kebabs and I was thrilled to learn that my friend did not mind accompanying me to have some nice kebabs. Being at Park Circus you are spoilt for choices when it comes to the typical Calcuttan Mughlai dishes. I finally said that I wanted to sit down at Zeeshan's and my friend suggested that we try the Chicken Chanp. Now I have to especially mention that while taste is subjective when it comes to the Calcuttan Mughlai food I had someone who has in-depth knowledge about Calcutta's Mughlai cuisine and all I had to do was to trust her blindly. Ah what a delight it is to sink your teeth in moist juicy chicken smothered in a  beautiful spicy oily curry. Now if you do not want oil in your food you should probably avoid Mughlai food altogether. 

The Roomali roti to accompany the dish was perfect, thin, soft . i personally do not know how else a roomali roti is supposed to be, :) 

While both of us were full I still wanted some phirni and I was delighted with the creamy , milky treat. While she gave up after 2 bites I effortlessly finished the rest. 

While eating out is fun it is even more fun when you have a friend who can guide you extremely well with the cuisine you want to try. 

I definitely would pick up some chicken chanp and roomali roti in the future and never will I go to Zeeshan and not pick up the phirni

Earlier I would have given this place a rating of 4 points.But now its not that earlier Zeeshan any more.The quality has gone down a bit.However,still in comparison to other restaurants,this place offers good food and can be well recommended.Biryani and chicken reshmi butter masala is still a pretty hit,but I must say that the nearby Arsalan is doing a better job now.
BUT,if you want to taste some of the best rolls in the city..boy,this is THE place.Their rolls have remained pretty the same from the time I have first tasted them.. :P You can surely go for this one.

Pros:
- Kebabs: They are extremely juicy and straight from the tandoor. Every single kebab, no matter how exotic they might be, are quite unique and thus distinct from each other
- Biriyani: In my opinion their Biriyani is better than that of Shiraz and Arsalan

Cons:
- Scores zero on ambiance. The eating place looks pretty dirty. Waiters also look pretty shabby and sloppy.

Tip:
Don't eat at Zeeshan. Pack whatever you want to eat and enjoy at the comfort of your home!

I was first dragged to Zeeshan many years back by a foodie friend who raved about the rolls. In those days we lived on Ballygunge Circular Road so I began to frequent Zeeshan regularly for their Egg Tikia Roll which was delicious and bursting with flavors and loaded with crunchy slices of onions and lots of freshly squeezed lemon. 
The biryani and chaaps are no longer to my liking as a couple of times they have been just too oily for my liking but I still drop by for the occasional roll because they still make one of the better Tikia Rolls in the city. Even the regular egg chicken roll is quite good.

Zeeshan used to be a daily visit for rolls at one point of time. I used to love the biriyani... chaanp and the phirni too  but the quality of the biriyani dropped a few years back . although i still prefer them to rehmania and shiraz but not brilliant any more.. The rolls were good till the time there was this really dynamic boy on the roll snacks corner but for the last few visits i see this older gentleman who always confuses orders and makes the service really slow ... it tool him a long time to understand what i  was talking about when i said Doubel Egg Double mutton tikia roll and its not the first time i have ordered it . 

The roll quality is still good one of the best parathas in town> also love their brain roll its creamy and to die for

Back in school I used to come to a tuition in pArk Circus and I used to fill my stomach with their amazing egg chicken rolls. I love the paratha in those rolls and I love the chicken and I love the overall effect it has. Yes, they serve the best egg chicken rolls in Kolkata. Period!

The lachcha paratha is another one of their marvels and when eaten with chicken chaap, it is awesome to taste. The special chicken biriyani here is very nice as is the hyderabadi biriyani.

The ambience is not great at all and reminds me of arsalan. I do not like the ac section that much either although it is better than the non-ac section. 

I would recommend this place for their rolls and their laccha parathas!

This place is sort of a pilgrimage for fast food lovers. Their Rolls are the stuff of legends, having been present in the culinary scene for decades. I decided it was time I paid the place a visit. I was not fortunate enough to try anything other than the Egg and Chicken rolls on their menu, which has pretty much all the standard kinds of Mughlai food you can think of. The interior has the feel of a neighborhood middle class eatery with people conversing over cups of teas. Pricing is average and the fact that but made the most out of those. Service is courteous and fast. I really liked the fact that they allowed seats to patrons who ordered rolls. 

The Zeeshan Egg Roll should be taken as a standard example for Egg rolls everywhere. It's delicious. Larger than most rolls elsewhere, it had a fairly large portion of perfectly cooked smashed potatoes used along with fresh onions. The lemon provided the tangy zest. It had a certain burnt in a tawa taste that bowled me over. The slightly sweet dough used to make the parattha clung to the mouth while the spices in the dough spread the flavour around. The layering of the dough in concentric circles also feels nice. It's not too extravagant in its feel or use of ingredients but has a certain class which is hard to miss. Minimum oil usage was also appreciated.
The Chicken Roll was also a firmly satisfying one. The large pieces of chicken, wrapped inside a nicely cooked parattha were more than delicious. :) However, I felt that the size of the roll could have been bigger.

Chakraborty Tip : The shop just besides is not part of the Zeeshan establishment itself but some kind of a sister concern.

Well managed to visit the joint after a long long time. For old-timers this joint needs no introduction at all.Situated on Syed Amir Ali Avenue near the Park Circus 7-point crossing this joint has been a popular destination for Mughlai food lovers of Kolkata. One advantage is that the joint is located on the main road and thus has adequate parking facility.
The seating area is divided across 2 sections -AC and Non-AC.I was seated at the non-AC section which comprises mainly of male diners and is crowded all day.Waiters are at times inattentive and rude.Service is prompt.
Now coming on to the main topic of discussion-food. I tried out the chicken chaap,chicken bharta and parathas. The chap had the usual staple minimal spicy gravy but the chicken piece  was a big letdown.I mean chicken not being boiled properly and being chewy is an absolute shocker!!! I have chewy mutton at several joints  and quality of mutton it is the ultimate test for a hallmark joint.But eateries who can't get their chicken right are a strict no-go. The chicken bharta was thankfully decent though the quantity was not enough for two people. Parathas were piping hot though nothing extraordinary. Though their biriyani and rolls are thankfully still pretty decent.
Quality of most items has gone downhill like most Mughlai joints of the old-school.Usual disclaimer applies-Venture in only if you are not calorie conscious and do not mind your food being cooked in dalda. This kind of food is only meant for the adventurous types and not for the faint-hearted. :)

I have almost grown up with Zeeshan. I have seen the up and down of this restaurant. They have got into the franchisee model these days but I am sure for a Biryani lover, you cannot ignore the park circus joint. 
The quality and service has definitely deteriorated over the past few years. Sometimes it becomes a bit irritating when the waiters greedily looks at your wallet whether you pay them tip or not. But having said that the rezala and the chaap are still a delight. The Biryani or the application of Dalda has surely made it a mess but still it stands as one of the best in the town!

Ambience was poor, unhygienic and chaotic, but the food was good. We had tried kababs, biriyani and chicken gravy. The murg boti kabab was perfectly delicious. The reshmi butter masala gravy was nice. But the taste of biriyani was average comparing to the other dishes we had ordered.
The egg chicken roll was perhaps one of the most brilliant among those I had in my recent days. The service was poor, people at takeaway counter are rude, they often messed up orders. 
It is worth a visit only for good food at affordable prices and iif you don't care for the ambience, service.

The chap had the usual staple minimal spicy gravy but the chicken piece  was a big letdown.I mean chicken not being boiled properly and being chewy is an absolute shocker!!! I have chewy mutton at several joints  and quality of mutton it is the ultimate test for a hallmark joint.But eateries who can't get their chicken right are a strict no-go. The chicken bharta was thankfully decent though the quantity was not enough for two people. Parathas were piping hot though nothing extraordinary. Though their biriyani and rolls are thankfully still pretty decent.
Quality of most items has gone downhill like most Mughlai joints of the old-school.Usual disclaimer applies-Venture in only if you are not calorie conscious and do not mind your food being cooked in dalda. This kind of food is only meant for the adventurous types and not for the faint-hearted. :)

The mutton Biriyani is phenomenal... The chaap to go with it. It's better if u sit in the A.C zone as its more hygienic and less congested. I luv going there and try to vist once atleast once in 2 weeks.

I have almost grown up with Zeeshan. I have seen the up and down of this restaurant. They have got into the franchisee model these days but I am sure for a Biryani lover, you cannot ignore the park circus joint. 
The quality and service has definitely deteriorated over the past few years. Sometimes it becomes a bit irritating when the waiters greedily looks at your wallet whether you pay them tip or not. But having said that the rezala and the chaap are still a delight. The Biryani or the application of Dalda has surely made it a mess but still it stands as one of the best in the town!

Ambience was poor, unhygienic and chaotic, but the food was good. We had tried kababs, biriyani and chicken gravy. The murg boti kabab was perfectly delicious. The reshmi butter masala gravy was nice. But the taste of biriyani was average comparing to the other dishes we had ordered.
The egg chicken roll was perhaps one of the most brilliant among those I had in my recent days. The service was poor, people at takeaway counter are rude, they often messed up orders. 
It is worth a visit only for good food at affordable prices and iif you don't care for the ambience, service.

thier dal makahni is something they should work on as it was way below the mark.

Some say Zeeshan (near Park Circus 7 point crossing) serves the best Biryani in Kolkata. Although I am not sure personally as I have other options but definitely, this branch of Zeeshan serves good food. Famous for their Biryanis, kebabs and rolls Zeeshan has many reasons to try out. And some minor reasons not too.. Again I mention on this one the place speaks food more than ambience. 6 footers avoid the AC section. I am 6 ft 2 in and had to almost crouch down to reach the tables as the ceiling is seriously low. Although the ground floor (non AC) section is good but don't expect good ambience here. 
Talking about food try the rolls. They are a hot favourite and if you are near the Park Circus area, personally I think this is the best place to have one of your favourite rolls. The paranthas are well fried with a little crispy surface and the ingredients inside are just perfect. I personally prefer the mutton roll. It is absolutely fantastic. I rate them high on rolls. Now talking about Biryanis, the service is moderately fast.. The Biryanis are nicely balanced but I lack the perfect flavour I get in Arsalan to be honest. But undoubtedly one of the best in Kolkata. I love the Chicken Dopiaza and the rezala from Zeeshan. It is well cooked but could be a bit oily for some of you. It is best to have them with rotis or naans. I still haven't had kebabs here. Maybe next time should try it out. 
Overall a good restaurant for food lovers who wants good mughlai and north Indian dishes sans good ambience and space. Worth trying out.

Situated off-the park circus 7-points, this one offers variation to your taste-buds from its neighbours.
Food has the desired essence of a true mughlai restaurant. Ambience has improved since the addition of the new A/C section.
Service is satisfying.
Over all, a family cum frnds cum office lunch eat-out place catering to all age groups.

Zeeshan is situated just off the main park circus 7 point crossing.  Every person has their pick of "Biriyani" place - Zeeshan's biriyani regarded very highly by a lot of people including me.

While other staple players skip the egg - Zeeshan includes Egg in the normal offering of its biriyani.  Love the differentiation. The biriyani is fragrant with beautifully cooked rice, the potato and chicken/mutton of your choice. 

In terms of place - do not expect a lot , although separate sections of A/C and Non a/c exist in an effort to serve their mass clientele. The kebab's are worth trying - delicate spiced and beautifully done.  Their take-away service is also very efficient - lot of commotion and quick service. Love the red and yellow packets of biriyani lined up near the counter.

Head to Zeeshan if you want to satisfy your soul with some good Mughlai food. :)

Rolls are always my favourite. very tasty, soft crispy sweet paratha wrapped over juice succulent tender pieces of meat with freshly chopped onion and chilli and drops of lemon. One of the best rolls in the town. For mains, biryani and kebabs are pretty good, but definitely not the best. Nice location, though parking is next to impossible. Service is okay to good.

I visited Zeeshan a few days back and found that good old Zeeshan food still rocks as always. I visit this place frequently and Zeeshan has never disappointed me. Even if Arsalan is few blocks away from Zeeshan, I still prefer going to Zeeshan just for their mutton chaap and rumali roti which still remain unparalleled. I love their firni too. For take away I think Zeeshan rolls are still the best. What they need to improve on are the ambience and their service.

Visited Zeeshan after a long span of five years. The new ambiance is worthy of appreciation. The restaurant has had a complete makeover. The service is good, waiters more hospitable and the restaurant more spacious. Had a regular chicken roll and chicken biryani, were good but not very  impressive. 
Suggestions:
1. The washrooms need to get bigger.
2. Also, a little more hygienic.

There was a small party to take place and me with my friend went for get biryani from Zeeshan. I thought that i was going to give him a big deal of business, and proudly told  " 25 Special Mutton Biryani.......jaldi".
The person looked at me and with a satiric smile, said'" Sir, 45 minute lagenge, aaj saturday hai na".
My local friend told me that 25 biryanis is like a daily affair for them. Anyways, after one hour i got my order, and i was humble this time.
Many of my meals of  next weekends, and weekdays were from Zeeshan. Everything in mughlai is good. Dont try anything else.

Zeeshan is one of Park Circus's most well-known restaurants, and in the main, they deserve their reputation. However, the food does not always live up to the relatively higher prices they charge.

Staples like the Biriyanis and Tandoori Rotis are good. The chicken and mutton dishes available are good, but none stand out. There are some Chinese items that need not be ordered - I don't see why people would go to Zeeshan and order Chinese food, unless they wanted to ensure that the meat was halal or something of that sort. I've never liked their kebabs, but friends think highly of them.

Their desserts are also good. They occasionally keep a Shahi Tukra, and the Firni is also the traditional kind. Service is quick - better on the ground floor than the air-conditioned mezzanine. However, there are no compelling reasons to visit it too many times.

This is one place whose name comes to my mind just after Arsalan when i feel like gorging on some lip smacking Mughlai dishes. While the ground floor seating arrangement is quite good, the ac part is very small and stuffy, and the ceiling is so low that we had to crouch down to reach our table. Apart from that, the food is very good. The kebabs, biryanis and special mention for the firni! I personally feel that the best rolls are from zeeshan. Do not fail to try out their chicken rolls first. The prices are relatively lower than that of the neighbour restaurants. Service is pretty quick. So I would give it a 4.

Zeeshan is very very dependable and it won't ever disappoint you. When you talk of Biriyani there are 3 names you can't miss and that's Arsalan, Rahmania ans Zeeshan. I have been to this place several times and after the meal I have always had a smile across my face. Their biriyani is awesome alone with the lip smacking kebabs and Mutton Chap. Their Phirni is simply amazing and a must try. The prices are very reasonable and you can visit here anytime you want. The ambience is average though to me it looks a bit unhygienic but the taste and quality of food makes up for its not so good ambience. 
So I rate it 4 and hope the ambience is improved so that I can give it 5 which will make the place perfect.

SIMPLY AWSEOME MUGHLAI FOOD!

Zeeshan can be counted among the best Mughlai food joints in Kolkata. One should not go there expecting a glamorous ambience or first class service. You would be greatly disappointed in those two departments. But the food of Zeeshan will never disappoint you.  Having said that, from time to time, they do suffer from consistency problem. The food items are priced moderately; even lesser than the other food joints specializing in Mughlai food.

They serve the best Rezala in town; be it chicken or mutton. The taste will always linger on once you have completely demolished it. The meat breaks off easily and literally melts in your mouth. A Rezala is always best had with Nan or Roomali roti. No matter the number of times you order for this dish there won't be any change in the taste and consistency. Their Mutton Rezala can certainly be considered as made to perfection. The same can also be said of their chaap dishes. Their Mutton and Chicken Chaap have a huge public demand. The chaaps are tender and juicy. They are cooked in the right amount of masala and for the right amount of time. Their kebabs are also the most haves at Zeeshan. The kebabs are tasty but sometimes you find them undercooked or burnt. Nevertheless I always order for the following from the kebab section-Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab and Mutton Seekh Kebab.  Their chicken tandoori is also one of my favorites. It is properly prepared and not charred like the kebabs. They make the tastiest Biryani in town. Some days, though, their Biryani does leave a heavy feeling in the stomach. Their Mutton Tikka rolls remind me of the mutton tikkas of some of the best Mughlai joints. A meal at Zeeshan is not complete without their Firni.

Zeeshan a prominent name is Mughlai and Tandoori Cuisine in Kolkata. Well,one can walk in to indulge him/her self in the mouth watering dishes served here.Though the  NON-Ac portion is not impressive,but the new AC hall hs a hell and heaven diff..The hall is LED dim lit,seat and tables are of modern design and the hall is well Air-Conditioned. The main attraction the Biriyani is cooked to perfection and has a unique taste.Though a bit gheee(oily),its nice :p ,well its what it gives the taste r8??The biriyani includes a piece of tender-juicy meat,an boiled egg and the kolkata special  a Juicy piece of Potato. Along this the Tandoori Chicken and Mutton chap are hot sellers,surely for their taste. The Mutton Chap here is one you will not get in the whole city,it juicy,tasty,gheee:p and masaleydar.What more do u needdd????Though you have more options of having roti's and nuns along with chaps,rezalas,kashas and more the above combination is the best. And for dessert you have the ice-creams and the delightful-Firni.

Zeeshan flatters the biriyani culture of kolkata by serving dryish whitish biriyani which you can never get sick of. However, the biriyani flavour is lighter when compared to others. Its great if you decide upon having biriyani everyday... ;-) the shahi ness of a biriyani is lacking at the biriyani here though. Kebabs are decent! If its on the way, i pick up stuff from here. Its decent. But seriously it cant make me drive all the way,Zeeshan doesnt have that pull- not anymore. I remember how it had usurped the popularity of shiraz n rahmania, when it had opened up, but that exceptional quality it had isnt there anymore. Basic point is that you will never be dissapointed.

The reason why I like this joint is simple - the Chicken Chaap. Well, I possess a terminal affinity for chicken chaap, and I like Zeeshan's version, preferably with a couple of rumali rotis and a couple of green chillies. their mutton tikias are also something I would go back to. 

Ambiance wise the place is okay-ish, but what I like is the service, which is pretty fast and friendly. They do not take much time in delivering what you want, so it makes for fast and tasty eating. Also, the rolls are worth going for, especially the mutton tikia rolls, and one is enough to fill me up for good. The biryani is okay, not too great or bad. But edible. 

Otherwise, I am not a big fan of the rest of the items on the menu.

I have eaten at this restaurant multiple times, mostly taken away stuff to eat at home. I have seen a decline over the past one year.

I used to enjoy their biryani, which in my opinion used to be less rich and yet a tad spicier than other's. Also, there would be consistency, which is not necessarily so any longer.

I used to enjoy their mutton tikias, the chicken chaap (better than many), some of the kababs (especially the chicken boti kabab that comes with grilled capsicum, onion and tomato). Of late, it seems at times they simply stuff in under-cooked ones.

A basic problem is their chicken portions are often very small. Their tandoori chicken, otherwise made well, often does not seem enough.

A couple of times they have messed up orders, mostly forgotten to pack something... last time it was a tandoori roti!

One recent and nice development has been the change in their chicken do-piaza. Since they have started using a chicken kabab (on the bone) rather than regular chicken piece, the taste has vastly improved. I found it quite delicious, especially with their roomali rotis.

Zeeshan is just the Mughlai restaurant for take away and if you really love Mughlai food then you wouldn't mind eating in here, though this place is a little dirty and it will really disappoint you if you are asking for the ambience or service quality, so don't come up here looking for such perfections. But this place serves good food at a reasonable price . The  kebabs are a liitle undercooked  or burnt sometimes but that really doesn't matter . The naan , Mutton Chaap are very delicious indeed ( very oily too : P),but the Biriyani is good ; but not what the people say that how splendid restaurant is ,stillI wouldn't say overhyped , but worth a try .It is not as good as it was in the past of course.But the Chicken Rezala is really tasty. If you are hungry ,you may just drop by and of course, visit this place at least once because it may not be be the best but it is in the top  restaurants in the list of best Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata.

Verdict: Drop in !

If you are an avid lover of Indian and Mughlai food yet have not visited Zeeshan, then I must say it is worth a visit. Don't go there for the best ambiance or the greatest service quality as both of these will make you feel extremely dejected. But just for the love of food...go there. 

The quality of food has deteriorated from the past for sure. But even then, the quality of rezala is simply awesome. I think one of the best you find in Kolkata. The biryani, definitely is not that tasty. And among the kabab, I would ask you to avoid the Hariyali Kabab. But having said so, it is and will remain as one of the best Indian Food Joint.

Forget the ambience and the service - just indulge in the food and you will know why this place thrives. The unbelievable price and the quality and quantity make a deadly combo that will leave you reeling from the impact, in a positive sort of a way.

The kebabs are sometimes burnt, but most of the time the flavour is something that you will savour. The naan, rotis and the Mutton Chaanp and the Rogan Josh are as famous as their Biriyani, and all of them are equally good. I would personally place the bread section a bit higher than the rice section - mainly because of the balance of spices which is only just a little skewed at times - but if you are hungry, all of this should not matter at all! The Firni and Kulfi are good, too.

The roll is perhaps one of the most brilliant ones I have had. Although I would not go as far as stating that it is the best one - it is definitely in the top bracket.

Verdict: Very affordable prices, very convenient location and very good food!

If it's just the food at a moderate price, you are concerned about then 'Zeeshan' is the place. The Biryani and the Chap served here are really good. But my favorite item here is Mutton Pasinda with roti. It's one of the better items served here. The Kebabs are horrible and mostly over cooked or burnt. The rolls are better. The ambience is not up to the mark. And lesser said about the seating the better it is. You literally have to crouch to enter the dining area which is on the 1st floor. I will suggest you for a take away. 3/5 for the food but 1/5 for the ambience.

One of the best kebabs that I have tasted in my life reside in this restaurant. A combination of chicken biriyani with mutton chap and maybe some kebabs and a firni as desert is truly a hearty meal!

I short, this place is kick ass. I feel sorry for this place because it has the gigantic Arsalan steps away, but what makes Zeeshan more awesome is the lower rates. This is easily the lowest you'll pay in the city for one of the best biriyanis. Another special mention is of a meal you can finish in Rs.50. Mutton Shaami Kabab is priced below Rs.30 and is one of the holiest things on earth. Rumali roti is more suited to go with it, but do order one roti at a time since, the roti becomes tough in a few minutes. Their chaap is also very good. 

I'll make a bold statement. I feel Zeeshan also has the best rolls in the city.

However, I have a complaint with Zeeshan. The waiters do not seem to come to you unless you call them. This might take some time as well. However, the food comes to the table quickly, once the order is placed.

It is small restaurant, ambiance is good.. here Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Kashmiri with Tandoori Roti is best.  
Price is reasonable.

They prepare some awesome Kebabs. Biryani is good as well. No other rolls can beat Zeeshan's roll; they are superb. 
Just have one Egg Chicken Roll & that'll suffice as your lunch/dinner. 
Ambiance isn't that good. 
The place is too small to handle a big crowd.

food tastes really good.. but it might be too much spicy for some people
biriyani is good.. and price is also moderate
however the ambience of the non ac section is really dissapointing and service is delayed by a large amount of time

They have recently renovated the AC Section, and they've done a pretty decent job at that. The kebabs of are the best in Park Circus region except for Krazy Kebab's. The biriyani is also good. If you want something cheap, try the Butter Nun or parathas with Shami Kebab. You won't be disappointed. Dishes worth mentioning: Rezala, Butter Nun, Kebabs esp. Chicken Tikka, Boti and Haryali, and Chicken Tandoori. The Chicken reshmi kebab feels quite dry sometimes. howver, at the given price, the food served is excellent. The ambience is nothing special. In fact, the non-AC section feels quite dirty. The waiters are quite courteous, though they are only fluent in Hindi. If you want the kebabs, order beforehand, as it takes almost 15-20 minutes for the kebabs to be served.

The best place for kebabs and biryani. They have been there for a long time in the business but the food quality has remained the best.

If you want a take-away cheaply, Zeeshan is the place. The Chicken Boti Kebab is recommended. Here's a tip: the restaurant makes delicious kebabs. But stay away from gravy based items. If you are in the mood for sinful eating, try the keema and boti combination- accompanied by parathas. For dessert, try the firni.
