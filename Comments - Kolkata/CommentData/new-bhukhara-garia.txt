The food here is mediocre...Better for takeaway purposes...The price is reasonable....Do try this place when you are planning for a low budjet meal...The Chinese food here is better than the rest...Give it a try ...

I have been frequenting this place since childhood and I am a big fan of their Chinese food. The rates are minimum for each dish and the ambience is not to great but the service is very quick and the staff is very friendly! Cheers to this place.

Got food delivered to my place.... All the dishes were pretty average..we ordered
Tandoori chicken-a bit too dry
Chicken reshmi butter masala-it was surprisingly sweet
Chicken tikka butter masala-tasted so-so
Nan-a bit chewy

Overall the food is average considering the locality and the price

When we were new to Garia, we opted for this restaurant for the birthday treat among friends. 
now let's come to the point. This place serves average sometimes below the average food but is damn pocket friendly. The mixed fried rice, noodles and chilli chicken were good as per I remember. The place is not really clean   to sit through but it has an great view of the metro passing by the bridge.

Out of nowhere, we suddenly decided to order our lunch from this place once during durga puja. Searching for the entrance was quite a huge task because its through the vegetable market. It is on the top floor of a building and nothing is to be written about the ambience. Some plastic chairs and tables are all that it has. The receptionist is pleasant and he suggested us to try the biriyani. We ordered chicken biriyani and chicken reshmi masala for takeway. I liked both the biriyani and the reshmi masala. Nothing extraordinary but pretty good. The chicken piece was also good. Prices are also on the lower side,so that's a plus point. Moreover it gives free home delivery within 2kms (not during the puja though) and my home lies within that, so we will definitely order something again. I guess those who know about it, order regularly for takeaways because the receptionist attended n number of calls while we waited for our food and he seemed to know most of them. A good take away joint,it is!

A budget friendly outlet. The quality of food is also good and furthermore you can get quality food at minimum prices even you have a min of Rs 100-150 so one can go there if you want to hang out at garia after tutions to eat

Very cheap in price. Ok ok food. Waiters are nice behaved.. good for students who go for tuitions near garia to hang out. Even 100rs in pocket is enough for a person there

I have been eating in this restaurant for more than 5 years. Mesmerized with various typical north indian dishes, it is bound to give you a flavour in a slightly different style. I have tried almost all the dishes and every time I had, I didn't find it bad. Food is tasty enough to fulfill your taste buds.
Some of the of dishes you must try is "Chicken Tikka Masala", "Laccha Paratha", "Roomali Roti", "Vegetable Jhal Phresey" "Chicken Biriyani" and "Chilli Chicken".
I hope you will like the taste of the food although the ambience and location is not good enough to match with the taste.

this restaurant is located in the Garia Bajar... its on the top floor of a building... bit tough to find out... when we entered into this joint.. we saw that windows were open and there was no mosquito coil, after pointing it out they arranged for a coil. 
Now coming to food, we ordered simply Mixed fried rice, chilli chicken, and cold drinks. taste was not bad... quantity is decent, ambiance is below average... price is not so high.. service is also below average.. but one thing is good that you can have a very pleasant view of the city including Metro rail if you can manage to seat near window.

There was a time when we used to be students at Ramakrishna Mission Narendrapur - translating - Money was short in supply, the hunger was the same as that of a baby dragon, and there was hardly anything we could do about it. In came two local establishments - Bhukhara and New Bhukhara. I have no knowledge if they are long lost brothers who chose to go separate paths or something. 

Coming to New Bhukhara - the Restaurant is on the terrace of a house - the first two times you will definitely land in someones drawing room (people generally mistake the building) ! Service can be damn good to plain pathetic - It can take 5 minutes to 2 hours. Better parts. If you are from any of the local educational institutions, you can smoke inside :D Don't get me wrong - but that is how it is. We use to get the Chicken Tadka with Roomali Rotis - it is cheap enough for you not to blame the establishment in case it goes wrong. Anyways it is just lentils & chicken therefore very hard to go wrong. The fired rice is ok ok albeit with a lot of mono-sodium glutamate (Ajinamoto) and so is the case with the noodles. Rest is fine. I suggest: go here to eat out when there is a strict constraint on your budget; which is always the case for students. 

About their Home Delivery - It is nothing but a few of their guys with bicycles. And yes you can drink beer on the terrace - its partly constructed so take care and don't fall off.

In short it is one of those motley establishments that only a city like Calcutta can boast off - a disappearing breed of cheap,  yet habitable by a middle class sort of a place . Its average nature made it affordable for punters like me. Somewhere you go on weekends on a budget of a hundred bucks and have a sumptuous dinner. Hope you have a good - no great time there !

They don't have basic knowledge of cooking. If you made any order with specific sugar, salt, chills - they will forgot it and serve you the regular menu. Their home delivery is the worst I had seen ever in my life. But of course they will send you all ordered food in a regular plastic container with a (no name) bill purchase from local market. Make a try and u will understand their service.

Garia Bukhara food delicacies are excellent considering the reasonable price range and the delivery at your door step when ever ordered any menu. I stay at Patuli which is few Km away from the restaurant but when ever I give any order they serve it promptly.
