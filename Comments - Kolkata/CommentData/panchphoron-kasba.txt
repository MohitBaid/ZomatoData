Located near to Siemens bus stoppage and adjacent to Cakes kasba. A small and cozy outlet serving bengali cuisine as it can be figured out from its name. Food served here are not good at all and half of the dishes mentioned in the menu card are not available. Its a never visit place and eating here with the same money spent at a good restaurant makes no sense. So bengali food lovers do not waste your money in this restaurant.

Update: Recently we ordered takeaway once more...this time shukto and alu-jhinge posto; the former was okay, but the latter had mostly alu and barely any jhinge!!!

I haven’t eaten here, but had opted for parcel from this restaurant. At the time of ordering, I did have a glimpse of the interiors....the space inside is tiny, so not sure how the dine-in experience would be. The ‘dhokar dalna’ that I brought home was decent....a tad hot for our tastes, perhaps. I will have to try out the other items before coming to a final verdict.

Located near kasba new market...it's a very small restaurant with only 3 tables...food was not good at all..we ordered plain rice,dal,doi potol n doi Mach..the food was very ordinary... not happy with the service.the biggest drawback of ds place is that they have the menu card written in Bengali only..I saw people leaving the restaurant bcz they are not Bengali n they can't read the menu card.its not at all appreciable..they should make the menu card as such so that everybody can read it...

This is a quaint little place right on the R.B connector opposite Siemens and can be easily located.Coming to the interiors it is done in the purely Bangali format with interesting array of decorative items.Although the seating is limited but tidily done and managed.The food that they serve defines comfort home food.From the Dhokar Dalna to the Aloo posto, Chicken Daakbunglow to Kochi Paathar Jhol or the Paabda and Parsher Jhaal everything oozes flavour.Both the veg and non veg items are fresh and well flavoured. Staff is polite and quick and have never been dissapointed from the services.This place can easily be tagged as those "hidden gems" and should necessarily be tried!

Why doesn't this place have their Menu in Hindi or English? 
Or is it that they only wish to serve locals. 
Sad. 
Wish Zomato could at least regulate such issues.

Have tried their food quite a number of times its very good. Though its a small place I suppose their dine in is not that attractive because of its shabby interior but I believe one must at least order food from here once to judge them...

Just opposite to Siemens this restaurant cannot attract much people due to bad rating on Zomato but we tried lunch and felt amazed with the taste. Restaurant is too small and only hold 16 people. There was only a single staff, he is efficient and we ordered Chingri Pulao and Chicken Dak Banglow. Chingri Polao quantity is sufficient for one people, Dak Bunglow contains 3 big pcs of Chicken. Well cooked with good taste. We'll try again.

Good Bengali Cuisine. Had been there for lunch and loved the food. The place is not very spacious. Well if you are looking for a decent place for Bengal cuisine, you must try it. This place won't leave you unsatisfied.

Though most people don't write a good review for this place, I love the place for its bengali cuisines. Too small for a restaurant with less than a dozen seats, but the restaurant looks much bigger with intelligently crafted mirrors on the wall. However, most of the time you would find a table despite this small seating capacity. In nutshell, ambience is good
I love this place for its bengali dishes. Chicken and mutton dishes, with special mention of chicken duckbunglow and mutton korma are real treats for the taste buds. Not to forget about fish dishes. 
Prices are reasonable and waiting time is little long but again, reasonable. However, dont expect all items on the menu card to be available.
A big thumps up for panchphoron.

Located very close to my place so one day i walked in for a parcel. Since it is nearby i never sat in to eat and the ambiance is very average while seating arrangement too is very limited.

Anyways coming to food i ordered for aloo posto and chicken curry.  Seriously regret it. The aloo posto was stale and had a weird taste and smell and the chicken was just average. I regret having tried this place. I guess i can make better at home. 

They have limited staffs so it takes time to deliver. Overall bad experience or just wasnt my day.

You enter this restaurant and u see just 3 tables. But once you have the food, it's out of the world. Try out the chicken jhol, mutton kosha, steamed rice, dhakai chicken and almost anything on the menu. Pure bengali paradise.
Amazing job guys. Keep it up.
I will definitely come again and again.

Well we finally got the chance to have lunch in this place after months of having decided to come here. I still remember that day months ago, when we came across this place while on our way to Crystal Crossroads, which is situated just a floor above, figuratively as well as literally.... Now this is quite a small place, with like 3 tables in a pretty small room (i mean it ends almst right where it starts...we were just discussing the owners mistakenly opened a restaurant instead of a home delivery service...but ya, we stood corrected). And they serve only bengali food. So what's special about this place? Well, there is a term in bengali which describes this place accurately: "chhimchham". It's a well-kept sweet little joint, the service is good, the people are polite. The food could appear a bit pricey but tastes nice, so that makes up for it. Above all it's a place where any bengali would love to have a nice quality time. The ambience has that factor hidden in there. But ya it's better to avoid coming here if you are looking for a small snack like a fish fry, it could take time. Overall, it's a nice place to visit for a satisfactory bong lunch.

Awefull restaurant.  The person who works there is a hulligun.  He made us sit for 45min and rather than being apologetic started shouting. Such restaurant are spoiling the name of calcutta and bengali food.

This is worst Restaurant I have ever visit in my life. First of all we ordered the food. Then we were waiting for food in a very good mood. After minimum 45 mins of waiting we didn't get the food. Then, I just said that it is enough. And suddenly the manager got furious and started a hot argument. After a while he came to beat me and my family. I was so shocked and stunned that could not understand what to do.. I think this kind of behavior I have faced first time in Kolkata.. I can't believe that in my city, almost in my locality this kind of incident can happen.. So, before going to that place beware people. It's not about only food.. It's about your safety.. A big "NO" for this crap place from my side!!!!!!!

If you live in the vicinity and you mostly have to order take outs cause you are really lazy to cook, this is the place to make a call! Good food and inexpensive! Went to the place a couple of times - barely sits 6-8 people.
