The best cake and pastry shop that I have ever tasted. They even have a live bakery to bake and create cakes of your choice and customisation. By mere coincidence I dropped in the store on my first month marriage anniversary to buy a cake which also happened to be their first day of operations and in spite of having many customers, they individually addressed everyone. The customer service, The customisation, The superior taste and many more other qualities are thr reasons for which I am currently following their menu and actually ticking off each pastry one by one to taste each item atleast. KUDOS to the team and management.
