Good food and awesome service. Better quantity on the combo may earn you the 5 star you are looking for. Keep up the good work and the service.

I ordered  customized lunch packets (Bhetki Fry-salad-shahi polao-dahi katla-chicken kasha-chutney) for a small occasion in our department at iiest,shibpur. My oder quantity was just 15..They delivered this at a distance of approximately 12 km from their base kitchen without any delay and perfectly  right on time..Packaging was perfect and temperature of the food was well maintened..Quality wise shahi polao,chicken kasha and chutney was above the mark, but dahi Katla was average..We expected a much thicker gravy for the dahi Katla..But the main issue was quantity of rice..May be the quantity was sufficient for corporate lunches or something like that, where popele generally eat less carbohydrates..☺️..But in general some people eat rice just twice of the quantity..So as a host i felt a bit of embarrassment..So my advice is always order for some extra rice.apart from this it was really good..

I like their food. I've liked their food for a long time. One, the packaging. Two, the combo choices. Three, the taste. ONLY issue I have is that delivery often takes longer than ususal.. and the pulao is a tad too sweet for some.
Keep up the good work, guys, especially the consistent taste and standards.

My aim was to see if I cud get food at my doorstep which is far from there outlet and is at quite distant place from main road. The food delighted me as well as the before ETA delivery.

At midnight, our hungry stomachs was craving for food, and then zomato always helps! It showed us a vast number of restaurants, F4U showed up. Tasted food from a lot of restaurants, but the taste I felt after tasting the parantha and chicken butter masala from here, the taste was mesmerising!  The food quality was damn too good and quantity was also sufficient! Delivery was on time. Overall it was a very good experience! I recommend it to everyone who's looking for great food within budget. Gracias!

I cannot sing enough praises about this place. First off, we ordered at around midnight, and as we are not locals, the guesthouse we were staying at has locked their doors by that point. We were unable to wake the security guard to unlock the gate - however, the F4U team, as well as our amazing, amazing delivery man continued to talk to us on the phone (through the language barrier) from 1.30 AM onward, trying to find our guesthouse, which is usually a little difficult to locate. 

We were on the phone for an hour, and our delivery man had been roaming the streets for just as long. He later mentioned that he was also stopped by the police as he had been circling our neighborhood trying to locate our guesthouse. He finally located us at around 2.30 AM, much to our disbelief. When he noticed that we could not unlock the gate, he very generously offered to climb onto his scooter and pass our food over the top of the gate.

Not only did we manage to get our food despite being behind a locked gate, the delivery man apologized for the late delivery. We were in absolute disbelief that this delivery man persisted through the late hour and climbed onto a scooter just to make sure we got our food. On top of that, he was so humble and not at all annoyed that the process had taken so long. We are so very impressed with this service, and hope the F4U team will reward this delivery man accordingly. 

Furthermore, the thali that we ordered was delicious, and the packaging was so convenient and user-friendly. We also ordered the methi chicken, which was tender and cooked to perfection. We had such an unbelievably good experience with F4U and highly recommend this restaurant to the Zomato community. 

To our delivery man, thank you so very much for your amazing service and continued persistence. There are no words to describe our gratitude. THANK YOU.

I ordered a combo of Rajma-Chawal & Luchi-Dal from this place today. Their online order starts at 1:00pm but then also it was fast in processing the order and the food was delivered by 2:15pm. 

The taste of the food was really nice but the comparative quantity in the combo is very less. Once gets left in lurch how to finish the rice as because the Rajma gets finished half way through.

There were 4 luchis in the combo, but the quantity of the Dal as compared is less.

A suggestion while serving combos .... the quantity of both the items should be relatively same to enjoy the food

Will recommend to others and try next time. Also try to put other items from your menu for online ordering through Zomato

: A fan of this organisation. The food tastes amazing and their service is pretty crisp.  Few items, it doesn't go with my taste pallet but most of them, they make me go gaga. The meat selection and preparation is on point. Though, I feel they need to improve their quantity because I have found it to be fluctuating quite a bit.  But that set aside,  F4U takes care of your hunger in a very healthy and homely way.

I urge you to try out this, if you haven't. Disappointment probability will be to that of an aircrash. Best of luck guys.

Proper sense of delivery, with most orders reaching before the designated time. Doesn't sell things that are too fancy but definitely cooks food that's worth your purse.
I honestly believe that it falls under the bracket of budget-eats, not too expensive and neither bland. North Indian and Bengali cuisine, done just how they should've.
Never physically been there and therefore no experience about the ambience of the restaurant, but whenever I'm hungry and unwilling to cook, this restaurant is my first thought.

"Do your best to fulfill the customers' requirement even if you have to go out of the way" - that was the marketing mantra we learnt in our PGDBA days . F4U has made it their USP and you do not have to look back ever . Timely delivery of yummy finger licking food - what else do we need ?? Am more than satisfied with their food and service and plan to become a permanent customer :) Not able to add photos of the superb packaging because we gobbled up before we could click pics :P Kudos to you and keep up the good work !!

In one word horrible experience.For the first time I ordered online frm F4U...& My guests had to wait hungry until I cld cook something fast fr them because the food delivered frm the restaurant was not edible. Polao rice was undercooked...So hard it seems kachha chawal...Chkn was raw...Masala also had raw flavor. They mentioned to gve chutney but it was not there. I suggest either change the cook or don't tie up with the Zomato otherwise ppl will lose faith in Zomato. Only standard restaurants should cater for the city people.

We ordered the recently launched punjabi curry pakori combo. There were 3 pieces of pakora with curry and plain rice in each combo. Rice quality was good (not quantity, its very less for 1 adult) but curry was not at all satisfactory..too watery...the essence of curd was missing..This was our 1st order..although dissapointed...but will try their bengali options...packaging and delivery were fine.

F4u delivers good food. I'm not certain about the location; I have been reading reviews of F4U on Zomato for a while and decided to order a meal on A Sunday night. It was yellow Pulao with Chicken kassa. The food came packed neatly; infact I was quite pleasantly surprised by the quality of the packaging materials used. A lot of top-notch restaurants dnt use such good quality food-grade plastics, so full marks to the F4U team for getting that right. 
The portion size was sufficient for one. The chicken pieces were decent, meaty and well-cooked. The kassa gravy was delightful. It was a tad bit sweet and spicy; however, I personally would have preferred it to be a bit less watery. Dnt get me wrong, it was not liquidy, but I prefer a thick sweet and spicy kassa gravy. The pulao was good with good amount of cashews and raisins. The only gripe I had was that the pulao could have been a little bit more sweet. I'm used to my mom making a sweet yellow pulao and spicy kassa at home and that's were my expectations come from. 
These guys are thorough professionals and inquired about the food after the delivery. I hope to try out their mahabhoj Thalis soon. Good luck.

Ordered two combo meals for home delivery for supper - alu paratha and dahi, and pulau and chhanar kalia. Delivery was on time. Meals well packed in plastic containers. Taste was okay, nothing to complain about. One suggestion - for a combo like alu paratha and dahi, it is not a good idea that the dahi is packed in the same container with the hot parathas; the dahi was warm and had started getting curdled. Combining two items at sumilar temperature is fine but for those with two extreme temperatures, may be a rethink is necessary.

Ordered a chicken kasha with pulao combo somedays back for lunch. Delivery took around 50 minutes.

Packing was good, food was hot & delicious. Pulao was well prepared & that kasha had 2 good pieces of chicken served with spicy gravy, which went well with the pulao. Quantity was okay for me.

It was an excellent lunch. Never expected it to be that great at that price. That combo was of 189 bucks only. So, this is a great option to have good meal at moderate price range. I am looking forward to try their other items.

I ordered the budget non veg thali which was really delicious and pocket friendly, the chicken was tasty, salad and sabji was spicy. My friends ordered too and they enjoyed the meal. F4U is an awesome place, the combos and thalis are very average and not so expensive.The delivery did not take more than 30mins to reach and service, packaging was a thumbs up!! The person taking the order was very polite and courteous too.

Food delivered withing 25mins.
Awesome food.

A friend of mine recommended me F4U.... I had ordered jeera rice - paneer makhni combo and  basanti pulao - cchanar kalia combo... The delivery was right on time.. And the food was hot... The packaging was so good and the pirce was very affordable.... I totally loved the jeera rice - paneer makhni combo... It was soo much delicious...  The paneer curry was finger-licking good... But i was a bit dissapointed with the basanti puloa - cchanar kalia combo... In the cchanar kalia the salt was so much more than needed... Bt then again the basanti pulao was amazing... 
I have never tried any other bengali cuisine before... F4U is the first... And i'm soon going to try the other items in the menu... Keep it up F4U... 😊

I had a very good first experience with Food4u. I got the food delivered to my office at Camac Street. The delivery was prompt.  The food arrived hot and very neatly packed. We has ordered the Pulao + Chicken Kasha and Pulao + Chhanar Kalia. The taste to my amazement was better than I had expected. The portion size was decent. Overall a good first impression. 
Well done Food4U.

F4U is located stone throw away from my place, very close to Navina Cinema. I ordered through zomato: egg curry & rice combo and chicken curry & rice combo. The delivery was fast, and the food delivered was hot. Now, the egg curry had two eggs, I liked the taste of the gravy even though it was a little bit on the sweeter side. I was disappointed with the chicken curry though. Although the gravy of the chicken was absolutely delicious, the chicken pieces were disappointing. Two pieces of chicken were there, but both of those pieces had more bones and fat rather than the actual meat. But again, the gravy was mind blowing.

I ordered once again from F4U, and this time they met with my expectations. The chhole bhatura was just mindblowing. The chicken kebab thali was brilliant. Great job F4U.

Tried F4U accidentally, just like another food joint, when our house maid decided to take leave. But quite strangely, found the quality and the packaging of food excellent, almost at par with big restaurants. Just started off with Mutton Kosha and Curry, as of now, and they were just awesome! 

Hope to try out their other items soon!

Ordered for 55 packets on account of Saraswati Puja today and the only thing I can say about the food is fabulous. Not only was the food scrumptious but was of the highest quality. It could be easily made out that the oils used were of excellent quality and used in proportion to its requirement. There was absolutely no excess oil in the vegetables or the puris. The food was also very light on the stomach. The packaging was also great with completely sealed lids and microwave reheatable containers. Overall a fantastic experience ordering from them and is highly recommended for anyone desiring excellent quality take away food.

Tried F4U accidentally, just like another food joint, when our house maid decided to take leave. But quite strangely, found the quality and the packaging of food excellent, almost at par with big restaurants. Just started off with Mutton Kosha and Curry, as of now, and they were just awesome! 

Hope to try out their other items soon!

Excellent food for value. More importantly the packaging is clean and attractive at the same time. We ordered from F 4U for our 5day workshop and it was very satisfying to find an Indian food delivery company so professional in their approach, from trading order to delivery. I'd recommend any institution to try F4U.

When we first got to know about this place, We ordered from here in one of our workshops and found the food, pricing and packaging and the service too be very good. Now we ate wrote reluctant to order from this place because we find that they're had been a great deal of price hike and the pricing is not really commensurate with what is offered. So we have actually stopped pressing from here.

Found them on FB, called to find out. They recommended their Festive Platter. Must say the food is superbly packed in a modern 5 portion black tray. Food was delivered quick and it was hot. One platter can be easily shared between 2 people as I couldnt finish half of it in one go. 

This thali had bhetki fry and the fish quality is one of the best I had in long time. Followed by Chicken tikka kebab. Very soft n tasty. Then comes the fried rice and the king of the thali THE MUTTON MASALA. 2 jumbo pcs of soft n juicy mutton. Cnt wait to have specially their mutton again. followed by some salad. This thali is unblvable. Was blown by the food and presentation. super going food for u.

So ordered, their special Bengali Chicken Platter.It had a delicious Pulao, Doi Murgi, Luchi, Chholar Dal and Begun Bhaja. The food was great. Special mention to the Chholar Dal.

After reading such good reviews about this place I decided to give it a try..BIG MISTAKE! 
 I don't know how this got such good reviews!
Firstly, their thali was unavailable which is weird because that's what they seem to be known for and then the food that they sent an hour later was tasteless and dripping with oil!
 Horrible experience!

This super home delivery outlet gets 5 stars from me. I recently ordered Lunch Boxes at my office for a small treat to my colleagues. I saw them on Facebook and ordered North Indian Veg & Non veg Thalis. It came sharp on time, very well packed. When I opened the Meal tray, the food was still hot and had some awesome tasting Dal Makhani, Jeera Rice, Chicken Butter Masala, Parathas - very soft and a big Motichoor ka laddoo. Wow! all of this on my office desk. I loved the food and their service and so did my colleagues. Shall surely order again. Though their prices are slightly higher but its complete value for money.

The packaging was great. I had asked for chicken curry combo. The only thing I enjoyed was the plain basmati rice and the dal. The sabzi was so chilli I thought this wasn't dinner but a world-record breaking chilliest food eating challenge. The chicken curry was terrible. I've never had a chicken curry this salty. Just horrible food. Never ordering from here again unless they give us a nicely prepared delicious free meal to make up for the horrific food last night.

There are a variety of options and you get the authenticated taste of North Indian and Bengali Thalis. The packaging is done with care and every step is taken to maintain the hygiene.

For me every one should taste their food cause it wont disappoint you in any way. 5 stars to this amazing 7 star quality food❤❤❤

My parents enjoy ordering food from this place. Right from the quality, taste and freshness of their food to their prompt delivery n good packaging, they are quite close to being the perfect weekend takeaway joint. They have a good spread of different types of  thalis and other delicacies to choose from. The food is delivered warm and has a homely flavour as it contains an excellent blend of adequate amount of essential spices and oil making the food light and delicious. This is must try joint as you get to experience all these at a very reasonable rate which makes u lazy to cook at home the next time.

Based on Prince Anwarshah road, the joint named  "F4U" provides delivery of home cooked food across the city, which is not only a concept pretty good, but also beneficial for people staying in the city in hostels and PG accomodations. 

The food is  nice, and the packaging is so good, that neither the contents inside mix with each other, nor the food becomes cold and insipid in a short span of time.

A good solution to get nice  home cooked food delivered at your doorstep in need. 
Nice initiative :-)
Happy eating!!

Tried out their ilish special delicacies. It was wonderful specially the ilish sorshe thali consisting of sorshe ilish, ilish bhaja, ilish chorchori and rosagulla. The sorshe ilish was tender and succulent. Ilish bhapa was delicious. Begun diye ilish was also good. However the ilish paturi was over fried and slightly burnt. Apart from this everything was good. The thali was the best. Ilish chorchori in it was really nice.

Have ordered from this place twice in the months of March and April this year.

Didn't like the experience in the first instance at all. The person taking the order was not proactive in sharing all available options.I had to pester him regarding the various Thalis that the place advertises in it's menu.Anyways,settled for the Special Non Veg Thali. It took a lot of time for the food to arrive though the same was mentioned while placing the order. However,the reason mentioned was funny and weird.He claimed that they prepare everything fresh.For me that's illogical and unacceptable because if an outlet prepares meals for Thalis after order placement then they should shut shop. Coming to the food, the taste of everything was below average and not enjoyable.There were 3 rotis provided with each Thali which was just not edible since they were so thick and tough.

In the second instance we opted for Combo Thali of Rajma+Rice+Curd and Chicken Curry+Rice.

Combo of Rajma was better than the Thali but lacked spiciness and was on the sweeter side.

Combo of Chicken was edible but had nothing which would prompt me to order again.

For a house party I ordered from F4U. I found their menu to be simple and pocket friendly. We ordered for Mahabhoj Thali which has Pulao, Mutton, Chingri Malai Currry, aloor Dum and rossogolla, Luchi. Food was excellent and quantity was more than enough. also tried their Pabda Shorshe. Their food is really good and will recommend it to anyone who wants to try good bengali food.

I  heard about it from my brother and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed with the quality of their food items. Well cooked homely food with good taste. Some of the meat dishes are a bit on the spicier side than required, but that can be ignored based on one's requirement. The home delivered luchis are really good compared to the luchis(home delivered) of many of the well known Bengali restaurants in the city.

Items tried - Basanti Pulao, Luchi, Muton Kasha, Chicken Kasha, Chaanaar Dalna 

F4U's business idea is a good one, especially for a bachelor like me who often has cravings for Luchi and Maangsho

During my recent visit to Kolkatta .. my colleague ordered food during Business lunch  meeting and I am not huge fan of take away food because it's usually not fresh and hot. But this F4U has changed my mind. Even it was package food, it was very well presented in quality package material and hence was hot and tasty. Felt it's worth it for what you pay. Good job team F4U and especially chefs !!

I  heard about it from my brother and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed with the quality of their food items. Well cooked homely food with good taste. Some of the meat dishes are a bit on the spicier side than required, but that can be ignored based on one's requirement. The home delivered luchis are really good compared to the luchis(home delivered) of many of the well known Bengali restaurants in the city.

Items tried - Basanti Pulao, Luchi, Muton Kasha, Chicken Kasha, Chaanaar Dalna 

F4U's business idea is a good one, especially for a bachelor like me who often has cravings for Luchi and Maangsho

During my recent visit to Kolkatta .. my colleague ordered food during Business lunch  meeting and I am not huge fan of take away food because it's usually not fresh and hot. But this F4U has changed my mind. Even it was package food, it was very well presented in quality package material and hence was hot and tasty. Felt it's worth it for what you pay. Good job team F4U and especially chefs !!

Last Sunday ordered home delivery from F4U. Pulao, Mutton Kasha, Chingri Malai, Luchi, Aloo Dum, Rossogolla all in one black food tray. Amazing presentation. Never saw any home delivery presenting food in such amazing style. The experience was very good starting from the order placement, communication, food delivery on time and ultimately the fresh and hot food. Will order whenever I feel like having bengali food.

One good thing which has happened due to competition in market is that the minimum value for home delivery has vanished. I ordered a single plate of special non veg thali.. Cost Rs190/-. A full course. Dal was good.. Bhindi subji .. Ok.. Chicken was very good.. 2 good pieces and very balanced spicy gravy.. Roti , I thought could have been better.. They gave 3 thick chapatis .. Pulao was ordinary. Chutney, raita and salad was also there. I couldn't complete the whole plate. Good part is the meal was served hot. I will keep trying more...

Recently during a family gathering I happened to order food from F4U. I got their information from a sms sent to my mobile and decided to try it out. I am a retired man and do not explore much. But I was pleasantly surprised by their food quality and the neat packaging in which the food was delivered. i ordered for their Bengalir Priyo Platter which had a traditional pulao, chicken, fish, luchi, aloo dum, rosogolla. Very good taste and light food. even my grandchildren enjoyed. Will surely order again to try some of their fish delicacies.

Today is the first time ,I ordered from this resturant . I ordered a "bangalir priyo platter"

Content was pretty impressive : luchi,kasha mangsho,alurdom,  polao, dohi mach, roshogolla  (2 pcs). And cost including packaging was Rs 285/-

I am pretty satisfied with their contents .
I really like the taste of kasha mangso (chiken), absolutely not over spicy, exactly the taste I look for, pieces was if decent size too. Polau and alurdom  was also had right taste. But I was little disappointed with dohi mach.  But overall , good.

Packing and delivery is was good and was in time.


My overall rating was good. I should try some more of there preparation.

" Ordered Biryani & Chicken Chaap platter and A Holi Special Veg Platter. The food tasted really great and the packaging was very convenient. The quantity and quality of Mutton and Chicken was huge. I could actually share. And the Veg platter was a delight with Dahi wada, Kachori, Paneer Makhani and lots more. Made my Holi special. Surely recommend. And special mention for the timely delivery in a day like Today. "

IF YOU PEOPLE CALL YOURSELF PREMIUM DELIVERY SERVICE THEN YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.
What ordered was festive platter  consisting mutton biryani n chicken chaap plus luchi n alur dom. The festive platter was horrible. Worst tasting biryani, too much kewra. The chicken was just foul tasting not chaap.Luchi was pappadam.Alur dom good.  They only deliver but you pay for delivery (Rs 30) plus packing charges(Rs 20). Amazing.
Need to think many times before you re order or recommend someone.

Over priced is the first thing that popped in my mind while unwrapping the thali. Rs 190 for non veg thali is too much. The quantity and the quality both left a lot to desire. 

My office is at Salk Lake Sector V and I frequently order from Dietbox. They offer the same thali at much lesser price. Ok, I admit they don't include polau in the thali. But, for the polau paying Rs 90 extra, seemed like a foolishness. 

The chicken was dry. I kept spooning the box in futile attempt to find gravy to go with the rotis. Same goes for daal as well. The last roti I had to finish with curd. Over all a bad experience.

It was a memorable experience at F4U. We had ordered for lunch at our office. The communication is excellent, timeliness even. 
Now coming to the food. I was a bit tensed when all started having it but was happy to see the satisfied faces on liking it. It was my first time even and they have kept my word. Thanks! Quantity is good for office lunch, fresh cooked food and prices are also affordable. Lastly, I loved it. I recommend for small lunch & dinner parties at office or home.

I've ordered Festive Platter during one Puja day. Delivery is perfectly on time. Packing is nice and impressive. Now comes the main part, the Food. There were Luchi, Pulao, Chhanar Dalna, Chingri Malai , Mutton, Chatney and last, not the elast, Rosogolla. Pulao was lite and tasty , so as the Chingri preparation. What I feel is must to mention about Chhanar Dalna & Mutton. Chhana's pieces are so soft just like it cooked at home, normally it's not so common to get such puffiness in Chhanar Dalna when it comes from Restaurants. Mutton was also very scrumptious. Chatney (Khejur, Aamsottwo)  was also awesome and my daughter just loved it. I am highly recommending F4U to my relatives and friends.  I wish all the very best to F4U team

Paratha basket included two onion parathas,2 paneer parathas,2 dal parathas,which melted as soon as i took one bite.A big thumbs up to the Food for u team for making their customer's taste buds happy :)
The fresh dahi and pudina chutney along with the parathas ,was like a feather on the hat.
The paneer makhani was also yummy,but pls try using lesser oil :)
Keep up the good work.Looking forward for making more orders from this place. :)

I ordered the paratha basket and paneer makhani.The packaging for delivery was very neat and food was piping hot when delivered, which is one of the best thing about this eatery.
Paratha basket included two onion parathas,2 paneer parathas,2 dal parathas,which melted as soon as i took one bite.A big thumbs up to the Food for u team for making their customer's taste buds happy :)
The fresh dahi and pudina chutney along with the parathas ,was like a feather on the hat.
The paneer makhani was also yummy,but pls try using lesser oil :)
Keep up the good work.Looking forward for making more orders from this place. :)

F4U has been a boon to me ! Being a working lady, availability of proper home cooked meal was always a concern. With the emergence of F4U I have been saved. Excellent home style food, perfect corporate lunches and to top it off the smooth delivery. Kudos to the entire team for the excellent service; keep up the great job :-) !!!

Heard from friends and ordered dinner with apprehension as i had a bitter experience in past with another home delivery.
This one, Undoubtedly is the best Kasha i had eaten. Such freshness in taste and hygiene is rare to find in home deliveries these days. Best part is the speed of delivery-prompt as promised. As per price quotient, very reasonable and excellent value for money. My fav so far in Packed food.

So the cook was cooking terrible food at home and I decided to get home delivery since I was fed up with bland food. Maa suggested this place seeing a pamphlet dropped off at our letter box and I thought to myself "there goes another chance to have yummy food". Little I knew the food was going to be so awesome. I am breastfeeding two infants so I can't really have much spicy food so I had pasta in mind but this was soooo much better than the bland food I was hoping to have. Its a fresh delight to have home made mutton curry, daal and cauliflower sabji w /o actually making it at home. Its tasty and wholesome.  Rotis (finally) were naram n garam!! Special mention to chicken kosha.. I loved it. Both the meats were soft and scrumptious.  Much to my happy taste buds they added a chutney (yummy I tell) and a rasgolla which I had after the longest time since I wasn't allowed sweets. 
If u r hungry and craving for mummy's-feel-good-food order from here! You won't be disappointed with the meat atleast. Plus its winter which bong wouldn't like a little spicy mutton curry and rice? Also a bug thumbs up to ur packaging. Its extremely impressive how you all have kept in mind customers satisfaction when it comes to carrying out food.
Highly recommended and I might actually try their veg food again this weekend. 
Only one suggestion : Please do not include Chinese n Momo in your menu. Nowadays its available in paan shops also it seems :p ;)

For the last couple of months, Jadavpur-PA Shah-Lake Town area welcomed new additions to its culinary High Street and notable amongst them - Shawarma Nation, Tamarind, Little India, Hillsa, Zest Restora, etc...F4U is the latest grand addition to the current culinary opera & probably amongst the best Bong food experience to hit the Jadavpur side of the town. I have been ordering regularly from F4U for the last 3 months for my entire Kolkata staff & happy to say that the overall experience has been really satiating. 

The Mini Thalis both Veg & Non-Veg are great delights. The Veg items - Rajma, Chhole, Cauliflower, Soyabean Sabji, Special Pulaos are really special and this is one place where I find the owner is always happy to incorporate your new suggestions like Dhone Paatar Bora. The Maccher Dimer Bora is as good as the homemade one. 

Rudro, the energetic proprietor cum hands-on manager ensures that the food & the ingredients are always fresh and serves his customers with a cheerful smile on his face. I would be more happy to see some more Fish additions to the Menu like Bhetki, Papda as I prefer Fish with few bones.

I am looking forward to F4Us success...and more signature dishes!!!

Tasty, delicious, professional with a touch of homemade spices. Dont forget to try the different stuffed parathas with the traditional kosha mangsho. Just brilliant! A thorough professional yet simple door to door service. A much needed venture in the Kolkata foodhub!

hi everybody, this is Sujit mondal... In my recent visit to Kolkata I tried F4U. I loved their food taste & quality. I was amazed at the presentation and the concept. First and the only professional home delivery service. Taste is absolutely home style and you feel home away home. I recommend anyone travelling to kolkata and want a home style food that to proper quality should call F4U and order.

I would order whenever I am in Kolkata.

Well as the name suggests, Food for U. The taste of their dishes really complements the name. Its absolutely a unique home delivery foodhouse. Tasty, delicious, professional with a touch of homemade spices. Dont forget to try the different stuffed parathas with the traditional kosha mangsho. Just brilliant! A thorough professional yet simple door to door service. A much needed venture in the Kolkata foodhub!

hi everybody, this is Sujit mondal... In my recent visit to Kolkata I tried F4U. I loved their food taste & quality. I was amazed at the presentation and the concept. First and the only professional home delivery service. Taste is absolutely home style and you feel home away home. I recommend anyone travelling to kolkata and want a home style food that to proper quality should call F4U and order.

I would order whenever I am in Kolkata.

F4u delivers healthy, fresh food at reasonable prices. I no longer need to worry about my daily meals as f4u has taken away my worries. The veg thali and non veg thali are brilliant and have quite a lot of variety. Even the chicken prep and mutton is tasty fresh and tender. Everyone should try out this new place. All the dishes are just awesome...

This place has completely changed my perception about outisde food. The food is healthy and tasty. They make it exactly like I want. Its fresh as they cook it only after the order had been placed. If you are concerned about your health and quality of food you consume go for it.

To start with, f4u is all about yummy food delivered at your doorstep at a very reasonable price. The best part is it's freshly cooked and can be consumed on a daily basis! I just love the pulao, mutton kasa, chicken kasa, Chanar dalna... The quality and quantity both are great and I highly recommend it to all..:D TRY IT GUYS!!
