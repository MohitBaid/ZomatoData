I orderd paneer chilli and it was tasteless. It was not upto the expectations. I have never had such a horrible and tasteless paneer chilli. Sorry to say this but it was horrible and i think i have wasted my money in this paneer chilli

Used to be a regular here, my office being located on Theatre road. Nothing more than the Kitchen, Billing counter and a couple of Stools and Chairs. But the quality of food is top notch. The Egg Chicken rice is great so are the rolls. Recommended for a quick lunch or an evening snack !

Basically a road side stall with few chairs. But let me tell you, don't judge the book by its cover. Basically im a regular customer of this joint as its just opp to my clg. Things u must try, chicken chow which comes with a heap of chicken pieces, mutton tikiya roll will melt in your mouth, the paratha/fried rice & chilli chicken combo is best for lunch. They will serve the food within 15-20 mins. The dishes are too cheap & lot tasty & one more thing, the kebabs are actually fried chicken in disguise ;) (try @ ur own risk)
P.S. - Dont confuse the shop, there is one more shop beside that.

Been here a few times. Last time went for Chicken Roll and a Mutton Tikia Roll. The items were good but a bit too oily.
Go for it , if you have no other alternative.
