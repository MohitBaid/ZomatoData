Tea Trove is not just about tea,
But is a story in itself.

From hundreds of flavours to choose from,tea trove is a wallpaper for tea lovers and the experimentation is text book stuff.

It's not only about the DRINK called "Tea", but is about the taste of tea is infused into other food items like ice cream.

Their Ice-Creams are fantastic.

 Moroccan mint
Jasmine tea
Peach tea
Gulabo tea
Mango green
Irani chai
Assam masala
Tripple berry
Nutella kitkat
Popwich treramusu
Popwich strawberry

As a big tea freak this place was a must try place for me. I tried the lavender bliss Rose delight and Orange cinnamon. But the experience was really disappointed for me because I didn't like their teas except The orange cinnamon. That could be because I don't prefer such flavoured tea. But  if someone wants to experiment with such a flavoured tea they can try their teas.

Nice place.Perfect for hangout.They didn't serve Sorbet the day we went,that's a shame.Its off-putting to not be able to try out items put in their menu.
Should try this joint out if you love tea,it's menu has extensive variants of tea! We didn't try any ,though.
May come back again for their gelato and that lounging area and offcourse the Shisha....

This outlet of The Tea Trove is located inside Spencer's of South City Mall in Prince Anwar Shah Road just opposite to the outlets of Wow! Momo and Tea Junction. I felt tea lovers would love this place. Coffee lovers like me would not prefer this place as I felt the items were a bit expensive but when one does get a free coupon, one does not waste it. So I hopped into the place. We had a couple of Iced Darjeeling Tea. It had the brilliant aroma of Darjeeling Tea and the outlet has a large number of varieties as well. I loved the glass bottle in which the tea was served which I got to keep after the drink. The service was quite prompt as well and we did not have to wait too long before we were served. It just may be an ideal place for one to have a long chat with nothing much to have.

Was just scrolling down the Zomato app few months back that I bumped on to an offer from Tea Trove and thus wanted to order the newly launched popsicles...

I ordered 1 Kiwi, 1 Mango, 1 Chocolate Praline and 1 Watermelon Mint Popsicle..

After a whole lot of delay and harrassment from the zomato delivery executive, finally got the popsicles delivered but they were in half molten state...I really wonder how zomato sent the delivery executive to deliver the icecream sticks to the customers without proper adequate means to carry them...the delivery man came just in a bike without any carrier attached where he could keep those icecreams sticks not to get them deformed...on asking such, the man replied that zomato do not provide such to them and thus we customers should complain on their behalf to the app...I also uploaded a picture on Tea Trove's site where a lady from this shop answered that the popsicles were handed over to the delivery man in the right and sturdy state from the counter and thus unaware why I received them in such state..

Anyway coming to the icecream sticks, all of the 4 popsicles tasted good even though priced too much for its quality and worth...

Really hope next time onwards I do not get to have molten popsicles if ordered via zomato..

The Tea Trove is the one of the coziest places to have drinks and a chat with close friends. I usually get the Hot Oolong tea and have yet to be disappointed whenever I order it. Even my friends who are not big fans of tea say that Tea Trove is the exception to the rule. Excellent cafe that everyone should visit.

The Tea Trove started with cafes and now shifted to kiosks inside malls. Tea trove after moving from cafe concept came up with idea of popsicles, shakes and ice teas. There are a lot of separate Tea and even Kettles for sale about which not much people are aware about. The main thing which i really appreciate is that they keep trying different things all the time. It was evening time when i decided to visit them with around 7-10 bloggers here. We were served a lot of stuffs (Varieties of Popsicles, Ice Teas and Shakes) which also included sharing a bit of insight of Tea. One can visit this website and even order their products online:

Blueberry Cheesecake Popsicle @ The Tea Trove, Kolkata ☺

Event: The Bohemian Souk by Midnight Prink

Date: 24 - 25 March 2017

Old age artificial color and flavor filled stick ice-creams have given way to modern age natural and fruit rich popsicles, that are a treat to both eyes and tongue.

Made of blueberry fruit puree and a concoction of cheesecake, this purple-red hued Blueberry Cheesecake Popsicle was a revelation in taste. It was sweet, tangy, slightly chewy from inside and at the same time quite filling.

Also, there was no mess in terms of coloring of hands or falling off of popsicle chunks.

Want to beat the heat? Go and grab one for yourself. Triple Berry was another flavor that looked quite promising.

Price: Rs. 80/-

Note: The Tea Trove had a stall at the aforesaid lifestyle exhibition. This popsicle was purchased there.

Well, it's getting hot (now!!) and will soon get even hotter. So, in this sultry weather, the need to cool down increases​!

But The Tea Trove has able to mark its place in a cozy corner with such a beautiful cool decoration. They have managed to put all things in place adequately to display their all products.

The Tea Trove is one place where I really  missed not taking my children.  The thick shakes like the Oreo shakes or the Mango macha shake or the rollicking popsicles just begged to be had. The Double Berry , the blueberry or the Blueberry cheesecake popsicle has made me go back for more and will keep me going back for more. I just hope that they open up more outlets so that going to south city mall doesn't become mandated. 
The Tea selection is good. There are teas which you can bring back home and savour. Like the Rose Oolong Tea. The white tea etc. What they can offer is a subtle mix of iced teas, guaranteed to leave you completely refreshed after a hard days work. I personally loved the Rose Delight having a mix of rose Oolong along with white tea or the Lavender Bliss. I have suggested the popsicles since then to many a friend and will keep doing so cause at Rs. 60... the popsicles are an absolute steal!
 I will come back as the Celsius soars.

Tried an array of teas. Learnt quite a few things about our different variants of tea. Their thick shakes are indeed promising. T3 brought about  revolution with their popsicles. They have introduced quite a few flavours! A lovely experience.

This outlet of The Tea Trove is located within the Spencer's food court of South City Mall. It's well decorated. You can get a huge variety of teas, hot and cold brewed. You can also buy tea leaves from here. Their various flavours are nice,innovative, and a steal at 20rs a cup. I have tried their Sweet Ginger and Rose Delight flavours. Both were good. They also sell popsicles of different unique flavours. Tried the Paan flavour. It tasted exactly like a paan should! Thumbs up to The Tea Trove.

A very new unique and different experience. For those who have special interest in tea flavors, this place is like heaven. They come up with uncommonly customized tea flavors and frozen fruit juice sticks. I visited this joint very recently. Two very friendly guys were extremely helpful in explaining what they offer. We ordered a single cup of black tea, second flush. It was surprising to see the way they prepared it ensuring utmost accuracy in the boiling duration. The flavor was excellent. Would like to visit this simple joint again. Note, this join is a small one with no sitting arrangement. If you want to have a cup of tea, you have to have it standing. I liked it that way! Reminded me my university days. :)

Located at Spencer's in South City Mall. I had heard recommendations from a lot of friends about the ice cream pop sticks from here. 

The tea infusions are also remarkable.
I tried the chocolate praline pop
The pan pop
The Moroccan mint
And blue berry cheese cake.

Superb is the word. Natural, low on sugar content and perfectly tasty and refreshing. Can't wait to go again and try new flavours.

The paan one was specially outstanding. The chocolate praline one could have little more praline. 

Can't wait to revisit.

Popsicle lovers, do give a visit to this place. It is located at the basement of South City inside Spencer's. Popsicles are a new addition which have a lot of flavours. Apart from that you get bottled ice teas of unique flavours and others. 
I solely went there to try the much hyped popsicle and tried up the KIWI flavour( it was made of fresh fruit and no artificial flavours were added.)
Price is okayish. I loved what I tried and looking forward to try the rest.

The splendid flavorful aroma of tea, and a long line of customers waiting to collect their complimentary cups of pure bliss - in the form of Darjeeling Muscatel Black Tea, is what greeted me when I stepped into The Tea Trove. As the new 'kid on the block' at Spencer's Retail, South City Mall, the 8th outlet of The Tea Trove has started off with a bang and is offering a whole lot of unique items such as the huge range of yummy tea infused popsicles, 4 variants of amazing cold brewed tea that is heaven when compared to any regular ice tea and a trio of healthy snacks for the fit, the-not-so-fit and the wanna-be-fit. I could not stop myself from trying out 2 of the cold brew teas - moroccon mint and fruit gatuau both of which were as smooth as...(premium aged beer?) and as refreshing and rejunivating on the palate as...(a cold breeze on a sweltering hot day?). Both the mint and the fruit essence were blended into the tea in just the right quantity, providing little bursts of flavour as I drank the tea. The popsicles ofcourse could not be ignored and I have gorged on both sorbet pops and gelato pops on another occasion, and I must say, the Chocolate Praline flavour is so divine and good, it ought to be knighted! I also picked up one of each of the munchies - Fig and Chocolate Cookies, Rosemary Chilli Almonds and Honey Roasted Walnuts simply because they seemed so out-of-the-box. And I must say they turned out to taste as magnificent as they sound. All the while, I couldn't help overhearing compliment after compliment about the authentic hot tea variants - the black tea, the green tea, the oolong tea, the herbal tea, that were being sampled by ever so many customers. A lot of people even swore that it was the best tea they ever had! It was overall a very good experience vising The Tea Trove, and I say experience, since you simply cannot miss the tall and friendly brand ambassador, Abhishek, who personally overlooks his employees in the evenings and is kind enough to give you a little guided and highly informative tour of his magical shop. An absolute Fabulous Fiver rating from me!

The Tea Trove is one of the best place for tea. I have tried 3-4 of their flavors, based on the recommendation of one of their staff and each of them tastes just brilliant.
I think Citrus Lavender amd the Tulsi Lemon blast was the best I had. Tasted just wonderful.
I haven't tasted their Cookies or other Snacks so don't know anything about them. But you must visit this place for Tea, that too for just Rs.20 a cup.
Excellent !!

The Tea Trove is your one reliable source of purchasing all sorts of teas, iced, chilled, and thoroughly brewed.

I had ordered their Cold Brewed Moroccoan Tea. It came in a glass bottle, sealed. The drink was refreshing. It was not overwhelmingly sweet. It had a hit of freshness to it and was actually quite soothing to have.

The staff here are polite and have fast set of hands. Plus, they give discounts upon registration of your phone number. Go Tea Trove!

Popsicle lovers, do give a visit to this place. It is located at the basement of South City inside Spencer's. Popsicles are a new addition which have a lot of flavours. Apart from that you get bottled ice teas of unique flavours and others. 
I solely went there to try the much hyped popsicle and tried up the KIWI flavour( it was made of fresh fruit and no artificial flavours were added.)
Price is okayish. I loved what I tried and looking forward to try the rest.

Located in the South city Basement food court. This was my ever try to this outlet and to this brand as well. came to this place with some of my friends while shopping. Tried some of their Ice teas in forms of Lavender as well as Mix fruit. No doubt it tasted very amazing and my first try here seemed quite fantastic. Cheers to Tea Trove.

The splendid flavorful aroma of tea, and a long line of customers waiting to collect their complimentary cups of pure bliss - in the form of Darjeeling Muscatel Black Tea, is what greeted me when I stepped into The Tea Trove.

Tea Trove has opened its new counter at the Spencer’s in South City Mall and what a delightful fact it is. I tried their iced teas today. The two varieties that caught my attention and pleaded to serve as refreshment were the Fruit Gateau and the Moroccan mint. Both the iced teas were extremely refreshing and the fact that they mere not aggressively sweetened is a plus. 

Both the varieties succeed in establishing the health and flavor factor that it has aimed to achieve. While the Fruit Gateau was lovely, the Moroccan mint wasn't disappointing either. If you are looking for refreshment, while grocery shopping and do not want to boost the sugar level in your body or pour overly sweetened beverages in your body, resulting in calorie gain, you can always settle for one of these.

They also serve Tea Ice Popsicles, looking forward to try them soon.

Orange cinammon tea was refreshing. 
Paan and watermelon mint ice cream stick was awesome. 
It was rs 50.
Tea price is rs 20 and 60.
Value for money. 
Staffs were welcoming and well behaved. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
A good small outlet. 
It's opposite to wow momo inside Spencer's south city mall.

Hello fellas! How are you guys doing? So the weekend is about to come. Must have quite a lot of plans on the go, right? Same here. Amongst all your plans this weekend, don’t forget to check out the newest outlet of The Tea Trove in the city which had opened up just a week back in the Spencers’ food court of South City Mall. This is the eighth outlet of The Tea Trove in Kolkata. The Tea Trove, rather the theteatrove.com has been quite a popular name by now for its online sale of tea directly from the cultivators of Darjeeling and Assam. Not only sticking to this, The Tea Trove has now been open to its customers to enrich them with an amazing tea experience and also a healthy snack experience along with.
                                                                ...

With this Tea Trove opens up its eighth outlet in the city, & south city Spencer’s gets it newest feather in the cap.
Personally I find the Spencer’s food court better in comparison to the mall food court (partly due to the fact that you can sit here without being disturbed by the security even if you are not eating anything. & Partly due to the fact that the narrow corridor nature gives it a marketplace feel). With the tea trove opening up it would be an added bonus.
This outlet doesn’t only sell hot brew teas & the tea infused ice lollies. They also stock the two items they have introduced recently.
                                                                ...

Located at the basement -spencers food court of South city mall this is the new brand of the Tea Trove franchise. This small outlet packs a big punch.This outlets deals mostly in Teas (Hot & Cold both) and Herbs along with munchies. So if you want to have a quick nip and a small nibble this is the place.Best part is the modular section where herbs are kept with details about their qualities written thus one can choose oneself rather being puzzled.Also the staff is fab ,communicated and polite. One gets a quite bit of varieties in the munchies section aswl and going to herbs you'll be spoilt for choice as to the choices on offer . Going to cold teas they've the perfect ones in a bottle ,you can sip on it or perfect takeaway if you are on the go. As for the herbs one should go as per taste and needs concerned as each has their own distinct quality Go to cold ones I recommend Moroccan Mint & Fruit Gateau . In Teas I always go for the my fab Darjeeling Black tea  beneficial for its catechins and flavonoids. In cookies I would suggest Honey roasted Fruit & Nuts  along with Chocolate Walnut Munchies. This is surely a must visit for all TEA LOVERS and yes the pricing is very much easy of the pocket considering the variety and quality on offer.
