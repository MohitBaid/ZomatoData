Located in the heart of Beleghata , 5 mins away from my place, near Beleghata Trikon Park , This place serves amazing Moghlai Dishes as well as Chinese . They have a small seating area as well ,but preferably do order at your own place. 

WHAT I ORDERED : 

1.CHICKEN CHOWMEIN 
2.CHILLI CHICKEN 
3.FISH KABIRAJI 

Was overall happy with the food. Do try . Reasonable as well.

Did not quite like the food. Things are a bit expensive considering other options nearby. Had ordered hakka chicken chowmein.... neither quality nor the quantity was upto the mark.

Just a stone's throw away from my home, I happen to be a frequent customer... The mixed gravy noodles are just mind blowing, and so is manchurian chicken to go along with it... They also have a pretty decent outdoor seating arrangement that can accommodate smallish groups of college goers on the lookout for some moderately priced chinese food... 
Though touted as a chinese fast food plaza, their egg chicken tikka kabab rolls are top notch as well... They offer free home delivery as well within a certain radius... All in all, a decent chinese joint where the rolls are an added bonus...

Taste is good here. Opposite of trikon park at beliaghata. Have visited so many time. But the price is very high here. Ambience 2/5. Food quality 3.5/5
Momos are awesome here.

This small eatery cum take-away counter is situated at a stone's throw from my house, just opposite the beliaghata trikon park.
I have been fond of their items for a larger part of my life, be it rolls, noodles, fried rice, momo, or lollipops...
They cook a delicacy, that I often bring back home for my entire family.., its a special 'gravy chicken noodles', which is actually very light and healthy to have.
This place continues to be a favourite spot for localites, to catch a quick bite in the busy evenings.
