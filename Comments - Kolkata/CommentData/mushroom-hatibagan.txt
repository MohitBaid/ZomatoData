We ordered food from Mushroom on 1st January. The food was completely stale and pathetic. The chicken pieces were rubbery and tasteless.
Horrible experience. Will not recommend anyone to visit or order from here.

Mushroom has room for improvement. Egg chilli garlic chowmein, mixed fried rice and sweet and sour chicken was a big time disappointment. Poor service of the staff. Horrible interiors. What's with the lights, seriously?

P.S..The green salad was good ( Thank God they couldn't spoil it)

Starting from ambience to food, the place is very disappointing. Food is average. I found a bit over priced. Quality needs to improved. Wish all the luck to Mushroom.

Let me come straight to the point
*If it's tandoori items it's gotta be mushroom*
They serve the best chicken tandoori, Reshmi kebabs, tangri kebabs..
Whenever I am craving for kebabs I don't stop on any other places..
It's just situated alongside of the hedua swimming club on beadon st..
Ask anyone in the area and even a child of that area will give you the location it's that famous..
Talking about food it's good..
They even have the Chinese option which is very good..
The must try items are their kebabs and chilly fish dry..
The food may take a while to be served as the service is a bit slow..
Not that spacious but 4 families can be seated properly..
All together a nice place and good food..

Found their tangri kebab to be a little dry but their moghlai gravys are too good. I love their chicken bharta, they give it a unique punjabi tadka which makes the bharta delicious. This restaurant is quite old but is still serves good food. Will be back to try more of their dishes. 

Edit: Another day I ordered their chicken butter masala and bharta together from swiggy and found they use the exact same gravy for both of them! The taste was good but still that's simply not done.

If you are on a budget and need air-conditioning then try here. But if you want to have good food then go next door! Coz food is just about edible,  service is self driven, and the ambience as Chandler would say "Could it BE any darker and cockroach infested!"

This restaurant is a 5min walk from my place. But considering the rating on Zomato I had always avoided this place until recently. The quantity as well as quality is quite satisfactory. Besides it's quite affordable too. If you're looking for a place for either north indian or Chinese food in North Kolkata, this place is worth a try!

Have been visiting this place since childhood. It 5mins from my house & serves decent chinese food. The competition however has increased a lot nowadays with many restaurants opening nearby. Quantity is good for all the dishes and taste is also good but prices have increased leaps and bounds in the near past which is not justified. Not much Indian dishes on the menu to try but the Tandoori Chicken is their best seller. For the Chinese, the chopseuy should not be missed.

Pocket friendly, ambience is not so good, space crunch is there. This is an old North Calcutta restaurant with that power of serving both Chinese and North Indian. Among the North Indians I prefer only the kebabs and Tandooris and among the Chinese the Hakka Noodles and Schezwan Chicken is worth a taste. Overall average

I cannot help being a little biased towards Mushroom; with my grandparents living in this region, my earliest memories of sitting in a restaurant are all associated with this restaurant. And it hasn't changed at all - the same old decor, the same poster on the way from the first floor, the same walls and fans and lights. Even the food hasn't changed; having said that, I think it's important to mention that the food is in dire need of change. They have a distinctive flavour, but they really need to up their game. The sides are pretty ordinary, the rice preparations need better quality, longer rice. The food is nice, nonetheless, but there's something off about it - probably because they haven't done anything new to their menu in a very long time. The service needs to be better and faster, the staff needs to be more efficient. The menu needs an upgrade. In fact, my ranking is majorly an emotional generosity. Still, there's something warm, comfortable and familiar about Mushroom and it's food, and I'll probably return, again and again, for that.

Mushroom Restaurant  near Hatibagan has always topped the rest regarding reasonably priced food items. Comfortable ambience with well maintained decorum has always attracted mass so has Mushroom. Coming to issue concerned that is food, chicken sweet corn soup will surely treat the taste buds amazingly, age old famous dish of chilli chicken is well cooked over here so one can go for that. While schezwan chicken along with mixed noodles is also another option to go for. Well for Mutton freak folks, Mutton Korma goes without saying.

Although an important time of Scottish school life was revolved around this place,but mushroom is not a restaurant that you should visit to have a moderate food. Its food is very similar to any good roadside take away. The restaurant itself has no pomp and show,kind of dull in nature. The food tasted spiceless and dull. And belief me I better spent my hard earned money on something else. Gloomy in nature and ambiance you won't feel hearty eating here. So neither its food nor its good position just opposite to hedua swimming pool is able to earn this restaurant a good clientele.

This obviously ain't a place you plan and visit. Similar to any other neighbourhood restaurant, when you feel like eating out all of a sudden and do not wish to spend too much, these are the places you choose. The food isn't anything great, but when eating out is all that matters, it passes as just fine.

Located beside the hedua park,it is a small restaurant that needs to improve a lot both in ambience and food quality. Its cheap no doubt,but when, with a little more bucks one gets good food and ambience at blossoms,I doubt anyone would ever want to visit this place.We had ordered chicken tikka masala and a friend has ordered Chinese. We were left highly disappointed. I'll certainly not recommend this place to anyone.

Mushroom is a very ordinary restaurant located at Hedua adjacent to the Scottish Church College. Once you enter & go up, you'll notice how cramped it is. A severe space crunch & a claustrophobic atmosphere is the only basic problem associated with this place. To add to your miseries, they don't have a washroom! This restaurant has minimal decorum & is also not well-lighted. But when it comes to food, this is the preferred place for college goers. And why not? They charge you minimal & serve you good food. I love the chicken fried rice & szechuan chicken here. Sweet & sour chicken is not bad either. Go for the tandooris. They are really good. The moghlai dishes like chicken butter masala & chicken bharta are always beautifully done. The chopsuey & hakka chowmein are moderate. The service is prompt and proportions served are good enough. They charge you low, I think that's a thumbs up for this place which makes it a popular eatery at Hedua. One can hit Mushroom if not for ambience, but for good food definitely.

First things first, it's not near college street. It's in hedua. 
How did I first visit this place? Well, the adjoining blossom was packed to its gills and I did not fancy waiting for half an hour to get my turn. 
Mushroom is a very cramped restaurant. So for those of you claustrophobic individuals, don't even think of entering this place. 
The prices are absolutely is sync with the locality where inexpensive dining is the norm. 
Coming to the food, the place really excels in Indian and Tandoori cuisine and the pocket pinch being minimal is a favourite of the college goers. 
Tandoori chicken, tandoori roti and chicken side dish highly recommended.

Located beside the hedua park,it is a small restaurant that needs to improve a lot both in ambience and food quality. Its cheap no doubt,but when, with a little more bucks one gets good food and ambience at blossoms,I doubt anyone would ever want to visit this place.We had ordered chicken tikka masala and a friend has ordered Chinese. We were left highly disappointed. I'll certainly not recommend this place to anyone.

while we went to the main campus of c.u..while returning decided to have some chinese at mushroom..its is just beside the hedua park near scottish church college..it is a nice place..

we ordered for chicken hakka noodles ,chicken chow chow rice..crispy chicken and manchurian chicken ..noodles is good but the rice is not good..crispy chicken is tasty and even chicken manchurian was delicious..

overall a nice place which serves good chinese food would try their tandoor part the next time i visit..service is good..price is pocket friendly and including taxes..!!

When i's in college, i was a frequent goer of this place. The only reason was cheap priced menu. What we mainly ordered were chili or crispy or manchurian or garlic or sweet n sour chicken , mixed rice or chicken or egg or prawn chicken fried rice n butter naan. All were moderate in  both taste n quantity. But they were not consistent. Once we went there and came to know that no rice item would be available then n we need to wait for 20 mins. As  we were returning home , it was okay with us. But what disappointed us was that they served half boiled rice fried with chicken n shelled prawn...! That was pretty annoying..! Otherwise pocket friendly place to hang out with friends..! But when it's time for food don't expect much..!



One more thing, they do not charge extra taxes, all menu prices are including taxes....!

When ever it was a birthday treat at Scottish it would definitely be mushroom. Since no extra tax was levied on the bill. Tasty food. Both the tandoori and the Chinese being equally tasty. I loved the chilli garlic pepper chicken.. the dry chilli chicken. Or evn the noodles were great. Strictly for college goers.

Lack of space and a little crumpy.Nonetheless, the ambience is spine flavoured.Service and food is good.The lack of space is perfectly made up for by the quality of food.Ordered American Chopsuey on the first instance,Paneer butter masala and naan for the second.
Been here...awesome experience.

On Beadon street, opposite hedua park. Nice place but nothing fancy. Their Indian and tandoor items are good. Chinese items don't exactly rock. Slightly overpriced in my opinion.

The Description: Very old restaurant at the Hedua just opposite of the Hedua park near Blossoms. This is a Chinese and north indian restaurant with lots of dishes to offer you. Went there long ago on family dinner. And the second time i went there was for a takeaway purpose.

The Ambience: Not a very big restaurant. small sitting accommodation with ground and upstairs facility. Place is complete A.c. IF the place becomes gathered then very difficult to stand even. The staffs are polite and catches you very quick for the order.

The Food: Tandoori chicken is just too good here. The quality of chicken and the roast is upto the mark. The piece of the chicken is big enough. Being a Chinese resto i always preferred to order Mix Rice and Chilly chicken. Thou i dont remember much but they provide quality food. Just not like any other restaurant. The next time we tried something more with Chilly chicken yet again which was very good this time with the prawn chilly which too was a good choice here. The Panir Butter Masala is also very tasty, in the gravy you can smell and in taste you will find the buttery taste. Nan was also at the soft side, The combination of Nan with prawn chilly and butter masala was really satisfactory. Mix rice this time here was extremely well made. i can taste all the ingredients and the combination of egg,chicken,prawn can be seen all over the rice. In the right way the Rice was 8/10.

The Conclusion: ¬†Satisfied with the first visit here and moreover very satisfied with the next takeaway. Hope to see them main the quality of their food like this. Prices are reasonable.

Note: The review is based on personal visit and experience to this place.

It is their position which has made them to rise(between scottish and bethune college and beside hedua park).And it is also their position which has compelled them to fall(beside Blossoms).Otherwise a good place for chinese.Upper floor is somewhat better.But the most curious thing is that one of the men who serves asks for tip openly!!

A very average restaurant with good Chinese food.

First of all its not at all at Sealdah ,its on Beadon street,opposite to Scottish Church college.

The place is poorly decorated,old sofas,tables,weird smell.staffs really dont know how to behave or they dont bother to smile.

They serve Chinese and Indian both but the Chinese foods are better.Indian foods are just pathetic specially Biryani .Among Chinese dishes lemon chicken is something I have liked.

I would not like to visit this place anymore,and not at all a family restaurant,but the foods are very cheap as per the standard.

food is not that tasty, ambience is ok, overall not a good experience. The price is okay too. But there are better restuarant in this area itself than this one. And most of the food items on the menu are not available. It is near to my college and home but I generaly go there if I can't find a place in the neighbouring favourited restuarant.

Staffs are ok. Prices is low. But I think its neighbour Blossom is better than Mushroom. But Mushroom is better than Capri.  Ambiance is ok. Overall average.
