First visit to this place. Huge restaurant located on the 5th floor of Axis Mall. It serves Indian, Chinese and continental. I went there around 5 pm on 30th December 2017. I loved the theme of the restaurant. Gives you that old kolkata vibe with cartoon arts drawn on the wall and even the windows are old fashioned. 
The service was very prompt and the staffs were pretty well behaved. 
Ordered a manchow soup, 1 chilly chicken and 1 halka noodles. The food was good. I won’t say very tasty but ya it was decent. 
The pocket pinch is bit on the higher side. 
You can give this restaurant a try. 
Ambience: 4/5 
Service : 3.5/5

Calcutta Retro has a huge advantage in terms of its location yet on a Saturday afternoon the footfall was very low. In our two hours spent there, we could find only four occupied tables including ours. They definitely to work on promoting the place more. This is one of the rare few Bengali restaurants that can boast of having a menu range similar to the British era, a perfect culmination of Bengali, Indian and Continental choices. It makes them unique. Delicious food, amazing ambience and helpful service adds on to create a delightful experience. Not to forget, this is quite a kid friendly outlet.

Nice place. They have got two seperate sitting arrangements with different name, theme and cuisine. One is Chinese where they serve authentic Chinese food and the other is one with an Indian retro look. Ambience was a very nice place. I loved the Chinese. Indian food was good as well.

Probably one of the best Bengali dining experiences in Kolkata. Gives you a typical retro Bengali look and feel. Tried the Jhuri Aloo Bhaja/Begun Bhaja which was good. The Tawa Fish Masala and Biriyani were really well done. Overall a decent experience.

The food may seem a bit over priced but if you order the right things it will be worth it.  The service is a bit slow but it's understandable because there aren't many customers at a time. Try their continental dishes(they are very well prepared) mainly the tetrazzini casserole and lamb stroganoff. If you're ordering Indian do order their dhaniya chicken, highly recommended. 
Overall a very good experience and loved the ambience.

The walls are filled with potraits of the nursery bengali rhymes 'baburam sapure' of the famous legendary poet Sukumar Roy . Ambience will remind you  about the good old memories of Kolkata - the entrance is a replica of North Kolkata streets with a phucka joint in one corner .The seating area represents the replica of the seaters in Park which i find a bit uncomfortable. Looks good but not suitable for dinning. The hanging lamps shades are covered with Bengali newspaper which is very attractive. 
  Ordered for Dhonepata mutton with narkel, baked rosogolla. mutton tasted amazing and the dessert was just okay.

Service is slow but courteous.

Visited the Axis Mall outlet. This restathrant will definitely satisfy you not only by food but also its decor & ambiance. Coming to food, i ordered Pantharas (Pancakes with minced mutton), which was quite unique and tasted really nice, Biriyani was tasty, Chicken was tendered, Kadhai Murg Kalimirch was also nice, a bit disappointed with the Tandoori Roti though. Overall i was satisfied with the food. More than food it was the decor which lit my eyes.

Visited on 7th Jan 2017.  Here is my experience (score out of 5)

Ambience : 5/5
Staff courteousness : 5/5
Staff efficiency :  2/5
Food quality : 4/5
Waiting time : 5/5

Area of improvement:
Person who was serving asked me at beginning, right after serving starters that whether I would pay by cash or card. I said I am OK with either option. He then insisted me to share my preference as accordingly he would start billing... NO GOOD... You can't bring this kind of discussion to your guests... 
Then, at the end of our dinner, which was indeed very good, sumptuous... Person told me that card is not working since last 2 days !!! I have to pay by cash only.... Are you kidding me?????? First thing... why did you then ask me for card or cash at beginning...  secondly... what if I am not carrying much cash at that moment... knowing flexibility of card or cash... I ordered additional platters ... what if I don't have that much cash? If card is not working then you must tell your guests at very beginning that only cash option is available... This is "BAD"...

Otherwise... this is must to visit place... not crowded... don't know why though... if you like to have a dinner with your family and friends in a place where you feel yourself and your loved ones alone... this is indeed a right place...

Visited this restaurant today. Tried fish finger with tartar sauce, it was very tasty. Next we ordered, chicken stroganoff( it wasn't mentioned in the menu but the chef customized it for us), and calcutta retro special grilled chicken. Food quality was good. The best part was their desserts. I would again visit this restaurant just because of their baked rasgullas. Amazing taste and flavor.

We loved the special non veg kebab platter. We also ordered Chanar paturi, Kasha mangsho retro style, cholar dal narkel diye and kashmiri pulao. We all loved the items. My colleagues ordered the Chital macher muitha which they liked very much.

Situated on the 5th floor of Axis mall, this initiative by Camellia group has resulted in a picturesque Bengali restaurant serving from Bengali, North Indian and Continental cuisines. My birthday treat here did receive a touch of royal flavour with the delicious dishes that followed...
A. From "Suruwat" menu:
1. Jhoori aloo bhaja- expertly prepared crunchy crispy fried potato.
2. Gilafi sheekh kebab- minced lamb kebabs with garlic, ginger, capsicum and coriander...which tasted just above average.
B. From "Sath Sath" & "Dal Bahar" menu: 
1. Luchi and Masala kulcha
2.Chholar dal narkel diye
A mesmerising combination which indeed  exceeded my expectations...
C. From "Basmati ki khazana" & "Bangal vs Ghoti" menu:
1. Kaju kismis er misti pulao (Guys... I urge you not to miss this one)
2. Kosha mangsho retro style- the pieces were well-cooked and succulent
3. Chingri malai curry- prawns cooked in creamy coconut gravy...this item was by far the best one I have tasted anywhere in a restaurant...hence I strongly recommend this.
D. From "'Continental Connection" :
Country Caesar salad (Chicken, icebreg lettuce, croutons with Caesar dressing).
This restaurant, although underadvertised, boasts of a decent seating capacity. With park benches as seats and wall decorations based on Sukumar Roy's collection of poems "Aabol tabol" , "Calcutta Retro" flaunts bangaliyana in every aspect.
The soft instrumentals playing on the background act as mood-elevator. The staff too are courteous and attentive to the needs of the foodies. Looking foward  to a second visit here in the near future...

The ambiance is superb, resembling the Calcutta of 60s/70s, as the name suggests. It is a perfect place to spend some quality time with friends/family if you like to have Bengali/North cuisine.

The service is good here. The staffs are prompt and attentive to customers.

The food is very good here. I tried their chicken, yellow dal, and garlic naan. They also served us complimentary nachos with tomato sauce, and it was great.

Since it's located at 5th floor of Axis Mall, Newtown, and they don't advertise themselves enough, majority don't know about this restaurant.

The hanging lamps shaded are covered with bengali newspaper which is very attractive.
Coming to food, this eatery is mainly known for Bengali cuisines. Authentic continental cuisines are not endorsed in the menu. Ordered am panna, steamed rice, dhonapata mutton with narkel, baked rosogolla. Am panna was not chill enough to quench my thirst, mutton tasted amazing and the dessert was just okay.

Service is very very slow. Even there were hardly 2 table occupied in the eatery, still the staffs are not being able to manage, but very well behaved.

Situated at 5th floor Axis Mall, a little hard to find.
It has very nice bengali themed interiors.
An artificial puchka thela at entrance, cartoon paintings on two walls, and diya/bhaand decoration on one wall, yellow light bulbs, and a fancy pillar in the middle.
One can choose between park style benches and sofas without backrest for sitting.

The menu mostly focuses on Non-Veg dishes, but they have a decent variety for Veg dishes too.

We ordered:
Jalapeno Cheese Balls
Paneer Tikka Makhani
Butter Naan

The food was tasty but the quantity was less.

The staff was polite.

They should advertise a bit more, as we were the only customers there even though it was weekend.

Overall a decent experience.
This is a one time visit restaurant for foodies.

On a cloudy Saturday afternoon,me and my friend were venturing in Axis Mall when we heard of this Restaurant.
As food adventurers,we entered inside.It is a Bengali Themed Restaurant with beautiful decorations.
The staff was good and had a good knowledge on the menu and combinations(Most Restaurants lack in this regard).
We ordered Dhakai Fish Tikka and Gondhoraj Chicken Fingers for starters.It was yummy and authentic Bengali.The chutney with them were also pretty good.
For main course we sticked to rice , Chetal Mach er Muittha and Kosha Mangsho retro style.
This also didn't disappoint as now we had high expectations from the restaurant.
Dessert was a combo of ice creams.
For 2, the bill was arnd 1900 ...which was ok considering the food,ambience and overall experience.

Foodies...esp authentic Bengali /continental freaks...you can have a go at it.

We wanted to visit Yin Yang for lunch. The person seated us in Calcutta Retro instead, and told us he would serve us the food there. 
The restaurant has a nice decor and the seating arrangement is quite different with benches. I liked it as it's different from the usual but it wasnt very comfy.
Coming to the food ordered for kung pao chicken, burnt garlic fried rice, stirfried lamb and som tum (raw papaya) salad. 
The papaya salad was tasteless, no dressing whatsoever. It was just shredded papaya with some crushed peanuts on top. Usually the salad has chiliies, lemon and has a zing to it. 
Burnt fried rice was ok but both the chicken and the lamb seemed to have the same dark brown gravy. Kung pao chicken had a few cashews in it and the lamb had some long coriander stems in it. Which just gave it a very weird look. 
When the host came to enqiry abt the food, i told him tht the salad wasnt up to the mark. His response was thats how we do the salad. Really? No dressing ? Just grated tasteless papaya? 
Service was attentive but with just 4 tables occuppied, we waited for almost 40 min for the food. 
Not sure if i will visit again. There are better options for chinese food.

Snuggled between banquet halls on top of a mall which is barely successful does not do Calcutta Retro any favours! 

Like i've said before, pleasant surprises when it comes to good food are always welcome. Considering it took us more than a year to figure out we live less than a km away from this restaurant I figured Calcutta Retro deserves a good review. 

The menu is quite interesting as the name suggests with a healthy mix of the "retro" continental items comprising of classics like Russian and Caesar's salads and of course the Chicken Ala Kiev, along with the traditional Bengali soul-food like Luchi Aloodum (my personal favourite). Food is tasty, service is good and ambience is pleasant and homey with a park-like feel because of the park benches used as seats (very innovative I must say) which completes the trifecta of any good restaurant. 

Calcutta Retro needs to be marketed better and I am sure people will be lining up to savour the food and have a great experience! My rating - Must Eat.

Food Is Good But very small quantity and very expensive. 5 stars would be cheaper. If you have deep pockets visit here though better options are available in kolkata. If you are a visitor in kolkata look for other options

The restaurant is situated at the 5th floor of the axis mall - a little non intuitive to find at the first place. however we took help from a kind person at the food court to get the direction. the place has very nice interior - generating nostalgic feeling from Kolkata lovers with their wall paintings inspired from Sukumar Ray characters. The waiter was really polite and helpful too. We had decided to try out their continental offering. So ordered for spicy sea food broth, betki  meuniere and chicken Sicilian. What impressed me to a great deal is - we were served with potato wedges and roasted papads as complimentary appetizer. The broth was accompanied with a portion of garlic bread too. It tasted quite authentic with generous amount of prawn pieces in it. The meuniere was served with rice pilaf and sautéed vegetables and was really well done. The chicken dish was however a bit bland to taste and not as succulent as I would expect. Overall was a good meal! 

Pocket pinch : 900~ bucks after a 10% corporate discount.

We wanted to visit Yin Yang for lunch. The person seated us in Calcutta Retro instead, and told us he would serve us the food there. 
The restaurant has a nice decor and the seating arrangement is quite different with benches. I liked it as it's different from the usual but it wasnt very comfy.

Visited this place today after some 1.5 years and have had a good experience both the times. The restaurant is conveniently situated @ 5th floor of the Axis Mall, Rajarhat. The place has been decorated to give it a Retro feeling – old Calcutta – hence, thy name. From an artificial puchka thela at the entrance to cartoon paintings on the restaurant walls to yellow light bulbs covered in bhel puri thongas to tea bhaand decorations – this place indeed takes you to the 1940’s. I was seated on a park style bench although, I could have seated on the traditional sofa with pumpum pillows but without a back rest!

Some laung, elaichi, suanf and a paan leaf were already there on my table (more of a decoration). I ordered their dal makhani, mixed vegetable handi, butter naan and steam rice. Dal was out of the world, but it was a pity that they served it in a very small bowl – quantity served being too low. Mix veg – again was nice – a good mix of gobhi, red and green capcisum, potato and carrot, but was too oily. Naan was soft and huge, whereas steam rice was fine. Was also served some salads. Nice to see that food was served in a golden polish plate. I ended with a scoop of chocolate ice cream.

Ambience as well as service is nice with some classical music being played in the background. This place deserves a much better rating as well as customer footfall but has been grossly unfortunate due to the fact that there are no offices in the vicinity, hence, very few customers.

With its elaborate paintings and the its classic decoration, it recoiled my childhood memoirs; the place has the aroma and the presence to be felt in your heart and soul . And that's just not for the ambience. Though the menu is much compiled for the non -vegetarian it still serves deserving Indian food. we have a fun course Indian Meal and to our satisfaction the last bite even served well to taste buds.

The pricing is decent and they greet customers with complimentary appetiser, that was new and was appealing. They gave us corporate discount as well asked us multiple times about the food and its taste. I am impressed.

With its elaborate paintings from the pages of Abol Tabol reminiscent of the childhood days, this place will, for sure win your heart. And that's just not for the ambience. The food is an absolute delight, satisfaction guaranteed as long as you stick to the Bengali and Indian dishes. We had Narayanganjer dhonepata murgi, kosa mangsho, bhetki bhape, misti polao, noori kebab. None of the dishes disappointed us. They offer corporate discounts as well. And before I forget, we were greeted with a complimentary appetiser. Not many restaurants in the city have complimentary servings.

Very good experience. Visited the place for a lunch with wife. We were the only people there. Nobody probably knows about this exquisitely decorated place. Beautiful saj-sojja and helpful staff. 
Now the food. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality and test. They also served us complimentary aloo pakoras . we bhetki kababab which was simply lazeez. Kashmiri polao was wonderful. And Narayangunj dhone pata chicken was nice. Presentation and service was so nice I would soon go back. The price may still seem a little overpriced yet overall experience was worth it.

Went to this restaurant situated in the lonely fifth floor of Axis mall after reading lots of rave reviews but thoroughly disappointed.. During our two & half hours stay we were the only customers there, with such low footfall how they managed to survive who knows! Though axis mall is not that famous like city centres but still this kind of emptiness really hampers the mood of the customers. When we entered the restaurant there was no one to attend us, we literally had to went inside the kitchen to tell the staffs that some guests have arrived! though the ambiance is good but the staffs are really not professional and service is pathetic and they take awful lot of time to prepare and serve the food and the wait is not worth as the food is nothing special.. we ordered lots of items, vetki rongpuri finger fry, gonghoraj kathi murgi, paneer tikka, tandoori pomfret, veg biriyani, subzi pulao, mutton kosha, lal murgi, narayangunj er dhonepata murgi, prawn malai curry, vetki paturi, paneer tikka makhani, fulkopir roast and blue lagoon mocktail. except vetki finger fry and subzi pulao none of them were good, they were very ordinary, pomfret & prawns were not fresh at all, even verki paturi was like it was made days ago, kept in freeze , they just took out and warm it in microwave, even the chickens were bad, it was boiled chicken pieces thrown into red and green gravy and the chicken pieces had almost raw blood clots inside them, disgusting..  When footfall is so low then expecting fresh food is almost luxury I guess. Even the mocktail was just like cough syrup, such poor was the preparation. The waiters were not attentive at all, they just brought all the items to the table, kept it at one side and just left and get busy in watching ISL football match on tv, we had to yell everytime to tell them to serve the items, when we were the only guest present there then we can expect some good service but that was also lacking. The bill for 7 people came a whooping rs-7800 and they dont have printed bill also, it was hand written one, never seen such bill in a mall restaurant. Overall had a very  poor experience and i will never go there for sure.

I have gone to the Chinese Restaurant Yin and Yang quite a few times and then only have seen this Restaurant as this is just next door and the belongs to the same group of Restaurants. It was from then only in my to visit bucket.

First thing you would notice about this restaurant is their decor with a puchka stall at the door. Wall painting straight out of the pages of Sukumar Ray's Abol Tabol. Lamp Shades designed from excerpts of News Paper. The ambience the lights is apt with the theme. Kudos for the decor.

Now lets come to the food, we ordered Gondhoraj Kathi Murgi as starters. The servers were suggestive but we had our mind set to try out authentic and simple bengali cuisine that day and we ordered for Plain Rice, Jhoori Alu Bhaja, Dal, Fulkopir (cauliflower) Roast, Chicken / Mutton Kosha.

We had to wait for quite sometime for the food to come in but in between we were served a complimentary Potato Wedges and Papad. Still the wait is not justified given the restaurant was empty and we (12 of us) were the only customer then.

Gondhoraj Kathi Murg was good and rest of the food is so-so considering the rate of the food. The Mutton Kasha was better than the Chicken Kasha as the laters gravy was not up-to-the-mark.

We ordered baked Rosagulla and which I heard is quite good (I am not into Rosagullas hence gave it a miss).

Will next time try their continental next time if I visit again.

Went there last night with my friends. The ambiance is wonderful as was the service. The food was equally delicious. We ordered kathi chicken for starter and for main course we opted mutton and bhetki paturi. Though I am not a fish lover, I have to say the bhetki preparation was awesome. The main negetive point is that the place is situated in 5th floor in Axis Mall, and didn't really notice about this place before.

After an afternoon of shopping we went to Calcutta Retro for a quick meal. This place is difficult to locate but the ambience was good.
The menu was interesting as they had from traditional Bengali to Chinese to continental cuisines. We did not experiment much and we had Dhoney Pata aar Narkel diye Mangsho and jeera pulao. Pulao was nicely cooked but the mutton was simply knockout for me. The meat was very nicely cooked,it was tender,you can easily detect the flavours of coriander and coconut. The best thing about that dish was with a tons of flavours,it wasn't too oily or spicy. 
The bill was around 650 with taxes which is kind of okay. I would say main courses are a bit of on the costlier side. A big thumbs up for their Bengali cuisine.

Unseen and unexplored by many Calcutta Retro is a very nice restaurant inside a very unpopular mall (axis). In fact you have to search for the restaurant if you do not have a prior dining experience there.  Accessible only by lift situated on the fifth floor Calcutta Retro packs a nice surprise for you. 

Our visit to the restaurant was welcomed with a complementary snack. The retro look and feel of the restaurant is really unique in this part of the city. Food quality is really good. Service is rather excellent. And the portion they serve for a plate is much too generous. Usually a plate is to be shared by two. 

The restaurant serves not only authentic Bengali cuisine but Chinese and continental too with some selected north Indian dishes. We had ordered primarily continental and the food was nice.

Cost wise a bit on the higher side but quality wise they do not lack generosity. They are sincere in trying level best. Overall a really good experience all things considered.

Yes yes, it is a creative and calm ambience. But the food was a major disappointment. The service, deplorable. Their menu is a mish mash of Bengali, Indian and Continental (why?!!), with Chinese right next door. Sadly, no justice was done to any cuisine. The begun bhaja was a greasy, bland disaster. The beautiful vegetable was massacred. Moving on, the matar methi malai was too runny and too heavy on green chillies. No balance. The rotis were hard, chewy and heavy. We were totally put off, enough to forgo dessert. Never again.

Today I went to Calcutta Retro with my family and as we were thinking about having typical Bengali lunch, I chose this one over many other options .I actually fell in love with their decor specially the entry zone which is modelled like old Bengali residence, with 'roak' style, a fuchka stall etc. Friends can sit there and have a chatting session while the food is getting ready! Coming to the food, we had  nonveg kebab platter, plain rice, cholar daal, aloo vaja, dhoney mutton, aam ada diye kankra, parsher jhal, butter nun, mixed veg.We were a group of 7 ,among us 2 opted for having nun. Portion of rice was more than sufficient, so is all other dishes. Mutton was soft and the kabab platter is too good. Food was excellent. Staff were cordial. We had such a good time that my father promised them to comeback with his friends during Puja. Moreover we got complimentary snacks too . Overall a very relaxed time spent in a nice environment, I got all the credit for choosing the place and my thanks goes to the restaurant authority for making our time worthwhile.

Great food, ambience, and service. After an evening of frenetic shopping at Axis mall we decided to give Calcutta Retro a try and came back thoroughly impressed. 

Our order for the evening included Chicken cutlet, Kosha Mangsho, Kaju kismis pulao, and baked rossogolla. Each of these is a Calcutta classic in its own right and Calcutta Retro did not disappoint. 

Though the food did take some time to come to the table, we kept ourselves busy soaking in the ambience and munching on the complimentary potato wedges and papad. Another awesome touch was the complimentary serving of chutneys - raw papaya and tomato. These go really well with the pulao and Kosha Mangsho. 

I haven't had Bengali food this good since 'Esplanade' and 'Oh Calcutta' back home in Bangalore. 

But Calcutta Retro goes a step further by offering a variety of Continental and Indian preparations too, so there's something here for everyone's taste buds. I highly recommend this place if you are in the Rajarhat, New Town neighborhood.

I had a meeting 5 mins from axis mall so I thought of going to lunch there. I looked up places to eat on Zomato and came across Calcutta Retro. The menu and the pictures really impressed me so i decided to give it a shot.

The place is so quaint. Right at the entrance is a huge road sign that says Wait! The seating is colourful benches with lovely cushions for backrest. 

Ny server was so sweet. He could tell I was not a local and he really went out of his way to make me feel comfy. On his recco, i ordered the prawn malai curry and the dry fish in mustard.

My tastebuds went crazy when i took the first bite of that prawn curry. He told me it was the most Bengali thing they serve and i just died. I have never eaten much good prawn curry in my years. 

The dry fish was nice but obviously, something else held my attention. I also got a plate of potato wedges on the house and a 10% discount. I love this place and i highly recommend it.

Located on the 5th Floor of Axis Mall, this theme based restaurant was a nice joint. Visited this place on Sunday evening to try out something new and we loved its Calcutta-inspired interiors, feel of the city and its joy as well as the courteous staff. The seating arrangement was really well done. Since we were the only customers there we thoroughly enjoyed their exclusive attention. The food tasted good but was a little over priced. We loved the kababs, specially the Murg Noori Kabab and Chicken a la Kiev.

I don't know about the bengali cuisine, but the continental one was horrible. They put chillis and so many spices on my sister's dish that she had to gulp it down with water. The steak was fibrous, and the fish and chips I had ordered was just okay (you cannot screw up an easy dish like fish and chips). I'll never go there and order the continental food, ever again. The bengali, judging by the reviews, I can try maybe.

I am rating it 4.5. It could have well been 5, but for the service is little slow (acceptable) and seating is uncomfortable in the name of being "Retro". Food (we had continental soup and main course) is awesome. Little disappointed to realize that they could not serve the lamb chops I really wanted to taste. Am sure I'll be able to try it "Next Time"! Staff is courteous and friendly. Don't really care about the deco much...its the food and service we visit a restaurant for. A "MUST TRY" place in New Town, Kolkata.

We went to this restaurant just out of impulse. We were looking for a place to eat and voila just before we exited the mall, found this restaurant on zomato.

The entire fifth floor has been leased out by the parent family of this restaurant and apart from Calcutta Retro, the floor also has a chinese restaurant and a banquet hall. The food from the chinese restaurant, yin yang, can be served here as well.

We were promptly seated as the restaurant was completely empty. Even on a tuesday evening, it was a little sad to see. The staff was courteous and polite and when asked, even showed us around the floor, where they are opening a pub called bluezz.

The servers recommended us dishes right from the beginning and almost of our dishes were from that pool. For starters, we had american baby corn, which due to my dislike for corn i didn't have but others said was quite fine. Along with that we had gandharaj kathi chicken, which again was quite tasty. We had a variety of soups ordered and the general feeling was that they were quite well prepared. Coming to main course, we ordered veg fried rice and veg manchurian from yin yang and prawns in coconut curry and dhonepata chicken alongwith rice and naan from calcutta retro. This is where the restaurant truly has its expertise. The prawns were unlike anything i have ever had before. The traditional mustard taste was present in the prawns but at no time did it overpower the coconut . it was amazingly tasty. The presentation too was wonderful. The dish was served inside a carved out coconut which added to its appeal. I have never had too much Bengali food but this surely made me realise what i had been missing out on. Amazing job done on the dishes. I visit calcutta for my annual trips and i am sure that i'll be dropping in whenever i come here. Would readily recommend this place.

If someone asked me to visit this place again, I would, but just to look at the decor!
The food, definitely, is a lot better at Aaheli or 6 Ballygunge Place.
However, that's not to say that the food isn't tasty, because it most certainly is. Just that, for connoisseurs like me, the taste buds aren't satisfied that easily!

This is one of those places that seems to be determined to hide its light under a bushel (yes its bushel not bush...) Thanks to Zomato we stumbled upon it. Even with directions the  Axis mall does not have much (as of last month) to indicate the restaurant's existence. 

But the experience more than made up for the irritation in locating the place.

The place was mostly empty at lunch time barring a small crowd of young professionals.

The ambience, once you get past a depressing corridor of half constructed establishments of uncertain variety is a pleasant surprise. It quickly gets you into the theme of Calcutta (or is it Kolkata) retro. The seating though pleasing to the eye a trifle uncomfortable - the management has obviously not heard of the wisdom of keeping comfortable seats in the initial days and changing to one that discourages coffee shop crowds later on.

An attentive and helpful waiter - the service is excellent - plied us with suggestions after allowing us to settle down.

The menu is vast, we tried samplings across cuisines. The Dahi Kababs or indeed any of the kabaabs give Zarang a run for its money. The thing to remember is despite the ambience the cuisine is not just Bengali. Anglo Indian menu is an unforgivable omission in a place that lays claim to Kolkata in retro. But much like the city itself the food from North Frontier and “Continental” as only Kolkata can produce has a taste that lingers long after you have forgotten Kake Da Dhaba…

Great place to eat with cool interiors reminding one of old Kolkata. Each and every item that we tried was great to taste, especially the Fish Fingers which were the softest and tastiest ones I have ever tried in Kolkata. The Bhuna Tomato Shorba & the Cream Caramel Custard are the two other dishes that stood out in taste.

The location is a draw back for the restaurant, located in the Axis Mall of Newtown, the reason why many in Kolkata might not have heard of the place in the first place. But the taste surely demands foodies from all across Kolkata to travel over to enjoy a great meal.

7th Mar 2015 - We ordered Non Veg Platter, Chicken Curry and Crab. The Non Veg Platter was extremely disappointing. It was way over priced for the quantity and not that great in taste. The Chicken Curry was ok. The Crab made up for it though. It was extremely delicious and very well presented.

The ambience is amazing!

Calcutta Retro, Bengali Cuisine fine- dining restaurant seems to be a well kept secret - of Rajarhat New-town #Kolkata. Situated at the top of Axis Mall - it's not the best of location (not easy to reach besides with low footfalls at the Mall - doubtful about clientele) and we were the only customers for lunch (granted the CWC15 IndVsAus match was on - which could be a reason for lack of crowd. TheBong version of "Idaho potatoes" as starters was an unnecessary innovation - but the "Posto-Narkel" Bora (Grated Coconut cakes coated with Poppy Seeds) was brilliant. Cholar, Daal, Lucchi, Jhuri Alu-Bhaja were standard. Home-Style Chitol Muittha (Fish-Cakes) with Potatoes was nice. Would rate the Daab-Chingri as above average. The Pabda was a bit over-cooked and excessive use of onion and garlic paste - which masked the flavour of the fish and marred the texture (in any case - the fish seemed to have been in a freezer for a long time - so lacked freshness). Overall, a good experience - though not in the same league of Oh Calcutta or 6 Ballygunj Place - but scores over Bhojohori Manna in ambience and presentation. If you're living or working in the Rajarhat area - a good place to go for a Bengali Meal (especially with Non-Bengali outstation guests) without having to travel into town.

Many doesn't even know about this place cause it's not that easily accessible to the local population. Calcutta Retro is a Bengali themed restaurant but does offers North Indian, Chinese and Continental too.

I have the opportunity to visit the place just once so far and I was delighted to find that such a nice place exists. The interiors are too good for a restaurant and it does have a Bengali vibe to it. Since I tried Bengali cuisine, I'd say it was fantastic and the service is prompt by the people working here. The feel you get inside this place is of an "Aadi bad I" which means an old house in Bengal. All in all, I'd suggest this to people who want to explore new places to try food as this one is not known to the mass.

You won't feel bad paying the bills here cause it ain't that expensive and two can have their meals at around Rs 1000-1200.

Visited using a groupon coupon. THE FOOD WAS TERRIBLE....STARTING FROM THE STARTERS TO THE SOUP..SALAD AND DESERT. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!
The British custard had no taste neither did the Afghan Shorba....the pieces of chicken were not juicy...just straight out of a freezer and cooked...the green peas soup had no taste at all ! The jerk chicken was awful !
The portions very ridiculously small...
What we liked was the spacious ambiance....and the service....the ambiance is really nice...sad that they spent so much on decor and space but have a chef who does'nt no  how to cook.....!

Beautiful decor. 
Very helpful and prompt service. 
We went in a group of five and we were the only ones there. Liked their Afgaani Shorba and Fish n chips a lot. Though they served garlic bread instead of Bread Roll and Chocolate Pudding as an alternative of British Caramel Custurd, we don't have much to complain there as they were delicious as well.
Though we felt the main course was a little less quantity wise. 

Overall, thumb's up for a fine dining experience.

As the name suggests, this restaurant is retro in the true sense. Located at Axis Mall, New Town (a place yet to be explored by the regular Calcuttan), the best thing about this place is the ambience. As you enter the restaurant you find the a dummy fuchka stall. It reminds us of the old zamindari days as depicted in many of the movies. The lights are too dim. The seating arrangement, the chairs are quite comfortable. I purchased a coupon from Groupon. Although i was the only one in the restaurant, the food was quite good. A bit expensive though.
Overall, 3.5/5.

First of it was very difficult to find that restaurant as we couldn't find any hoarding or banner even in the mall it is located in. But asking the guard we reached the restaurant. 
The aura was simply beautiful.They had these paintings on there wall which I got to know are related Bengali stories.
Coming to the food. It was one of the best food I have tasted in Kolkata since I have been here. Sweet dish was heavenly. 10 on 10 for food.
The staff was friendly too. I would definitely go there again.

This restaurant is retro in true sense. As you enter you get the whole vintage feel of Kolkata, the type you see in some old parts of Kolkata even today. Big spacious place, has a phuchka stand at the entrance, the wall paintings the blinds on the windows are made of bamboos- you know the typical traditional decor that you saw in old bengali zamindaari movies. Even the colour of the blinds are green just like it used to be in the past. Very authentic warm feeling. Reminds me of the houses in Bow Barracks.However the lights were way too dim for evening hours...makes you feel lousy and the seating arrangements i.e the benches are uncomfortable. 

Now coming to food, we ordered:
Firstly we were served potato wedges which was on the house. Sweet gesture but they were overtly fried and crunchy. Just OK.
Calcutta retro non-veg platter- it had chicken peices, 2 mutton sheekh kebabs,2 bhetki fish baked. Well the chicken and mutton were really nice and had good blend of spices but the bhetki fish was not very well done. It had a strong fish smell and even my friend who usually eats fishes found it smelly. So i suggest they marinate well and camouflage the smell because bhetki is a fish if well done can also be eaten by non fish lovers.

Next we ordered luchi, for 50 rupees you get 4 pieces and dhoney pata and narkel diye mangsho(mutton). The dough of the luchis were not well kneaded and that is why in minutes the luchis turned chewy. The mutton curry was good and the mutton pieces were really well done. The quality of food was really good. However i did not find much narkel or dhanya taste in it but it was nevertheless a good item not very spicy. I suggest one should have this with steamed rice and not luchis. 

Foodwise and pricewise a good place to go but the only downfall of this place is that it is not well advertised. It is located on the fifth floor of axis mall. If you use the escalator you will be confused as the escalator ends on the 4th floor where the theatre and hang out is located. So use the lift and go to 5th floor directly to avoid confusion. Even people in the mall lacked knowledge about the restaurant. I dont know why the place is not showcased via banners etc even in the mall. Due to this the place does not pull much crowd. We went on friday and apart from us there was just another gang.Sad. 

The staffs are polite but lacks promtness and training. When we entered there was noone to attend us and we actually went near the kitchen and knocked to let them know "Hello, you have customers". Hope the management tightens their seat belt and makes some serious amends before the place loses its charm.

It is one of the lesser known theme restaurants, maybe because it is located in the back of beyond locality of Rajarhat, which is yet to be explored by the regular Calcuttan. You will find some IT folks here and there in this otherwise near-empty restaurant. 
Its on the top floor of Axis Mall, not very noticeable at all. One really has to look hard. And like I said, its very empty and spooky. However the interiors are tastefully done - has an old Calcutta feel to it, spattered with some cartoons from Sukumar Roy's Abol Tabol. Interesting indeed!
I ordered veg, so I am yet to try the non veg, but I was mighty impressed. There was complimentary 'aloo-bhaja' and papad.
I ordered Roti, Rice, Matar Methi Malai, and Phulkopir Roast (Cauliflower in a mildly spicy yoghurt braised gravy). The food was cooked well, presented well, and the freshness and quality was also up to the mark.
The off-kilter refreshment platter had ilaichi, supari, and saunf! The service was superbly polite, and pocket pinch very justifiable - about 700 for 2. I will come back to try the other bengali dishes.

P.S - I tried non-veg the other day, Narayanganjer Dhonepata Murgi is worth a mention! Do try...

This place is just like a traditional Bengali house. It's located on the 5th floor of Axis Mall, Rajarhat. You will hardly find any crowd here. I have been to Calcutta Retro twice and both the times, we were the only diners there.
The food here is quite good. The fish preparations are authentic. The crab is extremely delicious.
The quantity of food they serve is really good.
Best place to have a quiet dinner.
I would definitely go back to Calcutta Retro.

We had lunch here on 9/9/14. Though all the cons I liked the place. 
Cons first
- Waiting time is too much. We had to wait for an hour for the food to arrive. besides all the good points, this wold hamper the business and people will not revisit.
- we were the only people in the restaurant. Though it made the environment calm and we-friendly but still ... not feeling like a restaurant.

Pros
_ ambiance was nice. I liked the seating in the park bench. Initially the cushion was bit uncomfortable but a little height adjustment made it perfect.
- Food was delicious. We were very much upset with the wait time, still we came out smiling for the food. awesome. we had:
    - Creame soup (less spicy, nice taste )
    - Chicken kebab (nice - bit salty)
    - Fish kebab (great)
    - Biriyani (Delicious)
    - Chicken reshmi butter masala (la jabab)
    - Parshe (really good - bit salty though)
    - Pabda (perfectly cooked)
    - Kakra (crab) (mango kashundi - bit like aachari style. tasted nice but actually I don't like the aachari dishes. so not enjoyed much)
    - Garlic naan (nice)

I like the presentation - with complementary plastic chutney (papaya ), mango-date chutney, cone shaped roasted papad, ice cold chills, pickle etc ...

This place reminds me of an old traditional bengali house. Very pretty decor. Large enough space to roam around, some authentic touches like a phuchka stand, spice jars made it more appealing. Though the seating arrangement wasn't good. Benches made it pretty uncomfortable to sit. 
However coming to food, our lunch was quite grand.
Complimentary chutneys papad and fried potato wedges were good appetizers and tasted mighty fine. 
After that we ordered Makai ka shorba, which was a corn soup with desi tarka delicious and was served with butter nun. Then in main course we had Murg noori kebabs, Dhania kulcha, Tandoori roti Paneer Makhani. Kebabs were just perfect succulent well balanced though I expected more cheese stuffing but it was good. Rotis and kulcha were good but the edges were undercooked which was a disappointment. Paneer was fresh and the dish stood out perfectly.
In desert we had Caramel custard and it was genuinely the show stopper. It literally melted in my mouth. 
Great place to hang out looking forward to my next visit and again for that caramel custard.

I had been to this place with two of my friends, and we were very much happy with overall experience. we had groupon coupon.
Mock tails were ok, in Starter we tried three items and drum stick chicken could have been better. but Main course was satisfactory and tasty. And in dessert, we had gulab jamoon... it was too good. :) the service was also good.

Yes, the location is on 5th floor of axis mall, which is difficult to find but i guess they can't do anything much about it. Lightening of the restaurant can be better, there is a high scope of improvement. More over, when we went there, there were only two service provider. but thumbs up for food taste .

The delivery was insanely fast – we got our food about 10 min after the order. As far as the food, I was disappointed the first time because I prefer my ‘Noori Kebab’ with a more caramelized cheese but that's more of a personal preference than anything else. I gave them another chance and I'm so glad I did. They taste freshly made from scratch (unlike other places where it seems like they pull them from a freezer & then put it on tandoor before serving) and just melt in our mouth. Noori Kebab was spicy, thick, rich, fluffy and tasty, it felt like perfect. I am planning to try their ‘Kebab Platter’ on my next visit.

went with my family for a lunch. its difficult to locate as there is no other way other than the elevators and there must be some proper directive guides at the ground floor and third floor where most of the restaurants are. The ambiance was fantabulous. It had glimpses of old day Calcutta. The sitting arrangements with benches(wooden) had a style quotient but staff behaviour needs to get a bit more groomed. Maybe the time we went in we were the only occupants and all were bit relaxed. The dishes are priced quite judiciously and never should be termed as exorbitant. But the chef there was bit dogmatic. The steward took the order for chanar paturi but came back and said "ota hobe na sir". Peculiar in big names we don't expect such things and that too for a food item which is a common place one. The manager intervened tried but the chef remained obstinate. Other than that I had a very good experience and the Chitol macher muitta is better than all other bengali restuarants in kolkatta. Every other item like gandhoraj kathi murgi (starter) dhoney pata aar narkel diye mangso, bhekti paturi , the polau and dessert e baked cham cham were pretty good. Posto nakel boro is not rightly priced but a good tasty one.

Went to Calcutta Retro from a Groupon lead. As others observed, this is difficult to find being located on 5th floor of Axis Mall and accessible only by elevators. Not viewable from Inside the mall unless you climb up to the 5th floor. 

On entering found a big restaurant chain almost empty! The walls of Cal Retro are decorated with famous Abol Tabol characters and the entire furnishing gives a retro feeling! which I personally felt awesome!

Coming to food.. I found their set 4 Course Non Veg Meal to be sumptuous, very tasty and fresh also! Their desserts tasted great - both gulab jamun and chocolate ice-cream. The fish finger and the chicken kebabs (tikka and reshmi)0 were delicious. 

The staff is very courteous and polite. Attentive to details. And the service is reasonably on time. So overall a very good experience. Would definitely go back soon!

Btw I also took the offer of Kebab Koobideh and there also the food was great! Only that was a very small restaurant!

The menu is quite impressive as we ordered some old bengali dishes, like sukto, alu posto, doi potol, daal, lal murgir jhol etcs. Sukto was ok, but the alu posto and doi potol was delicious, lal murgir jhol n the baked chomchom was good too. Services were little bit late, but overall it's pretty good n i ll recommend it all bengali food lovers. And i ll definitely go there again again.. :) Cheers !!!

I would have given a 5 but for a couple of thi g's they can do to improve: table staff though well mannered are not properly trained. In terms of serving food. Also,  they charged me around 19+ percent of total taxes without specifying the breakup.

Went to Calcutta Retro for lunch with friends. First of all, the position is quite hidden (in 5th floor), and is difficult to find if someone is generally roaming in Axis Mall. Suggestion is to have sufficient hoarding and path locators in ground floor.

The ambience is great. Gives you a feeling of old kolkata with those bamboo and earthen pot works. Even the seats are like old benches (with cushion) as present in parks. Good setup for addas.

Firstly, we started with Gandharaj Kathi Murg, a kebab with a bengali connection....the gandharaj lebu. This is a highly recommended dish. The paste that comes along with it makes the experience more exquisite. Awesome thinking!

We had Murgh Noori Kebab as the next starter. It is a great combination of chicken, cheese and pineapple, all tandoored. Surprisingly, it came in a sizzler plate (which is just for presentation!). Again, a great thinking and perfect execution.

We had murgir lal jhol and dhoney pata r narkel diye mangsho in the main course, with steamed rice. The chicken was based on tomato, and hence red in color, and quite tasty. The gravy of the mutton is toooo good, probably the best thing of the entire lunch. However, the quality of mutton disappointed us a bit as it was not properly boiled (meat was red in color) and dod not seem like fresh. Probably the mutton was in refrigerator for a loong time.

The waiter who was taking our order seemed a bit inattentive. We had to tell him the items 2-3 times each time before he grasped them. Also, his explanations of some food descriptions were not upto the mark. He also came to us thrice asking for the quality of the food, which we thought was an overdose. The maincourse also took time to reach.

Apart from these slight service flaws, the overall experience was good and would like to recommend the wonderfully crafted items to everyone.

A usual Lunch plan on a friday afternoon with colleagues took us to the Calcutta Retro today. There wasn't much feedback available for this restaurant and we were in for a surprise. The place is located on the 5th floor of axis mall and there was not much indication of its existence before we entered the restaurant.  The walls were adorned with Sukumar Ray (or so my colleague pointed  out) cartoons , and park benches were placed for sitting. We were the only group in the whole restaurant which was a tad bit unexpected on a Friday Afternoon. 
The Food was awesome and each of the item we ordered had its own unique flavour and character. Special recommendation goes for the starter Gandharaj Kathi Murgi and Murg Tikka +  Dal Makhani in the main course :)
A must visit for the foodies in this part of the city. Though one recomandmendation for the management, this place is too inconspicuous, needs more visibilty :)
Keep up the brilliant work on food :)

Ambience good. As name suggests, old Kolkata look. Food bit costly. Don't try chicken butter Masala. It's very bad, have taste of coconut. Serving staffs are friendly. They need better chef. 

2 person costs around 1600+ tax. Zomato also needs to update their projection.

Excellent food and great ambience. Mourola maachher peyaji was excellent, as was baked chomchom. 
It was difficult to believe that we were the only diners there on Christmas day @ lunch. I believe thats more because of lack of advertisement than the restaurant itself.
Would definitely go there again and again. Highly recommended !!

Mind blowing ambience. Food is good and sticks to its standards. Had a retro feeling of ancient Kolkata. A new hotel and way to go. A warm hospitality esp from Mr. Siraj. Would visit again soon

Good Place to eat  particularly if you are in New town area. Great Ambience, Good Service & Great Food. You won't get so much variety like an Oh Calcutta, but overall the food is good and fits your pocket. Service wise they are top notch & also the ambience is great. Must try dishes  Mochar chop, Bhetkir Paturi & Baked Chomchom

Considering the ambience and a beautiful spread , the expectation was sky high on our side from calcutta retro . Sadly they somehow failed to deliver on my 1st encounter with them . Our fish and chips was a perfect starter . But then came the lamb chop which spoiled the show for us .flavor was awesome , but the meat was so rubbery that it was extremely difficult to consume .probably it was a case of an aged lamb or not the right cut of meat ; whatever it was ,it was a plateful of disappointment for us .what is the point of great flavors if you can't chew it? Having said that i would love to go back there with a hope that i can give more marks than 3.5 .
