This sweet confectionary is located at Barasat.
Tried rosogolla, nolengurer sondesh, which were fresh and of good quality.
Pocket pinch is friendly.
Service is quick.
Overall satisfactory and caters the need of local people but there are many other good options in Kolkata for sweet lovers.

যারা গ্রাম বা মফস্বলের লোক , তাদের সাধারনত কলকাতার মিষ্টি ভালো লাগে না । উল্টোটাও সত্যি । ফলে বারাসাত এলে অন্যের দাবিখানাও একটু চেখে দেখতে পারেন । বাজি রইল , নিরাশ হবেন না । বাজির ভিত্তি ... রসগোল্লা ।

Rosogolla is something I loved from childhood and this is one place where you get hot amazing rosogolla if you make it there in time. The rosogolla's are just amazing and every time I end up eating 8 10 hot rosogolla's at a go. Although the other sweets are also very food but this is the goto place whenever i have 'gorom' rosogolla straight out of the oven.
