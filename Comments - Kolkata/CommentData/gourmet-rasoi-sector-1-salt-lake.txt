I ordered Winter Special Combo Thali which consist of Makki Roti, Sarso ka Saag, Matar Pulao, Dahi and Gur. I placed the order through Zomato. However they sent me usual Combo Thali that consisted of Puri, Alu Sabzi, Pulao, Chana masala and raita. I called Zomato and they were quick to oblige. They found the mistake made by the restaurant and refunded my money. A big thanks to Zomato. And a thumb down to Gourmet Rasoi.

Tried ordering home delivery on 24Dec. On a prepaid order of 4 items, the outlet messed up by giving a half quantity instead of full (half paneer butter masala instead of full ordered and paid for). The solution offered by the outlet was ridiculous, pay the delivery boy ₹70less (for a prepaid order)!!!! On mentioning that I did not need a refund but needed the quantity of food, there was no satisfactory reply, initially there was confusion galore but finally delivered the remaining portion to my address.

Noteworthy while the initial order had slightly missing item, GR was honest and sincere enough to owe it up and redeliver. Food taste was OK-Good, portions moderate

Food is largely good if not excellent. Ordered 1 thali each of punjabi and Rajasthani. Punjabi thali was really good but Rajasthani thali was not upto mark..specially kadhai was too sour with very less besan content to be marwadi kadhi..
Ordered at 9:50 pm nd got the delivery around 11:10 pm..long wait..zomatos real time delivery status tracker not working at all..had to contact Zomato chat personel to get the delivery status.t he delivery boy told that don't order this late otherwise will get food delivered even more late..the restaurant gets closed at 9:30 pm?? I think Zomato should update the close time for last delivery as 9:30pm if this is the case.
Overall not bad experience. Will definitely order again :)

Hi Gourmet Rasoi ,

I have order meal yesterday. Its very frustrating  you have taken 2hour to delivery the food.

Also noticed one of below comments that you will be taken care of this. However seems you failed to deliver your service.

I have ordered Punjabi thali for lunch. I have placed my order at 1:00 pm and it got delivered at 2:45 pm. When I almost finished my lunch with snacks.

Very disappointing with their delivery service.

I placed my order at 8.15 & got delivery at 9.40 and had to pay ₹30 for delivery . So u can imagine.after this troubled waiting my Chinese thali arrives.food was horrible.we cudnt finish d food it was so worse.rice & noodles was over boiled so they were sticking onto each other and not 1% did it resemble any Chinese taste.it was something els only.food had too much salt and spice.v wer forcing ourselves to chew d food.I had written in the order that I want chilli soaked vinegar along wd it bt wat I got was chilli sauce and soya sauce. I don't kno how they have got 3.4 rating.I would hv marked in negative.I paid 300 only to throw away the food. These people should not be allowed to cheat the customers.this food I got was in no way Chinese. Not remotely related to Chinese. I was thoroughly disappointed.
