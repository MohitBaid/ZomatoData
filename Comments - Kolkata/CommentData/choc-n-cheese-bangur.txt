After a hard day at work, as I sat down on the sofa to relax, suddenly I started craving for some ice cream. It was almost 9:30 PM and I didn't have the energy to go out. So, I started surfing the food apps on my phone and came across this food joint, and immediately ordered some hot fudge sunday, along with cheese burst kabab. The way they packaged the hot fudge was very neat. The cheese burst kababs were very delicious. I would request them to put some more dessert options in their menu.

It was my daughter's birthday and I decided to order fish fry from Choc and Cheese. I liked the way the owners helped me out in choosing the exact dish and quantity for the party. Best part was that we got the food home delivered at the right time. The guests enjoyed the fish pieces served with tartar sauce which was again provided by choc and cheese. I am waiting to visit the outlet someday and plunge on their food.

Fantastic food!!!  Great food quality with highest level of customer service.  The best part of Choc N Cheese is the hygiene that they maintain while providing the food.  
I would recommend people to get there soon and taste the food items.  
My favourite picks are cheese burst kebab,  fish n chips,  brownies,  schezwan rice,  pan-fried chilly fish,  Taipei chicken, dry chilli chicken...  N the list is endless!!! 
Thanks choc N cheese for opening your outlet in Bangur .  One stop for all the the foodies out here!!! 
Thumbs Up!!!!!!!!

I ordered from the Bangur branch, They sent me stale food with such a foul smell in it, I called the owner she said she is sending the replacement after 30 mins of waiting no one picks up the call. I would rather eat from roadside shops but never visit this shitty restaurant again.
