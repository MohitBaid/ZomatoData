Restaurant no doubt has a good ambience. Food is also good.
Bt staff service need to be improved. It creates d bad inpression.
And wateva price of foods is in written zomato is wrong. Where else there is much difference between price written in zomato and the actual price. So this need to be checked out.

Last night on X-Mas (25th dec, 2017) I went to have dinner over there with a friend of mine. Everything was good except the last part which I discovered the very next day. The bill served to me was in the name of "SUTTON SONS INDIA PVT. LTD." with no where the name "WALDORF" to be seen. I went for dinner at a well known restaurant to find out later that I had actually visited a CLOTH SHOP in reality... Just feel cheated on that part... Not going again ....

Visited the restaurant on 24th of December. Ordered a variety of non veg starters all of them were covered with sugar . The pork starter was having only fat . The main course was equally bad except the rice. Spare pork ribs was ordered in which they gave stale pork which was smelly and disgusting. 

The management needs to wake up rather the citing problems like rush during the hour. It is obvious a restaurant in Park Street which is known to people will have a rush during such peak hours, but that doesn't mean they can justify the situation by serving stale/worst food.

Do not have pork at this place they will serve you with uncooked pork fats, even if you get 1 or 2 pc of porks you fill find it not tender and soft. Fried rice, hakka noodles quantity wise was good, 2 people can easily share from 1. Side dish quantity was really poor compared to the price. Service was average. Overall experience was below satisfactory. I wouldnt recommend this place. Blue poppy is much better than this place!

I usually visit Kolkata once a year and try to cover all the legendary eateries in this city one at a time. Since I love Chinese food so my parents suggested Waldorf. Prime location on Park Street, Nice ambience and Authentic Chinese food. From the sea food soup to the Red Pepper chicken and the Hakka noodles. Must try the Pork dishes. Everything was spot on. Really glad I covered this on my trip.

I am pretty surprised to see so many negative reviews here, may be I was lucky or the guys here unlucky, however here's my review, it was a Saturday about 6:30 PM very odd time, I was looking for takeaway, was bit reluctant entering as I was in shorts and slippers, 
the gate keeper welcomes me, 
waiter comes over prompt with the menu
after seeing the menu the prices shock me (cost looks too low)
i guessed quantity would be very less
so for 3 people I order 2 starters, 3 main dishes and 2 side dish 
served within 20 mins (packing was poor I agree)
Quantity was so much we had it for dinner, next days lunch still had some left
Bill was peanuts
treatment was as if I am a VIP (though I was in shorts, not well dressed at all)
FOOD - Quality, Quantity & TASTE - "AWESOME"

I have been to this place quite a few times over the years and it gives you mixed feelings. The food here was once amazing, however i feel that in recent times it has taken a kind of downward turn. We were never a patron of the service at this place and i expected things to improve but was disappointed once again.
So me and my family went here on navami this year. The service was rather chaotic and confusing. We ordered fried rice, fried prawns, american chop suey and some chicken and fish side dishes. The fried prawns were extremely ordinary and the chop suey did not live up to expectations either. However the fried rice and the fish side dish(i forgot its name; sorry) was really good and well cooked. 
Time and again whenever we visit this place, we always love its ambiance; peaceful and quite and amidst the chaos of Durga puja. Thankfully this has not changed over the years and remains an attractive feature of this place.

Food : 3/5
Ambiance : 4/5
Service : 2.5/5

This is one of those legendary Chinese restaurants in Calcutta boasting of servicing the city since 1952. It is conveniently located right opposite to the Indian Hobby Centre at Park Street.
Had visited this place a week or so before the pujos. The floor manager was noticed guiding the customers regarding what to order and explaining the composition of each gravy. Not only that, but the staff serving us were extremely well mannered. 
We had decided to try out any Lamb or Pork dishes at this place on some positive reviews from a friend. For starters we had ordered Garden fresh mushroom soup with chicken. The soup was amazing. The quantity being served at this place is absolutely perfect and they were truly generous with the mushroom and chicken. Most places ruin their soups by adding more corn flour to try and thicken the gravy; they however, had kept a grip on it. 
For the main course we had ordered Waldorf Special Mixed Fried Rice and Roasted Chilly Pork. The fried rice was quite well cooked and perfectly seasoned with generous quantities of chicken, pork and prawns. Also none of the prawns in the fried rice were of a small size which was according to me is an exemplary move by the restaurant.
The pork had an even combination of pork meat and pork fat which is most desirable. The gravy was thick and perfectly seasoned & the taste and aroma of the smokey roasted pork made our taste buds tingle. It was absolutely a foodgasmic experience.
Will surely visit this place again to try out their Noodles and Lamb dishes.

It is one of the oldest restaurants serving chinese in park street area.I visited this place with my family for lunch and we decided to order Chicken Fried Rice,Five Spiced Lamb and Five Spiced Vegetables,the food was okayish, their quality has detoriated over the years.The Fried rice and the lamb were good enough but the five spiced vegetables were horrible,the veggies were not cooked properly at all.The service was a little slow they took almost thirty minutes to serve the food and for the food that we were served the pocket pinch was also quite high.It is sad to see that their food quality has detoriated.

Waldrof has been an essential part of my childhood. 
I dined here at every happy occasion with my family. Many are of the opinion that the place has lost its charm like many old eateries but I refuse to believe so. Yes maybe the decor of the previous outlet was more soothing than the current one , but hey when did decor matter over food!
But yes they need a change of staff.
They seem to be more interested entertaining themselves than waiting on the customers.

I have always loved their seafood
Pepper fish being my favorite.
The Thai and kung pao chickens are huge turn ons too

I always vouch for the Chinese in Kolkata, especially around the Park Street area. This was so pathetic that I can easily say that this is the worst that I have had in Kolkata for a long long time.
Soup - crabmeat soup, bland tasteless smelling of raw meat; returned and got hot and sour soup; first time in life I have had a tasteless hot n sour soup.
Lat me kai- flour wrapped chicken strips with fried onions
Noodles and chilli pork - v ordinary, the only good thing is the quantity

Okay now coming to the food... We were 2 people ordered Crispy Chilly Button Mushroom as a starter with a Chicken Wanton soup.. The mushroom preparation was one of the best I had till date... The Wanton soup was good... Then ordered Mixed Chowmein and Schezwan Chicken along with a Breezer for each... The noodle was just average and the Schezwan chicken was not upto the mark... The quantity was good though.. I gave this a 3.5 for the mushroom and the soup... I would like to visit again for the Crispy chilly button mushroom...

A really bad outing..Went there to celebrate mom's b'day but was very disappointing..
The quality of service and food has deteriorated immensely..
The place was desserted..The cutlery and crockery were dirty,the napkins stained..It was horrible..
There was no communication between the kitchen and service guys it seemed..Every time I ordered something,they went to the kitchen to confirm whether it was available or not..
The service staff was busy watching IPL in the television and chatting among themselves...
Coming to the food part,the soups were OK..The red pepper chicken was a standout but there was hardly any red pepper to be seen on the plate..The noodles were very very dry and the chicken main course was really bland and tasteless..The only things appreciable were the Chilly pork and Darsaan at the end..The portion sizes were well enough..
Having heard so much about Waldorf,it was really a let down...

Ambiance : 7/10 (Pleasant and comforting)
Service : 3.5/10 (A total let down)
Food : 6/10 (Not so great)
Value for Money : 6/10

Had dinner here on Sunday night, there were six of us in total. The place was surprisingly vacant for a weekend, only 2-3 tables were occupied. 

We tried a variety of chicken starters including chilli chicken and chicken wings. Both were good and non spicy as requested. 

For main course, we had chop suey, noodles and chicken gravy. The noodles and chop suey quantity is pretty large - 1 portion can serve two famished adults with ease. 

Overall,  a pleasant experience this place turned out to be!

If you have a special attraction for Chinese when you are in Kolkata this is worth a try. Its Chinese food is styled toward Indian tastes but is quite good considering. There are the usual chinese offerings on the menu and its not expensive . The service is good and friendly , just round the corner from Park street in Russell street. A nice place to try chinese.

To my surprise the place was totally empty on a Saturday evening. I went with a friend of mine.The place seems decent and there were many seating arrangements. The waiters were busy watching tv as there were hardly any guests. We ordered a chilli fish which was decent enough. There were 8 odd pieces and they were tasty. The  szechuan prawn was a bit of a disappointing. The drinks menu is  a bit weird . The categorization for whiskey,vodka and rum was regular, premium & super premium. Although I ordered premium as they said they will serve Signature or BP . So that was ok. The place is okeyish. Last but not the least there ATM card swipe machine was not working. So we had to play 2000 rs in  hard cash in this period of demonetization

Below average food, very little options.. not worth the money, looking at the quality of food.
We ordered chilly chicken boneless which was pretty bad. Same is the feedback of the Waldorf special Cantonese chowmein and chilly prawns (which was supposed to be dry. We found gravy all around).

Only facesaver was the pepper fish which was good and hence the 2 rating.

Coming to the deserts, we were recommended Christmas pudding which was nothing but plum cake with an icing. So did not find it much appetising .

We went to this place on sashthi...when the whole of Calcutta was busy pandal hopping..we were busy gorging on a delicious late lunch from Waldorf! The place is air conditioned and pretty clean and spacious. The interiors are done up nicely with dim lighting and all to set up a good ambience for the customers.
---------
---------
We ordered crispy butterfly prawn and spring chicken as starters with our drinks. We ordered 3 pegs of royal challenge premium whisky and four screwdrivers.
The prawn was sweet and very tasty. The batter was crispy and the prawn was plump and packed with flavor and taste. The chicken on the other hand was average. The coating on it was not too crispy.

For the main course we ordered egg fried rice, two chicken fried rice, a kung Pao chicken and a Sweet and sour fish.
----------
----------
The food was really great in terms of amount as well taste. It was clean and beautifully presented to us. The rice in the fried rice was fluffy and white. I loved it. Sometimes simple and uncomplicated food is just what the body needs.
------------
------------
Service was quick and the people who waited our table were gracious enough to accept all our demands. But I would have appreciated it, if the table decoration was uniform and up to the mark in all the tables.
I had a lovely time there, you will too.
Do give this place a try.

With bright red interiors and dropping lamp shades, Waldorf is a typical Old Calcutta restaurant and bar. The staff remind you of characters straight from a bengali film of the late 80s. They are courteous and friendly, and are helpful with the suggestions. 

The food and drinks are reasonably well priced, and are in line with the quantity as well as quality. 

We ordered for:

1. Szechuan Duck - This was my first tryst with duck, and I can safely say that it was very good. Somewhere between mutton and chicken, this stood out. Again, many might not take well to that taste and hardness of the meat. Nonetheless, it should be tried once and you might just like it.

2. Golden Fried Prawns: One of the better golden fried prawns I have had over the years. There is no excess of besan or maida, and the juiciness would sure make you yearn for more.

We also had two cocktails - Screwdriver and Bloody Mary, and both were okay.

This is one of my favourite places. This is a very old restaurant which offers you good food and drinks. Quality and quantity wise food is excellent, one plate can serve two persons easily especially if u r with ur girlfrnd :p :) many people love their duck preparations, fr example whole duck in Peiking sauce. But I find lamb and fish starter dishes are awesome. May be its because Im nt very used to hv ducks. noodles are better to avoid, go for rice dishes. A side dish or starter along with a chilled beer would be an awesome combination fr a lazy rainy evening. Staffs are also very good and helpful. Jst one last thing u might nt get mobile network inside the restaurant. But tht can help u enjoy the meal peacefully :D

Went there for dinner and ordered drinks, an appetizer and entree, but the staff refused to accommodate my order. I tried to order a dish of only asparagus (which was on the menu) and offered to pay extra, but I was told that they don't do any substitutions or changes, you can only order exactly what is on the menu as it is written. I left. I was told the the "chef would be overrun and confused" if customers made changes to their order. What a waste that the staff can only blindly following procedure. Rules and regulations about how to get things done are important, but not to the exclusion of good customer service. Stay away from this place.

Waldrof used to be my favorite place whenever I used to come to park street. Still remember those big aquariums all over when it used to be located on the place where the presently Marco Polo is situated.

##Location: Now they have moved to the side of the road opposite to the The Park Hotel on the bylane of the same.

##Experience: They have always been good with their food which is their USP I feel. The quality and taste is very nice too. Pricing is reasonable compare to the quantity and standard. But where they lag is the ambiance first as previously it was amazing now turned down to an usual one  and the service which failed to impress me . I personally have liking towards them but my opinion would be working on the loopholes for improvement and betterment to regain the authority .

Hmmm, it really hurts to post something bad for this eatery. It was one my favourite. Today we ordered fried wantons, Peking duck, PAN fried fish and others. The food is so so so ordinary for this place. Very badly done. Couldn't eat the duck as was very smelly. They took it back and came back with chicken dish and charged us for both.
Very ordinary device and ambience.

One of Kolkata’s oldest restaurants, Waldorf has withstood the test of time and remained as one of the go to places for some good, inexpensive Indo-Chinese food. Located in a prime part of Russel Street, the interiors of the restaurant are red hued and quite pretty. Waldorf has two sections with comfortable seating and attentive (albeit unsmiling) servers. Coming to the food, here’s what I ordered:

-	Waldorf Special Fried Rice – My favourite one here, this special fried rice has literally everything you want in it, including chicken, eggs, pork, baby corns, mushrooms, and prawns. There were two huge shrimps added too – just for good measure!

-	Kung Pao Vegetables – Extremely spicy and loaded with veggies, the Kung Pao Vegetables are for those who like the aforementioned traits in their food.

-	Chicken Noodles – The noodles tasted like your regular Indian Chinese noodles with chicken pieces. 

-	Pepper Chicken – I am so glad for this order because it was really, really good. The chicken morsels were succulent and adequately seasoned. 

The amount of food at Waldorf is generous and the price of each item does not burn a hole in your pocket. Hence, it is an ideal place for throwing causal treats or birthday meals with friends. The food is good in quality and rich in quantity. Have a g(f)ood day!

My friend had vouched for this old legendary restaurant but nothing really attracted me about this place once I found an opportunity to visit it, except for the neat and prim decor, the walls and the hanging Chinese lanterns. I hadn't been too keen on visiting it after surveying it on Zomato, but had been dragged to it by some acquaintances.
I found the food average-tasting, nothing special. We'd had soup, chicken and fried rice which had tasted like regular ordinary Chinese food.

Known for its seafood and duck delicacies, Waldorf has been a stalwart in the city's food history. More than half a century old, this place might not have the glitz and glamour of the past, but it has held on its own and continues to serve good Chinese. 

Their chimney soup and spring rolls were my favorites as a kid. Duck was considered something rate to be in the menu of any restaurant even a few years back, and so we always made it a point to have duck when we went to Waldorf. 

It often has various festivals and events where over can try out special preparations. Waldorf, with its moderate pricing and prime location, still remains an attractive option for Chinese lovers.

A dying legend quite evidently ! Walked in on a Wednesday evening at 2215 and was the only family in the whole restaurant ! The stewards were too busy watching TV and one your enthusiastic boy came and took our order and was the only good thing in the restaurant ! 

The stewards promptly started clearing the empty tables all around us and the order taker walked up even before we got starters to place last orders in case any as the kitchen was closing ! 

The food was moderate ... Compared to the lesser known places even on Park Street, many items were not available on the menu, but have to say the prawns were super fresh and would have made a great meal if only cooked better !

Definitely not going back ... Truly my sea song visit to a great dying legend !

Waldorf.. I hear it's one of the oldest of its kind in Kolkata. This standalone restaurant is cozy n pocket friendly place with a bit too dim lighting for my liking. The service was excellent. About the food ..it's was awesome.. the portions were more than enough and each n every dish tasted amazing. special mention to lamb Sichuan and fish in oyestor sauce. lat mai kai chicken was a disaster though.  Deducting 1 point for lighting and outdated decor.

Waldorf - One of the oldest restaurants in town. I always prefer stand alone eating joints. So, I have been here as a kid. I hardly remember what I ate that time, unlike now. Old is always gold as they say and I strongly agree. I like the decor, ambience is not bad either. They serve good Chinese food. Might not be brilliant, but you can give it a try, at least once. :)

This place serves the best Chinese food after tung fong in Park Street. Ordered chicken sweet corn soup for the starters. It was decent and the quantity is enough for two. The chicken meifoon is really good and the kung pao chicken has its own unique taste. The ambiance is nice and cozy and should be tried out once at least.

I don't know if this is the same restaurant that used be in Park Street but it is very very different. The old waldorf was a great place for Chinese food and pretty much authentic at that, but that was in the 80s I suppose. 

This joint is nothing more than a joint and serves average quality food although the pork is good. Provides a place for friends but service is a tad low in energy. So so....

One of the oldest names for Chinese, we landed here for an afternoon lunch with family. The place is spread out in a typical Chinese restaurant with shades of red color and Chinese lamps. Service was prompt and courteous. The babycorn chilli starter was quite good..crispy and spiced up with sauted green chillies. The waldolf special cantonese chowmein was a mix of soft noodles and a combo of 3 non veg meats - chicken, prawns and pork. Why those 3 specifically,  no one really knows...but it didn't disappoint with its fulfilling taste - veggies were in right proportion with the meat and glazed with white sauce gravy. A tad little bland for our taste buds..but nothing that got corrected with their special schezwan sauce. The chilli garlic noodles alongwith veg Manchurian gravy was also gobbled up in good taste by other family members. The staff was courteous enuf to give us an extra serving of just the white gravy for the Chinese chopsuey. A good Chinese lunch. With

Located in a very convenient place in Russell Street.
The ambience seemed appealing and the decor, to some extent.
But as soon as the food got delivered, the scenario changed.
Hardly did I like the food.
The prawns tasted yuck and looked like it was stored in the sauce bottles and served directly from there. 
Overall, a bad experience.

Coming to the food,we ordered panfried fish,waldorf special rice and mongolian chicken. We absolutely loved the rice,a must try for everyone. The panfried fish and mongolian chicken were just as spicy as we wanted. Overall a nice place to visit with a nostalgic ambience.

Ordered traditional Chinese rice..that was inedible(with a weird smell). And the famous spicy dish called Schezuan chicken, that too tasted so dull.
It totally wasted my new year evening. Will never visit this place ever in my life. Waste of money, and torturing your tongue.

The Waldorf was a surprising addition to my page -- I had originally planned on going to a different restaurant. Located just off Park Street, opposite Indian Hobby Centre, the Waldorf serves up strictly chinese cuisine and does a decent job.

I personally liked my visit a good deal -- the decor was very appealing to the eye, working subtly on us; the colour scheme too does only help the restaurant's appeal. Their service could be better however. The waiters are friendly enough, with the exception of one rather bitter person. 

Their food is alright -- at par with Amber and the likes. We dined as a foursome and ended up with a bill of 1300. Definitely a pretty decent place in terms of value for money. There was no standout dish -- everything was pretty ordinary. I'd say I was a little disappointed with the Kung Pao Chicken (not what it's supposed to taste like). The sides were alright and the cereals were edible enough. Food was overall very edible. No complaints.

However, they had no pork. Which was a major disappointment. I sort of feel that the Waldorf is better suited as a lunch place anyway.

Average food. Decent experience.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

I went there by seeing the zomato reviews for duck and lamb preparation. But I don't think the taste was that good!!  Chair, tables are not comfortable as well and the service was just above the average. The starter golden fried prawn is also not that good. You can find better taste in other Chinese restaurants.

I have been to this place few years back on saptami with few friends of mine... 

Decor : Total Chinese restaurant of 70's.... 

Ambience : Nice and calm.....

Food : We ordered 2 Mix noodles and 1 Chicken Fried Rice with 1 chilli chicken...

Mix Noodles was Very dull and u'll feel sorry for your money

Rice was even more dull... probably one of the most dull rice i ever had...

Chilli chicken was still better than the rest.... was little spicy....

Price : Reasonable .. but comparing the taste... wastage of money....

Service : Cant say and say bad also... but i must say they got a shortage of plates and bowls... i was having the rice... and my other friends were having noodles.. am little slow in having food.. i kept the bowl half filled with rice so that i could have it later... the waiter came and served the rice to all of us without even asking before doing so... so that he could have the bowl..which was really funny...

This restaurant is located at Russel Street forming a cluster of about 3-4 restaurants at that place. It is quite spacious and can seat around 30 -40 people at a go. Seats are not that comfortable with only plastic and wooden chairs being available. However,the food here is absolutely marvellous like most of the other chinese restaurants at Park Street. Red pepper chicken is a speciality at this place and should be definitely tried on a visit here. There is also a bar housed at the corner well separated form the restaurant itself. Overall a decent place offerung excellent food at reasonable prices.

It is a shame to watch such an old chinese restaurant deteriorate so much!! First of all behaviour and attitude of the staff is not proper. They made us feel like we are eating for free!! We ordered Mixed Cantonese Gravy noodles, mixed fried rice and kung-pao chicken. The noodles was good but the fried rice was pathetic and left a bad taste in the mouth. Chicken was nothing special and overall we were disappointed. Add to that the attitude and staff! Me and my friends decided never to set foot in here in the near future.

Waldorf used to me my parents' favourite Chinese restaurant. However, our last visit was quite disappointing. The dimly lit interiors was calm and inviting with the pentatonic notes of a typical chinese music playing in the background. However, the food was not up to scratch. We ordered the pan fried fish. It was okay. For the mains we had chicken chowmein, chicken fried rice and schezuan chicken. The portion size was quite generous but the rice lacked any  flavour whatsoever. Also the gravy of the chicken seemed a bit on the watery side. As for the chocolate ice cream for dessert, it looked like a rectangular slab of ice cream cut off from a big ice cream bar... no scoop, no sauce, no nuts. It tasted okay, but could have been so much more. Service however was prompt and the waiters were courteous.

Overall, the experience was a bit disappointing, especially compared to our previous visit years ago. I wouldn't mind revisiting it, but I don't think it will be anytime soon.

Went to Waldorf as part of a nostalgia trip - at the instance of my 85 year old Dad who had old memories of the place. I have myself written about it in my blog the Hakka Route: http://ghoses.blogspot.in/2014/08/the-hakka-route_10.html. The restaurant has shifted from its original location at the corner of park Street and Camac Street (opp the Park Street Post office) now to Russel Street - in the original Sutton Seeds premises. Being right opposite The Bengal Club have seen it often but never ventured in - put off by the round-the-year Hilsa and Duck Festival. Therefore, this evening before booking a table I was skeptical and personally went across to check - if it had any link with the original establishment. Since, it was walk down memory lane - we stuck to the old favourites - (rather than experiment with the newer innovations) Shrimp Balls as starters, Crab Asparagus Soup. Mixed Fried Rice (with Pork), Sweet n Sour Prawns and Soya-Chilli Chicken. The first two (starter and soup) lived upto to expectation and must say the quality of the shrimps / prawns and crabs were discernibly good. The missus thought the fried rice was a wee bit under-cooked (tho my     Dad disagreed and thought it was just right). The Hakka Chow was ok - but the Soya Chilli Chicken - nothing like what one remembers or still get at Chung-Wah and Tangra. Though I doubt, if we shall go back there in a hurry (tastes have evolved and for the authentic old  Calcutta Hakka Chinese one would still go

I came here once long back with my family and so thaught of visiting this place again as reminded by mom. I came here with my friends on a Saturday. The interiors is vintage and kinda same as before.  We ordered lamb and prawn balls for starters. Lambs were bit hard and needed to be cooked more. For main course we ordered Fried Rice,  Lemon Fish and Cashew Chicken. I would say the test detoriated . I missed the old flavours. The cost was pocket friendly it won't burn a whole. 2.5 k for 5 persons.

Among the many restaurants in Park Street if you want to have an inexpensive,quite, Oriental meal without zero or minimum waiting time then Waldorf is the place to be. Nothing great with its décor or ambiance but great with its food, & it has stood the test of time.
It’s a favorite among me & my Chinese loving pals & we invariably land up ordering the Cantonese gravy noodles.
The food is tasty & comes in sufficiently large quantity. The staffs are courteous & I especially should mention this as they rarely give us a look even though we chat up at a dangerously high pitch.

On the 18th of june, i went to Waldorf with family. It was my 4th visit to this place and definitely the worst one. We ordered momos, golden fried prawns, couple of bowls of soup for starters and they were all pretty good. But that's where the good experience ended. We ordered main course and what a disappointment!! We called for chilli pork, prawns in black bean sauce, chicken fried rice and mixed noodles, one portion each. This part of the food was a nightmare as i couldn't for the life of me understand why They would make everything sweet. I could understand if they made a mistake mixing the seasoning but the manager insisted that this was how they made it. I knew he was lying as this was not my first visit but i doubt If I'd like to go back. I would still like to recommend the momos at Waldorf but i think that's about it.

Waldorf used to be one of the finest and more authentic Chinese casual dining joint in the city..It has savoured chinese lovers with delectable fares for decades,however sadly it is not the same place it used to be..At one point of time it was located on Park Street where today Marco Polo is situated,but some years back it relocated to its current address at Russel Street and with it seems to have done away with their past expertise and reputation and actually degraded on all aspects for which it was hailed with legendary status..First of all the ambiance is pretty common place,the interior is smaller than what it used to be..also the servers here literally needs some grooming and training to understand the significance of serving your guests..Finally the quality of food has gone south while their have been significant increase in its rates which do not justify the food they serve..Definitely any day will Recommend Bar-B-Que or Tung Fong for decent economic Chinese food at Park Street area..Still for old times sake some of my more favoured dishes here are:Cantonese Noodles, Chimney Soup, Mandarin Fish,Sambal Prawn and Duck side dishes..Would heavily urge to avoid the pork dishes served here..way too full of fat..Cost for two would be around Rs.1200/-(incl tax) without alcohol..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 2/5
Service: 1/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Went for lunch twice and the place was OK.
Nothing much special about this place except they serve variety.

Tried only chicken items(Chilli Chicken Dry and Gravy, Chicken manchurian) : 7/10 and Friend rice (6/10).
Quantity of food is so much that it becomes difficult for 2 people to finish.

Service was very poor, staff is slow to respond(showing they are very busy) and always roaming here and there, even when almost the whole restaurant is empty.

Considering the Price and Quantity of the food, this place is good. But there are still loads of imporvements to be done in Food and staff.

Why do these restaurants still continue serving food. They simply cheat people with their most unpalatable spreads. Cut throat prices. BAD BAD BAD...! YUK. Don't waste your money. Been there a month ago.

one of my friend came down to kolkata from odisa and we went for a nice Christmas special dinner on 25th dec,2014.we ordered  barbeque rabbit and honey glazzed duck from their special menu. but d waiters serves us two plates of ducks.the meat was made of volcanised rubber for sure and the waiter must forgot that we came here fr dining in , not for swimming in swimming pool and served us d rubber duck
(literally). when we asked him whr ws d barbeque rabbit , he insisted tht we ordered two plates of ducks. he continued arguing with us and we called fr the manager.  he took back one plate of those iron made duck (could be easily used as missile ). we again ordered a pork dish (barbeque chilli pork ) and yes this time  we got pork fat served on our plate. we somehow managed to eat the turkey noodles and left the restaurant hungry and robbed as hell.

p.s. if u r hungry bt do not want to put on weight, if u want to be treated like dirt by unprofessional, ill mannered waiters , this place is a must visit.

There are few Chinese restaurants in Park Street which you can trust any day any season. They are time tested. They may surprise you but surely will not disappoint you. Waldorf is one such place. I remember , in childhood days I used to eagerly wait for the day when dad will declare a dinner in Waldorf. The recent visit did not create such a joyous feeling but I was happy. The food we ordered were served fast. The seafood soup was nice. Crispy lamb was good choice as a starter. We ordered special fried rice which was not exceptional. Garlic pork was testy. I must mention about the quantity which was huge. Overall dinner was enjoyable.

One of the legendary old Kolkata restaurants. There was a time when Waldorf was synonymous with first rate Chinese food in Kolkata (so i have heard from my parents and have read in books). Today, i guess it suffers from the gastronomic evolution of the city and onslaught of innovative concept restaurants, whereas it has stood still in time and tradition. The ambiance is plane. glaring red walls and commonplace chinese decorations like fans and lanterns. In my few visits to this place I have never faced any bad behavior from the wait staff. They have always been courteous and attentive. Food is lipsmackingly good!! I mean the Cantonese Noodle is to die for and is one of my favorite comfort foods. Another dish that i keep going back for is the Pan-fried Squid. Oh My God!!! succulent squares of squid lightly quoted with flour in a spicy red sauce with julienne green peppers!! I can devour at least  3 servings at one go. Can't have enough of it!!! I like the chili pork too although they tend to serve a lot of fat (I personally don't mind but some people might find it unpalatable). the crab claws in chili oil were also good. I like the way Waldorf food reflects the simplicity of the chinese fare yet their preparations cater to the Kolkata palate.
One of the best places to have chinese in Kolkata with a touch of nostalgia on the side. That's Waldorf for me.

Located at Russell Street, there's quite a few good in fact legendary Chinese restaurants around (i.e. Tung Fung), however this place is quite average. Nothing special about the food, nothing that stays with you. Same goes for the staff who seemed uninterested and cold.

Now situated in a prime and good location if fails in satisfying its customers or even providing proper service.
I have visited this restaurant a number of times so it is definate for me to say.
Now food is average plus less in quantity and highly priced comparing to what we have better ones around the area like bar b q it surely not worth it.
Decent sitting place average ambience 
Can be tried but nothing so special about it.

Went for dinner and left after starters. Working in a PSU bank has a few benifits, one if them being the fact that customers treat you like king. So, went to this place for dinner cos my customer wanted to celebrate the new year with us. Had some chicken, pepper fish and prawn with some red wine. Chicken was okayish and tasted a bit stale but the pepper fish was good. The wine was cool though. The ambiance of the place is good coupled with poor/slow customer service also a tad costly. 
We thus left after the starters and had a good dinner at Arsalan, Park Circus area.

A last pending from last year . I was with my closed ones over here last month of last year and the feeling was exactly the same which I had ages back wen I was in school and used to visit with family. This place has an old charm which cannot be forgotten and one will surely cherish. I love the place and the warmth of this place though i feel over the time period the attitude of the staffs have changed a bit and service has become slow gradually. 
Ok now lets come to food part well the food taste remains the same as before . we had ordered for starters which was really yum specially the prawns but the fried momo was not that good and we took parcel for main course though I must say the taste of chicken was very bad not the taste but the quality of chicken ,
Rest all good  price affordable .

I am having great pains to write this review. The collection of restaurants like Waldorf, Magnolia, Moulin Rouge have been time immemorial. In the recent past, swanky new restaurants have come up which are providing stiff competition to these legendary places. It is not that the food is very exceptional in the new places and honestly much higher priced than Waldorf. Also the touch of nostalgia and elegance that comes with this place is unmatched. However there are multiple issues to be sorted out in terms of the dishes. I had ordered crispy chilli lamb, duck, pan fried fish but even before that was the total lack of interest from the serving staff to guide/help us. Even to the point that I had to proactively ask for the menu card. All these dishes were disasters with the duck primarily filled with bones, the crispy chilli duck was filled with chilli pellets and almost uneatable and the pan fried fish was too bland. We added mixed fried rice which was quite good. The end bill was also quite high along with the insistence of tips from the servers. The only thing remaining for a visit is the quantity of food they serve and also the nostalgia. Hoping for a better experience the next time.

Let's not beat around the bush and come to the point straight away. My first Waldorf experience dates back to 2002 and from what I can fondly recollect, I did have a memorable experience out here back then, with all the choicest Chinese delicacies subtly flavored with pungent spices invitingly served to me in huge proportions.
Circa 2014... The magnanimity in serving huge proportions hasn't changed, the quality of the food being served has only gone up by a few notches, the prices haven't at all sky- rocketed, the ambiance is potent enough to match any Chinese outlet in Tangra, but I still have to settle for no more than 3.5 for this place. 

You must be wondering why.

Well, all the good work by the staff came undone when one witnessed the sheer haughtiness of the staff , which bordered on arrogance. We were a young group of 7 people coming together after a long time, so we could have been pardoned for being over- enthusiastic and perhaps, a bit unrestrained. But not for one moment and by no stretch of imagination were we pushing the decibel levels beyond acceptable limits. So, the sheer snobbishness of the local staff who came and told us that we were being noisy and juvenile caught us unaware and felt like a rude jolt. Even after calming down and adhering to the so- called "decorum norms", the staff repeatedly came and checked upon us with unmistakable contempt in their eyes, which cannot go down well with any sane, paying customer. Worse, we were sitting right in front of the AC and a few of us were already under the weather with regular cold and cough. When we asked the staff to temper the AC down ,as it was intensifying our cold, all we got in return was a blatant, brazen NO. After requesting again an hour and a half later, they were 'kind' enough to turn it off. While preparing to leave after finishing our meals, the waiters came scampering behind saying "TIP, TIP, TIP..", which we were anyways about to pay and that too, in spite of paying all our service taxes.

Needless to say, we were all left with a taste in the mouth so bitter, we would perhaps have second, or even third thoughts about revisiting the outlet, in spite of the lip- smacking Chinese fare we were served in bountiful proportions. There's nothing to complain about the aesthetics of the restaurant, but if they don't work upon the overall demeanor, I fear customers like us would choose to steer clear of this place, as there are a plethora of options to choose from in Park Street itself.

The fond memories of 2002, sadly, couldn't be replicated. I would still be generous enough to settle for 3.5.

I don't know whether I am worthy of reviewing a legendary restaurant like "Waldorf". It is among the oldest and most cherished restaurants in the heart of Kolkata. Located in Russell street, adjacent to Sam's pub. They are one of the pioneers offering Chinese and other Asian cuisines in town. The interiors of this place has a Chinese touch with those acrylic light shades then to the giant hand fan on the wall, overall the ambience over here is quite soothing. They serves a wide variety of Chinese cuisines ranging from different types of soups, noodles(rice+flour), fried rice; main courses comprised of chicken, lamb, sea foods(fish, prawn, oyster)etc;. Some of their most cherished dishes which savored for decades are- Mongolian chicken, tsing hoi chicken, duck in five spice and oyster, whole mandarin fish, sambal prawn, sweet and sour pork etc. Their range of dessert offerings such as- Waldorf special sundae, tutti fruity, honey and banana etc are succumbing as anything. Restaurant like Waldorf is one of a kind serving uncompromised quality dishes for ages and with conviction.

The name 'Waldorf' used to be on everybody's lips at one point of time in Kolkata. With the jazz music/the soft tune of the piano playing at your back,this place used to be a heaven for weekenders in the early 90s.

Stepping into the 21st century only a little of that old charm remains. With sky rocketing food prices and market competition, this restaurant doesn't have that huge crowd puller anymore.
As a matter of fact unless you are someone from the Old Calcutta neighborhood, you will not be recommending Waldorf.

The last time I had been there I had been there, I still got the smell of that old place,bit this time the pianist played a very different tune,and so did the food.
Had ordered some Lamb Chops and Oriental Grilled Chicken served with peanut butter sauce,and it tasted marvelous. The whisky was good enough to provide the momentum,and we just got along with it.

Service was a little laid back and the menu card was of very little interest to me.
Waldorf may not be the pioneer of these two dishes but the food is definitely good over here.
Coming to the price,our pockets were literally burnt. Charges went up to almost 1500 INR for one person. We were left awestruck....
Guess the Management has to take some wise decisions on curbing the sky rocketing menu prices at this place. But all in all it's actually over priced.

Till then I will not recommend Waldorf to the rest of the foodies,because there are much better options nowadays.

What to say about Waldorf. If I am to keep it simple, I will simply say that it is my favourite place to dine out. Another one of those places where me and my brother are frequent, we love the wide array of dishes that Waldorf has to offer. And not only that what makes the Waldorf experience worth it are the wonderful manager and floor staffs who are always eager to offer their insights as to what dishes should one pair with each other.
Coming to the fare on offer, gastronomes (like me) can find delight in the variety that Waldorf has to offer. From squid to duck to pork, chicken or other sea food, Waldorf provides a lot of options. One of our faourites are the roast pork belly and, well, anything that includes duck. The seafood soup is also a wonderful option one may try at the beginning of the meal. The Waldorf special chow faan is also really delectable. 
The beverages on offer at Waldorf are impressive as well, with the costs not being too much out of control.
On the negative side, the decor of the place could be done up a bit, maybe a bit more of oaken furniture, carpets and drapes to add that old world victorian charm, but when it comes to food, there are few other places in Park Street that I think can match up to Waldorf. Eagerly awaiting my next visit.

Ive been to this place a few times. One of the older restaurants of Kolkata, this place signifies the age old charm of park street. Dimly yet intriguingly lit, subtle yet rustic design of the place with its typical red Chinese dragon wall hangers and broken,  torn apart sofas this has the nostalgia of older park street. Obviously this place is way past its golden days, however the rustic charm and name itself "the Waldorf" adds to the elegancy of it.
This is perhaps the only place in park Street where you will get place for even a large number of ppl on days like ashtami, 24th, 31st eve without much hassle or queue. So if you r a large group and want to have dinner on the prime time on the prime days and the famed restaurant of park street this place is your best bet. 
About food? Well there's nothing much special. Their food quality n quantity remains same thru out the year even on the rush holidays. I remember the dish called lat me kai, deep fried pieces of soft juicy chicken served with minimal fried salad, this goes nicely with your drink. The rest I dont remember as I wasn't much impressed by the preparations. 
Price wise, this is exorbitantly priced for the quality and quantity of the food. With drinks be ready to shed 1700 for 2 hungry persons!! But then again its 'the Waldorf' u have to shed to take the name n tag n update on your fb status on prime days.

PS for this price u can defly find better place but not in park street on the days mentioned above n without waiting.

This place happens to be Calcutta's oldest Chinese restaurant and has apparently been operating since 1952. The place serves the best Cantonese Noodles I've ever had, that also happens to be a great value-for-money considering that its helping is massive! Their Kung Pao Chicken too looks quite fascinating but we were done for the day, as the place was our second stop for dinner, so will be trying that on my next visit.

Waldorf is a place I have been going for a long time. I like going there for Christmas as they serve Turkey and Rabbit though most people do not opt for it. The food is very good and they specialize in pork. This place is also historically very  famous and a great hit for all members of the family. Excellent place and a must visit.

Waldorf....been there countless times since the days it was located in park street instead of Russel Street. Everytime I have gone there, I have come back satisfied. The decor is great and the food is top notch. I have tried amost every item in their menu, yet anytime I feel like having chinese food its the 1st name that comes to my mind. The fried prawn ball is to die for and the taste is same as I had the 1st time some 10-12years back.

Today i got the chance to visit one of the oldest restaurants in kolkata, most probably started around 1952. but the best part is no one can get that oldest feeling once he is in. the ambience, decors are quite impressive and modern. stuffs are nice. just faced one problem with the sofaseats, they are too low for the standard height peoples and they don't have any 5 seater arrangements on chair completely, so we had to take those sofas. 

now regarding food, i have tried fried chicken wings, pan fried squid in starter along with mixed fried rice, chilli pork, five spice lamb and mandarin fish in main course. i must say the starters were too good, specially squid. we initially ordered 2 plates, it was so good that after having those 2 we had to order for another dish. the rice was good and quantity was huge. 3 plates would be fine for 5 people after having starters. pork was good, but a bit hard, should be little softened. in mandarin fish, they actually provide a quite large single piece of fish and it was soso. the lamb was also nothing special, just fine to have. 

the biggest observation that i had is their menu is quite changed from the uploaded ones in zomato, both in price and items. so, if any one is planning to estimate, please add 20 to 30 bucks more in each dishes.  also their price is on the higher side, cosidering this i should admit that i can get the similar taste in lesser price in kolkata, for sure. 
but still as a whole, i can recommend this place to visit atleast once specially for their starters and i will too...

A nice restaurant which comes up with a lot of history from the Kolkata context. It was on park street years ago but then moved to russell street. Have been there quite many times and it doesnt disappoint. Its the closest to authentic chinese you can get near parks street. The ambience is slightly dim but that can be ignored for the taste of the food. U can try whatever and all of them are good. Service is decent. Would recommend the same strongly

The quality doesnt live up to the price.. Its been in the parkstreet area for quite some time and I was a frequenter to this resturant. But my recent visits have left me disappointed. The quality of food has definitely fallen from its previous quality.

I have been going to Waldorf as a kid.
It is my dad's favourite Chinese joints in the city. I remember previously it used to be near Park Mansion. One could watch the fast moving cars while eating. 
Perhaps the thing I like Waldorf the most is the amazing Chimney soup. I always thought of the way they served the Chimney soup as some mystery being served. And boy, it IS some mystery. I have the Chimney soup all the time whenever I go to Waldorf.
Also, the roast duck is delicious.
However, I'd have to admit that the new address for Waldorf isn't AS appealing as the old one. It simply misses the charm and is tad too small.

Waldrof is one of the oldest eateries in Park Street serving Chinese food. My parents would visit this place regularly when I was a child. It whips up nostalgia. The restaurant has shifted to Russel Street. 
Still there is an old world charm. Price is reasonable though the quality is not same as it was formerly.

''Sir, 2,400 ka bill aaya, thoda aur tip''

Would you like being told by the waiter that the tip you gave him was too less?? Well, this was my first time here and that was my experience over there. Our bill was over 2,000 but still, this doesn't mean that we HAVE to tip the waiter. It's not like we asked him to get something from outside for us, or any extra service, we were a group of seven and we came there for lunch. 

I must say that the food is really good, BUT I will not visit here again because of the behaviour of this particular waiter (don't know about the others). A tip is optional, never compulsory. What makes the waiters think that we are obliged to pay them a tip, and even when we do give a tip, the guy says ''Sir, 2,400 ka bill aaya, thoda aur tip''. I straight away went to the manager and told him about this. not sure if it's resolved, but this sure will prevent me from coming or even recommending this place to anyone. First review on this site, didn't want to put up something negative, but I really felt the need to share my experience. No doubt, the food is really good!

went to Waldorf on Sunday after a year or so. Its nice to see my favourite restaurant still serves great food typical of that Chinese flavor so hard to get in other Chinese restaurants of the same category. The mixed gravy chowmein my favourite had sufficient meat although prawns could be abit more. The chilli chicken has that signature waldorf flavour and so is their finger licking crispy chilli lamb. . we ordered  chowmein, Lamb, chilli chicken and soup along with a starter. The only thing dissapointing is the incessant noise of a mix of Hindi and western music hitting you from all sides and which seems to be coming from a restaurant next door.. something should really be done about that. Staff seem cordial  although i wish they would smile a bit instead of looking like dead men on the verge of retirement. The ambience in waldorf when it used to be on park street was homely however the new place on Russel street needs a definite makeover, one wonders why the need for an insipid looking large aquarium that spoils the looks of the entire front facade. However all said and done, my dinner was great and i will always recommend this restaurant for the great food it serves.

My first dining experience  at Waldorf dates back to 2003. I was so in love with this place that bi-weekly or tri-weekly visits became a norm.
I remember how I used to sit with my platter full of stuffed crabs  and indulge in long hours of chatter with friends. Gone are those days when one could afford to pass time idly....not being much in a hurry to make money. It used to be just near the entrance of Russel Street....a cosy scarlet red themed chinese eatery that was a legend in its own right. 

This year on my last visit to Kolkata I decided to dine here...I had to choose between Waldorf and 2 other competing stalwart restaurants in the Park Street area but Waldorf won hands down.

The menu had changed over time....rather it was a complete new one...with all my old favs missing from the list. We ordered the Waldorf special soup, ham and woodear fried rice, rice noodles and Five spice fish. The food was good...but not to the point of being overwhelming. I missed my old Waldrof...but then everything changes with time. The experience was overall a nice one....more so because I was lucky enough to occupy the same seat I used to long time back...NOSTALGIC !!!!

Me and my husband had been here for a quite dinner, its literally quite just 2/3 tables occupied. The decors are done with black and red not so impressive. Ambience is okayish nothing great to talk about.

We ordered the Hot n sour soup and Thai spring rolls for starters.The soup arrived first, i din like the texture of the soup it was way too thick for hot n sour soup. The Spring rolls with Thai spices inside were very yum.For the main course we took a egg shzewan fried rice with Thai chicken curry, my husband said then side dish was very yum. I liked the fried rice it wasn drk and rightly cooked and spiced.

They have a lotta interesting dishes on their menu for sea food lovers.

Mysuggestion is they should be adding some more on their menu cards for vegetarians.

OMG I love the food here! I was in Kolkata for ten days but managed to go here twice just because I loved it so much. The Octopus soup, a delicacy from their seafood special menu was flavorful and the octopus was fresh and tender. The Mixed Cantonese Chowmein was delicious with a white gravy and chicken and prawns. I couldn't get over the Pork Chilly Garlic Noodles which were bursting with flavor and went perfectly with the Roast Chilly Pork. I also tried squid in a sweet and spicy sauce from the seafood menu. This was the only disappointment as the squid was overcooked and had become too chewy. But overall, I love the food here and the menu has a wide range of delicious dishes.

Me and my dad decided to visit this place since we were craving some Chinese food and didnt have time to visit tangra. 
Upon entering, the waiters were quite welcoming and they guided us through the specials. There is a lot of pure seafood like crabs, squid and lobsters on the menu but my father wasnt too confident in them so we decided to play it safe and ordered a cantonese mixed chow, a garlic pork and some drumsticks of heaven. 
All three of them were quite good, the drumsticks of heaven being the best, they were very flavorsome and the pieces were quite big(refer to pictures below). The garlic pork was pretty bland and it tasted like authentic chinese(which is a good thing), the quality of the noodles was also pretty good. The prices were reasonable  and all the three items were between Rs.170 and Rs.210 each.
My father was telling me about this place and its history(its quite old) and although it was my first visit, i really enjoyed it and felt that they have maintained at least some quality over the years. However, i still think there are far better chinese options in Kolkata.
3.5/5 for me.

The new Waldorf on Russel St. seems to have gone astray somewhere. From the Park Street location to its smaller and somewhat seedy ambience its lost its character and the food its flavour !!Went across for old times sake and wished hadnt >>>!!The food,standard noodle(Haka),prawn in garlic sauce,Charsu tasted stale . The Chinese veg dish was all mixedup and more like  Delhi pavement bhaji preperation. Sorry Waldorf ---another Calcutta landmark surely about to disappear.

This restaurant is an utter delight. 
First things first. Its serves the best snack with booze in the city! Its this yummy chips, still couldn't figure out the ingredient, but trust me it is very tasty and goes excellently with beer. We finished five plates of it!
We had this unique dish called Kay Chee. Twas excellent.
The Butterfly Prawns were crispy, tender inside, flavorful.
Szechuan fried rice with Kung Pao Chicken was a super hit combination!
Portions are generous. We had to pack up for home :-D
Yes, might be a tad bit heavy on your pocket but for special occasions with special food, it is worth it!

I've been eating at Waldorf for ages now and it pains me to see how much this place has degraded. Gone are the days when you would be licking your fingers after eating their fried rice,chowmeins and chicken delicacies. Now they make just average food. You’ll get better food at several other restaurants at lower prices. I sincerely hope that someday Waldorf regains its formal glory.

This has been an amazing experience for me to taste chinese foods. It's a bar cum restaurant. Food is really of very good quality. Quantity is fare enough when price implication is considered. The taste can only be justified by a gourmet......... and for me it is 10 on 10.

We had fish fries and fish fingers of vetki.......... lobster and prawns at the starter with soda lime. Crab preparation was awesome. Mixed fried rice......... with chicken, kucho chingri(prawn), pork and mixed chow(noodles). 

A must have restaurant for families, colleagues, friends, peers.

Waldorf is a very old Park Street restaurant. Probably one of the oldest Chinese restaurants when ‘Calcutta’ did not even know Tangra China Town. I went there with my two friend Soumitra Kumar Sahoo and Vidyasagar Das. On entering the restaurant, we were greeted cordially by their friendly and courteous staff, who showed us our table. Waldorf is reputed for serving lip-smacking Chinese dishes. We ordered ‘Kung Pao Chicken’, ‘Waldorf Cantonese Chowmein’, ‘Szechuan Fried Rice’, ‘Ginger and Capsicum Fried Rice with Mushroom’ and ‘Szechuan Mix Vegetables’. What else do you look for when you get to eat tasty and authentic Chinese dishes! I particularly liked their ‘Waldorf Cantonese Chowmein’ and ‘Szechuan Mix Vegetables’. Each spice retained its individual flavor and aroma. We also loved their ‘Kung Pao Chicken’, which was delicately cooked in spices and sauces. I also liked the quality of the food and the prices are too on the reasonable side. Recommended specially for family eat-outs.

Many good memories are attached with it. My previous office was in Park Street and I used to hang out quite a lot those days over there. Deep Fried Sesame Prawns are signature starters here, and I still can smell the ever-appetizing scent of it! Several number of sultry noon of my life were spent in Waldorf table with those sesame prawns and Waldorf Special Soup accompanying me. Their choupsuey is good, not that oily. I also liked their Kung Pao chicken which is not that spicy here in comparison with other restaurants. And they provide with adequate quantity of cashew-nuts to check the spiciness of the dish. Among desserts, their Date Pancake Ice Cream and Mocha Almond Fudge are my favorite. Price they charge is very reasonable and quantity they supply is quite sufficient with substantial taste in it. Apparently it appears less spacious as it's narrower in the front side, but it has space inside. It's my all-time favorite old restaurant. I'd rate 3.5 out of 5 to it.

Located in Russel Street, place is just beside Florina / opp to Ganguar (corner of Russel Street)... They have a small hoarding of Waldrof (its difficult to find out for first timers)...

Just stepping in, the place has an old decor but quite to my surprise the place is quite spacious... Like it has wooden chairs, fish aquarium, old staff and very very limited items for vegetarians... 

The staff taking our order helped us in discovering some vegetarian items and finally we ordered three of them... 

Every table has Catch salt and paper with a small plant placed in the middle... 

Coming to the bar menu, it has very very limited menu but the prices are reasonable.. In case one's a brand conscious for his drinks, i m not sure that he's gonna find his one in the list since it has only Kingfisher beer, two variety of Scotch and few varieties of whisky...
Coming to the food part: Ordered  chilly babycorn, veg manchurian and veg noodles...

Chilly babycorn and noodles were oily and manchurian was dry rather we told him gravy one.... Food tasted very ordinary.. Quantity is very less for two people

Overall, its a place where i would only when some1 is giving up party otherwise its a no for me in case they do increase their menu food along with the quantity and quality

this is a huge indochinese restaurant located at russel street. The entrance is quite small and its a bit difficult to locate , if you are a first timer.
 Inside, its huge with a section dedicated to the family. Interior is clean having a typical looks common to all chinese restaurant. a huge aquarium , big wall hanging hand fans , etc are all the common features of the kolkatan chinese restaurant s. 

all the decors and the ambiance gives a very old feeling, as if we are sitting inside an old 90 s restaurant. the most noticable thing is that almost all of the staffs are mid aged men and almost all of the customers were senior citizen. all these together makes an aura of travelling back in time.

coming to the food part,i always noticed that their noodles are always oily, the starters like crispy baby corn always lack the batter. though the food is tasty but still 
I will rate the food average due to excessive oil and the less quantity compared to the price.
the bar part doesnt have much variety and you wont have much option s. they have only 1 variety of beer ,3 variety of scotch and few varieties of whisky are available . this constricts the choice of anybody who usualy sticks to a particular brand.
overall i will rate it average and i wont visit it again if they donot take care of the quality of food and increase their bar options.

The experience in Waldorf and beyond it was not at all pleasing. The food was not up to the mark. The sea food fried rice lacked squid, though according to the menu it should be one of the components. The taste of Mongolian chicken was horrible. The chilli octopus though was good. This item was not in the menucard, but was suggested by them. Following the lunch three of us actually had GASTROENTERITIS with severe loose stool and fever. This prompted this review. Please stay away from Waldorf.

My first reaction on entering Waldorf was "it's an old place".
And I was proved right after seeing the first page of the menu card which described how this place was established.

I was not very hungry,so just ordered Sweet Lime Soda,Chicken Steamed momo,chilli garlic noodles and 5 spice chicken.The price is on the reasonable side.

While waiting for the food,I noticed.
1.My table had "catch" salt and pepper.
2.Glasses had stains
3.plates also had stains plus in the same table,one plate was different than the other.

When the momo and Sweet Lime Soda was served:
1.The waiter kept a "Kissan" sauce bottle in the table. :(
2.And the other sauce was not going with the Steamed momos.
3.The momo was tasty,but I've had tastier momos.
4.Sweet Lime Soda was way too sweet.

When the main course was served:
1.Chili garlic noodles was tasty.
2.Five spice chicken was yum.it also had mushrooms which I loved.

I liked the quality of the food,but the service was not upto the mark.The waiters seemed lazy or rather disinterested!
Hence,rating it 3

Previously very popular and a very good restaurant,the quality and also the popularity of the place has gone down of late.I had last visited the place about 4 months back.The quality of food is still good.But it was better previously.
The place has also lost its glamour.They dont maintain it well these days.The place has become a bit shabby.The plates were a bit dirty.The staff seemed lethargic.
But as I said the quality of food is still quite good and the prices are too on the reasonable side.

Visited Waldorf for a quick work lunch today afternoon. The decor, as always, is cosy and inviting. The staff is courteous and friendly, without being too overbearing. As we had always sampled the Chinese fare at Waldorf, we decided to give it a pass and went Asian instead, except for the soup, for which we decided to stick to the old favourite Chicken Sweet Corn Soup. The soup was pleasant without being extraordinary. When it came to the main course, we opted for Nasi Goreng with chicken (Spiced rice cooked with chicken) and Stir fried lamb in hot chilli. The food was served within little time. The Nasi Goreng was spicy rice, with chunks of chicken. I felt the rice was a bit overcooked, and the dish was very bland in appearance. It tasted good, though I would suggest not to opt for it if you do not like spicy food. The Stir fried lamb in hot chilli was spicy, as the name suggests, and cooked to perfection. The combination was extremely spicy, but really tasty food. The prices are moderate. All these with a sweet lime soda, a softdrink, a pint of Budweiser and a tutti-frutti icecream came to around Rs. 1,300/-, and provided a filling meal for two.

This place is surprisingly under-rated! IT has an amazing variety of dishes, be it fish, pork, chicken or duck. I was glad to see that the 'pork' section had WAY more options than the usual 'chilli pork' and 'sweet n sour pork'. And the starters too are a delight - MUST-TRYs include the 100-cornered shrimp balls, chicken winglets, honey glazed pork and pork spare ribs. 
The fish ball soup is classic Chinatown!
The noodles are also unique - neither soaked in oil nor stuck in thick, gooey cornflour 'gravy'!
If you order duck, make sure you ask whether the dish is made with boneless pieces or not. We ordered the duck with five spice and oyster sauce which was nice but inconvenient because the meat was on the bone!
The Lat Cheu Nu Neuk (pork with green chilli garlic and oyster sauce) was also super yummy.

The best thing about WALDORF is that the Price is not too much but the quantity served is pretty good.
If you want to have good Chinese food which is budget-friendly ,go for WALDORF.

I have been a frequent visitor at Waldorf for quite a long time and admired their services and their Chinese dishes, my favorite being the Red Pepper Chicken. The ambience is nice and quiet and the interiors are also well decorated.

However, I went there today (15/04/2013) and was shocked to see that both their services and the quality of their foods have deteriorated to a large extent. My favorite Red Pepper Chicken tasted different and quite not to my liking and the wine they offered was the worst I've ever tasted. I enquired with their manager on the brand of wine they offered and it was something called Indiyana - the MRP of the bottle was 485 and a glass costed 205. 

Overall, pretty disappointed with Waldorf. Their pricing no longer matches with the level of services, neither the quality of foods they offer. I'd much rather prefer Mocambo to Waldorf.

Well, WALDORF is a good chinese restaurant...i love some of their dishes. 
Crispy fried prawns and drums of heaven are superbly delicious and are also good choices for starters.
I did not like the waldorf special soup but liked the hot and sour soup.
The schezwan Fired rice and any preparation of chicken is nice.
Ambience is good and prices are not too expensive.
3.5 from me.

Eating delish and authentic Chinese dishes at one of the oldest and most popular restaurants in Kolkata is in itself an exciting experience. And the experience becomes even more adorable when you are dining with your near and dear ones.  My uncle had returned from Leeds after 5 years and we decided to celebrate the reunion by digging into lip-smacking Chinese delicacies at a popular Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. Waldorf, being one of the oldest and popular restaurants in Kolkata, was definitely our first choice. Waldorf has a nice and cozy ambience and the place is spotlessly clean.  On entering the restaurant, we were greeted cordially by their friendly and courteous staff, who showed us our table. There were 15 of us and the tables had to be arranged properly to make adequate seating arrangements. To our surprise, the tables were arranged beforehand- everything was in order (of course we booked our tables before, but in many restaurants you'll find that people start making arrangements after you enter the restaurant premises). 
Comfortably seated in cushioned chairs, we placed our orders. Waldorf is reputed for serving lip-smacking Chinese dishes. For our soups and starters we had succulent and crispy, deep fried Sesame Prawns, Satay Chicken, Thai Spring Rolls and Chicken Talumein Soup. Our main course consisted of Peppered Lamb on Garlic Steamed Noodles, Singapore Style Meifoon, Mongolian Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Duck in Five Spice and Oyster Sauce and Szechuan Fried Rice. We had nectarous and luscious Nalengurer Ice Cream and Waldorf Special Sundae. Well, the food was simply awesome! The crispy pawns and satay chicken tasted delicious. We also liked the soup and Thai Spring Rolls. 
What else do you look for when you get to eat tasty and authentic Chinese dishes! We particularly liked their Singapore Style Meifoon and duck in five spice and oyster sauce. Each spice retained its individual flavor and aroma. We also loved their Mongolian chicken, which was delicately cooked in spices and sauces. After a sumptuous meal, we really enjoyed digging into Nalengurer Ice Cream and Waldorf Special Sundae. Sweet and succulent, the Malengurer Ice Cream and Waldorf Special Sundae just melted in our mouths. 
Anyone would love eating in Waldorf restaurant which serves awesome Chinese delicacies!

Been here several times.The ambience is good and service is quick.Though the cocktail and liquor prices are high,the food is good.Tried their chilli button mushroom,chilli babycorn,dry chilli chicken and fish fingers.For cocktail,tried out John Collins,which was a disappointment! Best to relish their food with either beer or a peg of Blender's Pride.

Not very crowded around 5-7pm,so that's the best time to go.

I give a good rating solely based on the tastes of the Chinese cuisines I had over here. If you want good ambience, good behaviour then this is not the right place for you. 

25.05.2014: Rating changed as quality has drastically fallen. I was very shocked and hurt to see one of my favorite chinese restaurants suffering so much in terms of taste and quality. Sorry to say, but refrain from going to this place.

We decided to drop in at Waldorf's since we were in the vicinity, and our last experience had been very pleasant. It was a mistake...for one we had to wait quite a bit for our order to be taken...by a stretch, okay, it was full; we ordered only Chicken chowmein (hakka) and sweet and sour pork, and had to wait for a really long time....not quite excusable; the worst was yet to come, for the noodles were not really made the usual Waldorf way, and the sweet and sour pork was downright bad - no taste, let alone being sweet and sour...and I have never seen pork pieces cut this way; some were strips, as if picked up from some leftover dish, some were huge chunks which had to be chewed and chewed and chewed....We wanted chopsticks, and anyone who has eaten Chinese food in a Chinese restaurant knows that the pieces of meat are all bite-sized, in fact all that goes into Chinese food by way of vegetables or meats are bite-sized...the only saving grace was the sweet lime and soda...quite a dreadful food experience for a 24th of December...and they really have no excuse doing this...for a restaurant as old (almost of heritage vintage) as Waldorf.

If you expect five star super professional attitude, go away. This place is good food and simple traditional Chinese and Thai. The relocated Waldorf does not have the charm of its previous location, but it is catching up. Starters are all good to taste.

Not Great, Neither Bad. Just about OK !
Service wasnt very pleasing.
During my visit the 'GOOD' thing was we got a place quickly (this place was almost empty on a saturday @ 8:30pm).
So if you are around Park St. and extremely hungry and at a point where you can compromise on the quality of the food, you could drop by.
We did like the Sundae for dessert.

Food  is  good  but by no means excellent as some other reviews suggests. I would suggest that you try to stick to Chinese out there as the thai dishes are nothing extraordinary, strangely enough I like the vegetarian dishes over  here specially BABYCORN MUSHROOM HONG KONG  STYLE, STIR FRIED CHINESE  GREENS WITH ASPARAGUS, KUNGPAO VEGETABLES  & CHINESE SALAD ALL FOR STARTERS. For the main course I prefer Sweet & Sour Pompfret , fish with hoisin sauce & tiger prawns in sczechuan sauce all to be had  with mixed  fried  rice. We went there  in the 1st week of august  2012  with a  gang of 6 &  found the food reasonably  well  cooked. But  I  personally  still  wish  that  waldorf  had  not  relocated  to  RUSSEL STREET & had  remained  in park street where  today marco polo in  china  stands  . Those were the heydays of waldorf .  The same ambiance is sadly missing in this russel street outlet .

One the oldest places in Park Street that serves excellent chinese and thai. Been going to this place since I was a kid and this restaurant is one of the primary reasons that chinese still remains as one of my favourite cuisine. The quality of food of this place has not dropped a bit. You must try the sea-food here.
