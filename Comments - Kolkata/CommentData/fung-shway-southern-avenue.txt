Visited this place yesterday and it was a good experience. Good food, nice variety (You get Chinese,Thai,Japanese and Malaysian food), nice ambience and nice staff. The quantity is little less and a little overpriced but otherwise it's a good place.

It's been a while since I was there.... The flat noodles, the prawn tempura, the crispy conjee veg and the dessert with rolls of rice crisps was delicious... The addition of wasabi was definitely unique and a nice touch.... Would like to go again

I ordered Crispy Chilli Honey Potato which was made well.It was not very spicy nor very sweet.It was exactly as per its original taste .
My next order was Exotic Veg Rice Noodles which was OK.I only saw bellpeppers and nothing else in it.Along with it i ordered Babycorn,Broccoli & Mushroom in Mild Garlic Sauce which tasted very plain and Tofu with Exotic Veg Torched Sizzlers.The tofu were smelling and it just didn't taste as expected.
Next we ordered was Yaki Udon which is whole wheat Japanese noodles it was again OK in taste and with it i was served Exotic Vegetables in Orange Chili sauce which wasn't that great either.
The service was very slow and the quality somehow that day wasn't upto mark.Fung Shway was recommended by lot of friends so i was looking forward to good food & great taste.But somehow it didn't turnout to be as good as we expected.

Well went on the 25 th of December in Southern Avenue, city of joy. It's located in a very well sophisticated place.
The place has a good ambience. It has courteous staff.
We ordered tai pei chicken as an appetiser which was yummy.
Then in main course we ordered kaffir lime fried rice, chilly chicken, hakka mixed noodles and Thai basil chicken.
The food was overall really nice.
The service were also great.
Would surely recommend you to try this place.

I have visited multiple times and ordered in too. Their Schezwan noodles and kung pao chicken are delectable! I also love their fish in plum sauce.

Amazing ambience and scrumptious food! Enough reasons to give a good ratingüòä

Another wonderful experience in city of joy 
Foodies who were complaining about not many varieties on offer in Kolkata here's something to cheer about 
The resturant has a feel good factor in every wall 
You are greeted by smiling attended in entrance and guided to your seat by very professional  staff 


We had a pre ordered tailored menu 

A sweet lime in sprite with muddled herbs was served first as we commenced foodie feast 

It was followed by tastiest lemon coriander soup I have had till now 
The starters consisted of 
Honey Chilly Babby corn and Spring rolls 
Main course incuded 
Fried rice with 
Green veg curry and sauteed veggies in plum sauce 
The jai tai noodles were yummy 
Desert was fusion of custard with caramelized dry coconut 

We concluded with lemon grass tea 

The service was very crisp and prompt 

Co owner Mr Dilip was at its hilarious best 

Over all must visit 

Thank you

A fancy looking restaurant famous for oriental cuisines. Went there few months ago for dinner. We chose Thai cuisine and Malaysian  cuisine ordered for Tom kha sea food soup, ayam madu,green fish curry, curried mix Thai rice and paad Thai chicken noodles.The soup was thick with a strong smell of kaffir lime. It tasted refreshing. Ayam madu was chosen from Malaysian cuisine which was tangy and spicy. Green fish curry was amazing. And the rice and noodles both tasted good with a strong flavour of kaffir lime leaves.staffs are very cordial there. Recommended.

Well I would certainly not call this place romantic, as there is certainly nothing romantic about a few tables and so many restaurant staff standing infront of you. But that being said, we had come to the restaurant to eat, so lets just focus on the eating aspect of things.
Firstly, the staff are extremely courteous and there service was really good.
Coming to the food, i would rate this place as the best place to go to for an asian cuisine. starting from the rack of ribs (sensational) to the lamb shredded ( felt it to be a bit too salty) to our main course. Everything tasted splendid with no complains.

An Asian cuisine restaurant located at southern avenue. Nice ambience and good food but nothing extraordinary. We opted for the malaysian set menu lunch which came with a soup, a rice , a side and a dessert, all in two portions, for 1200. So that was a great deal. Just wish the taste was better. Although I totally loved this Japanese fried chicken dish we ordered apart from the set menu. It was yum!

Heard about this place from a friend who is a japanese food fanatic . So¬† decided to visit this place and try out the Japanese cuisine . Must say that I was not dissapointed .
This place offers the large variety of Malayasian , Chinese ,Thai & Japanese dishes.

>>FOOD: The dishes we tried were Udon & Salmon Sushi.¬† While the Udon is somewhat a close relative to the noodles we have , the Sushi is something totally different and astonishing . Uncooked , raw salmon fish with rice and mayo wrpping with soya sauce dip . It will be an explosion of floavours in evry bite. Totally enjoyed both the dishes.

>>AMBIENCE : This place takes hygience and maintanence seriously . From the staff to the manager all are very polite and helpful. The calm atmosphere is just the place you would like to have an enjoyable meal with your friends and family .

The whole experience was enjoyable , the food was delightful . This is where you should be if your willing to spend money on authentic asian dishes.

I was apprehensive earlier to try this joint , but finally went with my family last saturday. And yes I was wrong, as the food was very very good and the service also impeccable. We tried Korean Lamb Chop, Chicken Huangjiu, Bali prawns, Mixed chinese fried rice and my little cousin had her favourite chicken steamed momo. We also ordered two mocktails which were equally refreshing. Bali prawns were crispy and absolutely mouthwatering. Chicken Huangiju was a dish that we tried for the first time anywhere. There were 10 chicken pieces fried in a sweet and sour thick sauce and served on a bed of egg fries (like we have our Bengali kabiraji). None of the dishes disappointed us. Highly recommended.

Seldom it happens, that you visit a place and you like each and everything about the place. The ambience, the  food, well-mannered and helping staff. If you are wondering what "Fung Shway" stands for. Its just what we call "Feng Shui" but with a phonetically correct pronunciation. Everything about the decor of Fung Shway was Asian. With inverted Japanese umbrellas as lanterns and the bamboo blinds to  create an impression of a authentic Japanese window. Although , The lights could have been a bit dimmer. We were a party  of four and arrived early around 6:45pm in the evening. As starters we opted for the Chicken Kai Chi, Fish Torched Sizzler and Bali Prawns. All three items were exquisite and would leave you asking for more. Both the Kai Chi and the Bali Prawns were crunchy and were a burst of complementing flavours in your mouth.The Fish Torched Sizzler on the other hand was topped with tamarind and honey sauce. which had already created a  roller coaster of flavours at the appetizer phase of our dinner itself. For mocktails we opted for a Virgin Mojito , Fung Shway Special and two others which I apologize for not remembering as I was busy munching on my food when the drinks order was placed :p. However, the drinks were recommended by the staff and we went for it and I am happy to say, it was the right choice. The staff were well aware of their menu and guided us well throughout the ordering process. Now for the Main Course we had ordered the Chicken Cha Han rice ,the Chicken Yaki Soba Noodle and Chicken Cheng Du. The rice had a smoky flavour with a tad bit of cheese which really complemented each other. The noodle on the other hand were flat noodles and was topped with a lot of veggies just the way I like it. By flat I meant there shape, not the taste, Lol!. Cheng Du gravy was also great and we loved it. Finally for dessert they recomended a coconut based custard, which was just wow... Probably the best custard dessert in town. Unfortunately , we were so mesmerized by the food they offered ,we forgot to take any pictures of it. Overall , from a food enthusiast point of view, I would really recommend people to try it atleast once, and then they will be automatically drawn towards it. Solely for food, I would give it 5/5 stars.                                                                                                          And now it's time to bring the cat out of the bag. "The Bill" :D . Well it was around Rs 5000 for 4 people. Which I thought was a tad bit expensive compared to what is stated in Zomato. But If you want to treat your taste buds once in a while, It wouldn't be the worst idea to try this joint out. :D #AnythingForUrTongue So, for the pricing , I would give 3.5/5  stars.I would love to visit this place again to try out their Japanese delicacies.

Went for diwali dinner to this restaurant n found it pretty empty. The restaurant bang next to Indthali n seated on 1st floor n has a lift to get you there. Decor is kept simple with umbrellas n lights. Ordered a chicken sweet corn soup n tai pai chicken to begin our innings. Soup ws a bit on sweeter side though the sauces accompaniment made it better. The tai pai chicken came in no time n ws nice fried n tender boneless chicken served with sweet chilly sauce. Next we went for chengdu chicken, pan fried noodles in chicken n nasi kampoung rice. Chengdu was a different flavour with egg in the gravy n tomato sweet n sour n less spicy while pan fried noodles was definitely a thumps up. The malaysian rice was again a different take on fried rice as it had south indian spices of mustard seeds n curry leaves n the rive was almost like semolina thin n long. Over all service was very quick, ambience was alright except a loud group sitting behind us, staff was nice and helpful and food was good. The owner did come up n wish us happy diwali to put a smile on our face.

I didn't like the food or how lacadaisical the staff was when I complained about the food. It is true that I went during the Durga Pujas and that maybe a cause but when a restaurant charges as much as fine diners across the city I do expect some standard control. The portions were ok, ambiance was nice. But food was simply distasteful. The only thing I liked was the sweet corn soup. And saying 'like' is a stretch, bcoz it was just ok, quality/taste was similar to that of any small scale restaurant (the ones we all tend to get home delivery from) serving ok-ish Chinese food. We also ordered chicken satay which was a disappointing, literally nothing good about it. The chicken was stiff and tasteless. And the worse was Jai Thai. It was so hot that my father took a couple of spoonfuls and couldn't eat anymore. I had a couple of spoons myself but how much of excessively hot , tasteless noodles can one consumed. We didn't consume the rest. If something is beyond hot for a regular person, then I believe it is the responsibility of the staff to inform the customer about this attribute before ordering.

Situated opposite Nazrul Manch, Fung Shway is a beautiful and well decorated reastaurant serving authentic Asian food. Entering the place you will be mesmerized by the great ambiance. Everything is so perfect there- from the trained and courteous staffs to the food. We went there during Puja but we did not have to wait. For the starters we had TAI PEI CHICKEN and one Fish Sushi the name I don't remember sadly. I just Loved both the dishes. While Tai Pei Chicken was spicy, Sushi was non-spicy and perfectly made. For the main course we had Mixed Udon Noodles and Teriyaki Chicken. Teriyaki Chicken was a bit more on the sweeter side. Udon Noodles was great. only one thing, quantity was too less and it's a overpriced place. One thing I should say that don't opt for Japanese if you are not sure as my brother who is not an experimental foodie did not like the food.

Amazing food. No second thoughts...
The owners are friendly people communicating with every guest...
The rest of the crew are also very helpful.
We ordered Chicken Black Magic noodles...
Had no clue noodles could be sooooo tasty...
It was black noodles made with a creamy sauce... with lots of chicken and prawn.
I was running temperature that day... and the credit goes to the Chef that he could make food feel so good on a bad day.
We also ordered a side dish... the name is completely out of my mind but the tastes lingers... Chicken chunks fried and coated with a sweet sauce and covered with garlic... Amazing...
Will be back as soon as possible... Kudos to you guys ...

Had lunch with friends yesterday.
Superb decor. Windows have a green view. Multi-level but there's a lift for those wary of stairs.
The food was delicious, though sadly some a la carte items were unavailable because a key chef had taken leave after the Puja rush. A good reason to visit again certainly, for those elusive items of the far east.
We had -
Non veg yaki soba.
Pan fried fish in plum sauce.
Thai salad with peanut sause.
Veg burnt ginger fried rice.
Sliced mutton in a delectable gravy with veggies.
Alas, the Margarita was watery. I forgetfully violated a golden rule. At least one person should always go to the bar and watch the cocktail being actually prepared, so that the expensive liquids are correctly measured. Except for the really top five star hotels, this vigilance is a must.
Barring this,¬† a great experience and I would overall give a 4.

Located in Southern Avenue. A good place to try oriental food. If you are looking to try some oriental cuisine except for Chinese like Malaysian or Singaporean, you can visit this place. Price is reasonable. Service is good too. Try their Cantonese noodles.

Visited this place this puja..
Ambience- full marks for ambience.
Food- food is good but it can be a bit better. The presentation is good and everything had its unique taste.
Price- now coming to the price I think its a bit expensive given the quantity or anything that matters.

One of the best to serve authentic oriental cuisines in Kolkata 
Located on sarat Bose road just in front of vivekananda park 
We went down to taste some good Japanese cuisines
We settled in for some appetizers
Miso taki  soup  and tori katsu  
For mains we tried salmon rolled sushi 
Being my first time tasting tushi , I would say it was different but great .
For deserts we tried some coconut caramel vanilla icecream

The food served was really of top notch quality , 
Even portion wise it was of sufficient amount

Post Puja fatigue is bound to set in at the end of a long week of festivities but slacking on the taste of the food is no excuse even if the long wait be forgiven. The delay initially blamed on the steamed dumplings which eventually took less time to be served as compared to the simple sauted asparagus was also disappointing. The Malaysian style chicken, though good to taste was basically just chicken with lemon grass. They tricked us into taking bottled water even after we asked for filtered in house  water by saying that their filter was spoilt. The inattentive captain blamed us for not having ordered with him even after being specifically told that the order had been placed with the host.  Vegetarian Sambal tasted like uncooked  kissan tomato puree with vegetables. I wouldn't go back even if fung shway paid me.

Every other place was choc-a-bloc, so we went here after a particularly tiring Pujo hopping evening. We had no problems finding a seat and the staff were quite courteous.
However, our server was quite insistent on us ordering a select few from the menu, which seemed to put us off. He was quite insistent that we try the 'Paad thai', and 'corrected' us when we correctly pronounced it as pad thai. Anyway, we ordered pad Thai, hakka fried rice, and a lemon grass chicken. The pad thai was over-sauced, with the tangy sauce very overpowering on the palate.
The margarita was good. The beer chilled.

The prices were waaaay too much and the portions not very close to matching the price. Disappointed, to the say the least.

It was one night during Durga Puja that we visited the place. Location is great being situated right on Southern Avenue. The staff were well-mannered and polite. It was quite late, around 1 am that we entered the place and the management obliged us with quick on-time service.

The food - We had items from the Puja Special Menu. Among the starters, the Cripy chilli Baby corn was okay but the Nan King Lamb was exquisite. In the main course we had Chilli Garlic Noodles and Jai Thai Noodles. The former was good but Jai Thai deserves special mention. The noddles were flat-tape like and a bit like pasta in taste, very different and delicious. Although it was a bit too spicy for our liking but that just shows the authenticity of their touch of Asian Cuisine.

Dined with a few friends at Fung Shway last evening.
In simple words... Fantastic Experience!
Owner/Partner-Chef Dilip Massey was luckily around. He helped us choose our orders as per our individual tastes/preferences... and put in his own suggestions too.
The result: 'different', yet delectable dishes. The Laksa Soup was the first hot! Followed by, between us friends, some Chinese and Japanese dishes... Sushi here is worth a mention. And the two rice dishes -- the Chinese sticky rice, and the Japanese rice with veggies-herbs -- were outstanding.
These guys know food... so we've got to do it again...soon!

Located in Southern Avenue, Fung Shway serves a variety of authentic n delectable pan asian dishes. The restaurant is very well furnished with a pleasant ambience and the staff was very caring and courteous. Coming to food, Bali Prawns was a delight! Crispy deep fried prawns with a tinge of special sauce, it was simply delicious. Being a lover of Chinese cuisine, I mainly went for Chinese in main course. Pan fried noodles was very well prepared, Kung Pao fish was spicy n delicious, Chicken in Plum Sauce had a sweet n sour taste. For desserts Caramelized Coconut Icecream was really flavourful with caramel dipped coconuts garnished on vanilla ice cream. Overall food was really palatable served in a generous amount and cost is not really exorbitant. My experience here for lunch was quite pleasing; I'll definitely recommend to try this place for their food and I'll look forward to visit this place again. Rated 4.5.

Highly recommend the tai pai chicken, aayam madu, the Japanese noodles and the prawns in rendang sauce.. 4 jumbo prawns at 650 bucks is more than reasonable and the sauce was delicious as well... They have an indian touch to these cuisines so that they can be appreciated more.

Truly one word for this place- outstanding. Excellent service, beautiful ambience, delicious food. Full marks in all sectors. Numerous choice in menu- Chinese,Thai,Japanese,Malaysian. A bit confusing to choose but they will guide you perfectly according to your needs. Decor is top notch with spacious seats and vibrant lighting. All the starters that we tried was something new to the tastebuds. My personal favourite was oriental toast(minced chicken in a toast) , must try. Bali prawns had a crunchy coating- different and tasty. A must try restaurant for Asian cuisine lovers. Not too expensive but moderately priced. Quantity is also generous.

Fung Shway is one of those few places in Kolkata, which serve such authentic Asian cuisine. With an extensive menu and very difficult choices to choose from, Fung Shway has become one of the most popular eateries in Kolkata. The food was delicious. Excellent array of dishes from all over East Asia with distinctive flavors. They specialize in Thai food along with all their other cuisines.¬†

Would love to recommend Thai steamed whole fish: This is more on the bland side, but the dish is an absolute delight for those who like non-spicy food. Thai herbs add the entire flavor to the dish.

Would also love to recommend their Prawn Sushi, the dish was enjoyable. 
The service is good, prompt and friendly. We had an overall fantastic experience.

The lunch combos here are one of the best lunch combos we ever had.
The ambience is very attractive and the food is absolutely worth the price.
We took one Malaysian combo and one Thai combo.
Each of the combos begins with a mocktail.And then soup,Starters,Maincourse have rice,noodles and chicken side.It ends with the dessert.
The menu is a set menu.

‚Ä¢Thai Combo-Since I love Thai food I went for this combo and had some authentic delicious thai food.
The lunch course began with a virgin blue lagoon mocktail.
Then served with Chicken TomYum soup.
The soup was spicy with big chunks of chicken and ginger and tasted average.
For starter,the chicken satay tasted delicious and so well cooked.
The maincourse had Chicken Pad thai noodles,Eggchicken Khao Phat rice and Red chicken.
All the items are absolutely delicious and quantity is good.
Dessert was simple and good-Vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce.

‚Ä¢Malaysian Combo-For the mocktail here,we took fresh lime soda which was the other option.
The Soto Ayam soup of this combo is amazing.
It had noodles,egg and chunks of chicken-subtly cooked and delicious.
For starter we got Ayam Madu.This is a lipsmacking dish.The chicken pieces were cooked in Malyasian herbs and honey.
Maincourse had assam pedas chicken curry, Me Goreng flat noodles,Nasi Kampung chicken rice.
All the items especially the chicken and noodles are very unique and we loved it.
The dessert had vanilla ice cream with caramelised coconut.It is nice too.

Service is prompt and we almost went there near their closing yet they served us patiently.
The interior is beautiful.
The levy only GST on food and combos are exclusive of taxes.
We took a beer and breezer.
Our total bill was around 1.7k.

Always suspect of pretentious restaurants in Calcutta, which unfortunately no longer has the market for upscale (non Indian) speciality restaurants. The Kimchi turned out to be thick cabbage pieces with a sweet thick BBQ kind of sauce. The cucumbers were barely marinated - probably just sprinkled with sugar water. 

The Chinese Street Hawker Soup was like any cornflour enriched thick soup added with bits of Shitake Mushroom, Tofu, Bok Choy and a hint of burnt garlic. Hardly anything to the real stuff one gets in Hong Kong or Singapore.

But, that's when my luck ran out as the American Chop Suey did not arrive even after an hour's wait. By then famished, decided to walk out (after paying the bill for the drinks and soup, of course, and down by Rs 916 to be precise) in search of dinner elsewhere.

The beauty of the hospitality was - there was no serious effort to hold me back except for a feeble attempt by the barman. Obviously, they had forgotten the order.

Thus ended a painful saga. Never to return again. Thankfully, it saved me the frustration of going there with family or guests.

Brew me Some Good soup n u have 90% chance to reach to my good books.

From Moo Hin Nga (in Chilli Wok) to Muligatwanny (in Tamarind), I can recommend some really gr8 soups Kolkata has to offer and without any single hesitation I can include Tori Miso Taki soup of Fung Sway in the list. More of a clear Broth, subtle but has a strong lingering after taste. 

As, you can understand the soup itself is enough to get a good score for Fung Sway. 

Now more to the Microscopic Analysis:

Ambiance: Apt for a Japanese restaurant (though the restaurant should be characterized more Oriental than just specifically being Japanese). Low ceiling and Cozy sitting areas. Nothing out of the box but worked fine for me. (5/5)

Drinks: They have a drink menu. But I have not tried any. The choice of cocktails were basic. Would suggest to innovate, as per their Character. Based on the menu only giving a 4, deducting 1 for the lack of innovation. Priced a little higher. (4/5)

Food: This is the main area they score. We started with the Tori Miso taki soup, which is excellent. Moving to Maki Roll (stuffed Sushi), which is also quite good. In the main course, we had Thai sticky rice and Thai Green curry. It was not a daring selection and I am a lover of Kafir Lime leaf smell, hence the Green Curry went excellent. Ended with Coconut ice cream with caramelized coconut. Another must have. One plate is enough to be shared between 2. Price slightly high. (5/5)

Service: A tad slow, but friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. No complains (5/5)

Suggestions: 1) Just try to add some innovation in the Drink Menu.

Must Haves: 1) Tori Miso Taki Soup

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 2) Thai Green Curry

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 3) Coconut Ice cream

Overall Rating: 4.75 (rounded to 5)/5

While the Tai Pai chicken was good in quality and quantity their suggestion of Chicken Yakitori, an exotic Japanese item turned out so bad that we had to send it back. Twelve miniature pieces of chicken and scallion served in 3 skewers was hard and chewy. Even after it was replaced it was barely edible. Disappointed.

The food is absolutely brilliant here. I have been to most of the goid Chinese and thai restaurants in the town and this place is right there among the top in terms of food quality. Special mention the Bali Prawn, Teriyaki chicken all were out of the world. Kai chi was average. Pad thai noodle was good. Garlic Ale was poor. In terms of the pocket pinch this place is on the higher side. But I can say it was worth it. Also the owner himself came to us to meet and enquired about our experience which is very  ice gesture. Overall a very good place.

Out of the two chicken dishes suggested one was ok nothing great. The other .. teriake chicken was rubbery and inedible. Even though they replaced the dish based on our complaint, the replacement dish was also the same... inedible.

This restaurant reeks of Asian cuisines encompassing traditional Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese and Thai culinary heritage. I visited this place after stumbling upon a long list of Asian joints I was browsing online while sitting idly at my home. And I just gambled my way to this restaurant, unsure of what to expect. But surprisingly, this culinary home gave me an exhilarating shock with its uniquely built interiors, being located at a niche in Southern Avenue, just a couple hundred meters from Vivekananda Park. 

The waiters and hosts were fairly professional and courteous and that really is a plus factor for the restaurant to flourish.

I ordered...Steamed Fish, Rice Noodles, Chicken TaiPei and Coconut rice dessert thingy. 

The steamed fish is the star of the main course. It profusely gave a strong essence of lemongrass, that filled my nose, reaching all the way upto my stomach even before tasting the dish. All the other items were good, though I couldn't able to taste the other dishes' flavor after having the strong taste of the steamed fish. 

Would recommend foodies to try out this joint once.

I have had Japanese food only once before and I was dying to try out something new. So I landed at Fung Shway one fine day. I opted for their set Japanese menu and my friend ordered the Thai counterpart. But for the starter I also had Korean lamb chops. Honestly I did not like it so much. But I loved my Japanese food as well as the Thai. I gorged on everything. I absolutely loved the rice. It was delicious. People who love to try out new cuisines should definitely visit this place. A big thumbs up from me!

Beautiful decor. Staffs are very attentive and helpful but service is slow. Orderd kung pao chicken, singapore noodles from chinese main course and nasi kampung ( fried rice) , rendang ( chicken cooked in coconut gravy) from malaysian main course. Lastly one dessert. The order was very simple but it took too long to arrive at table. Food was good esp the kung pao chicken. I liked their chinese items better than Malaysian. They have lots of variety : chinese , thai , malaysian , japanese. So its difficult to say much about food if you visit only one or two times. Planning to visit again to try out their japanese & thai items.

This place is located just opposite the Rabindra Sarovar, beside the Whats up restaurant in Southern Avenue. A couple of days ago we visited this restaurant. Ambience is good, Decor is excellent, Service is great and Food is nice. We ordered thai delicacies there
For starters we ordered Tom kha soup Though the soup didn't tasted good. But it was quite different, it was a white creamy soup which tasted like pure coconut milk with thai leaves and herbs. I felt that it was okay but not that good. Next for the main course we ordered Thai yellow chicken curry, Thai steamed whole fish and Pineapple thai rice. The pineapple thai rice tasted well and was the best amongst all that we ordered. The Thai yellow chicken curry was nice but not up to the mark. It was a yellow creamy curry with small chicken pieces. Though the chicken pieces were good but the yellow curry was again coconut flavoured. The whole steamed fish was okay but was not tasty at all. It was a watery fish and was bad in taste. Everything else was quite good except their thai food. Overall experience was good. We may try their other delicacies in our next visit.

One of those few places which serve such authentic Asian cuisine. With an extensive menu and very difficult choices to choose from , Fung Shway has become one of the most popular eateries in Kolkata. Owing to its location , southern avenue , it is visited by many. 
We ordered sushi. The maki and the temaki kinds. The tuna roll was amazing and they served it beautifully with wasabi and soy. The temaki was a lot larger with creamy mayonnaise to go with it and was wonderful. For main course we had prawn red curry and kaffir rice. The prawn curry was cooked very well , it was spicy like it's supposed to be and had plump prawns in it. The generosity with which they used coconut milk was overwhelming. We had it with kaffir rice which boasted of the kaffir lime aroma and tasted absolutely delicious , even without the curry. 
Our server was a Mr. George and he looked after us very well. He even suggested what to order and what combinations would go well and really made us feel comfortable. The ambience of the place is nice and cozy , with two levels of seating. The place is easy on the pocket too serving Asian food of superior quality.

A nice bar cum restaurant. Food is very good and they also have a good variety of liquer. Ambience and choice of music is also good. The staff is very polite and prompt. The place is a bit pricy and thats the only reason why its neighbour "What's Up" has more footfalls than this place.

This place is located just opposite the Rabindra Sarovar, beside the Whats up restaurant in Southern Avenue. A couple of days ago we visited this restaurant. Ambience is good, Decor is excellent, Service is great and Food is nice. We ordered thai delicacies there
For starters we ordered Tom kha soup Though the soup didn't tasted good. But it was quite different, it was a white creamy soup which tasted like pure coconut milk with thai leaves and herbs. I felt that it was okay but not that good. Next for the main course we ordered Thai yellow chicken curry, Thai steamed whole fish and Pineapple thai rice. The pineapple thai rice tasted well and was the best amongst all that we ordered. The Thai yellow chicken curry was nice but not up to the mark. It was a yellow creamy curry with small chicken pieces. Though the chicken pieces were good but the yellow curry was again coconut flavoured. The whole steamed fish was okay but was not tasty at all. It was a watery fish and was bad in taste. Everything else was quite good except their thai food. Overall experience was good. We may try their other delicacies in our next visit.

The food was absolutely delicious. The servers  were very courteous and well mannered. Replaced the plates and spoons as soon as each dish was over. The food is absolutely delicious and tastes amazing. The authenticity of each cuisine is remarkable. Only drawback is the surround areas are water logged during rainfall. So it's a little difficult to enter the restaurant during heavy showers of rain.

One of those few places which serve such authentic Asian cuisine. With an extensive menu and very difficult choices to choose from , Fung Shway has become one of the most popular eateries in Kolkata. Owing to its location , southern avenue , it is visited by many. 
We ordered sushi. The maki and the temaki kinds. The tuna roll was amazing and they served it beautifully with wasabi and soy. The temaki was a lot larger with creamy mayonnaise to go with it and was wonderful. For main course we had prawn red curry and kaffir rice. The prawn curry was cooked very well , it was spicy like it's supposed to be and had plump prawns in it. The generosity with which they used coconut milk was overwhelming. We had it with kaffir rice which boasted of the kaffir lime aroma and tasted absolutely delicious , even without the curry. 
Our server was a Mr. George and he looked after us very well. He even suggested what to order and what combinations would go well and really made us feel comfortable. The ambience of the place is nice and cozy , with two levels of seating. The place is easy on the pocket too serving Asian food of superior quality.

Being a foodie I always try to explore different cuisines at different places .
Finally I tick this restaurant off my bucket list on 21.06.2017

Now let's talk about the restaurant.

1.location:-This place is located just on the opposite side of Nazrul manch.

2.decor:-a beautiful set up that can give you feeling as if you are in some Malaysian restaurant..the choice of music is also good.

3.staff and management:- I have read certain reviews stating that the staff behaviour is not that good and the service is slow, but I would beg to differ . The staff were really helpful and friendly from the word go.the service was good and everything was delivered to table at  right intervals..

4.food:- the food I ordered were-
(a)laska soup- a delicious soup served with eggs coriander, peanuts,noodles..if you are a soup lover I would definately recommend it..
(b)tai Pai chicken-its a very delicious starter which is crispy outside and juicy inside..it's.a must try
(c)pad thai noodles-flat thai chicken noodles..it was okayish.i have had better.
(d)green thai chicken curry- I must say ,one of the very few places where I have actually got the essence of real green thai curry.chicken was tender and the balance of spices was quite good..I won't say that it's the best thai curry I ever had but yes it was certainly very good.
(e)mocktails- blue lagoon- it was really good
Fung shway special-while ordering I wasn't really confident,but since I like to try new stuff I went for it and I wsnt dissapointed..this mocktail contains gondhorj lebu,soda,lemon and everything and tasted really good
(f)tampura ice cream- it was good  and kinda like fried ice cream the only difference is in this case it looks kore like a Swiss roll.

5.quantity and quality- if you order a normal course consisting soup ,starter, main course and dessert then a single portion of everything is likely to make you full..but if you directly go for the mains then may be it might seem that the quantity is not good enough.

Everything was fresh and well cooked.. quality of food was really good.

Pocket pinch- the price is on the higher side and it costed me 2666 for the items I have ordered but honestly it's worth the money


Remarks-everything was picture perfect until I found hair strand in my noodles and that is the reason why I have given it 4.5 instead of 5.. though the place seemed to be quite hygienic,but instances like cant be overlooked and management should take a note of this.


Overall a very good experience and would like to visit this place again.

Almost 40 years ago (way before everyone called themselves 'foodies') a little restaurant called 'China Bowl' introduced middle class Calcutta to south Asian food, new ingredients like lemon grass and oyster sauce and shitake mushrooms. Well, Chef Massay is still enthusiastic about his creations. Fung Shway is a beautifully appointed eatery with warm modern Asian decor, welcoming staff and priced just right. Since there were two of us, we only got to try their Korean lamb chops, the jai tai noodles and Ayum Madu (spicy saut√©ed chicken with honey). The lamb was beautifully braised to perfect tenderness covered in the right amount of sauce. The jai tai noodles was cooked al dente (not mushy like some places) with a lot of heat and spices. The chicken was superb! Crispy yet succulent, spicy, rounded off with an indulgence of honey. My goal is to go back and try the entire menu now. Chef Massey has promised me some great bulgogi when the weather gets better! Cheers chef!

The place has everything that can  fool you for an instant to believe that you are not in Kolkata but have stepped into some place in South East Asia. The lady at the entrance, her appearance right down to the length of slit of her Oriental dress, the flight of stairs going up with the dining room  situated in steps along the length of the staircase gives an impression of an oriental eating house in the land of the orient! 
Fungshway has been really successful in doing a makeover that is near perfect! The erstwhile China Bowl, which used to be a dimly lit, depressing place has been converted into a bright, colourful place that's certain to lift one's spirit a notch or two as soon as one enters and climbs the steps. 
Those coming to Fungshway should better come with a fixed notion of which type of cuisine they wish to savour. Such is the range and variety offered by the restaurant that unless one is very sure, one would probably take a lot of time to go through the menu and despite that, end up getting confused on what to order. There's an array of Chinese, Malay, Balinese, Thai, Japanese and of course their very own preparations from memory's Lane! 
Confused and unsure of what to order? Well, there's always the friendly staff who are willing to suggest and help in the selection process. We did fall back on them to help us choose and were certainly not disappointed. The Balinese curry and the Malay fried rice Nasi Kempung was a perfect combination, the sweetness of the curry providing a soothing balm to the tingling taste of spices of the latter. 
We topped up on the main course with a caramel custard served in the restaurant's own style, which was delicious and provided a fitting finale. 
China Bowl had proabably stopped attracting diners simply because it had failed to attract attention amongst the new glitzy ones that keep mushrooming every other day in the lanes and by lanes of Kolkata. Now in this new avataar, I am sure China Bowl aka Fungshway will again become the jewel of every diner whose palate craves for all things oriental! Mr Massey, thanks for this makeover and for giving us Calcuttans, Fungshway! 
PS : It would be good if the management tries to do something about the strong blast from the air Conditioner that tends to chill to the bone. Some sort of regulatory mechanism would be welcomed.

Fung Shway was a sudden find on Zomato and on seeing some really good reviews my friend suggested that we try this place and to be honest, we weren't dissapointed even a bit.

Situated bang opposite to Nazrul Mancha (in Southern Avenue), Fung Shway happens to be a beautiful and neat restaurant with a seating capacity of about 12 people on the first floor (No idea about the 2nd floor).

What I found weird and unusual was that, the person at the front desk had no smile on her face and seemed to be so obnoxiously sad upon receiving us. On the other hand, the managers (most probably - because they were suited and booted) payed no interest in attending us at the begining until when we finished the food..That is when he enquired if the food was good.
The other staff members were pretty humble and food was served on time.

We strictly went with the zomato recommendations and jotted below are the things we tried:

1) Laksa @Rs.295.00 (4.75/5) : Laksa happens to be a Spicy and very flavourful noodle soup of the Peranakan Cuisine with it's roots originating from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. It is basically a soup made with coconut milk as the base with sambal and curry paste with a dominant flavour of lemongrass. The soup is served originally with rice vermicelli but they replaced it with regular thick noodles (of good quality)- No complaints, whatsoever. The soup was served with other condiments like boiled egg, fried noodles (which needed to be more crisp), peanuts, chilli flakes, lemon wedges and fried shallots. I have had my fair share of Laska in Malaysia so I exactly knew what it was supposed to taste like. This was probably the best Laska I have had in Kolkata.

2) Chicken Khao Phat @Rs.400 (3.5/5) : In a much easier language, chicken khao phat is equivalent to Thai Friedrice. We received a bowl full of friedrice (great quantity!) which tasted pretty darn good but was no where near what an actual Khao Phat tastes like. A very well made friedrice, though.üôÇ

3) Tai Pai Chicken @Rs.350. (4/5) : Tai Pai chicken sounded pretty funny but what came in was actually too fun to eat.üòÄ
About 10 pieces of crunchy outside and soft inside chicken pieces were beautifully tossed and coated in a sweet and sticky soy glazed marinade and then mixed with crisp cooked juliened onions in the same marinade. Truly delicious.

4) Bali Prawns @Rs.650.00 (4.25/5) : 5 pieces of skewered fresh prawns, flattened and crumb coated with cornflakes (most probably) and then deep fried to perfection with minimal spices, in order to retain the taste of the fresh prawns. If this doesn't increase your adrenalin level already, I don't know what will.üòÇ
Super delicious concoction of fried goodness with crisp perfect outer coat and luscious awesomeness inside. Worth a try.üòç

We paid a total of Rs.2042.00 (Including 14.5% Vat of Rs.245.78 and 6% Service Tax of Rs.101.70) for 2.
Pocket pinch is on the higher side, but Fung shway deserves a visit!

‚óèFinal conclusions:
‚Ä¢Taste rate - 4.25/5. [Based on what we have had].
‚Ä¢Ambience - 4/5.
‚Ä¢Staff Behaviour - 3/5.
‚Ä¢Quantity - 4/5.
‚Ä¢Value for money - 4/5.

Hence, rating Fung Shway with a 3.95~ 4/5!

What a stupendous gastronomical experience!

Definitely Recommended!

Service: food wait time is too high but the staff are knowledgeable and helpful so is the owner cum chef
Food: the only reason u will go back. The ingredients are fresh and sauces are authentic
Balinese shrimp is a must so are the sushi if u are a sushi lover. Probably the best in town

Since it was my birthday I wanted to try something exotic and new..  So I went to this place.. To my relief this place has valet parking available which is such a great advantage.. The restaurant is very prominently located at southern Avenue bang opposite to nazrul manch .. Coming to the decoration the place is nicely and minimally decorated.  We ordered a pan fried chilling fish which was so soft and juicy that I barely can remember the last time I had such juicy fish.. It was soft,  tender and had the perfect crispness..  Then in main course they suggested us to try their prawn sizzler along with some Chinese rice... The prawn sizzler came to me sizzling with four above medium sized prawn which left me licking my fingers.. What a dish!!! Loved it. The rice was light and complimented the prawn..  A must try..

A fully Asian Restaurant in the southern pocket of City of Joy. They serve Thai, Chinese, Japanese and Malaysian to be precise. 

Locating the restaurant with the help of Google Maps wasn't a problem. Limited parking on the road pavement is available. 

The restaurant scores a full 5/5 when it comes to ambience. Once you enter you will be greeted by their staff and they will guide you upstairs to a table of your requirement. The stairway is very beautifully illuminated and looks graceful. Also the decor inside is discerning and sophisticated. 

Coming to the food we ordered a TAI PAI CHICKEN which was crispy, tossed in honey barbecue sauce and tasted delectable. Our next order was a starter called ANGEL ON HORSEBACK which is basically chicken was also lovely but the portion was a little less for 4 of us to share. Then came the TORCHED SIZZLER IN FISH with Chilly Rum Sauce. This was totally recommended by one of their staff and also said that it'd be boneless. The fish served was a fresh Bekti, also it tasted outstanding. It had a few bones inside and wasn't totally bone free. Also I'd like to say that the size of the fish was very small for the price they charged for it. We also wanted to have prawns and ordered the BALI PRAWNS from the Malaysian section of the menu. This was the best of all the dishes I had here. Skewerd golden fried prawns was served with sweet honey chilli sauce absolutely stole my heart. For the main course we ordered a rice called KAFFER (Mix) and a LAMB in THAI RED CURRY. The quantity of the rice was very small for the price they charged while the lamb was enough to be shared by 4 of us.

The service is slow here. Staffs are decent. A little pricey for the portions they serve, but quality control is done right. Also the restaurant is very well maintained and tidy. Beautiful place to go on a lunch with your family or your sweeter half once in a while.

Cheers!

"Fung Shway Fung Shway
Go away go away
Never come again
into our eye-way"
Well, that pretty much sums up my experience precisely!! I'll discus less about the food quality, and more about the horrible treatment we got there!
Arrogance is an instrument that can pare your flight feather of success!
Incivility, impropriety and insolence was all we got there! Now let me unfold it properly...
We went there yesterday evening... and ordered starters, main course, a mocktail and a dessert...
We, unlike their management thought that it was a restro and not a Museum, so naturally like everyone, we started clicking pictures of the food... at first we had not been restricted from clicking pictures by ANYONE, and in fact it was no where written that "Photography is Prohibited"...
Then suddenly when we were about to capture a picture of dessert, a tall, old man came, kept staring at us, lastly almost shouted "We do not allow clicking photographs"... It was told in such a bad way that everyone in that room turned back, as if we had made some criminal offence!
I mean why???? Whereas every 5 star hotels allow clicking pictures what speciality ur restaurant has that u do not allow clicking pictures!? And if you don't allow, then why there is not a single prohibitory notification about that???
Anyway, after this thing, we were treated as if we are having food without paying a single penny!! We asked the staffs to get us the bill, and we were replied with ignorance and countless frowning! And after getting such unacceptable behaviour, I had made up my mind to rate this bullshit restaurant lowest!
Since it is my duty to say something about the food of any restaurant, so I'll not skip it!
Starter tai pai chicken was good
The Mocktail was also good
In main course we ordered veg rice and hot garlic chicken...
Veg rice was half burnt, and tasteless and about the hot garlic chicken, I can bet any streetside restro can make it better than that!
And lastly dessert!!
We had ordered tampura Ice cream (the name might be wrong) and what the hell was that!!??? It was tasteless, and worst dessert we have ever had!!
So that is it...
I would suggest everyone, if you have self respect, please do not visit this restaurant!
And one thing I must say, if even after reading this review you are going to visit this Museum, ooops sorry, restaurant, please donate them 100 rupees so that they can buy a placard and write on it "We do not allow photographs"!
I forgot to do so, you please donate them on behalf of myself, Thank you! :)

This place is located below what's up on the first floor. Just on the opposite side of the Rabindra Sarobar lake. 
As you enter you will see a stair case which takes you to the first floor where all the seating arrangements are. 
Ground floor is the kitchen. 
A total 5/5 on the decor and ambience.
Coming to the main thing, the food and service. 
Ordered tai pai chicken for starter - too much sauce, quite spicy 
Burnt garlic fried rice - simple fried rice, nothing extravagant or worth mentioning about it except the steep pricing.
Pan fried noodles - again very ordinary nothing much to add 
Ordered chicken chengdu as the waiter recommended it. It was too saucy for my taste the meat balls were soft and tender tough.
Coming to the service, this was a let down. I would give 1/5. They made us wait for 20 mins for the main course after the starter was served. That's way too long to wait. If they don't do anything about it soon they will lose their customers. 
Loved the owner, he personally came to our table to talk to us about the food and the restaurant. He seemed to be a very nice person. 

This restaurant doesn't let you click pictures of the food for some reason unknown to me. When I insisted to the owner that this is solely for the review purpose he allowed.

We had a horrible experience yesterday.You guys were so confused when we asked if the restaurant will be open after 3.30 or not, we got different answers from every other staff. You guys made us go downstairs in the stag room, saying that the restaurant upstairs is going to get closed just after taking our orders.As soon as we got our starters and started having our food, we were informed that you guys are closing down. We couldn't even enjoy our starters.Why didn't you guys confirm the same in the first place and why didn't you guys cancel the order? This is absolutely unprofessional and unacceptable.

Fung Shway is located on Southern Avenue just beside What's Up Cafe.
It's a nice place to have Japanese, Thai and Malaysian cuisine. A very peaceful place not with much loud music, rather very soothing music to the ears. And very pleasant place because of the interiors designed by Japanese dolls, Thai women showpieces n etc.
Regarding the service, some of the junior F&B people doesn't have much knowledge about the cuisines served in their hotel, and they don't understand what their customers want‚Äãs as their dishes to be served, even they can't explain the customers about their dishes in details.
In my case it happened so, then the junior F&B person called his senior and he took the order and made us understand about the dishes in detail.
Now coming to the food, it was Fine. The dishes which all I ordered had a Sushi Platter n the rice in the sushi was not fresh it was not moist, it was much drier sushi than the usual ones. The Bali Prawns were crispy n was good in taste. The drinks were fine as well. I ordered one Rice Noodles n a Chicken's peparation too, which had very basic tastes.
But nothing I can say was out of the box or was lip smacking food.
So, I would suggest it's totally upto you whether you want to try them or not.

This was a terrible experience on a sultry Sunday afternoon. To begin with, there was an unnerving amount of miscommunication from 3 restaurant staffs regarding the seating arrangements for two of us, and we were moved thrice (once while having the starters). It was extremely hot outside, and inside too as the AC wasn't working... But we were not informed about that beforehand. Midway during the starters we were told that they'd need to cancel our main course orders as they're closing down the whole restaurant. This is just unbelievable and extremely unprofessional from my vantage point. I'd have liked to write a feedback, but never got the opportunity as every staffer was busy to get us out of the place as fast as possible. I am not going to comment about the starters as the sheer injustice and unprofessional attitude displayed by the people involved has left a bad aftertaste.

One among the cluster of restaurants near vivekananda park, this place is done up luxuriously with a generous touch of the south east and so is the menu. We were a group of seven and started off with mocktails. The grassy cucumber and the green ocean stood out among them though those were just better versions of mojito and jaljeera really! Next we had starters. The dragonballs which were mushrooms stuffed with cheese was quite a catch for vegetarians. The stir fried chicken was nice but the fish preparation was quite spectacular. Ikan bakar dengan air assam is steamed fish in chilly tamarind sauce wrapped in banana leaves. Would like to be back here solely for this. Again in the main course, the fish prep in chilly plum sauce was delicious and so was the singaporean chicken we had with hakka noodles. Those who had the exotic veggies with tofu claimed that it was quite nicely done. Overall we had a great time, ambience is wonderful and service is okayish- they take a bit of time to serve. Prices are on the steeper side as it's quite wonderfully done up to say the least. So Fung Shway would definitely be on my mind when next I would like to splurge on Chinese or Malaysian food.

It was a fine afternoon when we decided to go for a lunch there and try out their newly introduced lunch combos for two!
We were there and were totally awestruck by the beautiful lit stairs which one will witness as soon as one enters and also the beautiful decor. 
We then chose to sit on the first floor dining area where the staff greeted us cordially. We opted for the Chinese lunch meal which was priced at INR 600 inclusive of taxes.

So following are the list of dishes we were served:-

2 beverages - Blue lagoon and Sweet lime. Both were really refreshing on that sunny day.

Soup - Then we were served with two portions of lemon and coriander soup which was super delicious and had good amount of veggies in it.

1 starter - Crispy fried veggies in salt and pepper.
This particular dish was really flavourful and we totally enjoyed it with the chilli garlic sauce that they serve along with it! 

Main course - 1 portion of Veg Manchurian, 1 portion of Veg Fried Rice and Hakka Chow. The main course was again really delicious and filling. We were full to the brim and could not think of food after this.

Dessert - For dessert they served us with vanilla ice-cream topped with caramelised coconut. The vanilla ice cream was also flavoured with cardamom which lifted the whole taste.

Last but the not the least we were served with some lemon grass tea which is served as a palette cleanser and will sooth the gut after such a heavy meal. We totally loved this concept and the hot tea truly made us feel light inside.

The ambience and service was much appreciated and these people cater you to the best of their  abilities.

Overall a nice place with awesome food and prompt service.

We went to Fung Shway on Saturday for Poila Baishakh lunch. Me, my parents and my partner. Had been meaning to go for a while now, considering it's a stone's throw away from our place. Thankfully there wasn't a huge cue and we went upstairs for our table. The mezzanine floor looked a bit cramped to be honest. The place is well decorated, with a subtle oriental charm and the menu is extensive and very well crafted to say the least. It's a curation of the finest offerings from South East Asia and a delight for Asian cuisine lovers. That it has been made with a great deal of love and by someone who has traveled quite a lot was made apparent when we had a chat with the co-owner, Dilip Massey. A lovely gentleman with a deep running passion for food that's reflected in every dish that we ordered. 

Coming to the service, it leaves room for a lot of improvement. We ordered beer and they did not have any chilled beer. But what they lacked in terms of delivery they more than made up with their attentiveness. They brought us an ice bucket to chill our bottles in and it was a welcome gesture. Now, coming to the food, be prepared for a long wait. We faced a very slow service. But it was really worth the wait as the food was amazing. We decided to order a mix of Malaysian, Thai and Japanese cuisine. For starters we had Tai Pei Chicken- double fried crispy chicken tossed with vegetables and a sweet and spicy sauce. We greatly enjoyed and wholeheartedly recommend it. We also had Chicken Satay. It was different from the traditional satays we have had in Indonesia and Thailand but the taste was fantastic. The chicken was succulent and the peanut sauce went nicely with it. 

For the mains we had Malaysian Nasi Kampung, which we were told was like Nasi Goreng, Chicken Rendang, which was a creamy coconut based curry infused with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. We also had Japanese Yaki Noodles and a version of fried chicken. I am forgetting the name of the dish. Each of the items was stellar. Though the Nasi Kampung didn't come with a fried egg on top, they made one for us on request. We especially enjoyed the Rendang, which was a bit like a Thai green curry but more flavourful, in my opinion. The portions were generous and we had a fantastic experience overall. 

We definitely intend on visiting again. Sooner than later. I want to try the combo Thai meal next time. It was a good experience having lunch at Fung Shway. Apart from the food, I was very heartened by the hospitality and warmth that they showed. For me, that goes way beyond any shortcomings like the food arriving late or the beer not being cold. Though redressing that would be a more than welcome change.

Located near deshapriya park..which hosts a load of food joints but this one stands apart from the rest.. place is well decorated. Have two stories Ines being a mezzanine floor hosting a bar counter. Have their own valet parking which is cool.. now comes the food which is awesome, some of them may burn a hole in your pocket but considering the food it's nothing. It serves Chinese, Thai and Malaysian cuisines. We order a mix of all, starting with Thai starter Dee's prawn which is a must try. It has a slight sweet taste but the prawns just melts in your mouth. For mains we ordered Malaysian Nam Kampung rice which was pretty good and to go with we had Tai Pai chicken. Quantity is moderate but the taste is something that you will savour. Drinks are a bit pricey, one 60 ml of JD with coke will cost you around 750 bucks but considering the ambience and the place is normal.. management is really good.. try it out once u will love it for sure

China Bowl rechristened Fung Shway (this oulet existed some time back in between Gariahat junction and SBI Ballygunge branch but closed down probably when the gariahat flyover construction began) is one of those rare upmarket  joints serving authentic oriental cuisine. We ordered Korean lamb chops and Pork spare ribs; both were not just outstanding-  simply divine! Succulent meat served in deliciously mouth-watering sauces sums it up.....this place is highly recommended for every food lover of the country.....

Fung shway was a long desire especially due to the Oriental recipes it offers. Went there for  lunch. Its located on the main road of southern avenue and hence easy to locate. 
Juat after entering the place we were struck by an environment of awesomeness. Its so beautifully decorated inside. Ambience is top class with soothing music playing all along.
Coming to food they are now having a combo meal offer for 2 where you can choose between either chinese , thai, Malaysian or japanese menu. We decided to go with the Thai menu. 
The combo offer cosisted of a soup, starter(CHICKEN SATAY), noodles, thai Fried rice , thai style chicken and vanilla ice cream with caramelised coconut as dessert. They also offered complimentary mocktails
This whole menu was only for Rs 400. Now thats a pretty interesting deal. 
We also ordered a pork spared ribs along with the combo meal.
The food were quite good to taste and had the original Oriental flavours . Me , despite not being a big fan of the oriental recipe was amazed by the delicacies. The spare pork ribs was actually suggested by their manager and it turned out to be an awesome experience. 
The staffs were also very courteous and always happy to help.
Now coming to price , the combo meal offer is a great offer . It cost us 800 for two all inclusive for the combo meal. But on the other hand the price of individual dishes in the  ala carte menu is quite high. The pork spare ribs alone cost is ts512 including tax whereas the whole meal was for rs 400 per dish. So you can imagine .. 
Allover Fung Shway was an awesome experience . A must visit.

Nice place. Not very crowded. We ordered soto ayam- a chicken soup with egg and potato dumplings, ayam madu- chicken in a chilli honey sauce. Both the items were superb. The soup was enough for two. In the mains we ordered fish rendang curry and chicken nasi kumpung. The amount was more than enough for two and tasted great. Service was prompt and attentive. Burns a hole in your pocket. But still worth it.

Was there for dinner on satrday night. Starters were okayish..we ordered thai chicken and prawn in pineapple sauce...i didnt like the smell of pineapple sauce and the prawn had too much of coating.. for main course we ordered garlic fried rice which was great. We ordered sliced fish with bokchoy which was too lighty spiced. Japanese cuisine was not available. The biggest disappointment was there bar. Choices were too limited and they didnt hv most of the items mentioned in the menu. We ordered cosmopolitan which was utter disappointment keeping in mind the price. Went there seeing the good ratings and to be very frank extremely disappointed. The prices were also on the higher side and the quantity was meagre. Moreover the people serving food was too keen on removing the plates, that too wen we were not finished and had to keep on saying them not to..

This restaurant is situated on Southern avenue.They have various kinds of Asian cuisine. We went for lunch and tried Chinese and Thai dishes. The ambience and behavior of staff is 5 star. The food is delicious with authentic taste. From what we ordered these were my favorite - Chicken burnt garlic soup, Chicken in yellow Thai sauce, Chinese fried rice and the dessert that they recommended was Sankaya!! It was a pudding made with coconut milk and pumpkin, it was delicious topped with coconut cream and coconut praline.  Bonus is that they also offer complimentary wi-fi for guests. I definitely recommend this place!!

Decided to try Thai food at Fung Shway,a relatively little known eatery in Kolkata but hugely praised by those who happened to visit the place on the past.. It happened to be our Anniversary and our intention was to visit an untried food joint. We were received very warmly as soon as we stepped in. What instantly impressed us was the ambience and the d√©cor and the courteous welcome by the senior restaurant managers. The Thai food,in brief, was exemplary.  From the Soup to the Chicken starters and then  the Thai noodle,ending with coconut ice-cream, every item was heavenly. For a mere RS.800, it was indeed a very satisfying lunch. Do visit the restaurant for a really fulfilling gastronomic experience. The restaurant deserves a 4.5/5.0 rating.

Fung Shway is not only about good food, it is about bringing your dining experience upto a whole new level. It has won us over with its exquisite ambience, courteous staff and of course mouthwatering delicious delectable food.

Laksa Soup:
Laksa is a Chinese-Malay delicacy. A dish that showcases the fusion of Oriental style and Indian taste, Laksa is definitely something that kicks off your dinner in the perfect way. A creamy, pungent, savoury bowl of soup is served hot in a large bowl along with small bowls of condiments ‚Äï fried noodles, pad thai, chinese coriander, boiled eggs, peanuts and lime to mix into your share of the Laksa soup. The soup was simply perfect. Undoubtedly it is the best Laksa we have ever had.

Tai Pai Chicken:
Double fried crispy chicken tossed with red chillis and shallots and glazed in a chilli sauce. The chicken was soft and juicy, the sauce complimenting it well and the double fried chicken. A nice starter.

Nasi Goreng:
You will be surprised to not see this one on the menu as it was prepared by the chef on personal request and he absolutely blew us away. Nasi Goreng is an Indonesian version of the classic chinese fried rice served with chicken skewers, prawn chips and salad. The rice was very well prepared tossed to perfection, extremely savoury with all the juices from the chicken, it challenged the Laksa for the dish of the day.The skewers were soft doused in a sweet barbecue sauce.  Again it was the best Nasi Goreng ever and its a definite recommendation.

And we got served complimentary Jasmine Honey Tea served at the end of the meal keeping with the Japanese tradition.

A special mention to the staff and the chef of Fung Shway. They welcome you, make you feel at home and attend to your every needs, taking special care to know your preferences.

Cost for 2: Rs 1200

This is probably the only first restaurant that I gave a full 5.0 out of 5.0 and this is based on a lot of points that I have observed in Fung shway. Not only am I a big fan of Japanese cuisine, but this restaurant was just fantastic and I recommend everyone who loves asian food to try and visit this place. It's worth it!

Location: situated in southern avenue, its not very far from the island in southern avenue. It is situated right next to three other restaurants and cafes in the locality.

We were mainly looking for only japanese food and we were a bit reluctant to come and eat here as we thought the food might not be authentic due to the presence of four other main asian cuisine; chinese, Thai, Malaysian and Japanese but we still decided to give it a try.

Everything was very nice and warm, from the service to the food. The manager was extremely nice and courteous and made the entire food journey a very pleasant experience. We ordered a bunch of sushi as starters, tuna nigiri, Salmon maki, tempura, spicy sushi and so on. Those were the best part of the entire meal and I recommend everyone to try their sushi out. Then we ordered for miso soup, black magic noodles and kucchi rice ( lemongrass ). We love the food so much, i had to take home some sushi!!

We also had a very long conversation with Mr Dilip. He was very nice, courteous and friendly. We exchanged ideas and so many things and would definitely love to visit this place again.

The bill for all this was around rs 5000 and rs1,600 for the parcel but it was worth it. Would definitely come back here soon!

A perfect place for date. Located right next to indthalia, keyatala. They have a nice combo meal for two which starts from 600 only, and that too including taxes. If you want to drink something you need to order it separately. The foods are so delicious in here you will visit again. The ambiance is so nice and warm that it welcomes you wholeheartedly. The people are nice and the service is good too.

P.S. Among all the Asian foods the Chinese foods taste much better.

It was a last minute decision to go to this place as the place we wanted to go had no reservation. But I would say totally worth it. It is a must go for sea food lovers. There is Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Korean food. My personal favourite was the charcoaled crabs. They were served broken so making it easier for us to eat. We also ordered a collection of noodles-vegetarian, prawn, chicken. I'd give the food a 4/5 rating.

The ambience is typical Chinese and Japanese mix. But the place is too cool (I was literally chattering) given its small size. The waiters would occasionally increase the temperature and reduce it back. The bar is separated from the regular dining part but drinks were served in both the places. The bar part was poorly lit (dim blue),I assume this  was so as there were no customers there. We were a party of 9 so we occupied two tables and were not very comfortable. Better go to this place with a small party of max.6 that is the maximum a table there can occupy.

I went with 17 people to have lunch,we ordered Chinese combo.The food taste is good..but not so exceptional.There is a huge difference between the normal dish and combo dish,the chicken pieces is too tiny,so we neither had good quality nor quantity.If we talk about the service it is very poor.My point is when your restaurant is expensive and you are famous about your authenticity about dishes,you people should increase your food quality and quantity .

Standing tall on the main road,opposite to the Nazrul Manch this place is a must try.Awesome food coupled with good service and ambience makes this place a hidden gem.We decided to try this place after going through the zomato reviews and be rest assured you wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Orders- Torched Sizzler (Pomfret),mixed hakka noodles,rendang curry (pork) and 2 cocktails (don't remember the names though).
The pomfret sizzler transported us to a different world altogether. It was a staff's recommendation and was totally rocking. It comes in 2 pieces, head and tail. You just can't get enough of the tad gravy that it's tossed in to make it spicy.The catch was absolutely fresh and succulent.
           The hakka noodles was a perfect choice by the staff to balance the spicy fish,we had as a starter.
             The pork rendang curry came with a light
 coconut fragrance and was absolutely top notch.
               The cocktails were ok,nothing extraordinary.
The staff is courteous, makes perfect suggestion. Service is well noted and fast. 
I'm totally satisfied with the place.

Let me honestly clarify , this review is based on yesterday's experience (being Valentine's day) , they were unable to give us a table on the first floor which is brilliantly decorated with white couches and glittering statues and we had to adjust in a low ceiling narrow mezzaine floor which is really claustrophobic . So the first dissapointment was not getting a comfortable seating.

Secondly, the service was horrendously slow . The soup took almost 45 minutes to arrive and the maincourse after a wait of half an hour. The staff was trying to cope up with the crowd , but we have seen what mismanagement was going around , wrong billing at one table , delay in giving the cheque at the other, i had to ask for the menu card thrice , had to ask for water and set countless reminders for food. So the staff clearly is not competent enough to manage a full house on a special day.

The food prices are irrationally high. Serving a noodle at 400 and starters from 450, and not being perfect in terms of service , is no way justified.

The food quality impressed us overall. We couldn't have a more perfect start than this CHICKEN LAKSA , one portion, divided into two which is a must try item here. The starter IKAN BAKAR DENGAN AIR ASSAM was six sizeable portions of grilled fish in chilly tamarind sauce wrapped in banana leaves, i had sky rising expectation from this which unfortunately didn't meet. The fish was amazingly done but the marination failed to hit our taste buds , pretty bland and unusual. The last speciality CHICKEN BLACK MAGIC NOODLES , a plate of noodles that comes in Rs 650 , i was a bit skeptish about what it would be like and it was a mixed experience, black coloured flat noodles tossed with a coconut infused white sauce which itself was very tasty , but the additional lot of vegetables, fried wafers was kind of unnecessary elements in the dish. Also the amount of chicken was quite less.

My cocktail SEX ON THE BEACH was presented beautifully in a margarita glass and i loved it. He ordered a large peg of Whisky with soda.

Been it any other day, this place would have definitely scored 4.5 or more, but as far as this Valentine's day mezzaine floor dining experience is considered , i cannot afford a more than 3.5 , an extra .5 goes for the laksa üòâ

Well, the ambience was pretty sophisticated and warm, but it lackes in quality of service. The menu was varied and interesting, although the pocket-pinch was a bit too high.
First off, what i found lacking in service was-we were greeted very coldly by this lady staff, and when we were finally in, it took about half an hour for someone to come and take the order. When we finally ordered, the person ran helter skelter asking the other service men if the item was available! Also, three of our four items were unavailable , but thats fine. Till the time we found out that the fourth one was unavailable too, and it had been crossed out of the list without our prior consent.
Overall, we ended up with the main course before our starter arrived, and it was pretty irritating. The man who tended us was quite polite, but even that seems pretty small to acknowledge, since our Rice Noodles was undercooked.
Hopefully, if I ever get back here, i will have a better exoerience (seeing that the heads of the place were quite polite and apologised profusely).

It was a Sunday when I had been to this place.

I'm sorry but the truth is, I went to Watsup cafe and later crave which also had a long  queue and it was already 9, so we decided to go to this place. 
This place is beautiful from inside and waiters are generous. They asked if we wanted private dining despite vacant seats out to which we happily agreed.

The Crispy Chilly Baby corn was very nice. It was really crisp and tasted good.
Chilli garlic Noodles and Soup was Okayish.

This place is really good with a different cuisine including Chinese and the owner himself being a musician.

The price pinch might look a little high but the food you get is a treat.... Absolutely superb!! Each and every item in the menu is crafted with utmost perfection. The Bali Prawn and Dee's Prawn are supreme signature culinary delicacies... Pretty quiet and nice ambience. Recommended for all.

Average food, horrible service..
Post soup & starter had to cancel my main course order because of the service standards in terms of delay & negligence, that too the restaurant being not that crowded. They boast of Japanese, Thai menu but in terms of taste & quality it's not at all that great or unique...

Fung Shway is located where China Bowl used to be on Southern Avenue. Up the grand stairs...there is seating both on the mezzanine and first floor. The lighting is bright...which means you can easily click selfies, read the menu and see your food when eating. I liked the decor which was unobtrusive but brought in flavours of South-east Asia.¬†Coming to the food...the menu has four sections, Chinese, Thai, Malay and Japanese, with a wide array of starters, soups, main courses and side dishes under each. They have a bar and the cocktails which we tried were well-made.¬†We had the papaya salad from the Thai menu and for the rest we opted for Malay food. For starters the Ayam Madu chicken dish was full of flavour from the aromatics. The Rendang curry chicken was spot on and I could just have bowls of that lemon-grass scented thick coconut milk gravy. The Malay grilled fish in banana leaves was also much appreciated by the others at the table (since I am not a fish eater) and vanished quickly enough! Special mention of the Nasi Kampung rice which was very tasty and had a bite to it. The flat noodles were the most unremarkable dish of the evening for me. Quantities were very generous.The meal was highly satisfactory and I was pleased to make the acquaintance of the chef who confirmed that he was earlier the owner of Twinkle Fung Shway on Dover Road where I had had my first ever Thai meal with my family as a kid. Lovely restaurant....good food....I will go back again.

Ended up at Fung Shway while looking for a good Asian restaurant in Calcutta. Easy to spot on the main road, the location is very convenient. Parking may be an issue as they do not have a dedicated parking spot. But the interiors and food make up for it! Brilliant ambience. By chance we stumbled upon the time they serve various combos - Thai, Japanese, Malaysian and Chinese! We ordered one Chinese and one Thai combo as one combo serves two people and both were vey very good. The food was amazing in taste and quantity but the only point was that there was not much choice in the drinks served with the combo. It was either a blue lagoon or a fresh lime soda. But given the amount at which the combos are priced, this is manageable. Value for money combos and their dessert of ice cream with caramelised cicocunt was simply out of the world. Much better than darsaan! 
Would love to try their Japanese the next time.

Okay so..this time will not go in a bit of details so you have a pleasant meal !
According to pictures  , you get decent ambience but not something out of the box . That's all for the ambience .
Now the main reason you are reading this review , FOOD .
I would just say one word for the food ' Yummy ' . You get really nice chinese food here , but if you are a person with high cholesterol or diabetes .. before ordering request them to make it in low oil . Oil content is WAY too much in the food. Though it tasted nice ( Specially the starters were oily ) .
Now the plus points .. Really friendly staff , amazing food , decent ambience ..what else do you need for a lovely outing . 
Good work Fung Shway team ..Keep it up !
Bon Appetit !

Location - Good - easy to spot . Zomato says wallet parking , but i wasn't able to locate and had to search for slot on the busy southern avenue .

Decore - excellent . Just that the tables could have been placed little more apart so that you can avoid the smell , gaze and private discussion  from the other table. 

Food - Good - but was surprised when the person taking the order convinced me to change my choice of lamb preparation and servered me under cooked lamb. But rest of the disk was quite good. 

Service - Needs Improvement - They forgot to bring me toothpick and "mouri" with my bill and they never realized its missing. You served me under cooked lamb which would stick in between my teeth and you won't even give me a toothpick thats a punishment. 

I will give this place another shot hope they will take better care of me and my guests.

The restaurant is on Southern Avenue with a ground and two floors. The ambience ¬†and decor was more than average. The thai food was yummy.

The Tom Ka Gai soup was the best I have ever had and is strongly recommended as is the Kung Pao chicken. The rice was also very good and the Phad Thai is also recommendable. The Lychee ice cream was new to me. The meal was very good and not too heavy. Staff were attentive. The restaurant also has an enclosed room where we had our dinner in privacy.

Fung Shway had been on my wish list for its beautifully selected, eclectic menu. The detailed, often meandering menu will take you through street foods, rustic dishes and famed platters from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea and Japan. There's Nasi Goreng and Sambal, Sushi platters and Korean Lamb Chops...flat noodles and village rice....the list is endless, and that often makes choosing a little difficult. Kudos to Fung Shway for making each dish stand out on its own, in terms of presentation, flavour and taste. The Korean Lamb Chops have the tanginess of tamarind, topped with crisp sesame. The Bali Prawns are perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy, fresh once you bite in. The flat noodles from Thailand, with its hint of Basil, is mild and full of flavour. Each dish is excellent, and I'm definitely going back soon!

China Bowl has been replaced by this restaurant, Feng Shway. With a classy make-over, it got an awesome decor. Coming to food, we loved the menu card with distinct sections showing Chinese, Thai, Malaysian and Japanese cuisine. As we have not tasted Malay food before, we concentrated on that section only. Suggested by the restaurant staff, we ordered sota ayam soup, nasi kamping rice and redang fish. All the items were delicious. The soup got an excellent flavor. The portion size of both the rice and fish were big enough for two. We ended our meal with caramelized coconut ice cream and it was heavenly. This restaurant got a big score on the hospitality ground too. The owner himself came and greeted us. Together, we loved our experience at Fung Shway.

Asian Cuisine being one of my absolute favourite cuisine , me  and my folks  decided to give this place a try on Christmas . And I was not disappointed ! The place serves authentic and delicious  asian food. We started with burnt garlic soup , followed by Chicken satay , burnt ginger rice ,. Kung pao fish and pad thai noodles. The food was lip smacking and the service was impeccable. Even with all the rush , servers paid attention to each and every table which was really nice ( not something you get to see in some places especially if it's rush hour ) . Wrapping up , I would visit this place yet again to try other Asian delicacies .

There are good places to try Asian cuisines, then there are great places to have Asian cuisines. Fung Shway deserves to be the latter.

This place has been in our wish list for quite some time. Finally we gave it a visit.

On entering you will be amused by their elegant decor. We climbed up beautiful stairs and they gave us the seat of our choice. The interior was simple yet captivating.

We tried Malaysian cuisine which they are offering.
Starting off with Virgin Blue Lagoon (mocktail), which was quite good, we quickly moved on to Soyo Ayam. It was a rich flavourful soup containing Manchurian balls, noodles, shredded chicken and sliced egg. (5/5)
Then, they served us the star of the show, Ayam Madu. Soft chicken chunks tossed in tomato, curry leaves and Malaysian spices smells great, tastes delicious. (5/5).

In main course, they served us Assam Pedas, Malaya TEmpeh and Nasi Tomato (chicken).
Malaya TEmpeh was flat noodles tossed with Malaysian spices and chicken strips. (5/5)
Nasi Tomato was tomato flavoured chicken fried rice which complemented Assam Pedas, chicken in tomato gravy.
We wrapped up with butter scotch ice cream.

The quantity was too much for both of us.
Service was prompt and extremely cordial.

Fung Shway has been on my bucket list for a long time. I've eaten take away from here before but I've never had the full dining experience. We went last night to celebrate a birthday and we left extremely satisfied. The whole experience was incredible - from the impeccable service to the unique flavours. 
To begin with it's located in Southern Avenue. The restaurant is big and equipped with a lift (super helpful since we were with elderly people). It serves Thai, Chinese, Japanese and Malaysian food although we largely stuck to the Thai menu. The staff bent over backwards to give us an enjoyable time. The ambience was just right! Portions are quite large so I recommend going with a few people. 

Moving on to the food. For soup we ordered the lemon coriander, Tom Yum and Laksa. All were packed with flavour and meat. The Laksa was definitely standout. A speciality of the restaurant, it was rich, creamy and perfectly seasoned. The condiments complimented the soup very well. My favourite dish of the evening and I would highly recommend it (particularly if you're going for lunch)
For starters we tried - 
Pan fried fish - cooked to perfection 
Fish cakes - not a fan of fish cakes in general because of the texture but it was enjoyed by the rest at the table 
chicken satay - comes with a delicious peanut sauce
  Bali prawns - another standout! Skewered prawns with the most crunchy coating. Textural ingenuity!

For mains we had - 
Pineapple Thai rice - a little on the sweeter side goes well with spicy sides 
Black Magic Noodles - if you love coconut and noodles you have to try this squid ink noodles. It'll take you straight to the ocean! 
Hot Basil chicken - packed full of flavour and very aromatic 
Hot Garlic prawns

I thoroughly enjoyed my evening and the food was divine. As someone who enjoys Asian, I couldn't be happier that Kolkata finally has some great Oriental options!

Asked what palate of food we like and suggested us dishes accordingly. We ordered Laska , Tom Yum Soup, Paad Thai noodles, American Corn, Kakiyage Maki and Ice Cream Tempura. Everything was delicious and made to perfection. The flavours of each dish stood out distinctly. I highly recommend this place to all the Asian food lover, you get Thai, Oriental, Japanese all under one roof.

We went there on the spur of the moment. It was a neat and clean place. Valet car parking available. We were greeted by a beautiful lady at the reception who directed us to the required area. I did not expect such ambience and good behaviour from the staff. They ushered us in, helped me to my seat, and the Maitre de table was an extremely polite gentleman who could guide us to the gastronomical path. We were not interested in dinner, only bite sized food. I ordered prawn sushi as I was very fond of the same. Added to it he suggested Tai Pai chicken.

Chicken arrived first. It was a spicy affair, but very tasty. The pieces are juicy and soft. We enjoyed it to the full. Next came sushi. How we loved it! I decided to parcel some for home the next time I pass by. 

The price is on steep side, but it is worth it. We also had the pleasure to meet the proprietor who took personal care of the patrons.

We left a happy and satiated couple.

Fung Shway has opened its doors at Southern Avenue for almost a year now and I had been meaning to make my way here for quite some time..  Finally, on Ashtami night, we visited the joint for an early family dinner..  As expected on any Puja night, the place was already full and we were asked to wait for another half hour.  The lady at the reception was very polite and amiable üòä...  The place was quite spacious inside but I felt they should have done more with the decor, if they want to project it as a fine dining restaurant.  The decor was somewhat loud and commonplace. However I decided to overlook that because I had high hopes regarding the food.. They serve a wide array of dishes comprising Oriental cuisine - Chinese, Thai, Japanese, etc..  Unfortunately during pujas, they had a limited menu to choose from and so I had to stick to the basics. I loved the Tom Kha Gai soup and undoubtedly it was the star of the meal. The chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian were both ordinary.. The Chicken Schezwan had a peculiar taste, not what I have in mind when I order Schezwan.  The prices were a bit on the higher side.. I was very happy with the hospitality here though.. 
I feel this place has quite a long way to go  and they can become a force to reckon with if they improve on certain spheres. However before making any judgement, I would like to visit this place on a non-Puja bustle-free day and sample their original menu.  Till then, Best of luck to the team!!

I am a bit late in reviewing this place, but even as I write this review I am cringing¬† with disgust. Beware of their specialty, HAIR strands in most dishes. 
The decor is a bit loud and garrulous and the service decent but it disappointed us terribly on the food hygiene front. We ordered crispy chilly babycorn and the nan king lamb for starters, the raw papaya salad and the bali prawns as our main. As far as the flavours are concerned they were not found wanting at all and we liked all the dishes. However, we were initially put off to find a couple of strands of hair in our salad. After notified the staff we decided to move on assuming it to be a one off incident but were horrified to find a few more strands of hair in our prawn dish as well. We again duly notified the staff and the manager was quite ashamed (but not apologetic) and an hushed argument ensued amongst the staff members as to who the culprit could be. Our drinks of G and T and mojito were conventional so nothing to complain about there. The value for money too was reasonable.
I was definitely not expecting any freebies or a discount on the final bill but to display a token of apology the staff could have done something. No such action was taken. We left in a bad mood and they appeared embarrassed. Not going back. Not ordering again.

We went their on a Sunday evening. Restaurant was quiet empty with just 3 tables occupied. We ordered for veg lemon coriander soup which was too thick almost like sweet corn and it seemed they had mashed up the coriander and used it. Wasn't lemony as it was supposed to be. We mentioned it and the server was kind enough to change it. Next came the veg sushi which was nice. Chargrilled tofu was ordered on the recommendation of the server but to our surprise it was fried tofu in tamarind sauce rather than grilled. The stir fried asparagus was also recommended to us. The asparagus was not for good quality and was too thin which made the entire dish tasteless. We also tried the green curry with sticky rice and pad Thai noodles. The curry was really good however the rice was too sticky. Also the pad Thai was horrible. No sprouts or veggies. Hardly any peanuts. All we got was dark brown color flat noodles with carrots and onions only. Overall a bad experience at a much talked about place. Not going back again. With so many new places opening in kolkata they need to upgrade their quality in order to survive.

Fung Shway is located in Southern Avenue which previously housed one of my favourite restaurants China Bowl. The decor is bang on, loved it. Staff is courteous however service is really slow. 

We ordered Tom Yum soup, veg spring rolls and Tai pei chicken. For the main course, we order pad thai noodles, Nasi Kampung and chicken sambal.

The food was great but the price is a bit on the higher side. Loved it and will definitely visit soon.

We left a happy and satiated couple.

Fung Shway has opened its doors at Southern Avenue for almost a year now and I had been meaning to make my way here for quite some time..  Finally, on Ashtami night, we visited the joint for an early family dinner..  As expected on any Puja night, the place was already full and we were asked to wait for another half hour.  The lady at the reception was very polite and amiable üòä...  The place was quite spacious inside but I felt they should have done more with the decor, if they want to project it as a fine dining restaurant.  The decor was somewhat loud and commonplace. However I decided to overlook that because I had high hopes regarding the food.. They serve a wide array of dishes comprising Oriental cuisine - Chinese, Thai, Japanese, etc..  Unfortunately during pujas, they had a limited menu to choose from and so I had to stick to the basics. I loved the Tom Kha Gai soup and undoubtedly it was the star of the meal. The chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian were both ordinary.. The Chicken Schezwan had a peculiar taste, not what I have in mind when I order Schezwan.  The prices were a bit on the higher side.. I was very happy with the hospitality here though.. 
I feel this place has quite a long way to go  and they can become a force to reckon with if they improve on certain spheres. However before making any judgement, I would like to visit this place on a non-Puja bustle-free day and sample their original menu.  Till then, Best of luck to the team!!

I am a bit late in reviewing this place, but even as I write this review I am cringing¬† with disgust. Beware of their specialty, HAIR strands in most dishes. 
The decor is a bit loud and garrulous and the service decent but it disappointed us terribly on the food hygiene front. We ordered crispy chilly babycorn and the nan king lamb for starters, the raw papaya salad and the bali prawns as our main. As far as the flavours are concerned they were not found wanting at all and we liked all the dishes. However, we were initially put off to find a couple of strands of hair in our salad. After notified the staff we decided to move on assuming it to be a one off incident but were horrified to find a few more strands of hair in our prawn dish as well. We again duly notified the staff and the manager was quite ashamed (but not apologetic) and an hushed argument ensued amongst the staff members as to who the culprit could be. Our drinks of G and T and mojito were conventional so nothing to complain about there. The value for money too was reasonable.
I was definitely not expecting any freebies or a discount on the final bill but to display a token of apology the staff could have done something. No such action was taken. We left in a bad mood and they appeared embarrassed. Not going back. Not ordering again.

We went their on a Sunday evening. Restaurant was quiet empty with just 3 tables occupied. We ordered for veg lemon coriander soup which was too thick almost like sweet corn and it seemed they had mashed up the coriander and used it. Wasn't lemony as it was supposed to be. We mentioned it and the server was kind enough to change it. Next came the veg sushi which was nice. Chargrilled tofu was ordered on the recommendation of the server but to our surprise it was fried tofu in tamarind sauce rather than grilled. The stir fried asparagus was also recommended to us. The asparagus was not for good quality and was too thin which made the entire dish tasteless. We also tried the green curry with sticky rice and pad Thai noodles. The curry was really good however the rice was too sticky. Also the pad Thai was horrible. No sprouts or veggies. Hardly any peanuts. All we got was dark brown color flat noodles with carrots and onions only. Overall a bad experience at a much talked about place. Not going back again. With so many new places opening in kolkata they need to upgrade their quality in order to survive.

Fung Shway is located in Southern Avenue which previously housed one of my favourite restaurants China Bowl. The decor is bang on, loved it. Staff is courteous however service is really slow. 

We ordered Tom Yum soup, veg spring rolls and Tai pei chicken. For the main course, we order pad thai noodles, Nasi Kampung and chicken sambal.

The food was great but the price is a bit on the higher side. Loved it and will definitely visit soon.

Fung shway located on the southern avenue was on my list for quite sometime. The glitter and glamour from the outside made me want to go for dinner.
So i with three of my old school buddies planned out a dinner there.
if i was supposed to rate for the ambience i would give them 4.5, it is decorated in a splendid manner which gives it a very nice feel. The chairs and tables and the wooden work on the stairs make it look wonderful. okay so lets talk about food now.

For starters we had ordered Tai pai Chicken and Fish Cake.
The tai pai chicken being okay the fish cake was disastrous. It also had a hair in it and when we said that to the manager he readily made another one for us but the taste was still bad, Maybe its our food buds that was bad or rotten.

Without experimenting further we ordered for chicken fried rice and schewan chicken. I really didnot like the food at all. ¬†The rating is just based on the food and nothing else.
Staff, Ambience everything else ¬†was pretty good.

Went there on Ashtami of this year Pujas with my mom. It was my first visit to the place. But certainly not the last. The taste of the food was something which can make me spend thousands over there again and again without any hesitation. The food quality and taste is worth every penny you spend there. The ambience is also beautiful. Be it any occasion, the place just suits it.

The very first visit swept me off my feet. A set of cordial waiters helped in menu selection. The food was awesome yet did not tax my wallet. The icing on the cake was the caramel coconut ice cream (well... it a must-have) ÔøΩ. The cozy, warm ambience with the perfect temperature setting and sitting arrangement can far surpass any of the much famed restoras of Kolkata

First we have ordered stater like chicken ayam madu .it is very tasty and spicy dish. Then we ordered chicken tai pai. It was also good. Then we have ordered  chicken kaffir fried rice and chili garlic noodles and kung pao chicken. The flavor of the kaffir fried rice is just awesome.it is just like a lemon flavour. Last of all we have ordered desserts like carmalised coconut ice cream .

Visited this place with huge expectations but ended up with whole disappointment...

Had to wait for 45 mins but that's okay as it was Durga Ashtami...

But the quality of food disappointed us more than anything else...

The Pan Fried Chilli Fish had hard thik coating and even the fish was not marinated properly and hard...The Haka Noodles were hard and not boiled properly...

I have to think if would again visit here...

Nice Place. Good Ambience. Variation in the menu is good. Many options to select from. I ordered Korean Lamb Chops well prepared tendered pieces of lambs. I next moved to the Malaysian Part and ordered Pork item. The pork was under cooked and bit rough. I immediately went forward and raised concern with the manager who in turn took the whole dish away and prepared a fresh one for us. The manager also took away the rice got it recooked and served hot. This gesture is really awesome. I've been to quite a number of hotels and have faced problems with dishes but have received this type of gesture from any one. This fine dining restaurant knows how to satisfy their customers. I'll definitely visit them again to try the other dishes.

During a festival night we dropped by here, accidentally and it was a blessing in disguise! The moment you enter inside, the interior will catch your eyes. A picture perfect oriental decor, with few artifacts glorifying the oriental flavour! The seating arrangement is quite sophisticated. Most importantly the food tastes quite palatable. They offer a wide range of oriental dishes. We requested them to prepare the food less spicy and they did a good job without compromising the taste! The most striking feature was the delivery time. They were ridiculously fast in delivering the placed order to the table. All the staffs including the proprietor were ultra-courteous! They had been visiting all the tables and interacting with guests with a welcome smile on face. One of the best Oriental cuisine restaurants in this vicinity !

Landed up all drenched to this place on a rainy navami evening after puja parikroma. The entrance and the grand staircase delighted us at the first sight. We got ourselves tucked in the cosy mezzanine floor which had the bar section handy. We promptly ordered the hot and sour veg soup to warm ourselves, which was a great blend of flavours. We ordered the Kaki yage sushi, which had crispy fried veggies rolled in, and was amazing. Also ordered veg manchurian, which I liked a lot, and to go with it, a bowl of jai thai noodles, on chef's recommendation for it being their speciality. Noodles came as a big surprise because I wasn't expecting it to be matching my taste as I do not prefer thai food in usual course. Flat sloppy noodles with mild flavors which was equally balanced with sour and spicy infusions and had much of indian taste. Had a virgin mojito, which was pretty usual yet refreshing. Lastly, we ordered caramelised coconut icecream. I am a sucker for coconut icecream and this one just melted my heart away. I was being specifically told that it was imported from Bangkok. They staff was highly courteous. I would like to mention that we were explained every dish we were served and also got recommendations according to our preferences. They specially mentioned that the ingredients are imported and that is why the taste of their dishes are authentic. I was moved by the hospitality. I would recommend.

We went there expecting a classic Dilip Massey meal. They had a truncated Pooja Special Menu with some items from the regular menu priced about ‚Çπ100 more than the regular menu. We ordered 2 soups, a papaya salad and a Taipei Chicken. Then we sat chatting. 35 minutes later not a single item came to our table. I spoke to the person at the till and he said he would find out the status of our food. After 15 minutes still no joy nor news about the food. Went down to speak to senior management. They said they are a. It backed up in the kitchen. This was when there were about 10 people in the entire restaurant. Someone who seemed to be from the owners family said he will look into the matter. Surprise surprise he comes to our table after 15 minutes and asks us if we ordered anything. I was shocked. They did not bother to find out who took our order etc but came to ask us if we had ordered. Finally the soups and starters arrived after an hour and 15 minutes.

So went last night (actually midnight) with my family of 4, we were really hungry did not have any specific crave, ordered hakka chow mein, Gravy-style Kung Pao Chicken and Pad Thai. All of them were served promptly even with the Puja crowd. We were filled to the brim because the serving sizes were large. Quite good. They took some time to prepare the bill, but it was alright, because I took some time to finish my dish.
-----------
I have previously given a rating of 4.0 before, but now I feel it very important to reduce the rating. Last night, we went there, and ordered Yakisoba noodles along with some other dishes. However, I was shocked to see that they prepared Yakisoba noodles without buckwheat noodles. Let that sink in, Yakisoba, without 'soba'. I tried to keep it civil as I reasoned against their choice of noodles, but the owner of the restaurant confidently shut me down (with due respect) saying yakisoba could mean any noodles, though I kept protesting, but eventually gave up. Upon searching many sources, the first thing that came up was 'fried buckwheat' noodles. I don't know, they could've just said they ran out of buckwheat noodles.

Extremely delicious food. Really worth every penny. The best part is that it isn't confined to a particular cuisine. It has a variety of cuisines including my favourite Japanese. I tried the Sushis and Sashimis, they were awesome. Among desserts I tried the Vanilla ice cream with toasted coconuts. It was also mouth watering. I'll recommend you to try it. It was a great experience.

Went for dinner with family on a Sunday. Very nice and warm place with grand interiors. 
We ordered Lemon Coriander and Tom Yum Soup. Both were very good. I would really recommend people to try it.
We tried Sushi. It was quite good. The American Chopsuey was almost perfect.
We also ordered a combination of rice and gravy. I did not like it because of the mustard flavor. Leaving that aside everything was quite good.
I would also like to say that service is quite slow. Overall it was a good experience.

Very good decor, courteous staff, good food and good variety of cocktail. I really liked the place and I think our city should have more such upscale restaurants. I liked what the captain suggested us to eat. We ordered lamb chops, spare ribs, a malaysian rice dish and also one prawn. I think they can work on the spare ribs a bit more and give a little less cinnamon and increase the portions a bit. Still I must say I will go there quite often just because of the hospitality of the staff which is very much missing from most of the restaurants in this city. Keep up the good work.

After watching 'Baar Baar Dekho' we had planned a dinner at the nearest 'Oriental Cuisine' joint. But browsing though Zomato, got to know of this place and changed the plans. Turns out it was a good decision ,as we enjoyed the food and service offered here, in 'Fung Shway'. For the first course, we had Seafood Hawker's Soup, Bali Prawns and Chicken Satay. All of them had distinct flavour, were prepared with utmost care and definitely lifted our moods and satisfied our taste buds. The biggest appreciation is for the Bali Prawns though, a great preparation. Next up, for the Main Course, we went for the normal fare, with Mixed Hakka Noodles and Kung Pao Chicken. Both of them exceeded our expectations in taste and quantity. In the end, we didn't have space in our stomachs for Dessert, to be honest we felt almost full after the first course itself. On the whole, a nice experience and will definitely revisit. In addition, it was very nice of the Chef Dilip Massey to make an experience and interact with us, shows how much they care for their patrons. And though we didn't have dessert, this was definitely the icing on the cake.
Visited with family (4 persons).

Decided to try out this new restaurant situated bang on Southern Avenue while hanging out with friends. The decor and staff was were quite courteous and professional. Coming to the food, we had ordered the Dampa Prawn and a Japanese chicken cutlet (forgot the actual name !!!! ) as starters. The cutlet thing was nice and juicy, though the chicken could have been a tad softer (some trick needs to be done with the marination). But I was blown over by the Dampa Prawn. Innovative, tasteful, flavorful.....never knew that beer marination could produce such stupendous result. Full marks and a Big Thumbs Up to the Dampa !!!!
Coming to the main course, we ordered Saffron noodles with lamb in Sambal Sauce. The noodles were full of crunchy veggies and succulent chicken, nice flavor and taste. However, the noodle felt a little hard.....I am not sure if it was rice noodles, but if it was then that is okay. But if it was not rice noodles, then maybe it was a little underboiled (no big deal, just a matter of perfection !!!). The Sambal sauce was a treat, with soft pieces of lamb and a blast of flavours in the mouth. One of the best sides I have tasted !!!
We were well served by Akshay, who was very courteous, and he gave us dish suggestions which came brilliant. It was evident he knew exactly how the dishes tasted. Very impressive. The chef-cum-owner Mr. Dilip also gave us a visit and we had a very nice chat with him. With such personal notes, you are not only winning customers, but soon will have a cult fan following in the Kolkata foodies world. Great going folks, will be visiting you again !!!!

Fung Shway was an old favorite and I was delighted when it opened up on Southern Avenue fairly close to where we lived. We visited a number of time and had very good food. They had ¬†one of the best Green Thai Curries available in the city and we loved it. Regretfully however in the last two times where we ordered from there for home the first time the Chicken in Chilli Plum Sauce was inedible as the chicken was stale and bad and the second time fairly recently we had ordered our old favorite the Prawn Green Thai Curry and the Lemon Grass was rather dry and peculiar . I hope they sort out their issues quickly as I am a huge fan and want them back with a bang !

Laksha soup tasted delicious and so was chicken basil (Thai  rice) & Chicken yellow (Thai).Tori Katsu  (chicken) as starter  was equally good,but fish cake was not upto my expectation.

A new gem in Southern Avenue, this restaurant serves amazing Asian Cuisine, especially Chinese, Thai, Japanese and very new in Kolkata, Malaysian. The behavior of the staff and the d√©cor is sure to floor you, as soon as you enter the place. The menu can be a bit puzzling, since it boasts of relatively new dishes. We decided to stick to one cuisine but well, when it comes to food, sticking to plan is pretty difficult. On our attendant‚Äôs recommendation we ordered Lemon Coriander Soup, the flavor and taste is distinct and amazing. As starter, the Angel on Horseback was succulent, just as the menu describe. The Black Magic Noodles and the Ayam Madu were also strong contenders. Deciding on the winner was difficult and I did not even try. The behavior of the staff, the taste and the vast unexplored menu was an open invitation for me to visit again.

Been visiting this place for quite sometime now, me and my family have been loyal to this place starting when they were in Dover Lane, however, in between they were closed for sometime. Now, that they have opened again in Southern Avenue it brings back some nostalgic memories of fine Thai food for which Fung Shway is famous. THE Thai cuisine here is so far the best I have ever had, even better than what I had in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, in one word, "AWESOME". Apart from Thai, I see they now have a variety of other dishes and cuisine's added to their current menu. ¬†Will have to try them 1 by 1. Although, the cost is a little on the higher side, but then it's absolutely worth the quality and the quantity, well for premium quality food and ambiance, it makes sense to spend a little, especially when you are taking your family out.

Was pleasantly surprised with this new place.  We ordered the laksa which was phenomenal! It was perfectly tempered and tasted just right to have a hearty meal out of it.  The hakka noodles and the exotic vegs were okayish.  Nothing extra ordinary.  Would definitely recommend this place to try their Asian cuisines namely Malaysian, Japanese and Thai.

This used to be China bowl but now it's so much better. This place has been on my go to list for awhile and I finally managed to find the laksa in Kolkata. The food is superb and I couldnt fault the taste or the presentation. The pho and the laksa was good though the laksa was a bit more like khau swey than the Malaysian street food variety. The owners are rather nice and friendly and u know it's genuine and not hotel management gimmicky. Split into 3 levels the d√©cor is well planned and not over the top. There's also a hidden attraction,  you can take a ride on Kolkata's slowest hydraulic lift right here in this restaurant.

With the arrival of Fung Shway, Southern Avenue can now boast of a good restaurant. Good food served by courteous staff along with nice decor & ambience. Albeit being a little pricey, I'm sure Fung Shway would be drawing crowds. 
The choice of food is varied as the restaurant is serving Thai, Japanese, Malaysian & Chinese. The first item tasted was Ayam Madu, which was a non veg starter. It was excellent in taste & the chicken was soft. Kai Chi was another chicken item which was also  quite tasty. Oriental toast, where shrimps on toast was deep fried & served with a yummy chili coriander dip. The dish was delicious but would have preferred a bit more of shrimps. Lamb chops with tamarind honey sauce was out of this world! So was the Khao Phat Rice (mixed) & Sambal (chicken). The only disappointment was Pan Fried Fish. Though they said it was Bekti but I have a hunch that it was Basa. Didn't like the dish at all.
The desserts were something I haven't had before. Both the Tempura Ice Cream & Caramelised Coconut Ice Creams were great.

Nothing about this restaurant was classy,  neither the food nor the service nor the decor.   We ordered soups to being with and they were just okay.  For main course we ordered the Kaffir Rice with Vegetable Massaman curry.  The Kaffir Rice had no flavour or aroma of Kaffir and the Massaman curry was watery missing the rich taste if coconut milk and the vegetables were cut in all odd and uneven shapes. Only when we informed the so called gentleman serving our table that the Kaffir Rice did not really seem authentic were we told that there was no Kaffir in it!!!!!  The service was terrible,  the so called gentleman attending our table did not have any focus while taking the order, he was looking around and behind and attended a phone call as well.  Once we placed order for the soup,  his tonality was rude.  Pretty disgusted by the overall attitude of this particular gentleman.  So here is a little note to the management..... Please train your staff,  consider the pricing as neither the food quality or service match up to the rates on your menu card.  Also don't think when people are served a dish contrary to what has been ordered,  people won't understand! We were offered an option to order another dish half way through the meal, something for which we neither had the time and patience for,  really we did not want to try another disaster of a dish.  If you really had to do service recovery and you cared so much about your customers,  you would not have charged us for the rice.  So much for hospitality,  never visiting ever again and neither am recommending this place to anyone.

Had been to this place for lunch on a weekend and must say, was truly delighted. We were quite surprised that the place was empty, that too on a Sunday afternoon and when the food was yum! To start with, we ordered laksa, and to this day the taste is lingering in my mouth. Yes, it was so delicious. The Thai style chilli potato was ok but Thai red curry, which we ordered for main course was again a good surprise. The prices are a tad too high, but I wud like to visit this place again soon, just to have the laksa again! with

If you are willing to waste your money then you must visit this place. I was looking for a nice place for lunch in southern avenue when my friends and I came across this restaurant tucked between indthalia and crave foodworks. Although we had never heard of this place yet we decided to sample their fare. The interiors were well done and we ordered quickly since we were hungry. But beware...We were served chicken soup although we had ordered veg soup. The management was not very pro-active in dealing with the situation and we left immediately. So just a word of caution to those willing to pay for such fiascos...

My hubby wanted to pamper me for my decision to start dieting from today üòÅ So he took me out to dine here and guess what?! Yeah my calorie count must ve hit the roof.
Well I dont regret at all.
The decor is simple yet elegant and tasteful. The waiters and managers are so very courteous and pamper you with the elaborate menu choices.
Okay, the place basically offers Chinese (a lil adjusted to Indian taste), very authentic Thai, Japanese and Malay (Malaysian) cuisine. So go ahead and pick out things from all four portions of the menu.
We had all veg food today.
The flat noodles dish with a peanut twist was out of this world. Its called Malaya Tempeh. Work with the waiters because there is no elaborate description in the menu card. They will very politely guide you through it and mention about the spice levels you can take. We got all our dishes with the spice notched down a bit. And voil√†, I had the best meal of the month here. Crispy chilli fried cottage cheese was a starter I will remember forever for the sharp taste. Yummy.
*Lipsmack* my favorite Red curry was good -3.8 but nothing to ride home about except that it was steaming hot till we paid the bill and were about to leave.
The best item on the menu tonight according to me is one in the dessert menu - Caramelized coconut ice cream. Hot crispy Caramelized coconut bits on ice cream.
Well what can I say, it was a date to remember.
Crowd is decent. Location very convenient. Valet parking. Good for them business and family lunches and dinners y'all!

Seeing the great reviews and ratings on zomato and the Facebook page, took the celebration to this place. Food is decent, though not so happy that the pineapple rice wasn't served in a pineapple. Ambience is overdone and too much light. Ice cream is overpriced, not really unique or made in the house.

Well fellow Zomatians reviewed the place and it has a rating of above 4, so the familia decided why not give it a shot.
The decor was absolutely brilliant, but guess what the food was even better. The manager was extremely courteous (till the point you start doubting why is he so damn nice, is there something wrong with this place :D, has he poisoned my food or something :D ).... on a serious note the staff was well mannered and service was swift. 
Each and every dish we ordered had a distinct flavour and the quantity was also modest ( i have added a picture of a thai noodles u might get some idea regarding the quantity/portion ). Over and all a good experience. 
Pocket Pinch : 4.5 k for 5 people (2 soups, 3 starters, 2 main course side dish, 2 noodles and 1 rice).
Do try the Kung Pao chicken. 
Well...."The new kid in the block" was brilliant.
Thank you fellow Zomatians....keep hogging 
Cheers.

So on a lazy Monday evening, I stumbled into this restaurant. I took it to be a run of the mill Chinese restaurant. But boy oh boy, wasn't I wrong. The menu boasted of a quirky assortment of oriental dishes which would challenge any experimental foodie. I played safe and ordered a Pan Fried Fish with a drink. And they blew me away with the food. The Burnt Garlic Fried Rice and the Kung Pao Chicken, i ordered later, were equally satisfying. The best part, apart from the food, was the neat decor. Whoever designed the interiors deserves a huge pat in the back. The staff were quite welcoming and helpful.

Chinese done, but I am definitely coming back for the Japanese, Malaysian, Korean and Thai dishes. If you are reading this review and love oriental food, I would strongly advise you to follow suit.

Probably one of the best places in Kolkata serving oriental cuisine. Went there with my husband for a late dinner. A very cozy, nicely lit place, with well-behaved waiters, and awesome food! We just loved the Korean Lamb Chops, Fish Cake and Grilled Lamb with a touch of Basil and Chilli. I would suggest this place to everyone looking for some excellent food in the city. 

Would love to visit Fung Shway again soon and try their other delicacies. 

P.S. It was great talking to the Chef cum owner Mr. Dilip, and to tell him about our choice of food and he gave us a platter of exactly what we wanted ! Kudos to him ! 

Keep up the good work ! :)

Southern Avenue's newest offering! Conveniently located, busy place on weekends, so make sure you have your table(s) reserved!
Perfect place for a family dinner. The decor is commendable, so are the people and the entire setting. They also have valet parking and an elevator. The prices are on the higher side.

We had ordered for a chicken starter, a pan fried fish in plum sauce which was exceptionally good.
We inquired about their pork dish but they said "it was not available."

Ordered oriental toast which had shrimp. American Chopsuey was also okay.

Con: Staff needs to be little bit more attentive. We'd ordered J & B, what we received was JD. The price difference was huge. So, we had to pay for something we didn't want! Surprisingly in spite of pointing that out they did not make any change in the bill! So, guys, please ensure you ask them to repeat your order!

Finally visited this place! This an easy to locate restaurant on southern avenue. This used to be China Bowl which has now transformed into its new avatar Fung Shway! Also expanding its cuisine to Malaysian, Thai and Japanese. The crew was warm! Being quite unsure of what to order the meal was totally decided by the member for us! For entree we had Ebi Maki ( sushi with prawn filling) Chicken Wrapped in banana leaf and Californian Maki (sushi with crab filling). On the liquids, Casablanca and Cosmopolitan was just fair enough! From the Malaysian menu the main course was ordered, Fish in Sambal Sauce and Chicken Char Kues Tiaw. To satisfy the sweet tooth the table was served with Tempura Ice Cream (this is a ice cream fired in a rice sheet and tempted with chocolate sauce) and Nutty Date! It was a treat in itself. Ambiance worth many selfies and pics! ;) Pocket pinch bit on the higher side! Was it worth? Absolutely!

However, everything on the menu is exorbitantly charged. The excessive price and taxes on the charges will act as a deterrent to future visits to the place.

Another restaurant on the already crowded southern avenue stretch. The menu is divide into 3 sections - Malaysian, Thai and Japanese. 
Best to avoid the sushi. The tai pai chicken is a good sweet and at my starter. The fried rice is decent as well. 
All the food here is average in terms of flavour. Very overpriced for this level of cooking.

This newly opened place in Southern Avenue has a pretty flashy exterior and that's what initially caught my attention. Golpark, Southern Avenue, Hindustan Park all have seen a prolific rise in new eateries in the last few years. But there's hardly any fine dining place in this area which has caught my attention, but this surely did. 

I went here for a weekend dinner and was in the mood for my present favourite, Japanese. Their crabstick temaki was brilliant and they are one of the few restaurants in the city to offer sushis in their hand rolled cone form. The ubi maki was good too. 

We also tried the Thai Fish Cake, and with the sweet chilli dip, they tasted outstanding. The balance of spices and flavors in this one was great indeed.

For mains, we again went back to the Japanese menu, and ordered Chicken in Lemon Butter, and a Chicken Rice. The quantity of the rice dish was just perfect, and the chicken was still juicy. The mushrooms, doused in a brown lemon butter sauce, were my favourite part though.

Their lemongrass ice cream wasn't available, which was disappointing. So I skipped desserts. 

The place looks inviting and warm, the staff is well trained but could have been a bit more genial. Also they wanted to serve us our mains, while we were still just getting started on our appetizers, and that I find unacceptable. 

The bill with the above food, a pint of beer and another small drink was around 3.5k, which may be just a tad bit on the higher side. But this was a dinner I really enjoyed. Will definitely visit again.

Fung Shway offer 4 different types of cuisines - Thai, Malaysian, Japanese and Chinese.

My experience , the one time that I visited was limited to chinese and thai.
For starters : the steamed prawn reminded me of the flavour of the islands in Bali, rich taste of prawn , uncluttered, without any coating.

The chicken in Basil was a thai prep. and it was tangy and hot which suited by taste bud Very well made indeed.
Ambience and Service top notch. Well worth a few more visits.

Twinkle Fung Shway was a restaurant in Hindustan Road which opened in the early nineties and served what was then the most authentic Thai food in town and the only one,much before Baan Thai at the Oberoi Grand.

I guessed and was pleasantly surprised to find the same polite,helpful gentleman here in this glittering new restaurant which was earlier China Bowl.

A winner in menu selection and taste.We had American Chop suey,Malaysian sambal chicken and oriental prawns.Everything was good but the Sambal was not really authentic.

What these guys have to brush up on is the service which is inordinately slow and ill informed but I'm sure they will rectify this.

Comeback joint.

So, we went out for the Bengali New Year lunch in the Oriental fashion. Being recommended by a friend, three of us went for the lunch affair.  We had Basil Lamb, Kaafir Rice, Pork Chops and one Malaysian noodles with chicken (forgot the name)

Very good taste,each of the items. Our Captain, Mr. Rohan,has been a great help in choosing the dishes. We had reposed out faith on him and we were rewarded with the riot of flavours and tastes in our palate. Distinct aroma and tastes complementing each other created a harmony in mouth.

I will recommend and will visit again for an authentic taste and welcoming ambience.

After office, we wanted a nice cozy restaurant for a good meal. The restaurant caught our eye. They have a large spread in menu. We ordered fish amd rice after asking the waiter 100 times as the Malaysian cuisine is not known to us. The whole preparation was salty. The rice had no taste. In Fact, the sweet lime soda was horrible. The chief chef was very friendly but the food was over priced and not at all good to taste. Not a good place for foodies like me.

They have risen like a Phoenix from the ashes (of erstwhile China Bowl). Excellent ambience awaits as one walks through the doors. The music that is played is endearing. The decor is awesome....the seating is extremely comfortable.
Coming to the service....I have been many places but the service here is beyond compare. They take care of everything in detail, they do not even give the opportunity for a problem to arise. Very agile, alert and hospitable staff. ( All the ladies, the men and special mention of one Mr.Digambar).
This day our order mainly consisted of Malaysian delicacies. For starters we ordered Bali Prawns, Chicken Ayam Madu and Vegetable Satay. The mocktails on order were Transfusion and Virgin Mojito.
For main course: Chicken Mae Goreng (flat noodles), Vegetable Nasi Kampung (Rice), Chicken Rendang, Prawn Sambal and Veg. Sayur Lodeh Goreng.
For us each and every item was unique....we liked Prawn Sambal, Sayur Lodeh Goreng amongst the main course and the starters the most. The Prawn Sambal was very similar to our very own Chingri Malaikari but with a tangy twist. Vegetable Nasi Lampung was also a very tasty rice dish.
All in all a new and pleasant experience....Malaysian delicacies were new to us and we liked the flavours.
We all look forward to our return visit and try out some other oriental flavours.

Accompanied by a friend, I chanced upon Fung Shway while scrounging the streets of Gol Park, looking for a place to grab a bite before our movie started. At the outset, the restaurant has a very welcoming vibe and pleasant ambience - managing to be both upscale and cosy at the same time. The amount of items on menu are quite diverse, ranging from Chinese to Japanese, among others. Since we were short on cash (and time) we could not gorge to heart's content but were quite impressed by the Chilli Honey Potato (photo provided below) that we did have. Not only was the dish a sight for sore eyes, the flavour was rich and the texture was lip smackingly delectable. We also had a glass of Old Monk and the only reason we did not enjoy it as much as we should, was due to my asking for the drink to be diluted with water instead of Coke/Pepsi - an error that I was repeatedly chided for by my friend. The staff did not leave any stone unturned and did their very best to ensure that we were being attended to properly; their hospitality was particularly commendable. On the downside, however, the price is a little exorbitant, especially for college going students like myself. Fung Shway is more suitable for a family dinner/getogether/office friends meet. My overall experience was a, more or less, satisfactory one and I'd recommend this eatery to anyone who does not want to compromise on the taste and ambience, even if it means loosening their purse strings a little.

To start with, very well located accompanied with valet adjacent to Crave Foodworks, guess this area is coming up with lot of nice restaurants. 

The entrance is an array of staircase well lit that invites you well and greets you with a bar at the mezzanine. The place is well lit and subtle. At the first site, the menu is expansive and details Chinese Thai Malaysian and Japanese comprehensively. 

The flavours are rich and since cooked well, the meal feels complete and wholesome. Completely satisfied. Gonna try Japanese and Malaysian in my next visit.

Do try : TomYum soup(lemon grass lingers on) / Stir Fried Asparagus / vegatables in Hot Garlic / Papaya Salad.

Take 2 : 
Do try the Avocado Maki (Sushi). Splendid stuff!!!
I had it along with a Malaysian Clear Soup and they complemented each other well.

We called for the Stir fried Aspragus again this time, simply superb!!!

It is Easter Sunday and we wanted to go some place special yet with great food . I had been reading about new restaurants in the T2 and was interested in this place .
We were here sharp at 12 as it opens up in the afternoon. The place is on the first floor and the setting is marvellous. 
The cocktails and drinks are reasonably priced.  We did have a taste of different cocktails. The portions are also quite generous. 
Coming to the starters , we had a multitude of options as there's Oriental  , Thai  , Malaysian and Japanese. 
We started off with the Japanese Magura  ( tuna ) and Ika ( Ika ) and some delicious lamb chops ( Ayam Madu )
For main course we had Nasi Kampung which was Malaysian fried rice with lamb and spices ...It was heavenly and easily serves three people. We had this along with Squid sizzlers , which was a very satisfying dish. We had also ordered Thai red curry Chicken  , but were so stuffed that we got it packed .
We couldn't do justice to the sweet desserts but there is a great choice .
Really good , courteous staff and quick service. 
Great place to visit over and over again.

Went on a date evening with my wife after seeing wonderful reviews on Zomato. Was amazed with the variety in the menu. Ordered for Soto Ayam Soup, Kambing Mamak Soup, Fish Teppanyaki and Dampa Prawns.

Item: Soto Ayam Soup. 

Description in menu: "Thin chicken soup with potato dumplings with chilly". 

Experience: Sadly the soup served was a thick chicken soup with lemongrass with no potato dumplings at all. Upon complaining, the soup was changed and we got fresh bowls and shockingly the soup was the same, thick with no potato dumplings but this time addition of chicken balls. Disappointing!

Item: Kambing Mamak.

Description in menu: "Thick spicy minced lamb soup."

Experience: Soup served was thin as water, not spicy at all and chopped mutton. The soup seemed to be mutton stock with no flavor at all. Another disappointing dish.

Item: Fish Teppanyaki Punzo Mustard Sauce

Description: Hot and Acrid

Experience: Sauteed sliced fish with pok choy. It wasnt hot but had a pinch of spice. This tasted different in a good way. Finally something to like and admire about.

Item: Dampa Prawns

Description: "Prawns grilled with beer, pepper, tamaring and hot chilli garlic"

Experience: In one word, Devastating!! Deep fried prawns in Chinese based thick gravy. Nothing else to say about it.. Total Disaster!!

Overall Experience and Recommendation: I guess the restaurant is opened to cheat people saying they serve Oriental, Thai, Malaysian and Japanese while the truth is they just don't know what they are serving. It is best to stay away from a place like this where they think cheating their guests is justified.

Candle lit dinner was their highlight and a complimentary drink..just for the V-day.
Relatively new in the block, the staff will welcome you warmly right from the entrance. The decor and the ambiance is outstanding and the staffs were something to boast about, attentive, well behaved, and very very polite and helpful. We were confused, so on our attendant's suggestion we ordered a lemon coriander soup, which tasted heavenly followed by chicken satay,which was equally good. Even the complimentary drink was superb. We could have a complete meal due to timeconstraint, but surely would like to recommend others. A bit costly but totally worth it

This is one of those newly opened luxury restaurants at Southern Avenue. Went to this place on Valentine's Day. There is a nice spread of food items available on the menu encompassing Japanese, Malaysian Chinese and Thai cuisines. My favorite is Chicken Satay.
Speaking about the ambience it is very beautifully decorated in South East Asian style.
This place is quite expensive and is surely going to burn a deep hole in your pocket.

Our first meal at Fung Shway was brilliant. The Malaysian menu looked the most enticing, so we ordered from it. We tried:

Memanggang Babi - A BBQ pork appetizer. Plenty of delicious fat and the sauce was fantastic. The only thing that would have made it better would be if the meat of the pork was slightly juicier. But the fat made up for it.

Rendang Lamb - Rich curry with lots of sauce. The lamb was very good - not too bland or too chewy. Large serving.

Sayur Lodeh Goreng - We ordered this veggie stirfry to balance out the meal. It's hard to get a good stirfry in Kolkata that is not soaked in goo. This one was perfect and had an excellent selection of veggies, and a wonderful sambal sauce.

Mee Goreng with chicken - This noodle dish had a nice light peanutty flavor, which helped balance out the meal. Not greasy at all.

Palm Sugar Lemon Grass Ice Cream - The ice cream was fantastic, and definitely tasted homemade. I was not 100% keen on the palm sugar chunks. They were a little too sugary and not palmy enough. But it was still a wonderful dessert.

Steamed Rice - decent quality.

The serving sizes were generous, so the 4 of us were well fed. I really appreciated that we could order in such a way to get a balanced meal. That's impossible at a typical Kolkata Chinese restaurant, where all of the dishes are oily and heavy.

The service was impeccable, and the decor is very classy. If you're lucky you can have a table overlooking the green of southern avenue.

The prices are very reasonable for this level of quality. No complaint. It's very rare to find such authentic flavors in Kolkata at any price point. I hope they can maintain this level of quality, and I'm looking forward to another visit!

We are foodies and usually look out for new joints. so dropped by to try their food. Had Tom Yum Soup, Thai whole fish, Pad Thai and Thai curry. Loved everything else except the fish. The flavor was nice but it did have a smell around the head. The staff were very cordial and did take our suggestions in good spirit. Nice ambience. A little steep on the price.

I'm not wanting to sound like a Master Chef judge, but, there's a burst of flavour when you take your first bite of anything on their menu.¬†

Finally, Kolkata has a winner!

As you step in, you're greatly welcomed with pleasing staff and wonderful decor. The staff make sure you're well seated and cared for! Rich, aromatic Chinese tea a long with Kimchi is the served as Complimentary. The food was great and the staff was good. However, I found that the asparagus, was not of a very good quality. Hence, I wouldn't recommend you any asparagus dishes but I would highly recommend you to try the Thai curry. I would definitely visit again!

Yesterday we 3 went to explore a new restaurant. It was a good restaurant for family and friends. The ambience and decoration is very good. Service is good. We ordered Tum Yum soup- it was tasty, but there was a spice which causes us a tingling sense in throat. Then we had Smoked chilly orange(Chicken) - it was tasty, little sweet because of orange, Saffron noodles(mixed)- taste is very good(spicy and hot) but the ingredients are not sufficient as per rate. quantity is standard. Nasi Kampung is a Malaysian fried rice with musterd seed and curry leave, taste is like our south Indian fried rice... very tasty. the most amazing is Ikam Bakar Dangon Air Assam.. Vetki fish (paturi style) wrapped with banana leaves with a fantastic taste of tamarind, lemon grass, chilli flakes. We are satisfied, but the rate of food is little high, we spend 4300/- for 3. The lemon grass tea is served continuously as free of cost. Overall the food-ambience-service-quantity is good.

Perhaps many of you can still remember the restaurant called China Bowl in Southern Avenue. With time, the name of the road got changed and China Bowl transformed it into the newest oriental cuisine restaurant of the city.
If you are going eastbound, the restaurant is on the very next block after Vivekananda park. Limited number of parking spots are available on the road. So parking could be an issue during the busy hours.
The welcome desk was on the ground floor and the main restaurant was on the first floor with a cozy little bar area on the mezzanine. You can take the stairs up or if you don‚Äôt want to shed your hard earned calories then you can take the elevator too. Yes, you read right, they have an elevator to take you to the first floor!
The sitting area of the restaurant was small compared to its class. The decor was contemporary and showcased the elegant taste of the owner. The sofas were cozy, there were big mirrors on
the wall which gave an illusion of a bigger space. The lighting was smooth with Bose speakers playing calm background music. The staffs were courteous and service was very prompt. Used plates, cutleries were replaced immediately after use and the glasses were filled up with water as soon as we took a sip or two.
When I the visited the restaurant, they didn‚Äôt start their full menu. The menu card had three sections for Chinese, Japanese and Malaysian cuisine. Most of the dishes were quite costly compared to the size of the restaurant. We ordered a bowl of Chicken Tum-yum soup (Rs: 375), Ikan Bakar Dengan Air Assam (its the name of one dish, Rs: 495), Sambal Chicken (Rs: 450) and Nasi Kampung (Rs: 375). The first one was from the Chinese section and the other three were from the Malaysian section of the menu. The amount of food was good for 2 persons. Total bill was Rs: 1941 without
any drinks, including the VAT but excluding the service tax (yes, they didn‚Äôt charge the service tax, not sure why).
The soup tasted quite ordinary and you can get the same or better in Tangra for one third of the price. Nasi Kampung was a Malaysian spicy fried rice. It was good; the combined aroma of mustard seeds and curry leaves would remind you of Andhra style cooking. Sambal chicken was tasty and quite hot. I would not recommended that dish if you can‚Äôt take too much of spices.
The last but not the least, the "Ikan Bakar Dengan Air Assam" deserves a special mention. It was pieces of white Kolkata bhetki marinated in a spicy tamarind sauce overnight, wrapped in
banana leaves and grilled to perfection. This dish was like a perfume with three very distinct variation in the aroma. The moment it came to our table we got the top notes of the fish sauce.The middle note of tamarind and lemon-grass kicked in when we opened the banana leaf and took the first bite in the creamy white piece of the fish. As the middle note¬†departed, the base note of spicy red chili lifted us into the gastronomic heaven created by the Chef. It was truly a piece of magic. I will go back to Fung Shway for this magic again and¬†¬†again.

I have known Fung Shway from its Dover Lane days, and it‚Äôs so great to see the restaurant ‚Äì a true Calcutta institution ‚Äì reopened its doors again. I happened to visit this Southern Avenue joint a few weeks ago for dinner and was impressed with the menu offerings. The chicken satay and Balinese prawns accompanied by a range of authentic sauces were, in my opinion, the signature dishes here. The stir fry noodles and a fish dish (whose name I can‚Äôt recall) were equally great. Dilip Massey combines familiar flavours with his culinary ingenuity, to give us an inspired Asian fusion like none other. I had a great evening and look forward to returning soon. Good luck to your venture.

Chef and co-owner¬†Dilip Massey's personal interaction with the guests made our visit even more special. The food was excellent and very well worth the price.

A well-decked up ambience in a prime location & a courteous staff, backed by a displaced chef to sum up our visit.
Food is below ordinary. Limited starters, tastes which are not commensurate with the description or illustrations. Blame the dip in oil prices, everything is deep fried.
Balinese prawns had a wafer thin filling with coatings of batter. Chicken in teriyaki sauce was immersed in a pool of diluted soya sauce. Starry fried rice was only a semblance of a clear night sky but no hint of star anise.
The fish preparations seemed stale and what the staff claimed to be bhetki, was only a pale bhetki wanna-be. The experience was exacberated by "inadvertently" billing me for a dish we had sent back. That was eventually rectified.

Looking for Thai, Japanese, Maly food this the place to be at because it's never tasted soo good Kolkata. This is a great addition to the food scene in Kolkata. Great ambiance, good service and really great food. If I had three thumbs I'd give it a 3 thumbs up. They have a bunch of unique dishes that you just have to experience ( Lassa soup, black noodles and don't think twice about having the bento ice cream it's that good). Prices match quality and if you're looking for an even richer experience make sure you talk to Dilip(one of the owners and master chef trainer) he adds a lot to the your experience there.
