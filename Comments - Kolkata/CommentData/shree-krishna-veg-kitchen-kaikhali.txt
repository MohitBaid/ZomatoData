Situated in VIP kaikhali, very good place to enjoy with friends. Have been there twice and had enjoyed the food. Can visit in future if will be there.

Just off the VIP Road, on the Kaikhali Crossing, this outlet of sweets and snacks is located. It is a small snack shop which sells sweets too. Though the entry of the eatery is not much appealing but the quality of the jalebies are.
At mornings, you can have puri subzi and around evenings you get to eat tasty singhara, kachori as well as mouth watering jalebis.
I generally like to have jalebis, occasionally followed by singhara.
Both singhara and jalebi tastes really good and it makes up my evening whenever I opt for it. It doesn't have an adequate seating arrangement and thus, I prefer takeaway.
