When Mom decides to have a birthday celebration after so many years it definitely calls for a special birthday cake! Planning the party at the umpteenth hour, armed with zomato I went cake hunting on the day of the party itself. Bored with the same old cakes from those same old cake shops, my numb taste buds were screaming for a change and to my rescue came Chocodiction. Of the huge options I was to choose from (a hard decision none the less, cause all the cake were equally tempting) I settled for the Chocolate mirror glaze cake.

And my battle was half won, when my mom absolutely loved the way the cake looked and was really eager to taste it!

Needless to say it tasted awesome for a cake that was so great to look at had to taste amazing!!

Thank you Chocodiction for bringing the child out in my mom, again!
