Perhaps just the place our city needed.
The soon to be godfather of the Kolkata nightlife landscape, RBK is the place to be!! 
From the decor to the service to the food and beverages, it is top notch in every department. Visit here, and take it from me that you won’t be disappointed

Have you been to The great booze story?? Don’t think of visiting again, coz it is now riki’s bar and kitchen.

Ambience: Themed with inspiration from the Godfather movie series, the ambience is simply classic. Music played was good.

Food: We ordered cocktails, veg pizza, tandoori platter(veg and non veg) and wine. I feel you can easily avoid ordering pizza since it did not appealed to my taste buds, to add to it the crust was hard like biscuit, the platter was great, both veg and non veg.

Hospitality: This is one area that really seemed to be great. All staffs were awesome, 5 stars for the hospitality.
