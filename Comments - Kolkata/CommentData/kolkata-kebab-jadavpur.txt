Went there today with my friend and wasn't disappointed at all. Situated in the by-lanes of Jadavpur, this place is a gem if you want good kebabs but don't want to burn a hole in your pocket. It's a small shop although.
We had seekh kebab today. Four big pieces of kebabs just for 86rs, served with onion rings and a green chutney (pudina chutney probably). Totally worth having it! And that chutney! Boy oh boy! They should bottle that chutney and sell those!

Now coming to the glitch which was definitely the ambience. They place is very small itself, has a few stools and two slabs where you can keep the box of kebabs. The adjacent kitchen didn't have a door. Now they kept switching on and off the chimney, which also makes a very harsh unpleasant noise, during the cook. As a result the room got a little Smokey making us shed a few tears. Later they switched on the a.c. and chimney both so the air was clean again.

Overall a nice experience and would recommend this place and an absolute thumbs up if you wanna order a home delivery!!!

The finest kebab destination in the Jadavpur area for sure. The peri peri kebabs and sheekh kebab are amazingly well prepared and tastes great. But the management must seriously look to the space constraint. The space is so narrow that any unforeseen occurrence cannot be avoided. Please make it a take away only until you find a spacious outlet in the area.

A frequent customer of "kolkata kebab".. Do mostly order by swiggy but did have had some snacks at their Jadavpur joint. I do love a good food and more if they come in without pinching my pocket too much 😂... But kebabs that less expensive and that quality is pretty rare to find.. So a "tinsy little" pinch in our pocket is a good thing with them 😂... Pretty much have had all the type of kebabs orders through them.. But peri peri kebab is my personal favourite and had two types of wrap one being reshmi kebab and the other seekh kebab.. Bothe were pretty exotic and mouth savouring to me... A quick sneak peak every now and then with them will surely make anyone's day 😊.. Thank you and keep serving some garib hanglas like us these great delicious food.. Kebabs 🍻 to you too! 😂

We ordered via Swiggy and tried the following things in two days:
☆Anda Nawabi kebab:
This is an innovation and an impressive one too. I feel one should definitely try this once if you're a egg lover.
☆Chicken Chatpata kebab:
This was chatpata really.
☆Chicken Reshmi kebab:
This was a little dry for my liking.
☆Chicken Sheekh kebab:
I am not a fan of sheekh, but preparation wise it was really good.
☆Chicken Peri Peri kebab:
The Chicken pieces are succulent and the peri peri spices stand out.
☆Chicken Tikka burger:
This burger has a good tikka filling but it needs more mayo and more filling.
I'm being partial and giving this place some brownie points for the drop dead cheap rates of freshly prepared kebabs.
They also send their delivery in nice packaging.

The food quality is average. This is not a resturant. Rather it could be said as a kabab parlour. The taste of kabab is nice but the size of every piece is too small. The space of the place is also too small.I am not satisfied.

The kebabs were very good, the biriyani average and the absence of any other entrees from the menu a disappointment.  Surely mughlai chicken and mutton entrees need to be offered.

I ordered one Sultan platter. It contained two seekh, two peri kebabs and a chicken tikka burger. The deal was good. Food quality was good and fresh. It tasted good. They could have not used the sweet mayonnaise in the burger which suppressed the taste of the tikka. Could have used a salted and mint flavoured mayonnaise...

Chicken chatpata kebabs- these are chicken wings and has a chatpata flavours.... A good go

An upcoming den of tasty and delicious kebabs available at an affordable price. Situated in jadavpur 8b on the alley beside lokenath bookstores this is a heaven for kebab lovers like me. A wide variety of delicious spicy kebabs are at your disposal here. I had their nawabi kebab platter which is a combination of 4 different kebabs 2 pieces each. Seekh kebab, reshmi kebab, masaladar kebab and periperi kebab. All of them were exotic in taste but periperi deserves special mention. This spicy kebab will take away your breath. It's just 210 INR for this platter. An individual dish of 4 pieces of periperi kebab comes at a price of 86 INR. Overall, value for money.

Located in Ibrahimpur Road beside Lokenath stores. Take the first left turn, the lane just to the right of Bawarchi (facing it), if you are coming from 8b. As soon as you enter the lane you can see it.
The first time I went, I had ordered Murgh Tikia Burger.  It's okay for it's price. The filling had mashed chicken with onion and little bit mayo. It would have been better if the quantity of chicken was more. It's moderately filling. Otherwise it is soft and tasty. 
The next time I went, I had tried chicken chatpata kebab. I loved it. There were 5 pieces. It was not very spicy just the way you would like it to be. It was served with pudina chutney. It can serve as a good evening snack. Never have I found kebabs available in such cheap prices.
The place is too small and so it literally pains your eyes with the AC on. There are hardly 6 seats and 2 very small tables. Opting for a takeaway would be convenient if you come in a large group.  Service is quick. No tax charged.
Would visit this place again definitely to try the roomali wraps (hopefully, because they are available only after 5:30 pm).

Another newly opened tiny eatery in Jadavpur. This one is located in the lane beside Bazeegar. They serve some well known kebabs like Chicken Reshmi kebab, Tangri kebab, etc and also some lesser known kebabs like Chicken Peri Peri kebab, Anda Nawabi kebab, etc. but all at very pocket friendly prices. I have tried their Chicken Chatpata kebab and the Anda Nawabi kebab. The Chatpata kebab was really delicious but there was nothing really "chatpata" about it. It's not really filling though. Can serve as a great evening snack. I did not however like their Anda Nawabi kebab much. The taste of the egg white was mostly dominant in it and there was almost no taste of the yolk. Not recommended.                                   Not much to say about the ambience. If you are in a large group, then it's best to opt for a takeaway as the place is really tiny and gets crowded easily. Service is decent. P.S- The roomali wraps are available post 5.30 p.m only.

All other kebab items were finished when I went there, so I ordered Chicken peri peri kebab and chicken sheekh kebab! The first one was really tasty, with succulent pieces of chicken, the second one was alright, both came with a tasy sour dip! really wanna visit this place again and try their other items!

Bought chicken chatpatta kebab it cost 59/- for 5 pieces. It was packed nicely with pudina chutney and salad( mainly onion). Tasted pretty well and did had a smell of actual kebab. Pudina chutney could have been better as it had too much of curd.
Overall this can be a nice place for evening snack at very minimum expense.

30/12/2017:- well i tried chicken chatpatta kebab again. Though packing has become fancier but quality has dropped a bit. The chicken pieces were small and had too much masala in it making it very spicy. Pudina chutney quality has also been reduced. So, certainly there is a dip in performance.

For an eatery which has the word Kebab in its name one would think that they at least would be competent enough to make the kebabs flawlessly. Well, if one expects this, they are in for a huge shock. The pieces of chicken were very chewy and felt like not cooked properly. I had ordered Murgh Peri Peri Kabab, Murgh Reshmi Kabab, Kolkata Murgh Biryani and Kolkata Gosht Biryani via a food delivery app. Quite frankly just saying that this was the worst biryani ever would be sugar coating it immensely. The rice was so overcooked that it basically was a mound of rice potato meat and egg. Before this I have never posted any review for any eatery but the vile quality of the food here has compelled me to do so. 
Never again I will be making the mistake of ordering from here again.
Had to give a minimum rating of one. But it deserves even less. Maybe in the negative.

Newly opened Kolkata Kebab outlet near 8b bus stand.

Small place with 4-5 sitting arrangements. Mainly a takeaway food joint.

Attendant is very responsive and sober.
Prompt service.

One shouldn't miss out the kebabs from this particular place...Very much pocket friendly place.

Kebabs, Nolen Gurer Icecream tastes awesome.

They newly added both chicken and mutton Biryani in their menu. Not very rich in tastes... Light and good.

This place is highly recommended.

Visited this place after rave reviews in Zomato. But am sorry to say that this was a bad experience. We ordered Murg Peri Peri kebab, Murg Lehsun Kebab and Murg Chatpata Kabab. These were very dry and tasteless. Everything was horrible. Even the sauce which was provided smelt spoilt. I don't know if this was due to the puja rush, but i must say, i was thoroughly disappointed. Not quite sure if i want to give this a second try.

My first experience of kolkata kebabs was from the Kolkata food festival held at nalban park in February 2017 where we tried some delicious kebabs at pocket friendly prices. So upon seeing the outlet in my swiggy delivery range area, i could not resist myself from ordering their food.

In the mood for some mughlai cuisine, i decided to order the following:-

1. Chicken reshmi kebabs - 4 pcs of traditional reshmi kebabs at only Rs 86 was a no brainer for me since i'm a big fan of reshmi kebabs. The pieces were standard & were cooked to perfection. The meat was soft & wasn't too charred. However i found them to be a tad dry but the taste compensated for it totally.

2. Chicken lehsuni kebab - 4 generous chicken wing pieces coated in garlic paste with oozing juices totally made my mouth water. The lehsuni kebabs were a treat to my tastebuds. The strong hint of garlic made me crave for more kebabs.

3. Chicken biryani - The quantity was very generous with the price charged. The biryani had 1 chicken,1 egg & 1 potato. The rice used was of higher quality & the biryani is totally kolkata style in terms of flavours.

4. Nolen Gur ice cream - This stole the show for me. Nolen gur is an absolute favourite of bengalis when it comes to sweet dishes. Nolen gur ice cream variety is being sold by major ice cream parlours around the city but do try theirs as well since it would surely leave you wanting for more. The nolen gur flavour was felt by me in every spoonful of it. The quality of ice cream was also great.

All these items cost me about Rs 385 which is very reasonable. They don't charge any GST on deliveries. Try them out during the puja to savour your food desires.

P.s.they dont even charge taxes.

This is the new addition to the multitude of eateries we have here in Jadavpur. The best part is that they serve real good kebabs in damn cheap prices. Its not been a month since it opened its shutters for the ever-hungry crowd( mostly college-goers like us) and I had visited this small takeaway outlet a number of times already. Easy to locate, its on your right if u enter the lane just behind 8B Bus stand. They serve a host of kebab dishes, even platter and also a Chicken Burger which is delicious and filling at the same time. Now, what I found really interesting is what they did with egg -- they came up with a dish called Anda Kebab! With the white part used as the outer coating as in an egg,(duh!) the inner part of these soft succulent kebabs are made of the yolk and a few other things.The chutney served along with the dishes just fits in perfectly. They are planning to introduce Biryani as well as I have been informed by the person at the counter. More to aggravate the fantasies of the taste buds for sure. Don't miss out on this place if you care for kebabs, or above all, good food!

This is a newly opened small kebab junction in Jadavpur.
Today I went here to try their kebab.
Prices are so reasonable and food quality is good.

We had Murgh lasuni keba.4 pieces of chicken, succulent and perfectly smoked for just 100 bucks is absolutely worth it!
Also had a mini combo of baby butter naan and chicken butter masala.
Quantity is sufficient for two.
Naans were a bit chewy but then chicken will win your heart.
Also,my boyfriend packed peri peri kebab for home and he says it tastes great too.
Will surely visit this place again. 😊

Terrible kabab. This is the worst kabab i have ever tried. I stopped by today for takeaway of reshmi and periperi kabab. The periperi smells like the marination was about to get rotten. And also the pieces were half done. If you are running with kebab speciality you can't have your main item like this. Definitely money-back quality

South kolkata now got an outlet of this famous restaurant in North Kolkata. This is a take away joint and we ordered through swiggy. We had chicken reshmi kebab, chicken periperi kebab, murgh chatpata kebab and Tangdi kebab. The first two dishes contained 4pieces each. The reshmi kebab was a bit overcooked so the juicy soft nature of reshmi was missing. The periperi kebab was the best of all. Very tender juicy pieces of chicken well marinated and the flavour was also good. There were few pieces of tandoor pienapple which gave it a sweet and sour taste. The chatpata kebabs were made of chicken wings and the Tangdi kebab was also okayish type. The main trp is the price-very much pocket friendly. If they improve the taste a bit then they will surely rule this area.
