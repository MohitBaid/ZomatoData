***Update 18th March 2016***
Went nearby the shop for my doc's appointment. Visited at around 1:30pm.
Brought Malpoa and Pantua.
8/10 scores to both of the sweets. It was fresh, soft and tender. Malpoa was not as fried as my last update says. Pantua was delicious.

***UPDATE 4th NOV, 2015***
I live in Kasba and thus, this shop isn't so far away from my house. Well behaved staff and a spacious shop, doesn't get crowded much bit serves good quality and unsold stale ones as well. So, do try a taste sample before buying.

Malpoa(6.5/10): Tastes good but, its too much fried, brown in color and the outer covering is hard and crispy, some parts taste bitter. Its Malbhaja :P.

Chitrakoot(8/10): Was served fresh. Tender and sweet. It tasted wonderful.

Kachagolla(8/10): Beautiful from the outside,soft and juicy inside. A wonderful sweet served,you would need a spoon. Make sure to get the taste sample as its a milk product and can go stale .

Sugarfree Sandesh(5.5/10): You.need to be lucky to get the fresh ones. If you do, they taste wonderful else Good Luck.

Shor Bhaja(8/10): Worth writing a review for. Red, tender and juicy, palatable item.

Pantua(7/10): It tastes good too but they don't serve it with the Juice/rosh.

**Older Review***
Had been to this shop many a times and I am a daily commuter in Kasba. The sweets here are commendable and the varieties they have creates difficulties in choosing the ones you really want to have. Service is slow and this shop though being good at quality, remains empty most of the time, but its quite spacious. Well behaved staff but their hearing lags.They had an Orange mango sweet, which smelt like Mango but tasted like Elaichi. The sugar free 'Sandesh' were twice served rotten. They continue to serve the old sweets days after days, unless it sells out or maybe until its noticeable. Many sweets are dried to cracks accompanied by ants having their buffet. Whenever you visit the shop choose your options carefully, and if possible taste the ones you have as options, the  prices are comparatively reasonable, so the price of the 'TASTE SAMPLE' should not poke you.If you choose the right sweets, you won't be disappointed. Still, I would suggest you to try Lengcha, the yellow rasgulla or 'KOMOLA BHOG'....Refrain from the Laddoos.

DIFFERENT PERSON HAVE DIFFERENT LUCK,  TASTE AND OPINIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROTTEN SWEETS UNSOLD FOR 3 DAYS IS REPLACED, AND YOU GET THE FRESH ONES ON THE 4th  DAY. DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING UP TO A CONCLUSION.

Hailing from central kolkata , i do not find "mishti" at south kolkata enticing enough. This sweet shop does not live upto its name. Their original branch is not the bhawanipore one. The sweets seems overpriced compared to the taste. I had a bad experience with their "kora paker sandesh". But Mishti doi is very good here, rosogollas and also the kheerer mishtis and they do have a updated variety of sweets.

This is a quite new sweet shop in our neighbourhood. But their sweets are too very good. Rosogolla, kachagolla, aam sandesh, laddo, sitsbhog and every sweet I tasted there is very nice.

This is not just a neighborhood sweet shop. The varities available here is not at all available in other sweet shops in this part of the city. My favourite have been the lengcha which is almost an obsolete sweet now. Rest all are of very good quality and the sweets here are always fresh.
