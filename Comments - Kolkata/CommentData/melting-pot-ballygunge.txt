Melting pot is a warm and hospitable addition to the growing numbers of restaurants in Kolkata. Situated in Ballygunge, this cozy 36 seater is a winner. The decor, food, service are top notch. The hazelnut coffee, pan fried noodles are very good. I was left disappointed by the mushrooms however. The service was fast, and the pricing was reasonable as well. A 4 course meal would cost about 500/head.

I went to Melting Pot Restaurant & Cafe to celebrate New Year’s Eve with my family. It is one of the new eateries in Kolkata and a very cute one! It has a cosy atmosphere and is perfect for a family lunch or dinner or spending some time with old buddies, listening to classic instrumentals and chatting at your heart’s content!

This time my trip to Kolkata was quite different, thanks First Idea PR. Though I have reviewed quite a few places individually, this was my first Bloggers Meet in Kolkata. When Susmita, invited me and shared the brand profile, I was a little uncertain as it appeared to me it was no different from other similar places around the city. However, when she said this place was run by Srabani, I was excited to know her story to take up this challenge. Read my special feature on Women Entrepreneurs around the country.
                                                                ...

Melting Pot, situated in ballygunge place is one of the recent attractions of the foodies across the city. In Zomato's language the Look and Feel of this place will definitely seek your attention. Their food was good but was extremely disappointed with their quantity. Moreover, the lad who served us mentioned that we could order one plate of rice or noodles for two people. But that is definitely not the case. One plate is just enough for one person. So for those people visiting Melting Pot, make it sure that you order the number of plates of your favourite dishes keeping the quantity in mind. The rating is the reflection of both quantity and quality, it definitely deserves a bit more solely for its food. Mentioning about the food: Green Garlic Fish and Cantonese Noodles are highly recommendable, and would love to visit the place again only for these two dishes.

This pretty Cafe is located near chowman ballygunge which serves delicious Chinese and continental delicacies. The place is very uniquely decorated with yellow lights besides each table adding candle light dinner charm, quirky walls with nice message , ideal to visit with friends and family. So we ordered 

KOREAN CHICKEN STICK - This was an excellent dish with a very nice presentation. It was the Chinese version of seekh kabab , small diced chicken pieces dipped in chilli soya sauce was put into a stick with bell peppers, onions etc. This was our favourite part of the meal. 

CHILLI GARLIC FRIED RICE ( CHICKEN ) - With the right balance of spices this dish was finger licking good. The rice was very aromatic and tasted great with the side dish. 

SLICED LAMB CHILLI OYSTER SAUCE - Never had a better lamb preparation frankly. This was a basically shredded lamb dish in a thick gravy . 

They serve authentic Chinese within affordable range and friendly stuff. Do visit. :)

Trust me, this place is a hidden gem, hidden in the narrow bylanes of Ballygunge. It is near Weavers' Studio close to South Point High School. It is so easy to miss because it's not so customer-attracting from the outside, but once you have enterred, Melting Pot will leave tou asking for more.
The Continental menu is the best here, that too at an affordable pocket pinch. We had:
A soup,
A fresh lime soda,
Chicken Mushroom Steak
And Chicken Lasagna Bologeness
The pocket pinch for two was Rs. 900 and we were satisfied with the quantity and quality of food.
The service is also prompt.
If you want to have good continental food without burning a hole in your pocket, this is your go-to place. It involves a bit of walking from the main road, but apart from that, it is all pros, no cons.
All in all, a delightful experience.

We were a group of 7 people who visited this place for a treat since all of us were pretty impressed by the positive reviews on Zomato and wanted to try it out for ourselves. It's a quaint little place with little decorations that add to its charm. Coming to the food and drinks now, we ordered,

For mocktails :
1. Lemon iced tea (4.5/5)- It's one of the better versions of the classic drink available nearly in any place that has a beverage menu.

2. Blended hazelnut coffee (4/5) - This came laced with caramel and is definitely worth a try.

3. Blended Irish coffee (3/5) - This tasted similar to the hazelnut coffee but was much sweeter in taste and was most definitely nowhere near authentic Irish Coffee. I'd recommend the Hazelnut coffee over this one any day.

4. Virgin Mojito (4/5) - Another classic which did not disappoint.

5. Kitkat shake (4/5) - A delicious shake with a beautiful presentation. This will be a recommended beverage.

5. Cinderella (2/5) - Okay, so I asked the server about their best mocktail which is not coffee based and he recommended this to me. He said it's a mixture of pineapple and orange juices with a choice of either litchi or strawberry syrup. I, being a lover of both pineapple and orange, decided to go with the strawberry counterpart and that was probably the worst decision of my life. This tastes like the tangy blend of cheap lozenges which are available in local trains and it was so bad that of the two we ordered, we left one as it was. This was our disaster of the night if I may say so.

For starters :
1. Crispy chilli mushroom (3.5/5) - This dish was recommended to us by the server and was pretty decent but not exceedingly delicious like we expected since it was a highly recommended dish from amongst the veg starters. It came with salad.

2. Stir fry shrimp with exotic veg chilly and basil (4/5)- Another recommended dish and was pretty good. It came with ample amount of shrimps( for the price) and veggies. It was also accompanied by raw salad.

3. Pattaya fish (4.5/5)- The best starter of the night according to me. It contained 8 Juicy, succulent pieces and was a definite game winner in the starters division for me.

4. Steamed Chicken wanton (3.5/5) - It contained 6 steamed wantons and the taste and quality was average. Not bad and not very good also. It was a prettt mediocre dish for me.

For mains :

1. Chicken lasagna bolognese (4.5/5) - This was a great dish and the only qualm I had with this is the fact that the quantity was a little too less for my liking and it ended sooner than I would have liked it to.

2. Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce (4/5) - Four very fat and tasty fish fillets served with boiled veggies and mashed potatoes. Highly recommended for the quantity and the taste in this price.

3. Chicken Stroganoff (4.5/5)- Again highly recommended and a better version of the dish. The quantity however is perfect for one person and cannot be eaten by two without anything else to accompany.

4. Chicken steak with mushroom pepper sauce (4/5)- Two tender and Juicy chicken steaks served with boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. Can be shared by two people and the taste is lovely too.

5. Chicken fried rice with Chilly chicken (4.5/5) - The safest option to order anywhere and Melting Pot did not disappoint either. Quantity was ample and quality decent. Can pretty much compete with any other well known Chinese joint.

For dessert :
1. Tutty fruity (3.5/5)- We ordered only one dessert as we were too full to order anything else. This was good but there are much better places to enjoy this dessert.

Our bill came at around 4000 which is pretty good for a full dinner of 7 people. Overall experience was pretty good and I'd definitely recommend people to try this new joint out.

Went there on 1st if January.The decoration inside has been kept very simple.They dont have a large area although but what is most talked about factor of this place is the food that they serve.I mean if you are looking for a resturant that serve good food at a reasonable price then you must visit this place.The staffs are helpful.
For food we ordered Fried gyozi dumplings,fried rice and tsing hoi chiken.The chicken preparation was different in taste.May be not preferable for the people(like me) who likes more of hot and spicy gravy.Anyway surely visiting again to enjoy some more items.

I have seen reviews on Zomato about this place and my expectations were sky-high. I visited this place on December 27th. The neighbourhood is peaceful and Melting Pot is such a cute little place. You open the door and you get the feeling that you are being transported to some other place. 
I will the covering the food , ambience and the service respectively. 
We ordered Blended Hazelnut Coffee, Chicken Shawarma Salad, Chicken Suimai and Chicken Gyoza Dumplings. 
Blended Hazelnut Coffee: I came here with my ❤ and she is addicted to coffee. We ordered it and Holy Moly it was heavenly. The distinct taste of hazelnut lingered on and it was smooth.
Chicken Shawarma Salad: Let me clear that we were not fans of raw veggies and this was a daring thing to do on our behalf. But we went ahead and ordered it and did not regret it. The salad was peppered with generous chunks of chicken the veggies were fresh and crunchy. Won't hesitate to try it out another day.
Chicken Suimai and Chicken Gyoza Dumplings: This place serves the best dimsums in town. Write it down. They blew us away with their presentation. And the dumplings melted in our mouth. Actually, we tested out restraint on ourselves and did not order more. I wish i could give a rating more than 5.0.

Now, coming to the AMBIENCE.
Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is one of my favourite films. And I know that I can't get into Paris wherever I want. But, this place transported me to another place, literally. Minimal decoration with elegance. The counter is picturesque. You get these sorts of places in films. But we have one in Calcutta. The decoration and lighting are pretty. Not very dimly lit. Not very brightly lit either. Just perfect for a quality time with your food and your loved ones. This place welcomes you with open arms. 

SERVICE: As mentioned earlier, we were allotted a table for two. But they happily obliged when we requested for a bigger table. A four-seater. The staff were cheerful and amicable.  

I had a great time dining here. Will definitely come back. Promise. And those who are reading it, make sure you visit this place. Your loss, not mine.  😄😄

Ballygunge place is a pretty sober neighborhood if you ask me. The place has quiet a number of popular restaurants which has been ruling the hearts of Calcuttans sine their begining. Joining this scenario is The Melting pot, a newly found cafe/restaurant with minimalist decor, warm ambiance and cracking food.The 36 seater restaurant although having a prime location is quiet reasonably priced at INR 600/- for two people.
Coming to the food now.  Here are a few highlights of the menu:
Cream of chicken soup- This is not the conventional creamy concoction we are used to . A slightly thinner version of it but pretty soothing to my taste.

Steamed chicken momos: Absolutely spot on! Served in a beautiful bamboo steamers these dumplings were cooked to perfection with thin skin and ample of filling.

Spaghetti Aglio e olio: Done quiet right but I figured a pinch of salt would not have done much harm to it although others might like it the way it was.

Burnt Garlic rice and Sliced chicken in Chili Oyster sauce: Perfectly matched for mains the chicken complemented the rice pretty well. The Oyster sauce was warm and light with well balanced flavors.

The mocktails: Now these are real treats both visually and for the taste-buds. The sweetheart which is a vanilla and oreo based mocktail with strawberry crush is an absolute killer. I literally could not stop spooning into it. Others include the brownie shake, Caramel crunchy coffee and the very refreshing Orange Mint Mojito.

Desserts: Toffee walnut and Tutti Frutti. I am more of a chocolate and toffee person but for the fruit lovers out there the tutti frutti is a treat.

When I walked into the restaurant, I confess that wasn’t expecting what I finally got. which made it an even more special experience. Melting Pot nicely brings Oriental delights and Continental Classics in one place, one will be spoilt for choices here. We often go to places that offer a wide variety of food but we are left with a very few choices as far as beverages are concerned, not here, I counted more than 25 entries on the beverage menu, not accounting for the 9 varieties of teas. That itself is a big plus for me. 

*A few must haves:-Steam Chicken Momos, Korean Chicken Skewers, Spaghetti Aglio e Olio(n/v), Burnt Garlic flavoured Mixed Fried Rice, Sliced Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce. For beverages and dessert: Sweetheart, Orange Mojito and toffee walnut. 

Melting Pot has friendly staff, prompt and cordial service, an amazing menu, good food, and most importantly, the effort that they are putting into making a mark for themselves shows up on your plate, shows up in their hospitality. All of this, at the price point that they are offering it at, I am sure that they have good times ahead of them. 
I'll surely be back again!!

Melting Pot is one of the newest eateries in town located in the quaint neighbourhood of Ballygunge. The location is quite fancy and convenient if you ask me. This place is very close to Weaver's Studio in Swinhoe Street. Stroll up casually during the eveings if you're around Ballygunge and just drop by at this place. It's warm and welcoming and definitely has a lot of options for you to try.

Run by Srabani, who is extremely welcoming greeted us as soon as we reached the restaurant. This 36 seater is nicely lit, has very basic yet pretty interiors and gives off a very homely vibe. We casually chatted up with the owner and found out that this restaurant was an ode to her love for oriental cuisine. It is truly an amalgamation of continental and oriental food and stands very true to it's name. Although you might feel that the place is small, it is pretty nice and airy and is really good for dates or even a bunch of friends.

Now, let's get to the food -

Appetizer : Cream of Chicken Soup

I feel that the soup was a little watery for my liking. Cream of chicken soup is suppose to be nice and creamy, and should give off a lovely fragrance. They even had a few croutons in there but the soup somehow missed the mark. Need a little more creaminess in there.

Starters : Korean Chicken Sticks and Chicken Steamed Momos

Both the starters were pretty amazing honestly. Loved the steamed momos. The skin on the momos were nice and thin and the momo was generously filled with chicken. The sauce gives a good spicy kick and that was amazing considering it is cold outside. On the other hand the Korean Chicken skewers are a delight. They are well seasoned, has a delectable taste and the salad that is on the side makes for an amazing pair. Do give these a try!

Mains : Spaghetti Aglio e Olio (n/v), Burnt Garlic Mixed fried rice and a side of Sliced Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce.

The spaghetti was good and light. Aglio e Olio is usually pretty light, fragrant and nice. Ours had chicken bits as well. I liked it. The burnt garlic mixed fried rice however was a little oily for my liking but I liked it nonetheless. The food here is cooked from the heart and it shows on the plate. Generous portions served hot on the table. The chicken in chill oyster sauce however is amazing. Very well seasoned, lovely broth and perfect cooked chicken. I totally recommend this one.

Beverages : Orange Mint Mojito, Caramel Crunchy Coffee, Brownie Shake, Sweetheart

All of their beverages are really good. My personal favourites were the Orange Mint Mojito which was so refreshing and Sweetheart which true to its name is a delight. Do not miss out this one. They serve the beverages in tall glasses so make yourself at home and sip on.

Desserts : Tutti Fruity, Toffee Walnut

Classic desserts to gorge on. Huge quantities so you might have a hard time to finish if you are all by yourself. Nice and sweet - although if you are worried about he calories, I would suggest going a little lighter. You can end your meal with their amazing hazel cappuccino - it is absolutely amazing.

Hospitality : I really like the hospitality here. So warm and welcoming. The servers are always ready for your feedback, they would also ask you once in a while if you are enjoying your meal. Just a place where they give a lot of importance to it's patrons.

The place isn't pricey and serve up amazing meal given the location and the competition around. Definitely drop down because the pot does serve up amazing varieties.

Price for two : INR 600/- plus taxes

This is a small cafe in ballygunge. I visited this place with 2 of my friends and my sister. It was almost empty when we entered. We ordered fish and chips, drums of heaven, Thai red chilli prawns, blended hazelnut coffee and brownie shake. All the dishes were nice and the two items that stood out are thai prawns and blended hazelnut coffee and I will definitely recommend these two items to anyone visiting this place. The decor is cute and simple. Prices are really affordable and hardly any tax is charged. The only let down was the behavior of the staff. They didn't show any interest and lacked politeness.

A small joint tucked in a quaint corner of ballygunge but definitely serves better version of dimsums,continental and chinese and comes in the list of one of the best.We ordered cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup and it tasted great.Perfect blend of everything.Soup came alongwith a plate of garlic bread which was a total surprise for us and no wonder it tasted great.The signature caramel crunch shake was awesome but the brownie shake was average,can be skipped.The shawarma grilled chicken salad with garlic yoghurt dip is an overrated and overpriced dish there and it is the only dish we regret ordering.The dimsums were soft,thin coated with a generous filling of chicken and served with sweet chilly sauce and chilly oil and I was bowled over this dish.It is called chicken gyoza dumplings ( pan fried).Very nice decor,friendly staff and mostly crowded at peak hours.

Um..knew about this place from Zomato
so why not start off the new year with something new?
For starter,we had pan fried chilly fish!
My verdict? Yum yum!
Main course comprised of sliced chicken in oyster sauce & chicken fried rice!
It was equally good.

So why 3.5 stars? um service was not good.

Great service and amazing food. Had cream of mushroom soup, which was a wonderful delight. Stir fried vegetables for starters and noodles with chilly paneer for main course. All were equally good. Quantity is on the lower side and so is the price. Hence, it gives you chance to try a few extra items which was otherwise not possible considering the appetite. Staff was very courteous as well.

Well this restaurant has been on my list for quite some time.Finally on this xmas i went there for lunch. The location is convenient and easily accesible.The beautiful decor coupled along with the soft soothing instrumental music is sure to elevate your mood and the ambience is appropriate enough to make you feel relaxed.The staff here is courteous and service is prompt enough so that your hunger pangs doent worsen furthur.The Food out here is unbelievable.Among starters i had The Fish n chips and Chicken steamed momos.Both of which i would count among must-have out here.I had the Chicken Penne Pasta with mixed sauce and Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce for main course.The pasta was perfect with good quantity of chicken and appropriate blend of sauces.The Grilled fish was another delight.Overall i was spellbound after having the food out here.To quench our thirst we had The Classical all time favourite Fresh Lime Soda and perhaps the signature out here The Melting Mocha.In a nutshell Melting pot is a place which deserves all the praises and Kudos to Team Melting pot for serving happiness on every plate.

Came here for the first time and the experience was astounding. We had crispy chilly babycorn, chicken fried rice, mein foon and many more. We tried devils for the first tym and it was very well. The beverages were damn invigorating. Albeit the ambiance was little bit clamorous but it was good. And last but not the least, the staff was well bred and their service was good as well. Had the best dinner today!

A small joint tucked in a quaint corner of ballygunge but definitely serves better version of dimsums,continental and chinese and comes in the list of one of the best.We ordered cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup and it tasted great.Perfect blend of everything.Soup came alongwith a plate of garlic bread which was a total surprise for us and no wonder it tasted great.The signature caramel crunch shake was awesome but the brownie shake was average,can be skipped.The shawarma grilled chicken salad with garlic yoghurt dip is an overrated and overpriced dish there and it is the only dish we regret ordering.The dimsums were soft,thin coated with a generous filling of chicken and served with sweet chilly sauce and chilly oil and I was bowled over this dish.It is called chicken gyoza dumplings ( pan fried).Very nice decor,friendly staff and mostly crowded at peak hours.

Um..knew about this place from Zomato
so why not start off the new year with something new?
For starter,we had pan fried chilly fish!
My verdict? Yum yum!
Main course comprised of sliced chicken in oyster sauce & chicken fried rice!
It was equally good.

So why 3.5 stars? um service was not good.

Great service and amazing food. Had cream of mushroom soup, which was a wonderful delight. Stir fried vegetables for starters and noodles with chilly paneer for main course. All were equally good. Quantity is on the lower side and so is the price. Hence, it gives you chance to try a few extra items which was otherwise not possible considering the appetite. Staff was very courteous as well.

The food is great. I must say it's great for a new restaurant with this amount of competition.
The chicken and all the pieces they served well melting in our mouths. 
Only compliant is = quantity 
It's not rough but not enough too.

This place seems like a cafe & chinese restaurant hybrid to me. The ambiance is like a cafe with nice decorations. But its suitable for family lunch or dinner as well. We ordered two cold coffees and a chicken salad. All the items came within 15mins. I was impressed with the quantity of cold coffee and it tasted good too. The chicken salad was also super fresh. Overall a good place to have a fulfilling meal.

We had fish and chips as starters. This is a must try once you visit this place. It's amazing. We had chicken Singaporean noodles and tsing hoi chicken as main course. They were also nice. The waiters were also very courteous.

❇Location- Take the Lane where the Ekdalia Durga pujo takes place. Turn left and walk till Tasty Corner. From there take a right turn. Walk for 3 mins and turn left. This small food joint will be on your left.

❇Ambience- The place is very nicely decorated with dim lights & the seating arrangements are comfortable.

❇Staff & Service- The staffs are informative & Cordial. They took almost 25 mins to serve the starter. A 4/5 for the service.

❇Food- We ordered 
               🔘BBQ Chicken wings
               🔘Khao Paad Chi (Thai Chicken rice)         
               🔘Tsing Hoi 
               🔘Brownie with Ice Cream

The Chicken wings were undercooked (only reason why 4.5 & NOT 5). The rice had an unique taste, loaded with corn, brocoli, mushroom & chicken (a must try). The chicken was super-yum. Small diced chicken in a sweet & sour gravy. The brownie was served Hot with two scoops of Vanilla Ice cream. 
Overall, the food was very good. A 4.5/5 for the food.


Moderately priced.
Surely, going back again. 😁✌

Great chinese and amazing value. Even on Xmas eve timely delivery and no compromise on quality. Th e fried rice is light and much better than the oily stuff most other places give. Sui Mai is excellent as is the thai chicken omelette which is really filled with chicken. Must try some of the other SE asian dishes. Quantities are very good and the prices are good. Ordering again tonight.

We were in Kolkata for a day and decided to visit this place mainly to eat crab meat. The food was not up to par. We ate Wolk toassed Prawns with Green and Garlic sauce as suggested, Crab meat Fried rice and Cantonese noodles.
The service and ambience of the place is great.The food didn't taste that good as described in reviews.
At last, the taste of food wasn't proportional to money I paid for it.

This newly opened food junction was in my bookmarks list since it's inception. We visited this food junction yesterday.

Location : One might find it a bit difficult to locate . A 10-15 minutes walk from gariahat via mandiville gardens will help to reach this place quickly.

Ambiance  :  The interior of this place is really cool and charming. A part of the wall is well decorated with photo frames. The presence of lamps over the tables also adds a additional charm. The staffs were @very friendly and he also described about the items which were unknown to us.  


Food  :  The items which we ordered are as follows:
1) Chilli garlic noodles(4/5).
2) Coriander Burnt Garlic rice(3.5/5).
3) Basil rice(3.5/5).
4) Green and garlic fish(4.5/5).
5) Shredded Chicken in hunan sauce(4/5).
6) Slice chicken served in chilly oyster sauce(4/5). 
7) Cantonese noodles (mixed)(5/5).
The food was really good in taste but we got highly dissatisfied with the quantity of food provided.
They also took a lot of time in preparing the foods too. The items which i liked most was the cantonese noodles and green garlic fish. One more thing they didn't even charged gst.
Looking forward to visit this place again but we will enjoy more if they increase the quantities provided by them.

An above average meal at a rare Asian restaurant (rare for me). The paneer satay with peanut sauce was really really good. Super soft paneer, a solid sauce, it was delicious. The main course that followed was just ok. Chilli garlic fried rice and veggies in oyster sauce. Not bad but definitely unmemorable. We asked for some of the leftovers to be packed for takeaway. They did a really shoddy job of it causing a lot of it to spill and get wasted, the opposite of what we wanted to do.

This is a little gem tucked away peacefully in the busy neighbourhood of Ballygunge. We were a group of 6 who went in for lunch and stayed till tea time coz everything in the menu is so refreshingly tasty. Nowadays you find a Chinese joint at every corner and most dishes taste the same - of dark soy and a medley of other sauces. We ended up ordering 8 starters and each had such distinguished taste, that's what impressed me the most about the melting pot. We had the Korean chicken skewers, fish chilli pan fried, Pattaya fish, dumplings- steamed and pan fried, calamari in peri peri sauce, nachos, garlic bread with cheese, a number of different mocktails and Thai curry. I struggle to fault any dish and have to say that the over all bill was much lesser than what I imagined it would be. My favourite was the fish Pattaya and calamari. The melting pot is a must visit!

This is a very good place to have Chinese food. I just love their dumplings and prawn starter. Not very much expensive its value​ for money. It is not very big or very small place just perfect for cafe. May be we were the last costumer in their restaurant, that's why they r may be in little hurry to serve the courses.

Ordered for home delivery through swiggy so won't be able to comment on the decor and service. Coming to the important part- the food! 
Ordered the chicken Thai green curry which came along with steamed rice. The curry was a bit runny to my liking but was packed with flavour. It was absolutely delicious with 12 moderate pieces of chicken and some vegetables. 

Looking forward to visiting the restaurant.

I recently went there with one of my friend after seeing good ratings on zomato. However, it did not live up to my expectation.
Being a vegetarian, I had limited options in starters.
Ordered Paneer Satay in Peanut Sauce and was highly disappointed.
Pan fried noodles and brownie shake was average... Nothing too great.
After this, I did not feel like ordering anything else.

The staff were well-spoken, however, the service was tooooo slow.

Overall, I would not like to visit again.

Lived up to the expectation and all the hype this place have garnered recently as some touted it to be a "hidden gem". As starter the Gyoza (pan fried chicken dimsum) was really very good. Unfortunately can't say the same for the drums of heaven. I have had better ones. The Cantonese mixed chowmein was nice and tasty with a bit of crunch to it. We were suggested a semi dry chicken dish in chilli oyester sauce to go with the chowmein. It really went well. We tried another dish from the continental menu called grilled fish in lemon butter sauce which comes with lightly sauted veggies (read green beans, carrot and broccoli) and some mashed potato. Again nothing much to complain here apart from the fish being a bit too salty to my taste. But it will still go well with the sweeter and buttery mashed potato. Then there were some chicken shawarma salad. Don't get me wrong, the dish (whatever it was) were really tasty. But I can vouch for the fact that it wasn't anything near to what one calls a shawarma to durum. There was nothing Turkish or Lebanese about the chicken. But since the taste was good, I can't care less. My companions tried some of the mocktails and seemed satisfied with them. So no complain. On a whole this place is recommended and the best thing being the pocket friendliness of the offerings and friendly service.

3 of us were on the look out for a cozy place to have a good brunch, one sunny weekday, when we stumbled across this place on Zomato, and things just got better from thereon in.

It's only a little distance from 6 Ballygunge Place ( I'm terrible with roads so that's my landmark), we walked into an empty, well-decorated cafe with sceptic hearts.

The food left us completely surprised and extremely satisfied.
I think that's the best Momo I've had in ages, being served in a proper restaurant.
The conversation just flowed as all the food vanished.
The steak could've been better made, it's not even a complain, it's a suggestion!
The Chinese won us over further and further with every dish.
From the presentation, to the spices, they have absolutely nailed it!
The prices will literally urge you to push your eating capacities a little beyond normal!
I cant wait to find my way back there. Do drop by if you're in search of a proper chinese lunch/dinner, they'll satiate any hunger you might have.

Coming to the food it was truly one of the most tasty and delicious meals i have ever had. All the items like Pattaya Fish, Chicken korean stick, lung fung soup, etc were extremely delicious and delectable. Prices were also reasonable. Overall a highly recommended place and a must visit for all the foodies!

WARNING THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS A THIEF ...... !! I ordered 2 portions of Thai Red Curry and Rice via swigy. After taking the delivery i was shocked to see only one portion. paid for the 2 portions.  So call the restaurant as there could be a genuine mistake. The person who attended the call admitted that they had sent only one portion and would deliver the second portion immediately. The person attending the call took my address and mobile no. To my shock they never delivers the second portion... apart form the money lost ... they did a lovely job of ruining my dinner. Keep up the Great JOB.... Would warn everyone ..... Order at own risk !!!.... I shall also post this on all my social food blogs.....

This place is a hidden treasure.From starters to desserts each item was equally delicious.
Drums of heaven - was different with a pinch of twist

Both steamed & pan fried momos are good

Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce  -  just melts in mouth

Darshan with vanilla ice cream just blew us away


Overall a great experience.. only the quantity can be on a larger portion as compared to price, that's all.

Fancy Vivers!

It's been long being hunted any eatery house, so craving was growing stronger day by day. Thus, finally melted my awaited pot at Melting Pot. 

Addiction for something is wild. And if it's for food, well that fancy can only be fulfilled by vivers. Hence, decreed quick for Korean chicken stick: this cuisine sticked so hard that can't forget its taste still. Mouth watering! Furthermore, pan fried chicken gyoza dumplings were phenomenal in taste and presentation as well. Cherished it. In addition there were KitKat shake and Caramel crunchy shake. They actually sedated the awaited thirst for good edible. They scored full marks in their sheet. 

As we were almost full, thence for main course we ordered Mixed Cantonese Noodles. I prefer mostly hakka, but this didn't dissatisfy me at all. Instead I just savored it utterly. However, the giant surprise was it only costed 950 bucks. Damn economical. Must go guys.

Thanks for reading. Follow me on Instagram/Zomato @Supratik Chakravarty or chakravarty8supratik.wordpress.com

Talk of hidden gems and Melting pot would sure as hell hit my list of favourites... A newly opened restaurant, this place attracted my attention a while ago after perusing the marvellous reviews and recommendations on Zomato and as always, I am forever grateful to this site which has taken up the responsibility of satiating every hunger pang of mine every time.
Located in an obscure bylane of Cornfield Road, the ambience of this eatery is one of comfort and warmth. The place is quite small yet beautifully adorned with pictures on the walls and pleasing music in the background.
Now to the food, which absolutely took our breaths away...
We started our voyage de appetit with,
Crispy chilli babycorn-- My ultimate favourite dish on this planet and truth be told, if you've got your babycorn right, you have won my heart😋. The crisp on the corn was one to rave about and the taste was spot on, the tangy and sweet flavours dancing tango on your palate.
Drums of heaven -- Beautifully frenched chicken with the right sauces made for a beautiful starter... If I could recommend some tiny change, I would say, I would have loved the addition of some caramelised onions to make the dish rise to glory...but again splitting hairs here...😅
Chicken steamed momo-- The star of the evening for sure... Being an inveterate lover of momos, I have gone on and about tasting momos everywhere but I would not hesitate to give these little darlings the acclamation of being the best momos I have ever tasted... The filling was absolutely marvellous and everything about it was spot on!!
Fish and chips-- Did I call the momos the star of the evening? Then these fab fillets would definitely deserve to be the "ultimate" showstopper of the evening... Probably the best fish and chips anyone can ever have... Whatever i say about it would be insufficient to describe it's perfection.... "Highly" recommended!!
The mains comprised of --
Shanghai chicken-- Frankly, I have never had such soft chicken pieces in my life... This chicken dish would go down in my list of most memorable chicken sides without a doubt...
Fish in chilli oyster sauce-- I have always been partial towards chicken as my favourite protein, but man, did this dish convert me!! The most fulfilling fish side would be my only verdict for this dish.. Again, highly recommended...
The fried rice and hakka noodles taken alongside were perfect yet again to say the least.
The desserts made for a perfect epilogue, comprising,
Brownie with ice cream-- One of the best i have had for sure... The brownie was soft, flaky and not overtly sweet... It surely won hearts.
Tutti fruti-- Infused with multifarious fruity flavours and juices, this ice cream was nice and light, perfectly balanced.
Toffee walnut -- My favourite dessert of the evening. The vanilla ice cream fusioned with flavours of toffee topped with generous amount of sticky walnut was absolutely blooming beautiful.
We were so mesmerised by the food that we HAD to call in the chef and thank him for sweeping us off our feet. As for the staff, waited upon by Bheem, he really made our evening special with just the perfect recommendations. After all this never ending gorging, the bill summed upto 3000 bucks which gives you an idea how reasonable this place is. I implore anyone reading my review to rush to this gem of an eatery in ballygunge as soon as you can...this place deserves to be talked about at length😊

A newly opened Chinese, Thai & Continental joint located in Ballygunge Place.

AMBIENCE - This is a small cosy place, vibrant & soothing interiors, accomodating around 25-30 people at a time.

FOOD- We tried the cajun spiced chicken, crab meat rice & chicken in chill oyster sauce. Every dish was quite tasty, but the crab meat rice was the best one out of all. Looking forward to trying their mocktails & desserts in our next visit.

SERVICE - The attendants are well behaved, & they suggest you well.

POCKET PINCH- 800-1000 for two.

Been here with some of my friends last week at lunch time to kick our hunger with their delicious cuisines.    Melting Pot is situated in front of 6 Ballygunge Place. very easy to find.    A Small Café cum Restaurant with sitting capacity of around 30. Minimalist Décor with vibrant wooden interiors. Ambience was as classy as Classy Cafe's would. Calm and peaceful environment with quick service and decent staff. Very impressed with the hospitality and presentation.    Now let's quickly move to the Food & Beverages Department starting with the drinks we ordered -     * Strawberry Soda - The most refreshing, Fizzy and the Flavourful drink. Sweet to the ultimate level with excess fizziness and refreshment drink totally loved it. * Lemon Iced Tea - Iced Tea looks simple but it's really hard to make perfectly balanced one. This was just perfect. Refreshing, mild, chilled, little tangy and aromatic flavourful Lemon Iced Tea which tastes just heaven. Now let's move on to the Starters -    * Mushroom Pepper Salt - Mushroom Pepper Salt is a simple mushroom appetizer. Crispy mushrooms tossed with Asian Spices and veggies like onions, spring onions, green chillies and some herbs tastes amazing. * Crispy Baby Corn with Chestnut - Crispy deep fried Babycorn toasted with the spice of Chestnut and coated with white sesame tastes truly spicy, little juicy and heavenly delicious.  * Veg Panfried Momos - Momos are BAE, i just loved them. What they made it was fully loaded spicy tossed veggies in a momo which was pan fried later tastes amazingly delicious. perfectly made and Pan fried till perfection.  Now let's move on to the main part which was main course -    * Sundried Tomato & Basil Risotto - This is nothing less then heaven. Arborio Rice Risotto made with Sundried tomatoes and Basil Pesto tastes heavenly in mouth. I can still feel the taste in my mouth. Highly recommended totally loved it.  * Green Thai Curry - Veg version of the Green Thai Curry Made it as perfect as it can be. Thick and heavenly delicious made with lot's of modern veggies, aroma of lemongrass and creaminess of Cream. served with Steamed Basil Rice. That's all folks. Our experience was just fantastic. Strongly recommended to all. A must try place.

Melting pot is a hidden gem..it is situated in Ballygunge place just after weaver's studio..such amazing food we had.. and the pricing is as reasonable as it can be..now they just do not serve awesome food but they have a beautiful ambience too..cozy is the term that I prefer.
Now coming to the food..
Lung fung soup - nice just the right option to select this winter
Chicken salt and pepper- just simply loved it
Fish and chips- now this is pure love..thie food is a classic.. highly recommend
Chicken stroganoff- quite well made
Chicken parmesan- this is a chicken and cheese lovers paradise

The one of the trending, hold on .. I guess the most trending restaurant in Kolkata, on this day. It's creating a huge buzz , and thus got my attention also. So, was very excited to visit this cafe/ restaurant.

Location:
____________

It's in bullygunje. Near the very famous tastey corner ( near by south point)

Decoration:
_____________

Decoration is okay type. A small joint with a decent and nice look , is good enough to welcome you to having a good time with food.

Now coming to the main segment. Okay 1st of all let me clear it out that, had a huge expectation from this. May be that fired back a little.

Beverages:
______________

✓ Coffee Hezelnut - an undoubtedly let down. Did not like that at all.

✓ Green Apple Soda - the sweet portion was a bit higher , but quite refreshing.

✓ Lime Ginger Soda - nice one. Quite refreshing.

Food:
_______

✓ Thai red chilli prawn - it's okay type. Prawn was nice. But this dish could have been better.

✓ Chicken Suimai - chicken momo. Very nice one. Undoubtedly the best one we had there.

✓ Sea food Suimai - now , that chicken one is so good, we opted for this one. But it's a disappointment. I mean it sea food  how could you include basa fish? It's a mix of basa and prawn.

Now that was a great let down for us. Thought of tried their so many dishes, but decided to seal the tummy there for that day.


Now, the most important thing we experienced:
_______________________________________________

The person who served, came every time to know our likings, and he discovered we were really unhappy with some food.
 Now what see you most of the time, they took a note, promise you to server better next time.

Now, to our surprise, when the bill came, the didn't even charge the food, what we didn't liked.

And that proves their loyality to the customer. I have been quite a few places , but this kind of gesture , didn't even think of.

We'll all that cost 786INR.

In this review 0.5 point extra for this kind of gesture to customer value.

I would put it like : **** this is an incomplete review**** till the date I visit again. I hope you guys will make to give you a 5 star review, by your food only.

Had been looking forward to visiting this newly opened café. Finally went there for lunch with some of my friends last week. The restaurant is small and seating space is limited to around 30 souls. Interiors have been done up cleverly at minimal expense, yet soothing to the eye.

Coming to the food, we started off with some beverages. We had Strawberry Soda, Blended Crunchy Coffee and Lemon Iced Tea. All were pleasant. For the soup, I loved the Lung Fung Soup.
Crispy Babycorn with Chestnut, Mushroom Pepper Salt and Veg Pan Fried Momos were delightful to have.

For the main course, we ordered Sun Dried Tomato & Basil Risotto and Thai Green Curry. I have always been a fan of sun dried tomatoes and loved them here too. Thai Curries never fail to impress and same was case here.

For dessert we had Tuffi Frutti which is made with freshly cut fruits, strawberry crush and ice cream. A treat for people with a sweet tooth.

The name is Melting Pot, and the place melted my heart and my digestive system. Each and every dish I tried was awesome. Not a fan of continental and thai food. But a friend forced. And am glad that he did force. Full marks for ambience and service. 

The USP of the place:- They play instrumental 90's music.

Melting Pot is located at the Ballygunge Place,it’s easy to locate.The ambience is pretty nice with mesmerizing music.

We started with Tom Yum Soup,it’s tasty and tangy,you will instantly love it.

Thai Stuffed Chicken Omlette was impressive ,a recommended one.

Chicken Pepper Salt was amazing and crunchy.

Fish and chips were presented beautifully and it was enjoyable.

Caramel Crunchy Shake was one of the best shake I ever have,highly recommended one.

Lemon iced tea was terrific in drinks.

Green Thai Curry (Chicken)was the perfect start in main courses, it’s really delicious and divine,the chicken pieces were also very tasty.

Chicken Permassiona is another appreciated one of them, it’s stunning.

Desserts are the most crucial part of any meal and Melting Pot didn’t disappointed us in that.

Tutti Frutti was truly appealing and divine, again a recommended one.

Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu and really decent food ,Will be back.

Melting pot will surely melt you with their mesmerizing preparations be it starters or mains or dessert.
This place is a hidden gem in short.
Decor is beautifully done(read neatly)with a wooden touch and bright lamps. Quite spacious too.
Do not skip the beautiful wall clock done so innovatively with frames in respect to the minute&hour hands.
🍝Well coming to the food, I was taken aback with the yummy titbits namely Cajun spice chicken and pattaya fish. This was accompanied with Melting mocha drink. It was thick and chocolatey!
Pattaya fish tinkered my tastebuds with its soft texture and perfect flavour. Presentation made it more beautiful on the platter.
Next came Conjy crispy lamb that was perfect to bits. Soft, juicy and rich by taste. Lamb lovers please do get a taste of this one.
Mouthful of crispy lamb and Caramel crunch in between the bites made my soul happier.
It was followed by their popular Thai red chilli prawn. I could have it more than just one plate. Prawns were amazing and thumbs up for the presentation.👍
For mains we had chilly garlic noodles with shredded chicken in hunan sauce. How delicious it was! Couldn't have been better actually.
The creamy gravy will give you feels for sure.😍
We also tasted their Thai preparation and trust me it was equally fantastic!
A bowl of rice(enough for three if you had so many starters already) and Red Thai curry- Lamb will make your dinner remarkable. The colour..the gravy..quantity plus the quality will never disappoint you. 💯
Grilled fish steak is like their must-have dish. Neat by the presentation and amazing by its taste. Mashed potato with veggies and well sauteed grilled fish as a whole. What else do we need?😍
Thank me for this one if you get what I mean.
We were charmed by the dessert that came in the form of Brownie with ice cream and Toffi walnut.
My vote goes for both the items. 
Brownie as a dessert is something you can never skip and the latter half is so delicious that you won't even feel like skipping it!!!
This place is highly appreciated.👍

Melting Pot is all set to melt your heart with their food and service. A hidden gem located in one of the lanes of ballygunge place won my heart immensely. You will find good ambience, good people and very good food in this pot. Dishes that i tried:
Tom Yum Soup- i had the chicken version. Beautiful aroma, spicy and tangy taste and beautiful rich flavour what constitues this beauty.
Chicken Pepper Salt- chicken tossed in spices and bell peppers. Flavours are balanced perfectly and the chicken being cooked beautifully.
Bbq Chicken Wings-do i need to describe this thing? I guess not. 
Fish & Chips- beautiful fillet cooked to perfection. You get the right crispyness from the outer crust and then the fresh fish inside it.  A must try dish.
Chicken stroganoff: chicken and vegetables in a smooth creamy sauce. Loved the flavours.
Chicken permassiona: this was just heaven. It was cheesy affair. The saucyness and cheesyness was too good. Highly recommended.
For the drinks, we had strawberry soda,blended crunchy coffee and lemon iced tea. Each of the drinks were superb. Liked every one of them. Being a coffee-lover, i liked it too much. 
Ended my meal with tutti frutti. This was really good. 
Every dish was presented beautifully. Loved the place.
Should i come back again? Definately.

The decor of the restaurant gives you a very warm and cozy vibe. The food is seriously amazing. Try out chicken dumplings for starters, for main course you can go for cantonese noodles and sliced lamb in chilli oyster sauce. If you are a milkshake person like me, do try out their oreo milkshake and you won't be disappointed.

The cozy and neat to perfection ambience of Melting Pot has just melt my heart. Coming to the food , they have a variety of dishes with pocket friendly price tag. ( The price of the food in their menu card is inclusive of GST and not the price shown in Zomato). However , I ordered two different chicken dishes - BBQ chicken and Chicken wings and to my utter dissapointment both were made the same way ,( i felt both were dipped in honey, i was expecting the either of the dish to be a bit spicy)only the pieces of chickens were different in shape. Momo was so so, but their presentation of food was top notch. Lastly, the brownie with ice-cream was the cherry on top. It was delicious.
If for nothing else , you should visit the outlet for --- brownie with ice-cream.

Melting Pot is a small restaurant located in near Ballygunge Phari. I had developed a bit of an expectation from this place going through Zomato reviews and recommendations but was totally let down by it. First of all, the place is decorated wonderfully and is accompanied by 90's tunes running in the background which provided a nice warm ambience. The place was almost empty when we arrived barring a couple of people. We ordered Pattaya Fish for starters. The dish tasted very delicious. It was soft and has six pieces. The dish has a smell of coconut due to a sauce or topping which was given, so if anyone is obnoxious of coconuts do not try this dish. For main course, we ordered Chicken Cantonese Noodles along with Sliced Chicken served with Oyster Sauce. The Chicken Cantonese Noodles totally ruined our experience. The dish was not adequate in quantity for a single person, let alone two. The dish calls itself being a chicken dish but has more pieces of mushroom in it than chicken. I think the dish needs to be renamed or re-prepared. The side dish tasted good and was okayish. I also found the behaviour of the staff a bit odd. Inspite of the place being empty, the staff tried to get rid of us quickly as if they were closing down or there was some emergency even though it was around six in the evening. The Zomato menu of this place is also a bit outdated as it hasn't covered GST and hence the place isn't 700 for two people as mentioned here. Nevertheless, one will pay money if the quantity is wholesome. When the quantity isn't satisfactory, the place will definitely find less takers. I hope the management takes this issue seriously and increases the quantity of the dishes.

After being turned away from two other restaurants due to rather unfortunate reasons, Melting Pot came to our rescue and we are glad it happened. Located off Bondel Rd, this place is easy to locate. The arresting decor and the spacious sitting even inside this cozy a place is a great plus. The server was very attentive and multiple staff keep you updated about the order, which is a first for me.
We ordered Pan Fried Chili Fish, the highly recommend Thai Green Curry with Prawns, and Grilled Fish in lemon butter sauce. The chili fish was a fiery concoction of well fried fish and a tangy sweet stir fry of veggies, lip smackingly tasty. Thai green curry comes with a side of rice, so is a meal in itself. You might confuse it with a "Shukto", albeit a higher grade containing broccoli in it. Jokes apart, this one was an out and out winner, with its subtle taste brought out in its full by the rice. A musty try, this one.
The grilled fish was good too, with a side of veggies and mashed potatoes. I felt the portion doesn't do justice to the price for this one though.
For dessert, we had darsan with ice cream. Warm and crunchy and flaky and in one word, awesome, this one.

Full marks to this place, keep up the good work.

If you are looking at a light dinner to kick start the weekend with, Melting Pot is a good place to drop in.

The place is big enough to host a party of 30 and is the sitting arrangement is one to love.

Colourful little place with good food. 

Right from the starters to the mains, everything is made with a touch of care. So there are no over catering of spices and grease. The dishes are well balanced and you can definitely go back for more spoon fulls, once done with the first. 

We started off with pan fried chicken momos and the steamed chicken momos. Out of which the steamed did fall into my space of liking more. We also loved devouring the fish and chips, a definite must if you are dropping in here. Their highlights are definitely their  mains, out of which, we tried the  Cantonese noodles, Crab fried rice, hot garlic fish and the chicken green Thai curry. The food has a homely, comforting feel to it. The chicken steak is unmissable and I think it surely is one of the best dishes served here. Go try out ne things. Excavate their menu and make your picks.

I am clueless as to how this place has such high rating. The interior was beautiful but the food was a total letdown. Food quality was ordinary and the quantity was highly disappointing. Pocket pinch too was on the higher side (prices are inclusive of GST).

We ordered Chicken in Salt and Pepper, Chicken Hakka noodles, Chilli garlic noodles, Chicken in hot garlic sauce and Brownie with vanilla icecream. Neither of the item was impressive.

Service was prompt though.

Not recommended and definitely never coming back.

A newly opened restaurant in ballygunge place,Melting Pot serves Chinese, Thai and Continental fare. This was my first visit here and I must say I'm quite impressed. We tried the cajun spiced chicken, crab meat rice and chicken in chilli oyster sauce. All the dishes tasted good. The rice was the show stealer though. Pocket pinch justifies the quality of the food. Though the quantity can be improved. Look forward to visit this place again.

This new restaurant just caught my eye. It was a spur of the moment decision to visit this place and boy we were not disappointed. The decor is top of the class with enough lighting to neither make it too brightly lit nor too shabby. Just the right amount. Now coming to the food. We had ordered a lime soda, a chicken  pasta with white sauce and also a Darshan along with it. They tasted pretty good and hit the right taste buds. The waiting staff are friendly and helpful. Just that when it's empty they tend to stare at you. But overall it's a place I would gladly visit again and again.

This newly opened place totally won me over. Specially with their starters. The momos we had (fried and steam) were too good. The chicken wings were good too.
Their drinks could be made better, specially the blue lagoon. Hazelnut cold coffee was good but the caramel crunch was the best one.
Main course had Cantonese noodles and crab rice and chicken green Thai curry with normal steam rice. Loved the green Thai curry, I could just have that. Cantonese noodles were also good. There was a side of fish whose name I forgot but it was very good.

Overall great experience. And special mention to the amazing staff and quick service. Will definitely drop in again for that green thai curry.

A newly opened restaurant in ballygunge place,Melting Pot serves Chinese, Thai and Continental fare. This was my first visit here and I must say I'm quite impressed. We tried the cajun spiced chicken, crab meat rice and chicken in chilli oyster sauce. All the dishes tasted good. The rice was the show stealer though. Pocket pinch justifies the quality of the food. Though the quantity can be improved. Look forward to visit this place again.

This new restaurant just caught my eye. It was a spur of the moment decision to visit this place and boy we were not disappointed. The decor is top of the class with enough lighting to neither make it too brightly lit nor too shabby. Just the right amount. Now coming to the food. We had ordered a lime soda, a chicken  pasta with white sauce and also a Darshan along with it. They tasted pretty good and hit the right taste buds. The waiting staff are friendly and helpful. Just that when it's empty they tend to stare at you. But overall it's a place I would gladly visit again and again.

Melting Pot is a hidden gem when it comes to finger licking food and courteous service. You can walk for 5 minutes from Ballygunge Phari to reach the place. There's a cluster of eateries around - Kasturi, Fish Fish and Chowman.

It's a small yet well arranged place with basic ambiance. However, the food will exceed your expectation for sure.

The must orders -

Blended Hazelnut Coffee
Caramel Crunchy Shake
Chicken Shawarma Salad
Drums of Heaven
Conjy Crispy Lamb
Steamed Chicken Momos
Mixed Cantonese Noodles

Price is reasonable. Service is good.

Recommended!

The restaurant is a small comfy joint which is a little hard to locate but worth the trouble. Me along with a couple of friends needed a place for small celebration and finally decided on this restaurant. The ambience is a very calm and peaceful one with minimalistic decor and colourful seats to perk up your moods. They were polite enough to accomodate our noisy group without getting irritated at all. 

Now coming to the food, we had drinks, starters and the mains ofcourse.

Drinks :

1. Cool Blue
2. Caramel Crunch Shake

Starters :

1. Crispy Konjee Lamb - Tiny pieces of minced lamb with a crunchy to it. Loved it.
2. Pan Fried Momo - Juicy momos with a great dip. I personally felt that the sauce could have been better, but everyone else just loved it to bits.
3. Steamed Momo - I cannot rave about it any less. Juicy and yummy with large chunks of chicken inside.
4. Chicken Shawarma Salad - Shredded chicken tossed in creamy sauce alongwith veggies. Ah, this is the perfect dish for all those who are always on the lookout for healthy dishes but do not like comprising with the taste. 
5. Fish and Chips - Firstly, the presentation of this was SO CUTE. The fish was of a decent size and melted right in my mouth. The crispy french fries and the creamy dip was also perfection.

MAINS :

1. Mixed Cantonese Noodles - Definitely recommend. 
2. Hot Garlic Fish - Soft and tender fish with the perfect blend of spices.
3. Crab Fried Rice - Guys, you NEED to try this. 
4. Thai Green Curry - A favourite again. It was so tasty. 

Overall, I really really liked the place. The service, the food as well as the ambience, everything is a thumbs up!

Located in Midway between Weaver's studio and ballygunj chowman. 
This is a feel good cafe totally. Be it a little date or meet up, it's just the perfect place with  soothing ambience. 
It was subtly decorated, with dash of colours here and there, little quotes painted on walls.
Love their seating, the wooden tables and benches. 

Coming to the food and beverages :- 
➡️Caramel crunch shake was really tasty, not too heavy and not too sweet either. Loved it. 
➡️Hazelnut blended coffee , a mild cold coffee with hazelnut flavour. 
➡️Drums of heaven were really succulent coated with the luscious sauce on each side served it chopped fresh veggies. Must try. 
➡️Crispy konjee lamb( recommended) . One of their specialities. Lovely taste and crisp to the t. 
➡️ Chicken shawarma salad was a good order to cut out on the grease from the fried food and refreshing to have the upcoming ones. 
➡️Momos , both panfried and steamed were to die for. Totally in love with them . 
➡️Fish and chips an all time favorite, could never go wrong and it didn't. Huge fillets of fish, crumb fried served with giant french fries and tartare . (Recommended) 
➡️Mixed Cantonese noodles was as classic it is. Steaming, with crunchy veggies and meat. 
➡️ Crab meat Fried rice (recommended). One of the best fried rice preps I've tasted in recent past. Not oily or hard rice. Just the perfect way with crab meat in every bite. 
➡️Hot garlic fish complemented both the rice and noodles pretty well. 
➡️ Curries - thai green curry and mutton matsaman curry. Loved the latter. former too was well done. 
This place is added to my personal favorite list. Do give a visit and have a great time.

Location : Ballygunge place. Equidistant from Fish fish & 6 Ballygunge place.

Decor & ambience : broad wooden table, hanging  lamps and bright colours give this place a nice and warm vibe. This cafe is perfect for a date with that special someone as well as for an 'adda' session with friends.

Food :

* Crispy konjee lamb : This is one of my favourite dishes and melting point did justice to it as well. It was pretty good.

* Momos : Be it pan fried or steamed, I loved their momos. The momos are juicy and the filling is nice & flavourful.

* Fish & chips : The portion size is huge. I loved the chips. LOVED. The fish fillet was thick and juicy, lightly crumbed and fried till perfection. It was meet in the mouth. The fries were amazing.

* Hazelnut coffee : reccomended.

* Caramel crunchy shake : this was thick and creamy and the sudden pops of caramel crunch really enhances the shake!

This cafe definitely bags a reccomendation from me. If you're in that area, do give this cafe a visit!

This is a new restaurant which I had been planning to visit since some time. It was yesterday that I gave this place a visit with some of my friends. The place, though small, looks beautiful with a vibrant decor. It is basically a cafe but finger food isn't their speciality. I was quite surprised to find some beautiful Chinese and Continental dishes here, the taste of which can anyday give a good competition to any fine diner. 

We started our meal with some mocktails and shakes. The Melting Mocha had a strong flavour of coffee and wasn't much sweet. The Green Apple Soda didn't look green but tasted good and was refreshing. My favourite was the Crunchy Caramel Shake. It was consistent and tasted amazing. One should definitely order this if you're visiting this place. The Cranberry Cooler had a mild flavour of cranberry. 

Moving on to the appetizers, the Cajun Spice Chicken had a thick fillet of chicken which was crumb fried and served with mayo. The Pattaya Fish was my favourite. The fish was flavoured with lemongrass and tasted beautiful. The Chicken Steamed Momos were perfectly done. The momos had a good amount of stuffing which was enclosed in a thin coating. The Conjee Crispy Lamb was well fried, and tossed with bell peppers. I actually fell in love with the texture of the lamb. The Thai Red Chilly Prawns were juicy, succulent and quite spicy. 

It was time for the main course. The Chilly Garlic Noodles was spicy which was paired with the mildly spiced Hunan Chicken. This combo didn't fail to impress me. Next was Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce. The fish was well grilled and the sauce tasted excellent. The mashed potato was super creamy. The Lamb Red Thai Curry tasted great, though not like the authentic one. 

Our meal ended with the desserts which had Brownie with Ice Cream and Toffee Walnut. The brownie had a beautiful texture. The Toffee Walnut was also nice.

Overall, it was an amazing meal. The quality and quantity of each dish was great. The prices were quite nominal. The service was good as well. This is indeed a hidden gem where I'd love to give another visit soon.

Cranberry Mojito- another well blended drink and nicely presented in a mason jar.

Chicken steam Momo- soft, juicy and well filled with chicken. 
Main course 
Chicken in Hunan sauce - one can blindly order this.. my favourite item from all.

Located in one of the busy bylanes of ballygunge(near South point school),  this hidden gem really deserves a thumbs up for their unparalleled food quality, hospitality and a plethora of lip smacking delicacies which they offer. 

The first thing that is going to catch your attention is the stunning decor and the beautifully decorated interiors, it really does elevate the entire dining experience! 

Now coming to the most awaited part of this review! 
The food and beverages really pack a solid punch and it is really difficult to choose from such an elaborate menu but nonetheless we did arrive upon a decision! 

AMONG THE BEVERAGES - The cranberry mojito is a must have! It was so refreshing! Followed by the crunchy caramel shake- and let me tell you, this place really knows how to impress with their shakes! 
We also tried the green apple soda and the melting mocha which were quite good! 

HERE COMES THE FOOD! -- Some of the starters which i would recommend are the PATTAYA FISH which was hands down one of the best fish preparations which i have had, the CAJUN SPICE CHICKEN- this dish was quite filling and well prepared! , CONJY CRISPY LAMB- i am not much of a Lamb person but this one was really crisp and yummy- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. For Momo lovers, this place should definitely be in your bucket list, the chicken steamed Momo rates high in terms of presentation and taste! 

HOLD ON, HERE COMES THE MAIN COURSE NOW! 
The chilly garlic noodles along with the shredded chicken in Hunan sauce formed quite a formidable combination! The quality and quantity were highly impressive! 
Next on our table was the grilled fish with lemon butter which was quite delectable! We also tried the red Thai curry (lamb) and it scored well in terms of taste and quantity! 

Our journey to this beautiful hidden gem finally ended with the toffee Walnut( looks great and tastes even better)  and Brownie with ice cream! 

This place is relatively new and is working it's way through the ranks on account of their work ethics! Kudos to this place!

This place is located in Ballygunge, a few minutes walk from Ballygunge Phari.
This cafe is a New on the trend with its new outlet. The ambience is detectable with lamps hanging and with quite eye-catching interior decors. A sofesticated ambience i must say ❤So I had decided to go for a walk in with my friends.
Here what we ordered :

Green Apple Soda:
A refreshing drink to start with.Green apple syrup with soda water and ice.The taste is amazing. Too much to break your tiredness in a sip of one.

Crunchy Caramel Shake:
This a must drink from this place I found.
Crunches of caramel on top with milk and chocolate being the base. Amazing tastes. The shape of the glass in which they serve is cute though and it's also served with forth of milk shake on the top.

Cajun Spiced Chicken:
The thin strips of boneless chicken pieces with crispy coating on the outside is what they serve here. Tastes good. Quantity is enough for two. It's more on the side of what we serve as chicken strips.

Conjy Crispy Lamb:
This a must have dish from this place. The crispyness is on point with chopped lamb pieces. For those who don't have lamb try it. You won't ever find it being lamb meat. It tastes so different than the other dishes. A bit on the spicer note. I loved it❤

Chicken Steam Momo:
The softness?Wow! The dip?Wow! The fillings?Wow! What more? They serve in a wooden box.

Chilly Garlic Noodles:
The noodles are different i must say apart from the noodles in other places. Tastes good. Quantity serves enough for people of three. They serve it with assorted capsicum and egg etc as per the order.

Shredded Chicken In Hunan Sauce:
Chicken in white Hunan Sauce tastes good. Serve is white bowl. Quantity serves max of two people. Consists of shredded pieces of chicken.

This is what yesterday's dinner of mine consisted of ❤ head on to Melting Pot for your experience sooner.

One of the most beautiful places in Kolkata to go to. Situated at 89 B, Opposite to BSNL Complex, Ballygunge Place, Ballygunge, Kolkata. 

You might just miss this restaurant because of its location. However, if you have found it, its  a fantastic place have your weekend. They have a unique menu like Chinese, Thai and Continental.

Just like its unique name, this place has unique peaceful and traditional ambiance too.  Uniquely designed  beautifully with the concept of structure, it would definitely impress anyone at the first instance. Beautiful would be an understatement of how good this place looks when the lights are on. Great place for conversations or a date with the one you love.

The service is prompt at this place. Food is definitely lip-smacking and hot. 

What should you order:
                    

DRINKS:

1) Crunchy Caramel Shake : 
This crunchy chocolate caramel milkshake is the perfect mixture of creamy caramel chocolate-ness and crunchy biscuit bits.

2) Green Apple Soda :
So much better than overly sweetened apple sodas with “natural” flavors.

3) Cranberry Mojito :
Fresh cranberries, mint and lime slices add super vibe in Cranberry Mojito. Heaven.

4) Melting Mocha :
this Chocolate Mocha Shake is very reminiscent of CCD Mocha Frappuccino and an absolute dream for all of you fellow coffee lovers.
                    

STARTERS :

1) Cajun Spice Chicken :
This Cajun-style spice coating is simple, intensely flavorful and a little spicy.

2) Pattaya Fish :
With a slight twist and a subtle kick, you'll absolutely fall in love with this lovely dish.  They are crispy and spicy and tangy and frankly they are not too fishy.

3) Thai Red Chilly Prawn :
It's sweet, tangy, spicy… and of course, sticky. 

4) Chicken Steam MOMO :
Out of the world dish. Cannot believe how can a dish be so perfect. Definitely made me fall in love with it. Must try.

MAIN COURSES :

1) CHILLY Garlic Noodles with Shredded Chicken In Hunan Sauce :
Each item that was served in this dish taste heavenly. Again I just said the taste is perfect. It's hard to beat anything that we ordered at this place.

2) Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter:
Another out of the world flavor on offer by Melting Pot. Hard to beat the taste. This makes total love to your taste buds.

DESSERTS:

1) Brownie with Ice Cream :
 A unique and yummy dessert which is served with vanilla ice cream scoop.

2) Toffee Walnut :
This crisp English Walnut Toffee is one of the best things I've ever eaten. A toffee slab is coated with chocolate and walnuts, then broken into pieces. It was just HEAVEN.

Overall this is a nice place to chill with your friends. The service is quick and the staff is good. I know you guys would want me to tell you more about the food at this place but trust me this is the place to visit and explore. There is hardly anything which is not delicious at this place

Happy hogging fellas :D

Went there during Durga Puja on Saptami with my friend for some adda over hot coffee. Initially they said they aren't serving any hot coffees for some odd reason, but later as we were planning to leave they said they could serve on request. Ordered Cappuccino and a Crispy Spicy Chicken from the starters. Cappuccino was average but the crispy chicken was quite good. Its a small cosy place with a few tables but the ambience was nice.

Quite a decent place and not very busy usually. Nevertheless, I was amazed to get some lovely food. Thai curry was perfect and so were dimsums and Agli Olio. 

All in all would recommend for a good dinner.

Review 2:
Cream of Mushroom wasn’t very exquisite as it had bread crumbs instead of small mushroom slices, though had the right flavour. 

Avoid the mushroom pepper salt. It’s too deep friend and you don’t get the taste n  feel of mushrooms. All you eat is fried covering over the mushrooms. Thumsdown!!!

I realised this time that on a weekend and at peak hours chowman in neighbourhood has waiting and this is empty, well not advertised it seems. People hopped in randomly only to check the menu.

On Navami night, we waited 45minutes for the food  to turn up. They served one of the best cooked grilled fish I have ever had. The other dishes we ordered included a chicken steak with mushroom sauce and a chicken lasagna. While the chicken steak was yum, the chicken lasagna could use a bit of work. The stuffing wasn't as appealing as we had expected it to be.
The portions weren't too generous(even that of the lasagna) but enough for those who enjoy a light dinner. 
I rate this place a 3.5/5 only for their grilled fish and their chicken steak!!

Nice and cosy ambience located in a small lane close to ballygunge place. Excellent services. Their menu card is small but quite interesting. We tried chicken stroganoff, mixed pan-fried noodles, hakka noodles and steak and garlic breads..
The pan fried noodles wasn't that good but the rest were quite delicious.. Each of the dishes provide a quantity enough for an individual.

A very pretty place. Perfect for a date or a family dinner. You can come here just to grab a cup of coffee or indulge yourselves in the Thai flavours. Ambience is very soothing. Interiors are beautiful. The staff's behaviour is humble and polite. Service is quick too. 
A must visit! ❤️
