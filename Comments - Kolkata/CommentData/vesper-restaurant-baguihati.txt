This restaurant is located near Baguihati Big Bazar outlet. We were on the way to some place in morning at around 9 AM and was searching for some place for having breakfast and since no other restaurant in that location was open that time, we thought of getting into this Veg small restaurant. Although I am not fond of veg items, but I liked this place and their food Quality as well as quantity that is served here. Overall small restaurant but good food and service. I hope vegetarians will like this.

Yesterday we 10 people went there. Though I saw this place b4 but wouldn't ever think to dine in. One of my elder brother insist to go so think of visiting. Simple decor quite place had given personal attention. We oreder peas polao, butter chicken, mix fried rice, mutton curry, kulcha, butter nan....it is must said that each n every item was great. Price n quantity both were satisfactory. Only one objection...we had to wait for a little long time despite of not having that much crowd.

Food is good but the Service is not up to the mark. The management is poor when there is bulk booking for both food and lodging.

Hospitality is poor and the manager at the reception is happy to fight with customers over small issues.

Good for eat and go but not ideal for staying back or bulk booking for parties both for food and lodging.

Small and cozy place to have a quick meal. Just beside bazar kolkata at baguiati. We ordered steam rice,kadai chicken,tandoori roti,veg polao,mixed veg and paneer butter masala. Taste is good with a middle indian touch. Quick service I must say. Price is at per. Quantity should have been better.

It was a late flight day before yesterday and we wanted to grab a quick bite because all of us were tired from the vacation (ah, the irony!) and wanted to hit the sack as soon as we could reach home. The service at Vesper was quick and prompt, we ordered Plain Rice, Dal Fry, Fish Curry and Chicken Tikka Masala. The Beckti Fish was really good. We were glad they didn't keep us waiting or else we would have fallen asleep on the table itself LOL. The washroom was pretty clean as well. There are many small restaurants on the way back to the city from the airport but one can't just land up in any one randomly because it might turn out to be a rather infamous "moder thek" if you know what I mean. Vesper is a rather safe joint for ladies at night.
