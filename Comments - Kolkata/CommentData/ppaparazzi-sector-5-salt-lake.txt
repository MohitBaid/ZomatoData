Been there for 3times. I visit this place only when I have cash issue!!
Very much affordable. They offer alcohol at low price. Food is good, and sufficient.I am a lover of their chicken tandoori​. Give it a try.
Though the place is not too spacious. I always find it crowded. There is no separate smoking zone actually. They have forcefully created a smoking corner just beside the washroom.
Inspite of all when you are running out of cash you can visit this place. You won't be disappointed.

The place is good to have an occasional party with friends.

The cost of food and drinks are nominal. 

The service is good but a bit delayed occasionally.

The ambiance is average.

Stopped by here for lunch today after a while between visits. Must've been to the place maybe 4 times over the past five years I've lived here. 

Paparazzi is a bar-cum-restaurant and the interior and clientele reflect that. It's clean and pleasant enough for a quick lunch or a few cheap drinks. Ordered a chilli cheese garlic bread and a chicken pepper steak sizzler. 

I really like the food here. It's fresh, flavourful and balanced just right, texture wise. The chilli cheese garlic bread could've had more chilli and bigger portions for the cost but good flavour. Fresh crunchy bread, garlic butter that's been made right and just the right amount of cheese. They topped it off with some chilli flake/powder mix and it made certain parts spicy enough and others not quite, but over all satisfying to eat. The sizzler wasn't available yet to we opted to have the components plated. Two perfectly grilled thin breasts of chicken, doused in a generous amount of gravy, with creamy mashed potatoes on the side and sautéed vegetables. The potatoes were quite frankly, perfect and the vegetables, fresh and crunchy. 

Cost's a bit on the higher side and service is slow but for a lazy Sunday afternoon, it's rather a pleasant place to chill. Worth a visit for the food!

Well, to begin with, it is a good place to hang out. Located in the ground floor of Globsyn crystal building, one may actually give it a miss thinking it to be something else rather than a place to chill. The drinks, I gather, are easy on the pocket. The food here is good. We had crispy chilly baby corn, drums of heaven, chilly chicken. I was a little disappointed with the ambiance.

Walked passed this many a times , from the outside it looks like a storeroom rather than a restaurant but this place is quite the TARDIS. Excellent utilisation of the space available and has a airport lounge bar look about it. The food takes forever to come out though we were the only two people for lunch today. Food is better than basic and of generous quantity. Would recommend the rice noodles.

Positioned prominently at globsyn crystal building in sector 5 and featuring a multicusine and well stocked bar menu , yet ppaparazzi is not one of the major crowd pullers in recent times in the it hub ; the reason i think personally is the ambience and the interiors which is a drawback relatively . With newer themes and glamourous set up restaurants that are popping out here and there in saltlake , thus turning the market very competitive , one has to be not less than excellent in all the categories , be it food , ambience , service and value for money factor.
The seating inside is bit cramped and ordinary , the interiors have nothing to write about , but to my surprise the food was really well cooked. We had CHICKEN BREAST IN MYSHROOM SAUCE and FOUR CHEESE CHICKEN LASAGNA with beer both the platters tasted amazing with the fries and garlic bread that came as sides.

This is a real small place. When I first visited the place, I found it to be decent enough. However on a recent visit found they have not maintained the property well. Now it looks like a cheap watering hole trying hard to look fashionable. 

Some dishes here are good. The fondue I tried the first time was good. The cheesecake was also decent. The steak however was a disappointment. The potato wedges were fried too much and tasted stale. 

They need to wake up fast and sort the issues.

Frankly, I am quite surprised at the low rating and the negative reviews here, because I have been to Pparazzi a couple of times and have really enjoyed my experience at this place. The restaurant is quite small, so I usually pack my food. The fondue, of course, is one item that I like to sit here and try. The food is sufficient in quantity, though the prices are a little bit on the higher side. My favourites:- 

(1) Charcoal Grilled Prawns
(2) Ppaparazzi Fondue
(3) Blueberry Cheesecake

I wish the restaurant is larger in size and the service was a little better. The food can sometimes be a little too spicy. Apart from that, I am quite satisfied with my meals at Ppaparazzi.

This is a very small bar situated in the heart of sector V, which I have visited quite a few times. The seating area is very limited and there is no specific decor as such. The service is okay. The alcohol is dirt cheap and the food is pretty good. This is one of the very few places in the city that serves fondue, and the fondue is quite nice. Apart from that, the barbecue prawn in peanut butter, and lamb roast are nice. The four cheese lasagna is bit sweet on the palette, however I personally liked it. Surprisingly chilli fries were soggy and was a huge let down. I would like to mention one incident. The first day I visited this place, one of the diners got drunk and was disturbing the peace of the place, the waiters efficiently handled the situation and made that person leave on immediate basis. This gave me the confidence to visit this place again

Chanced into this one as our group of friends were looking for a place for some drinks in the sector 5 area. Situated at a stone's throw from webel more, a flight of stairs beside the KFC takes you to a courtyard where this restaurant is located. they even have a f.l. off counter beside the joint.
Inspite of high ceilings the seating is a bit cramped. Ambient lighting is a bit in the lower side, suited for a pub.
First things first,the booze is reasonably priced, at least for a location as good as this.
But the accompaniments were not good. 
In fact even the French fries were quite disappointing. Add to it the fact that when we tried ordering it the second time they said it won't be available! How can French fries not be available! We also ordered some masala peanuts which was value for money at least.

Unfortunately I didn't know they make some fine foods, which I found out after I read the reviews by my foodie friends.
Surely I'll try the items suggested by them the next time I visit. Untill then I'm keeping the rating to a modest 3 only because of the value for money booze.

When i visited this place, it was quite empty and the staff were busy watching tv. Service is okay, also the food isn't really upto the mark. The grilled chicken barbq sauce is passable. Overall, not one i would much prefer to go.

We had lamb , chicken there, which was OK types. Don't let the lamb get cold, otherwise the power of your teeth will be tested.
Also hope the bartender makes the peg infront of customers.

Costly as hell - For the food quality, staff service and menu options, you are bound to feel the pocket pinch. 
The restuarent get up is all too empty (I didn't find any other adjective to describe it better). AC vents plasticky chairs and tables with a shabby bar counter all plays against this outlet. (Industrial built should have some kind of finesse). That's why most people resort to this place only when there are no other available option in that area. 

In the menu Grilled chicken Barb Q Chicken works well. Lamb steak is also a viable option for some. 

Other than those we also tried the Chicken Meifoon with Mandarin and Manchurian chicken. Pretty much main stream. 

All in all this place is not kind of any deal breaker or ground breaking venue ti venture at. Uf yiu have stayed away till now - you may continue to do so. (I feel for the management, but they really need to invest in this place to make it more favorable for its customers)

I was there on Sunday 21st February 2016. Ambiance was okay(as the sitting arrangement was ill-shaped), staffs were friendly and food serving time was very less.   

What we ordered? Lamb Steak and Roast Lamb with Mint Sauce.  
In drinks 2 X Haywards 5000 (650 ml) and 1X Carlsberg Premium(650 ml).
  
Now when we got the food, my main question to the waiter over there was which is what as both the items (Lamb Steak AND Roast Lamb with Mint Sauce) looked same and also tasted somewhat same. To be honest I was expecting a roasted lamb for Roast Lamb with Mint Sauce item, but that didn't happen. 

Speaking about the quality of the food, I would say its okay and as per me the lamb was not fresh and moreover the platter arrangement was similar. Again as mentioned above, both the item tasted almost  similar to my taste buds and if you are Lamb lover then you should go for anything but the the mentioned items. 
 
Attached are both the pics of the item which I ordered for this review

Speaking about Ambiance , I would say the place is very congested and they could work on it. 

Should I visit this place again? YES I would, may be for trying something new and hoping for better experience.

Visited this place on the 24th of December, 2015, prior to Christmas Day. We reached the place around 7PM, to avoid the late night rush. There was a light crowd at that time. 
*SEATING ARRANGEMENT*
You have both chairs and sofas to site upon here. The bar was dimly lit. There was some background music being played. But the place is not at all spacious and looked clumsy. The Washbasin and toilet door had turned to be a smoking zone, which was not at all a pleasant sight. The entire place had a seating capacity of maximum 40 people.
*FOOD*
Speaking of the food here, we had ordered Chilly Chicken and Tandoori Chicken. Apart from that there were breezers and other drinks, which were also ordered. What startled us is that the Tandoori Chicken had a gravy, which seemed to be the same gravy as that of the Chilly Chicken. That disappointed us and so did the taste.
*STAFF BEHAVIOUR*
The staff behaviour here is something that I did not appreciate at all. They werent attentive enough, and after we placed our orders, it wasnt served in the next half an hour also, inspite of the fact that there wasnt much rush at that time. Even after half an hour, when we inquired about our orders, the waiter simply brought it and served it on our table. This indicated that the dish was made well before but the staff wasnt mindful enough to serve them. This is an important factor which needs to be taken care of by the management.
I am unsure if this thing happened only on that day or is a typical affair at this restaurant. Definitely there is a lot of space for improvement.

Again as mentioned above, both the item tasted almost  similar to my taste buds and if you are Lamb lover then you should go for anything but the the mentioned items. 
 
Attached are both the pics of the item which I ordered for this review

Speaking about Ambiance , I would say the place is very congested and they could work on it. 

Should I visit this place again? YES I would, may be for trying something new and hoping for better experience.

Visited this place on the 24th of December, 2015, prior to Christmas Day. We reached the place around 7PM, to avoid the late night rush. There was a light crowd at that time. 
*SEATING ARRANGEMENT*
You have both chairs and sofas to site upon here. The bar was dimly lit. There was some background music being played. But the place is not at all spacious and looked clumsy. The Washbasin and toilet door had turned to be a smoking zone, which was not at all a pleasant sight. The entire place had a seating capacity of maximum 40 people.
*FOOD*
Speaking of the food here, we had ordered Chilly Chicken and Tandoori Chicken. Apart from that there were breezers and other drinks, which were also ordered. What startled us is that the Tandoori Chicken had a gravy, which seemed to be the same gravy as that of the Chilly Chicken. That disappointed us and so did the taste.
*STAFF BEHAVIOUR*
The staff behaviour here is something that I did not appreciate at all. They werent attentive enough, and after we placed our orders, it wasnt served in the next half an hour also, inspite of the fact that there wasnt much rush at that time. Even after half an hour, when we inquired about our orders, the waiter simply brought it and served it on our table. This indicated that the dish was made well before but the staff wasnt mindful enough to serve them. This is an important factor which needs to be taken care of by the management.
I am unsure if this thing happened only on that day or is a typical affair at this restaurant. Definitely there is a lot of space for improvement.

Apart from being congested the food was average. We ordered hout and sour, sweet corn, manchow soup, tikka kebab and pepper chicken as starter. Soups were fine, tikka kebab was average, pepper chicken was delicious. In the main course we ordered plain nun, garlic nun, butter nun, masala kulcha with chicken butter masala, murg ka mukul, chicken do piyaza. There was lack of butter in butter nun, but after complaining the buttered it. All three chicken dishes were some how similar in tastes as if they are made of same ingredients.We had to ask for water again and again. Moreover, the basin was running out of water, they made some jugaad to keep a jug of water near it for hand washing purpose. Even they don't serve finger bowl. Boozers started to smoke inside the restaurant and no staff made any objection. May not visit again.

Had been here twice in the past two years. A decent place for any casual dining. They serve seafood, continental, chinese and north indian. The continental and chinese food served here is quite good in taste. Service is good but they need to work on the interior decor and ambience.

Tried this for a small take away. Only took chicken biryani. Look and feel was good, it is a bar. Food was not up to the mark. Maybe a good place for drinks, for only food this is not so good. Interior decor was very good.
Since I am doing all sector V reviews I thought I should review this place.

We went there on the evening of 25th December, so its some time later that I'm writing this review. We went there for a casual Continental dinner and some drinks and the food was very good. The best part was the variety of liqueurs that they had in stock. Considering the date, it was a bit loud and boisterous in there with a large group creating some chaos. But then I guess, that was only adding to the Pub feel. Overall a really nice experience and I'm looking forward to visiting again.

I had to go to sector 5 for a work today and once that got done, I thought of having a drink at the most closest place nearby. Pparazzi it was, and withouth much thinking I just get in there..being a saturday afternoon, the place was completely empty. I took a sofa and tried to make myself comfortable. However to my utter disappointment, the seating arrangement  was too narrow and they have done a maximum utilization of the entire space...small place but huge number of tables and sofa..the stuffs were ok, I ordered for a shredded chicken preparation (Sang Dong chicken) and the delivery time was quick. They don't provide any complementary peanuts or "চানাচুর " everything is chargeable. But the most important highlight of this place is the cheapest rate of alcohol. Trust me, no where in kolkata you would get a 60 ml of Blenders pride in just 121 rupees  (inclusive tax). Also the food was, if not mouthgasmic, but good enough in taste and in terms of quantity as well. So overall, an okey experience and if you really wanna enjoy an evening without spending much, this is definitely one of the places to be.

Probably the place for Cheapest Alcohol in Sector 5 when combined with the ambience and service! This Small Cozy place in Globsyn Crystal is a perfect destination for a quick Alcoholic outing in the evening after a hard day's work. Food Quality can be improved but its still very good compared to the pocket pinch. Not much covers are available as its a very small outlet and free space is an issue.

Stepped in this outlet for lunch with few buddies during office time!! The restaurant was all vacant at peak lunch hours. The decor is not that hi-fi but we made ourselves comfortable.Coming to food,we ordered French Fries and chicken lollipop for starters both of which was well prepared. For main course we ordered a chicken sizzler and Chicken Cantonese noodles!!!! Even these 2 items were not bad to the palate!!! Those who doesn't like plain blatant taste of boiled veggies would not like the Cantonese noodles but I thoroughly enjoyed it!!! The expense was also within budget!! One can anytime sneak into this small restaurant for say lunch or dinner during office hours!!! But nothing big a boo for celebration!!

Tried Ppaparazzi Italian menu for the first time however the experience was not at all good. Except one dish all other dishes were a waste in terms of taste and flavour. Excessive usage of cheese has overlapped the original tastes leaving behind the liquid hot cheese. The outlet in itself it not too catchy either. The bill was not worth the food. Will not visit again. Lunch was a waste in terms of money and taste!

Well we like to try new restaurants and their food.so we came to this one and thought it would be a nicer place to have food.we order red chilli pepper chicken and chill potatoes, they served the plates which was very cheap look wise. And then they served the chicken and potatoes which we didn't even like. We found hair in our potatoes. And the whole place looks so dirty,the walls,the seats,cealing,silverware everything looked so dirty. We would never go there again..

October 1, naturally every pub has a queue. So paparazzi was the only place that was affordable and had a place for us. They had happy hours running and thus they offered a 20% discount on 6 whiskey pegs. Cool enough. We ordered a dry chili chicken and a red pepper chicken. They were decent in taste, nothing extraordinary. Decent place, congested, decent service.

On 15th of July 2015,I went to Paparazzi for lunch .. I have read lot about it from Zomato earlier,so I was very excited in my 1st visit....The Ambiance and Decor of this restaurant is nicely done,But the Sofas r very uncomfortable, AC doesn't properly circulate the air in such a big space, So some part of it remains quite Hot n Humid..
About Food, I wanted to try something Different in Continental food (House special) , I asked for some starters like Crab meetball , Mexican wings on Fire, middle eastern Meatball But unfortunately those things were unavailable.. I was asked to choose fish n chips , fish finger ,chicken satay.. which didn't amuse me...
So i finally ordered-

1. Prawn n corn Chowder Soup [ 2/5 ] -  Its not worth calling chowder at all. it is a worst version of cream of Prawn u can say.. which was flat ,tasteless.. I had to add a good amount of salt , pepper n tobasco sauce, just finish it. Portion of Prawn in the soup was Good.

2. Chicken Taipei (from Chinese section) [ 4/5 ] - Very Good quantity, Very Spicy n crispy chunks of chicken.. It balanced the experience of Tasteless soup..

3. Papparazi Special Pizza [ 4/5 ] -  Pizza crust was thick,quite similar to a Pita Bread.. Not like the normal thin or Thick Pizza crust ,that's why the crust was soft n could not fold its topping properly .. Amount of Cheese and Topping was pretty good, tasty as well.Just because of the Crust i couldn't rate it 5/5..It was bit different..

Most Important serving dishes were not up to the mark.. Sply  Soup Bowl, Spoons, Plates have stains in it..like what we get in Road side small food joints...

On a Saturday evening, when the heavy crowd of Sector 5 has kicked you out of all other places, this is a nice place to chill. It becomes highly stuffy by late evening - the seating is closely packed and they let you smoke in the passage way of the washroom. 
Food is okayish. nothing too great to be mentioned.

I went there on a Friday evening and it was packed totally. We had to wait for 40 mins just to get a plate of golden fried prawn. I was surprised seeing that the food was served in a plastic/ fiber plate (come on it's not a street side stall)  and on top of that plate was really dirty. Overall food tasted good and ambiance was okay except the fact that it was jam packed evening and this place has very little room to move around.

Very bad a place. I visited this place with my friend yesterday for lunch. But the place was totally disappointing. The staffs looked like local goons. And we had to wait for 30 mins for getting a starter. The food was ok. But pricing was excessive. After wasting 45 mins there we paid a bill of 382 for a single plate of fish fillet and left the place. We headed to Jaisalmer then. Guys, never ever visit this place.Very nasty ambience and pathetic service.

Been there twice. Once with friends after having some drinks in The Pride Hotel rajarhat which was a horrible experience. We had common Chinese items at that time at ppaparazi which felt kind of good in the taste buds. Next time I went with my wife to have full course dinner on a Sunday evening. Prices of drinks as well as food are very moderate. Service is a little poor with only two or three people. One should really try there continental dishes...wonderful..I don't want to compare with Mocambo but nothing less than that. Such good food in such a small unknown restaurant is rare. Really enjoyed there crab meat balls and grilled prawns. They had different offerss in drinks. I was given 20% discount on 3 pegs of antiquity blue and for the cocktail we ordered mojito (bacardi base) which had 1:1 offer. Nothing much to talk about the ambience. If anybody wants multi cuisine in a Sunday evening with less rush and cheap prices then definitely this is the place to be.

A small place situated inside Globsyn Crystals, this restaurant was in my wishlist for a long-time. Since I was short on time, decided to order for a Non-Veg Pizza and a Chicken Steak in Mushroom Sauce. I must mention here that that this restaurant offers 20% discount on total bill amount of Rs. 1000/- during the noon-time (1 PM  - 3 PM).

I reached the place in time but had a bit of difficulty in finding it. One needs to walk past the fountain all the way straight and this restaurant can then be found to your right. The first impression disappointed me thoroughly. The place was smelling of alcohol and immediately caused some kind of headache for me. The order was however ready and the waiter readily came with the bill.

Here, came my biggest shock. While the menu here mentions that the price mentioned in the menu is inclusive of VAT, I was literally shocked and taken back to see the excess charges. Upon inquiring, the waiter readily denied any such pricing scheme. Dejected and saddened, I walked out of the restaurant and made my way back home.

The Pizza was quite good when comparing to the standards maintained by Dominos and Pizza Hut. The quantity was good with plenty of toppings. However, the minced mutton was topped in excess and the cheese seemed to be of low quality. Sausages and Salami could be scarcely found. Absolutely no comparison with the pizzas served by Don Giovanis.

Coming to the steak, it contained two decent sized chicken pieces but were undercooked. They were smothered with mushroom sauce but did not appeared to actually have been cooked with the sauce which made the entire appeal and experience pretty low. The chicken pieces were accompanied by some potato wedges and veggies.

To sum it up, a decent place to have food along with alcohol but I wouldn't prefer going here just for the fun of having food.

I visited this place last week.
We ordered amritsari fish tikka for an appetizer. I did like the preparation as the fish had been cooked well and was soft.
For our main course we ordered two dishes namely, chicken cotton role and chicken cooked in mushroom sauce (which came with potato wedges). The chicken was overcooked and had a tinge of dryness in it. On the better side, i did like the creamy rice.
Ppaparazzi also need to work on their ambience and lights for now, as it was kind of too dimly lit.

I love visiting this place for their thin crust pizzas.
I have tried their margarita pizza and double crust chicken pizza.
Both were amazing! While the margarita pizza was more cheesy and tangy topped with a tomato slice, the double crust chicken pizza was both cheesy and spicy.
I also love their refreshing mocktails.
Planning my next visit soon :)

Went there during a weekday for lunch. Ordered 2 dishes for myself. 1. Mexican Fire Wings and 2. Mutton dish. Terribly disappointed with the mutton dish. There was hardly any mutton. Only bones covered with gravy. Spoilt my lunch mood for sure!! As for the wings, I swear there was nothing Mexican about it. It was more like Chinese sauce rubbed over deep fried wings.

It's a very small and comfortable place. Food service and quality of food is good. We have ordered butter naan, ra-ra-mutton, bhuna ghost and chicken butter masala with soft drinks ?. Place is not big but atmosphere is good and all kinds of drinks available.

If you want to give your taste buds a change, this is the best place to give it a shot. The menu is eclectic and serves salads, pasta, lasagna, lamb, roasted chicken and a variety of other cuisines normally not found elsewhere in Salt Lake at affordable price. 

Personally, I love the chicken lasagna that comes with a side of garlic bread. It is a sumptuous meal giving you no room for complaint whatsoever. 

The place is not too big but is still cosy and a cool place to try something new. 

The service is very nice and they accept sodexo coupons too. Overall, you will have a satisfied experience which your stomach will cherish.

Its a very comfortable restaurant.
Their lasgane and spaghetti is one of my usual orders.
Sadly they have increased their minimum order limit for home delivery from 500 to 1000 rs. So no Kore of that for me.

The tastes of the dishes are not very authentic but its definitely refreshing. Given all the Bengali outlets out on the streets.

Usual offers on cocktails is another reason which makes this place a go to from office.

Decent service.

And finally i went to Ppaparazzi on the New Years Eve with my husband and bro-in-law ! We wanted to hop in a new place and I knew that this restaurant wont be that crowded unlike the rest! Anyway, my first impression aftr entering the place was that it's a bit congested. Also, the music was too loud and the choice of songs were pathetic. The food, however, tasted quite good. I had ordered a Chicken Breast Steak which was real yum. The Sex on the beach cocktail wasnt good at all. Although, the Mojito tasted better. The French Fries were crispy and the Crispy Chilli Babycorn was above average ! To sum it all up, this place isnt that bad! One can surely try their steaks ! I would rate it 3/5 and hope that they do something about their interiors and music real soon.

I have been to this  restaurant many times for the last one month. The ambience was also good. The offer on the drinks was also good. But suddenly for the last 3 weeks every time the rate of the drinks goes up. When I told the staff  that why it's happening so they told me that every week the rates are  increased. This is absurd.  I really didn't liked this behaviour and now I have stopped going there.

Visited this place for lunch today with a group of friends. The menu was quite diverse. We ordered a wide range of dishes. Then trouble started. The roast lamb and lamb steak were exactly the same. The food arrived cold. Garlic bread was soggy and soft. The waiters looked confused when any complaints were made. They messed up our order too. Not one but five different wrong dishes were served. I had the lemon coriander soup which tasted good. Also had the roast lamb. It was decent. Would have been better if it was served hot. To sum it up, first and last visit!!

Paparazzi- a simple well laid small place for casual lunch or dining with the whole paparazzi set up on one side of the wall. This place must be be a frequent joint for those working in sec V. Hopped here for a quick lunch and came out satisfied with the main course. We had ordered the chicken steak with mashed potatoes and the mutton chops in sizzling style. I think the chicken steak outdid the mutton sizzler as the mashed potatoes were well done whereas in  the mutton sizzler they had boiled potatoes which were tasteless. The garlic bread that was served as sides were stale and dint stand up at all. However the mains were excellent and filling. Also i would like to add the mutton was really well done and did not have any roasted kind of a smell. People who are very finicky about their food can relate to what i am saying about the whole muttony smell that one comes across usually at such american diners.

Ambiance was good, sober and the staffs were polite but the service was a wee bit slow.  Also not a very fancy place so comparatively the rates were fine. 

The blueberry cheesecake--- I suggest avoid desserts in this place. The cheesecake was frozen and was disgusting. Cheesecake is the safest dessert i feel but this place makes you think otherwise. So if you intend to visit the place for drinks and food then you will come out with a happy tummy and face.

Mind you this place is not at all suitable for family...its small restaurant cum bar suitable for friends only.....coming to the food the expertise is in continental dishes....we had chicken in barbeque sauce and Shepherds pie....chicken dish was good but shepherds pie was awful ( actually it was not a pie at all...they put some kind of white  cover over a mutton mince gravy)....their prices on the menu are inclusive of taxes which is OK but ambience and quality of food should be better considering the prices...I would recommend this place for their variety in continental dishes

To be honest, the small restaurant, accompanied with a bar, packs a powerful meal. The food is great, not something I was expecting. The service too is warm and efficient.When i first ate here, and I've eaten here twice, the thing that stood out for me was the Lamb, and the starter fries. I rarely have eaten fries that good, perhaps I was really hungry, I can't be sure.
The real hero of this restaurant is the low expectancy coupled with the high delivery. The food cannot be argued with and the meal is hearty. No two ways to say it, it's just as good as any other restaurant, without the perks of heavily designed interiors.

Have a go at it, you will not be disappointed.
Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

Horrible place. Never never go there if u can help it. We had 12 gift vouchers each for Rs.250 for the place given to us by The Telegraph. We went there to redeem them on a Friday evening. Right at start we told them that we wanted separate bills for each person so that we could redeem our vouchers since only one voucher could be redeemed against one bill. We requested them very nicely to please help us since it was the last date of redemption and we had come a long way specifically for this purpose. Immediately their manner changed. They said that: 

a) We should have come before 3 pm

b) We should not have come on Friday evening

c) We should not have come in group. 

d) They cannot honor more than one voucher

e) Since we are requesting, they can pack some food worth 2 vouchers

None of these conditions were mentioned on the vouchers except the last date for redemption and one voucher redemption for one bill. On our insistence, the manager came to speak to us. He was too eager to send us on our way. He refused to give his name since we said we would quote him on his refusal to honor our vouchers on flimsy grounds. We told him to give us in writing all his reasons, that too was refused. We offered to go out, come in one by one, and sit at different tables. Still he refused. One lady was clicking pictures of the place, and the manager grabbed her hand and tried to take away her mobile, saying that taking pics is not allowed. 

Finally, we tried a compromise that out of 12, just 6 should be honored and we were ready to settle for packed food as our kids were very tired and hungry. That too they refused. Since it is also a bar, 6 ladies with 6 kids would perhaps eat into their liquor profits on a Friday evening if we sat down for a meal.

They stuck to 2 vouchers, no matter what we said. As if they were handing out charity to beggars!! We have gone out to many restaurants together but have never faced such rude behaviour anywhere. It wasn't any money out of their pocket. They obviously care nothing for building any goodwill, neither do they have any thought for building a better business. Don't go there folks!!

Visited this place a few months back for a friends' birthday. It's tucked away in a corner of the huge building but once there it's hard to miss. The place is small and does not serve too many covers. We ordered for some food and drinks. I didn't have the drinks but the boys were happy with what they were served so I'm sure it must be good. The quantity of the food was on the lesser side according to me but it tasted good. Service was prompt and quick. Overall a good experience.

Yesterday I.e 28th October 2014 in the evening at 8 pm a very bad experience was gained from Papraazi restaurant. I was informed by the restaurant manager that no item is available for parcel of food items except Chicken Butter Masala. Further I was also forced to purchase a Kinley Water of 1 litre. All these treatment was meted because I was carrying a coupon voucher of Telegraph worth Rs 250.  Chicken Butter Masala costs rS 219 . I wanted to Purchase  Murg Kali Mirch . But was denied on the ground that I was carrying Voucher . On requesting the complaint log book I was also denied by the manager. stating that any complaint could be lodged at Telegraph Newspaper. This complaint could be substantiated by me and also another consumer of my locality who was also meted the same treatment.The restaurant may check the billing details at 8 pm with One Chicken Butter Masala and 1 liter Kinley water for  authenticity . Alternatively i may be requested to send through e mail the bill copy. from  i hope to get a favourable response from the restaurant management

Ppaparazzi is in the globsyn building in Sector 5, webel more. We ordered all full course items: roast lamb with mint sauce, Prawn parmesan, and grilled chicken in barbeque sauce. All the items were pretty much decent, and filling. Not the best i have had, but definitely worth trying out. I find the quantity a bit less, compared to the price. I have had better at cheaper price, and I would expect the same here because it is not a very fancy restaurant or belonging to a known group of restaurants.
Cost for 2 in my case- 1000 approx.

The place is a small cozy place.
Preety lighted up.
We ordered a pepper chicken for starters which was very tasty. For main course we had mixed haka chow and bell pepper chicken. And we had two Tuborg strong. Overall the food quality was excellent.
Price for two with alcohol :1000
Price for two without alcohol : 600 
Had the ambience been a bit better, it would surely get a 5.

This Bar-cum-Restaurant is located in Sector V (Salt Lake; near Webel). It has a very simple decor and has nothing that justifies the name - Ppaparazzi, except that the word is pasted on a huge Wall-Paper just as you enter the restaurant. The Bar scene ain't that much and the restaurant is big enough for 40-50 people. However, coming to the food - it was delicious! Had ordered Continental (Grilled Chicken in Barbeque Sauce & Chicken Breast in Mustard sauce) and the flavor was perfect. The portions were good too and could put lot of renowned city (continental) restaurants to shame! Pricing is okay compared to the food quantity & quality and there are daily 'deals' on Drinks! Would definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu.

As far as the theme of the place is concerned; I think its a good job done. The big poster showing all those cameras flashing towards you helps you exaggerate yourself :P . The bar is nicely decorated. Otherwise its a simple decor. Service is not bad. Food is good. Especially you must try the pizza. Believe me, Pizza Hut and Dominos dont even come close. Slightly overpriced but quality and hygience was satisfactory. Its a good joint for once-in-a-while office time lunch.

To address our craving for continental menu to thought to hit Ppaparazzi on Saptami evening. Initially it was difficult to locate the hotel as there was no glow signboard outside.We had our table reserved but found that the table was not ready at all. The place is very smaller than it looks in the picture.We ordered Pepper Chicken Steak, Chicken Lasagna, Chicken Breast with Mushroom Sauce, Grill Bhetki with Lemon Sauce and Fish Cilantro. We inquired for Chocolate Fondue but same was not available.

Couldn't find any difference in taste between Grill Bhetki and Fish Cilantro.

Chicken Lasagna has good quantity for 2 adults. Every dish tasted amazing and must not be missed.

This is majorly turns into bar in the evening with crowd ranges from college students to office goers. If you are there with family will feel uncomfortable as you may hear swearing and foul language from other tables.

I found servers are very lazy and confused. Had approached me 3 times for checking my order as they noted down wrong dish. Even after that they got one of the dishes wrong. 

They have a smoking zone in the restaurant near washbasin. As he restaurant is small people will feel smoking zone next to their table. In fact we found the next table guys were smoking at the table itself. 

Food wise great place but ambiance, service, setup and environment lets it down.

Price was affordable, bill for 5 adults came INR 1692 with taxes.

I got a voucher from Zomato and decided to head over to this place before it expired. Ordered the nachos, corn cheese balls and mojito between the two of us... They have a 1:1 deal on mojito and a few other drinks for a reasonable price so thought that was a good deal. The nachos were weird.... Not bad mind you... Just weird because everything came separate.. The beans tasted like spicy baked beans and the cheese sauce was decent. We really liked the cheese balls which came with a sour cream dip. The cheese was stringy and nice... Definitely a thumbs up.

We were actually quite full after these starters so we weren't keen on ordering more food. However these guys came along and told us that we HAD to order something else.

We were flabbergasted. Although we knew our food bill was less than the voucher we were okay with foregoing the rest of it... Just make a bill for the drinks separate. But the servers were adamant and insisted on us ordering something else with the balance amount. We argued for sometime... Then I decided to pack a fried rice. Very weird.. They made a decent fried rice though... As per my sister who ate it. But this attitude was not expected.

I think the owners of this joint got a bit confused while making this place. Did they try to make it a fusion joint or something?? As you enter the Red Zone ( Yes the lighting is red all over the place) you get to see a huge poster in black which has Tollywood written on it. I found this ridiculous and out of place as it made no sense to me. Maybe i am not as intellectual as the desugner of this place. The food is horrible and the pricing adds to the ordeal. We tried some chicken finger dish ( I dont even remember the name)... it was a total thumbs down. The pepper chicken was equally bad as the pieces were small and the corn flour content was more in it. We were not bold enough to try any other dish after all this. They provide Chanachur and 'boiled and spiced up chole as chakhna which is the only saving grace if you want to drink. There is nothing that is appealing about this place... The music cannot be heard properly (either their system is bad or my ears need to be checked). Overall a bad experience.

Went there on a rainy afternoon for lunch with my sister and boy friend during the time of eid. The place is small. The decor is not attractive though they tried to be funny! The waiters are always happy to help. The complete glass walls made us feel us nice as it was raining torrentially! 
Food: Wanted to try out their Fondue but was only available in veg :( Ordered Roast Lamb with Mint sauce. Grilled Bhetki with Lemon butter sauce and Eid Special haleem with Paratha. The portions were limited to strictly one person! One spoon off anyone's platter and the person will remain hungry! That was a major turndown! Other than that, the lamb tasted good!! The bhetki tasted more like basa without much flavor of its own but the lemon butter sauce made it tasty nonetheless. The haleem was okay , had better elsewhere! and the paratha was hot but a bit chewy.
The prices seemed a bit more. Will visit again but for continental spreads only.

To end my weekend with some cheesy continental dinner I went to this place with my two great buddies...located in the  isolated end of a non functional monstrous office building this place apparently looks like a good pub from the outside...well tge owner definitely had the intention of putting up a pub but the ambience fails miserably to match the pub quotient.  The lights are too dim to even read through the menu card and the ac doesnt seem to  cool you down even when you haven't boozed...thus the two most important criterion of perfecting the pub factor goes thumbs down.
Coming to the food, I took a Portuguese style fish and chicken cottin role.
Both tge dishes were continental and tasted really good barring a few thumbs down factors again...
The oriental rice served with both the platters weren't properly butter tossed...the veges werent sufficient and most importantly the price wasnt at par with the quantity n ambience..699 for two dishes..a bit too much. 
Anyway I must say that quality was great and its definitely worth trying. I would definitely go back to ppaparazzi to explore the other dishes !!

went with a friend. first point to note- though it hints at being a pub, it doesn't have a very lively ambiance. the lighting is insufficient too, in some corners. we ordered a pizza, that turned out to be better than what we were expecting. the topping was good, but the base was way too hard. might just go back again to try other stuff on the menu.

The food they sent me was not as per the menu. This is the first time in my life that Grilled chicken that they sent was actually chicken chops, two pieces in a plate. And lamb chops were just 4 pieces of chest bones. Really horrible & waste of money.

Situated in the Globsyn Building I visited Ppaparazzi during lunch one of the days. Ambience is ok, could have had more space, The food was good. We had pizzas along with a few starters and drinks. The only issue I found was that the service was slow and manpower less. Being in an office area I feel they should be more ready for crowds during lunch which they didnt seem to be. Price is also a little high so if u r around and want to have quick bite then chose other options in the building

I had been twice at this place in the recent times. Situated at the heart of Saltlake Electronics Complex, couple of minutes away from our office at Sector-5. Though the streets there are a bit crowded during the lunch hours but still you can manage to get a parking, no issues. For all the continental food lovers at Sector-5 this is the place to be. According to me, this is the best place to have continental dishes in Saltlake. In both these visits our consolidated order consisted of Chicken Spaghetti Bolognaise, Fish Cilantro, Prawns Newburg, Roast Lamb with Mint Sauce. During our first visit one of my friends ordered for Indian dishes including Chicken Biriyani, etc, I just tasted a bit of it and felt their Indian preparations were very average unlike their Continental dishes some of which can simply blow you away. My personal favorite is Fish Cilantro, if you are there do not miss it. Next coming to the decor, it is nice, can be better and more cozy. The service is bit slow I felt, though I would say if you have ordered for continental then that is worth the wait. My suggestion would be to restructure and organize their Menu Chart which is very confusing at times (to me) even today. But apart from that, there are few things really which are out of place, and the food is definitely not in that list. Go out and try continental at Ppaparazzi. Cheers!

It was a pleasant surprise to find a place like Ppaparazzi in the Globsyn Building area! It's an extremely small outlet but the ambience and decor were to my liking. The food was better than average, and the service equally good. I am guessing that it would be a even better place in the evening with its classy lighting. The lasagna was just too good, but the quantity is just too much for even two people. Definitely a place that I would strongly recommend, and would like to come back as well.

LOCATION : Globsyn crystal area in sector 5 ,which is beautiful (with beautiful ,apart from the ever crowded kfc within the premises.The premises also includes the globsyn business school campus.
AMBIENCE: Ppaparazzi is a themed based restaurant,the theme being,youre the star, and paparazzi is drooling over you and clicking your pics.The idea is to make you feel like a star.A  red carpet also waits to welcome you .The idea is good but the execution falls short , coz apart from the a big wallpaper depicting a paparazzi frenzy and  a few pics of calcutta landmarks,there isnt anything  worth mentioning.The place though not big can host a number of people. 
FOOD: Italian,chinese and indian comprise the big menu.I have tasted italian as well as chinese here in my 3 visits to this place.
=> For italian i have had the four cheese lasagne which was excellent from presentation to taste,ratatouille which was good and a salad.The desserts here are limited and i have tried their caramel custard and it was good(could have been better)
=> For chinese i have had the veg cantonese styled noodles, and i have to admit i visited this place the third time only for this!I have never tasted a cantonese styled noodles so divine.It was lovely!This i had with cottage cheese in shanghai sauce and it was very good. THe broccoli mushroom soup was tasty.
SERVICE: The staff is very hospitable and the young owner is mostly present in the restaurant! 

PRICE: The food is priced pretty decent. 

PROS:Good food, good prices, great service.
CONS:Could work more to make the theme more engaging,location is a disadvantage.

Visited this place quite a few times and had mixed experience. Had Grilled Prawn sizzler, spaghetti with meatballs and blueberry cheesecake. Under-cooked prawns in the Grilled Prawn sizzler was a huge letdown. The cheesecake was good though. Ambiance is okay and the restaurant usually remains empty during lunchtime.

Food quality - 2.5/5

First time and is the last time

My office is in Globsyn building and if they could have got good quality food I would have been regular but alas, I expected  lot about Paparazzi.....

Presentation and very prompt service.....
But .....the quality of food is utterly disappointing
 
Grilled pomfret was not even aldente it has serious issues of tension within the flesh...
and tandoori murg was ok
however in drum of heaven one of the chicken drumsticks there was blood.... it happened last week and.... remembering it was horrible  I am not going again

in other restaurants of in chicken steak you can find blood in the bone when roasted but in drums of heaven? I have informed my colleagues and they swear not to go there....
Horrible experience.

I would like to start off saying I was disappointed here. Not because the food sucked, but because the menu raised my hopes so sky high that I badly wanted this place to be my lifelong food oasis, not withstanding the shambolic look of the place which hardly makes u feel like a celebrity. The prices are outright high for the food quality and there is no genuineness in the food taste. We took egg fried rice which tasted like road side food minus the salt, pan fried chilly fish which was delivered with loads of gravy which I had specifically instructed not to provide, a chicken lasagna which made a good effort to be good but failed and a cheese fondue which tasted so "go cheese" with only a few crumbs of bread and potato fried in stinky oil. I guess the place is run by some foreigners, its my request to them if they have done so much to set this place up and design a menu one would like to lick page by page, please make the food live up to the expectations.

Absolutely awesome. As everyone says, if you ever go to this place don't miss the chance to please your taste bud with Fondue. You just can't ignore the Grilled Bhetki if you are one of the fish lovers. Loved the ambience and the food. Management is good. Nice place to have a office party and all. But I believe the place is small to have big parties. hardly 30 people can accommodate at once. But from the food POV, it's amazing.

A friend was giving his birthday treat and wanted us to choose an 'unexplored' place. That's how we went for a Sunday dinner at Ppaparazzi. Being a sunday the location was deserted but transportation was not a bother. We had opted for Italian food. I loved the prawn starters n also the satay chicken with peanut butter. Blueberry cheesecake was delicious. Ambience seemed fine for hanging out with friends. But we felt the staff was not efficient enough.

Go for Italian fare and fondue,not the buffet. I haven't tried the buffet but all the bad things written here are about it,so avoid,like i did! You'll fall in love with the fondue here,trust me. Their service is not that sloppy as the reviewers here have written.
Ambience 8/10
Though the restaurant is small,it's lovely with a nice corner couch and an entire wall printed. Not an exceptionally good ambience.
Food Presentation 9/10
It's pretty nice. I liked their fondue sets which have separate long forks placed on the body. They served chicken lollipops with salads decorated on one side of the square plate. O yes ignore the melamine crockery. The lasagne was served on a hot portion.
Food Quality 10/10
The fondue is to die for. The liquid cheese with different types of stir fried vegetables,potato wedges and croutons is no less than a treat to the taste buds. The lasagne has four distinct cheese types and thank god for the chicken in it!
Food Quantity 9/10
It's based on the a la carte. The fondue can fill two big tummies. The lasagne portion is more than sufficient for one person.
Cost effectiveness 9/10
The fondue is meant to be expensive,but the price here is the lowest among the places I've been to. Rest of the dishes are reasonably priced.
Overall 45/50

Heard a lot about this and today decided to have a look around for this Italian cum Chinese cum Indian restaurant and as I  read earlier from Zomato, I did not take the chance to go in the day time to experience what feel this place is giving, Honestly speaking, I really did not find any kind of zeal or the feel of walking as an star, rather, it made me feel like I am entering to a nightclub or pub for a peg of whisky. Anyway I knew the place is very small but still expected that a bar cum restaurant would not be focusing only at its drink and not on the foods. I found people were just coming here for drinks, may be Management could easily denied the fact and come up with an excuse of the day being Saturday, but that really does not make my point unrealistic. Whatever it is,When you go with a family and you do not prefer drinking, you will obviously prefer a place which will be having a segregation between the bar and restaurant, but the thing made me very uncomfortable is the way the restaurant is allowing the smoking inside the premises itself, and I restricted me and my wife from going towards the washroom as the place was occupied by a group of drinkers who were having smoke party in between their pegs. This is too offensive.

Anyway,coming to the part of the food, we ordered :
Lemon Coriander Soup(which I found too sourly than required )and Crispy Mustard roasted chicken (which was no doubt a new taste to me and was good). We had one Papparazzi Salute and one Frozen Litchi from mock-tails although the decoration and the taste was very interesting for both, but the content was so less that they will fill the glass mostly with the ice. in the main course we had Spaghetti and Fettucine twist with Chicken and Grilled Chicken Bar B Q sauce(where I believe both are taste wise good but economy wise not worthy enough) and the meal we finished with a Blueberry Cheese cake( which a piece was costing around Rs 179 + vat and to me that is just robbery)

hence as per me,with such small place of seating and ambience wise stuffy restaurant even though, delivering taste wise good quality food, quantity and atmosphere wise it seemed to me a bit over rated when there are such good restaurants around it like Flame and Grill, Barbeque Nation etc

I and my friends have been quite regular to Ppaparazzi over the last few months simply for the food and the polite and smiling behavior of the staffs. The price is also very reasonable. I have had one of the finest Chicken Tandoori over there, The kebabs are also very nice. They have a lot of options from the continental section also. I would highly recommend this place to everyone... :-)

It's the in gratuitous behaviour of the staff that will simply piss u of out of your brains ... So cold blooded that they don't even bother to attend you ... It looks like a haunted place that will freeze your nerves ... The food is a complete drain ..every penny spent is just a waste , they don't even have the expertise of preparing a fresh lime soda... Simply downmarket and cheap!!!

Tucked away in Globsyn Building, this new place is a small outlet with a cosy feel. The staff is very eager to please and are always attentive. However, the food is nothing to write home about. We ordered a chicken mushroom soup, mexican wings and lamb steak. The soup was bland, almost like plain stock, with bland boiled pieces of chicken. The mexican wings were good, with a smoky BBQ sauce. The steak was then a  surprise to us as it too was doused with a similar sauce, and while the accompaniments were broiled veggies, french fries (thick and burnt) and garlic bread, the sauce was a mix between a chinese garlic chicken and BBQ!!! Am really not going back I guess, inspite of the rock- bottom prices and the nice staff. A pity since I liked teh cozy setting and music too :(

as soon as we entered the restaurant ends the momnt you step in and take a few steps inside.
i really did not undrstnd the theme and decoration.clumpsy and very christmasy theme.
we wer in a hurry so ordered chiken drumsticks (tasty),
pan fried chilli fish (yummm), chikn fried rice (ok types, lacked in flavour) , chilli prawns gravy (prawns were rubbery but gravy tasted nice).
i had read reviews of ppaparazzi here thats y wanted to give it a go but i can only score them 3 outa 5 for service as well as food.
there is room for renovation in food and interiors.

I have heard good things about this place, and when a friend suggested a lunch get together there was a prompt yes for this restaurant.
This was a first visit to the restaurant and though I was impressed with the menu, the food was not so impressive
we ordered 
--- Chilli Crispy Chicken Balls: It seemed like a new variant of my favourite chilly chicken, but alas it didn't taste so well

For the main course 3 of us ordered 3 different things but the outcome was same - a disappointment

--- Mexican chicken sizzler: The chicken cutlet was more of a aloo tikki cutlet with some shreds of chicken in it. Also the sauce was too less and the sauteed veggies weren't up to the mark. The rice was okayish.
--- Grilled Tiger Prawns with lemon butter sauce: The grilled prawns weren't cooked too well. The portion of mashed potatoes made was so large that it could have easily been the main element of the dish. Sauce was too watery for my taste.
--- Prawn Paremsan: Gravy was nice, but the prawns weren't cooked well. 

All in all the exciting continental menu gave way to a very pseudo-continental lunch.
Though the service was slow the staff was polite and smiling. the location and the decor were good as well.

May be next time it will be better.....

First of all its not a restaurant it's like all those filthy bars. Restaurant is so small that it can be called world's smallest restaurant.  My living room is bigger than that.
I and my colleagues went there for buffet lunch. Starters were served like the way prasad is distributed in temple; one piece chicken, one piece prawn. If you ask for more than one piece waiter will reply "sir can't serve more than one piece at a time".
Service is absolutely horrendous.
Quality of food is average at best.
We were so frustrated with the service that we had to leave the restaurant after having starters and complete our lunch elsewhere.

Went to this place on 31st Dec. Made a prior booking because of the special day.On arrival we were greeted by the gate keeper and saw a table was booked, but sadly not the one I have asked for. That was disappointing. Yet the service was very good and the waiter were very courteous. 
Price is reasonable. Special mention should be made of the Shrimp Manchurian. It's really good.
Drinks are also reasonably priced.
Ambiance was pretty good too.
They made a mistake in the bill but on pointing that out it was resolved without any further problems.

Having heard quite a lot about this place and also having seen the advertisement of this place on the Zomato Kolkata homepage,I was expecting something quite special when I finally managed to visit this place today.But I was surprised to find the place to be actually quite small.Though the Globsyn crystals building at Salt lake Sector 5 that houses this restaurant is very impressive,the restaurant itself is quite simple and nothing exceptional.There is this one big poster of numerous photographers clicking their cameras attached to one of the walls which gives this place its theme and feel.

As I mentioned the place is quite small and looks more like a cafe than a restaurant.But its nice and clean.The seating arrangements are decent.The isolated red couch in the corner looked kinda odd.The choice of the music playing in the background was quite good.When we were about to leave the place around 5.30,the lights were beginning to take effect and I must say the lights give an added dimension to the place.

Coming to the food,this place offers so many different types of cuisines ranging from Indian to Chinese to Italian to Sea food to Sizzlers and pizzas that we found it hard to select what we actually wanted to have.The menu card I feel needs improvement in the sense that I found it to be a bit disorganised and we found it difficult navigating through it.The drinks menu is quite good though.The two of us finally ordered a Spagetti with meat balls and a pan fried stuffed squid.For drinks we chose a Sex on the Beach and a Gimlet.

The food was really good both in terms of quality and quantity.The Spagetti with meat balls was very flavourful and almost perfect.The size of the meat balls were very generous.The pan fried stuffed squid was also excellent.The consistency of the squid was nice.Though we were a little disappointed to find the stuffing to be rice based but actually it went really well with the flavourful and spicy sauce.Another thing that I really liked was that both the items came with a couple of slices of garlic bread.Both our cocktails were also very well prepared.Overall we were really satisfied with the food.

The pricing is very very good.Our overall bill was around Rs1050.They also run happy hours from 6pm which would surely be a great option for people who are interested.The service is quite swift.The waiters are quite well behaved and helpful.But the one thing I did not quite like was that they should serve all the items together unlike one after the other which they actually did.I had almost half finished my spagetti with meat balls when my friends pan fried stuffed squid arrived.

In short this is a small and simple theme restaurant which offers quality food and drinks at a reasonable price and at a prime location.This place though not exceptional has something to offer for everybody.A nice concept and a place surely worth a try.

I remember going to this place a year ago from now, and coming back without ordering a dish, as the behavior was more like, We have just opened up for Time Pass, and have no interest in selling foods.
But few days back I met a friend in a lift while I was leaving for lunch and he strongly recommended to give Papparazzi a try and so I did, and I was surprised by the change.
So here is what I feel now about Papparazzi:
Food : 4/5
Ambience: 4/5 (When comparing to the restraunts of the same level)
Service: 5/5 (Keeping in mind the behavior of the care takers).
Hygiene: 5/5

I visited Papparazzi seeing the reviews from zomato.I didnt like it much.I opted for lamb starter,which was quite costly and the taste and amount served was not worthy of it,I doubt whether it was really lamb.
The food is quite costly,amount is less and not tasty enough.


One time go..... sorry :(

Three of us made an impromptu plan to give this buzz of a place a try this Friday. The place is a bit cramped and decor a bit outlandish, which may not be palatable to everyone. There was no booze available as it was a dry day but they do have some attractive offers, including happy hours in the evening. We started off with veg tempura and English style fish and chips. The tempura was good but the fish was shockingly stale and borderline rancid. We should have taken the cue and not have ordered the Portuguese fish steak(comes with cauliflower and rice) which corroborated the fact if fish is what you crave, this is not the place to be. We also had two more steaks, grilled chicken in BBQ sauce(with mashed potato, bread and peas) and chicken breasts in mushroom sauce(with potato wedges, vegetables). Though the stakes were of good portion and quite savory, the meat was not really toothsome. The service is quick enough and the staff are courteous. For those who prefer smoking, there is no separate smoking room but they shocked us with their cordiality by allowing us to smoke in the kitchen.

A pretty funny looking place is what I recollect from my visit here last evening. The globsyn building looks impressive and given the kind of prime location and space, ppaparazzi interiors could have been much better! Nevertheless it is clean and full of positive vibes.
Our order comprised lamb hungarian goulash soup, spicy prawn for starters, seafood pasta and roast lamb in mint sauce for maincourse, and a blueberry cheesecake for dessert. We desperately wanted to try the date pancakes but the waiter advised against it because it would be time consuming. On interrogating, he kind of negated that order and pushed us towards the cheesecake. I am sure he had his reasons and saying that, the pancake is on my next visit list.
The soup and starters were impeccable. In true sense of the term appetisers, appetising it was! However, I expected the maincourse to be better. The seafood pasta tasted nice but was extremely ordinary. A seafood pasta is always an exotic dish in my mind and I have tasted brilliant ones. Comparatively, there was nothing great about it. Yet my friend has raved about their four cheese lasagne, thick, meaty, delicious and sumptuous. This is therefore on my list still. The roast lamb was extremely simple, light and succulent. The mint flavour was not overpowering yet owed a certain texture to the lamb roast which went down the foodpipe smoothly.
P.S.- The lamb is not exactly lamb but what we know as mutton. In Kolkata, most places pass off mutton as lamb, so I wasn't surprised, but would like to bring it to notice.
The blueberry cheese cake was NICE. REALLY NICE! 
About prices, the place is priced well. With a soup, starter, two maincourses, a dessert and two fresh lime sodas, we paid INR 1342.

A reasonably good experience in my opinion. The pricing is spot on. Food is pretty good from an overall perspective, just a few things which do need attention. I was not too bowled over by the decor of the place. Maybe that is how it was envisaged, but did not grab me. The sofas/cushy seats in the corner are slightly weird. They dont allow you to sit and eat on the table while providing any back support. The lighting did throw me off a bit though.

Coming to the food, we ordered the fish fingers served with tartar sauce. A pretty standard fare and there were no mistakes whatsoever. Really good. I really have to put up a mention for the mutton lasagna. It was excellent. Really robust flavours and very textural in the mouth. I loved it and I could go back for it again. The spaghetti with meatballs was decent. Had mixed opinion on our table. I liked the meatballs. Had a very sausage-like feel to them. Had a wonderful heat to it. My friend did not like the fact that the spaghetti was so scrunched up together. Personally, I did not have any complaints with it. The pizza was good flavour-wise again. 

Ppaparazzi ticked most of the flavour boxes throughout the meal. We took a salami and seafood thick crust pizza. Wasn't sure we actually got served a thick crust pizza though. I did not like the pizza base. Not sure how exactly I would put it. Wasn't exactly chewy, neither was it hard, just did not yield properly in the mouth. Lacked something I cant quite point at. We took the chocolate fondue. Slightly disappointed with the fact that we weren't served marshmallows as was specified in the menu. Again, it tasted good, but was just too runny for the fondue to be really enjoyed. The peanut butter was a real nice touch. Not sure that giving pineapples and apples to be had with chocolate is a great idea. The brownies did compliment the fondue though.

The waiters took reasonable care of us. Not too obtrusive. A tad difficult to converse with them though. The tables during service could be looked after better in terms of cleanliness though. They dropped this good plop of spaghetti on the table, but did not clean up until we left. Small things, but they can seem annoying at times. Barring all this criticism, I did quite enjoy the food and will be back. Would like certain things to hopefully be better the next time round.

I have read some good reviews of this place and thus decided to pay a visit with my family. To begin with the place and surrounding areas are very romantic... This is a prospective romantic dinner hangout for quite a few young couples... Globsyn crystals has nice fountains and shimmering blue water bodies in front thus adding a very pleasant appeal to the complex in general. 

Coming to the restaurant... I still don't know why this is called Ppaparazzi in the first place. The place is simple not too fancy looking in fact very normal. i would have given a 4 star rating but the thing that put me off was that as we were entering the restaurant we were welcomed by a garbage drum exiting the restaurant's main main entrance .

Coming to the food .... our order was as follows 

Cripsy chili baby corn : Thank God .... we finally found a place that makes crispy chili baby-corn that stays crisp till the last bite, and does not taste of ketchup.

Red Pepper Prawns: Perfectly cooked prawns, tad bit over salty but very tasty none the less 

Thin Crust Pizza : was not a disappointment but nothing worth praising .... The pizza was not hot.... and the base was very chewey . good sauce .. 

Paneer Shashlik sizzler:  was brilliant super soft paneer and excellent taste .... served with fries and vegetables and garlic bread. Special mention for the garlic bread. It  was very nice 

The Pepper Chicken Steak Sizzler:  Slightly over cooked but the sauce was nice and tasted good  ... Generous portions 

The disappointment was the menu had do desserts but ice cream .... the steward offered us gulab jamun but we refused . 

all this with 3 sodas and 2 red bulls ... was 1880/-  For the portions they give.. SPOT ON ! 

Its a value for money place and I am sure to visit again. The Chinese and continental is surely worth a  shot. 

 The Staff was very warm and very attentive ,,,

Rating finally :

The worst restaurant I have ever visited. The food quality was very very poor. Total waste of money. Main course was a total mess with chicken,prawn,rice and noodles. The waiters served the food after 45minutes we ordered. As dessert we ordered Thandai which was just a rubish. I won't reccomend anybody to go to this restaurant.

Probably the worst restraunt in Sector 5 among the ones I have went to so far. First of all, the restraunt is overprised. Our misiries started as soon as we entered the restraunt. The waiter serving us almost drenched us with water. Yes, he spilled one of the glasses of water, and we were all wet. Our order took 40 minutes to be delivered, which is a bit too high, considering that we were the only customers out there. The biryani we ordered lacked any taste at all. It infact didnt even taste like biryani. Upon inquiry, they said that their taste is a bit dirfferent.

Thank you Zomato for the recognition and the coupon that made me find another restaurant that serves excellent Italian/continental food , yes I am talking about "Ppaparazzi" in Globsyn Crystals , Sec V  Salt lake,Kolkata. Ambiance just as perfect for a corporate lunch or a family dinner , rather pleasant decor just what is needed for a restaurant.I went with my wife to this restaurant for a weekend dinner.

Coming to the menu part , I would say the waiters are courteous and they do tell you about the recipe as I was planning to order the continental/italian food in the menu .Though they do serve Indian/Chinese food as well.

Coming to what I ordered :
Starters: Cream of Chicken Mushroom Soup and Satay Chicken with Peanut butter(Delicious and appetizing)
Main Course : 4 Cheese Lasagne Chicken & Grilled Chicken Bar-B-que Sauce 

Lasagna is a form of pasta which is usually prepared with layered pasta with layers of variations of ground meat, miscellaneous vegetables, mozzarella cheese flavored with oregano, pepper, garlic etc and than oven-baked.Chicken satay is	a Thai dish with strips of chicken skewered and grilled than served with hot peanut butter/sauce decored nicely.Its delicious and a must relish treat for foodies.Grilled chicken in barbecue sauce is boneless chicken breast grilled with barbecue sauce and served with green peas and mashed potato .

I must recommend this restaurant to people who love to experiment ,like continental food and  love the garnishing style moreover enjoy good food. Cheers

I heard about this restaurant many a times and finally one rainy afternoon I decided to visit this place. Its suitably located beside the pool of the globsyn building. I was expecting a huge restaurant but this is a petite cosy one . We were very nicely greeted by the restau staff and they offered us to make our own choice of the table. Inspite of its bantum size it was very well decorated , a wall was postered with multiple cameras shooting at the guests. what I didn't understand why is it named and themed of paparazzis. Anyway I really liked the decor. I was with my friends and we wanted to have a full time meal. So we went through the multicuisined menu chart and chose to have italian dishes. We ordered
1. Rrisotto with Chicken
2. Four Cheese Lasagna
3. Spagetti with Meat Balls
4. Chicken Fettuccine with Paparika Sauce
5. Grilled Chicken with Barbeque Sauce.

The waiter was a very good guide and took all the trouble to describe the dishes. The food was served in minimum time possible but what I did not like was that they served us one plate after another and they waited till one plate got over. The best thing was that every pasta dish was served with two pieces of garlic bread. every dish was magnificently made and served. And I will recommend there risotto and lasagna to every foodie as these are the best in the town. The risotto was perfectly made creamy and velvety with the short grained arborio rice ,adequate butter and parmesan cheese. The lasagna was heavy with four colossal cheese and was faultlessly mixed with onion ,clove garlic oregano etc.
The fettuccine pasta was smooth and creamy and was basicaly base in white sauce. The meatballs in spagetti was uncorruptly enormous in size.
We loved and enjoyed the last drop of molten cheese. At the end we were filled upto our mouth, for the quantity was undoubtedly huge .
This is a place which will definitely sooth all your taste bud. This is the right place if you are searching for Italian and you are near sector 5.

thanks to zomato for recommending this place. good food at a very reasonable price. the decor is not something very elegant but i liked the giant screen. the food was too good. the best pick was the drums of heaven and penne with chicken in mixed sauce. we ordered biriyani and as per the ongoing offer got another plate of biriyani free. but i would request the chef not to add peas to the biriyani. it loses its taste to some extent. the fresh lime soda was awesomely made. i had a good fresh lime soda according to my required taste after a long time. the lasagne was good too but a bit of pepper could have been better.we ended with cheese cake which could beat flurys for sure. the staff was very helpful and courteous. highly recommended place

Went to this place with a friend on the 31st December. The place was a bit empty but was otherwise lovely....with the pool outside and true to its name, there's a Tollywood theme with many flashes on one wall. The staff was polite and explained things well. We ordered the drums of heaven and fresh lime soda for starters. They took a bit of time but tasted really yummy. Heaven indeed ! For main course we ordered mixed fried rice and garlic chicken. They tasted pretty nice. And yes, the quantity was good too since one portion was enough for the two of us. This was my only visit there...As I look through the zomato menu now I see some pretty interesting stuff, so looking forward to trying some of the other items. 3.5 stars for now. :)

Had visited this place a couple of weeks back,on a sunday. I t had been raining,and I had made a reservation for two in the morning. About fifteen minutes after we reached, we were informed that the kitchen was under repairs,so nothing except biriyani could be served. After a disappointing 10 minute flurry,which involved the staff making a few phone calls to God knows where,we were informed that nothing could be done. Disappointed, we walked out into the rain and drove over to Drumstick in beleghata. 
Anyway, two days later I received a call from them, asking me to drop by any day.I happened to have a Zomato food coupon with me,and they said they would be happy to acknowledge it. When next we visited, we were well treated indeed. (A nice change after our previous experience).
The place is a bit small, but the decor is in sync with the techie environment of Sector V. I ordered the grilled bhetki with lemon sauce..It was wonderful to the palate..while my friend ordered the drums of heaven,served with sauted vegetables . Next we ordered the spaghetti with meat balls...It seemed just a little bit overdone,but was nonetheless quite enjoyable. we had also taken up a dish of bell pepper chicken, and this was wonderful...overall,the portion sizes are ok,and the prices are decent keeping in mind the location. They have an interesting menu and I'd love to go again sometime soon to try out a few of their other offerings. After our meal,we were given a complimentary serving of Blueberry cheese cake which was just so lovely.  Overall my verdict is that this place really likes its food,and strives to provide an unique gastronomic experience to its customers on a budget. And the staff are all very well mannered. Definately worth a special mention. A good place indeed.

as much as you may hate the term ''paparazzi"....you would surely love yhe restaurant....my first visit was a great experience..the decor is nice and justifies the name of the restaurant....the food is great....not very spicy or oily....served hot and yes the waters are responsive...I had to wait 20 odd minutes before the plates touched down...and wasnt served water when my glass was empty....for thati deducted 1 from the perfect 5...but then again.5 for allowing me to use their wifi...and good behaviour. ..ohh...and they accept meal vouchers too...prices are pretty reasonable...the veg thali is good...n fills u up...and probably the only restaurant in sector v where you can chew on authentic pan...or paaaaan...as the Bengali say. ..good job...kiu..

First time on the way to Ppaparazzi (with double P), finding the place can take about 5 minutes if you're not friendly with Google maps. 
Walls look great and gives the guest an impression of being clicked and pampered once you've stepped in. 
Neat sitting arrangement and quite spacious as well. 

Staff are always ready to welcome and helped me choose my place of comfort. Was handed over the menu card and although it looks pretty simple but the array and blend of choices took me some time. The waiter came in to help again and finally decided on having some Nachos and Salad of grilled chicken with ball pepper. 

Service is pretty swift and I asked them to keep a lil gap in between the two since I wanted to take my time. 

Must mention, that they do take care of individual guests and understand what he/she is actually wanting. Was served with Nachos and boy it looks great! They didn't just make the food they took care of the presentation as well. 

Digged in cause I was hungry and couldn't wait. Quantity was good and tasted like it should. 

The ceiling has pretty LED lamps and could see things turning a bit colorful as the sun went dark. They had music playing in the background and I liked it. They have a screen and a projector system just in case if you want to make a reservation for some kind of a private party. That was well thought about. 

Was ready for round 2 and they bought the food in.
Chicken tasted pretty good and things were fresh. Deliciously made and had a good time munching. 
Yes, I visited the wash room too and it was clean :) 
Didn't mind paying an extra tip to the waiter who has been so good with the service. Was thanked by the manager and he did ask me to write for them. 
Has been a pleasure visiting you, Ppaparazzi. 

PRICE : INR 700 + Taxes for a couple. 
DECOR : 7/10 Nice and cozy
FOOD : 8.5/10 Hope to meet the chef next time. 
SERVICE : 9/10 Am I being a bit frugal with the scores? :P 
VISIT AGAIN? : Yep!

First of all my heartfelt gratitude to the team of zomato for appreciating my reviews and sending me a meal voucher of this restaurant. Though some of the misleading reviews initially discouraged me from giving this place a try, but now I believe that all those who love international cuisine must try this Italian-Continental-Chinese-Indian restaurant. Located in sector 5 globsyn crystal just opposite kfc, this area will give you the tech feel with huge buildings, some pools in front with fountains adding to the beauty. The restaurant faces the pool, and has many tables with a comfortable couch at one corner. Tollywood theme with one wall displaying innumerable camera clicks, good English music playing in the background speaks of its multicuisine international genre. Now the food,i wanted buffet but my parents chose to go for a la carte,so we chose what they serve best- drums of heaven from Chinese, their famous ppaparazzi fondue and the Italian delight-chicken four cheese lasagne. Some foodies have complained about their service,i would say they were pretty quick during lunch hours,the drums came in just 5mins. They serve 8 chicken legs sauted in a delicious Chinese sauce with grated salad as a side. I loved the presentation. Oh yes someone wrote about their melamine crockery,i would say every restaurant serves in ceramic,i appreciated their uniqueness,the crockery and the cutlery were  clean,that's all what matters. Now the show stealing dish,the cheese fondue which they served on a portable oven with liquid boiling cheese on the common pot and long forks for dipping the focacia croutons and potato wedges. They pepped it with their Italian vegetarian combo having mushrooms,zucchini,broccoli,cauliflower,carrots,beans! This was heavenly! MUST TRY! Last but not the least,the four cheese chicken lasagne was exceptionally good. The flat pasta beds with a unique cheese flavour is out of the world. Prices are very reasonable, waiters are courteous and food is of international standards! I just hope people are not misguided anymore! Don't forget to have fondue there! Kudos!

Wonderful reply of the restaurant owner to user Anirban - if you don't have the IQ...The owner seems a stranger to the dictum "Customer is King" - and not very educated himself, and uncouth and impolite. Was planning on visiting this restaurant but after reading this... definitely not. Don't want to be manhandled by a waiter and bad-mouthed by the owner.

Tucked away in a corner of the Globsyn business school campus, this eatery is a nice little place for decent affordable Italian food. The staff is extremely welcoming and courteous. Despite the somewhat crammed in and congested space, they still manage to give a pretty nice illusion of space with good colours. 

The food tastes okay. Not proper Italian, but not too "desi" also. However, they should really do away with tandoori rotis used in place of proper tortilla wraps! Otherwise, it is pretty decent and I would go there again if we run out of few Italian options, honestly.

Definitely a no go for me.. The first experience was too bad to attempt a second visit. First of all, the food was not up to the mark.. No options in buffet.. Even if you get something in non-veg, there is nothing for veg eating folks..Secondly, the place needs a makeover.. It just looks like a street side canteen of some sort.. The most ridiculous thing which I heard from the staff after a friend of mine took a serving of a preparation and did not eat it as he did not like it was "Sir, if you waste food, you will have to pay fine for it.." WTH!!

I went there a couple of weeks back with very little expectations,given . But I was pleasantly surprised to see what I'd found. 
Firstly,although the place is in the heart of sector 5, situated in an office complex and is a little difficult to find,the location itself is very beautiful,with many eateries located in the same area. Very clean and cosmopolitan. 
Next up,the food. We ordered  grilled bhetki with lemon sauce,sea food pasta, grilled chicken and fish cilantro. The portion sizes were pretty good and it's one of the few places where they take care of presenting the food well,without going overboard. And the food itself tasted delicious. I loved the combination of sides. I really hadn't expected that since most restaurants serve you something completely different and indianized when you ask for a grilled fish or steak. But for their price range,it's good food at a good enough price(all this cost us about a grand). I don't think there are too many places nearby where you can eat good continental fare within this price range. 
We were the only ones there so the service could've been quicker but we did go at an odd after-lunch hour. The ambiance itself is not as great as the food. The place is a little small, plus they have a big mocktail counter. It would be great if they started serving alcohol as well.

The positive points:
The great Continental cuisine here. There are soooo many great items to choose from, and they're mostly great tasting as well. I'd say the fondue here is a must-go-for dish.
Value for money. Considering that we were 8 people who went there, and ate a humongous amount each, the bill wasn't the worst we could've done.
The waiters. Really friendly, really polite.

The only negative point: Location. For most people of Kolkata, being located in Sector 5 means that its a little cumbersome reaching here using public means of transport. A big help for all the folks working around here though.

Went with my family today (01-May-2013). Ordered Buffet. The quantity of food given on buffet table was for about 5 people - no kidding. As we were early, we started the buffet (i.e. we were the first people to take food from the buffet table) and as usual took a little with intent of 2nd & 3rd helping.

As 1st May was holiday in IT sector, there was two more family who went for buffet (i.e. total 9 people). The food finished. After 15 minutes of wait - the Italian chicken dish was replenished - it was half-boiled chicken in a watery white sauce (I guess that they just boiled some chicken and put it in same sauce with the boiled water). Food was not just being given.

My wife and kid wanted to get out with half eaten stomach. I became obstinate and wanted to wait to see if they will replenish the food. After about 25-30 minutes of wait (the other two family walked away) - they gave a plate of Fish item. Same cooking style - just put some fried fish on old gravy.

It was a sheer waste of money & the pleasure of dining out was lost. A grumbled family returned back. We had some food to fill in our tummy on way back.

A 100% no-no joint.

At first a ton of thanks to Ppaparazzi and Zomato for giving me the voucher. I was pretty much happy to avail the offer and I ran towards it the last Friday night just after my work was over. I went there with one of my friends.
First of all the building in which Pparazzi is situated is very cool and I just loved the pools in front of Pparazzi. Credit goes to the restaurant owner for selecting such a beautiful location. The interior ambiance of paparazzi is also impressive but I think they can do a little better with lights. I mean they need to make the interior more illusive to attract people. The staffs are very well behaved and they were always waiting beside our table with smile in their faces which is very necessary for a good-will.
Due to urgency, we opted for taking away the foods and we ordered chicken drums of heaven, crispy chilli potato and chicken biriyani. I think their price is very low according to the fine location. Well now coming to the main thing, the quality of food was good. Chicken drums of heaven was literally of heave. I really mean it :) Crispy chilli potato was a delicious snacks but I think it should be more spicy. Biriyani was not that good so I think they should improve their Indian cuisine soon. Although I loved the leg-pieces in biriyani. I will come here again as I want to taste other italian items. Overall Pparazzi is a nice restaurant to hang out both for students and earners. A total value for money restaurant in saltlake tech-hub. All the best from my end :)

On reading the reviews posted on zomato thought of giving this place a try. Before leaving for this place we called up the restro to book for the buffet @ Rs. 399/-. But sadly, I was informed that buffet is only available during lunch hours. Since we had decided our minds on the venue, we headed towards 'Ppaparazzi' to try out their delectable fares from the ala carte. It was not difficult for us to locate the place since we had taken the directions from the person during the call. 
This place sits inside the Globsyn Crystal Building in the tech hub of the city. As we took the plight of stairs to enter the premises the reflective glass towers, standing high; along with the artificial water bodies for rainwater harvesting caught our glance. These eco friendly concepts of the building no doubt add to the charm of the restaurant.
We were greeted warmly by two staffs. Since it was Sunday evening we had the entire place to ourselves. Both of us got seated on the comfy red couch -perhaps the best seat in the entire restaurant. The staffs were extremely attentive and helped us in choosing from the elaborate menu. The grilled bhetki in lemon sauce was pretty delectable. The fish fillets were fresh and decent in size for the price charged. Next came chicken in mushroom sauce which was suggested by one of the staff. Preparation was good. Only observation - The chicken pieces were a bit chewy and the garlic bread that was accompanying this dish was over toasted. It tasted more like a toast biscuit. The staff also suggested us to try the Fondue but we kept it for some other day.
However the overall experience of dining here was nice. Quality and taste of food was good. Ambiance and decoration wise it is nothing great but basics are done properly with good seating arrangement. The cheerful behavior of the staffs deserves special mention.

@ Satyaranjan Pradhan 

Today we went for trying the Buffet in Paparazzi , it was even more worse than your Ala Carte .
Though the taste was ok , but the starters and soup  were served cold and was even limited when it was a "Buffet" . And when we asked for some more soup and starter then we were told that it was over and we were directed for the main course unwillingly .

Main course is a Thumbsdown for Veg , you wont get much variety (only a plain dal and mix veg curry ) which is really disappointing indeed .

Even desert was also not good , ice-cream was mixed with some amount of grained ice to increase the quantity and that too limited .

Last but not the least is the behavior of the staff , we were given the Mouth freshener and the Bill before  we even ask for that which is quiet disgusting .and humiliating for a customer.

So if you guys are planning to go for a Buffet in Paparazzi then remember one thing its a" Limited Edition Buffet " with so so taste

good....as per the ala carte is concerned. I visited this place last Sunday for a lunch.
Actually, I had thought to try the buffet. Up to my surprise there was no customer and so there was no buffet. They told me to book prior to visit for a buffet and advised to try out their ala carte menu.
I had no option, so I tried the ala carte but it was really good...specially the crispy baby corn.
Also they have a good optopn (thali system). It was good, not sufficient to kill ur hunger but can satisfy u.
I love the service. They serve with smile. Wi-Fi is there.but they dont know the password.
It was socking.

It was a mix type of experience.Still I have decided to visit this place again this sunday with some of my friends to try the buffet. Hope I will not be dis satisfied.

Nice place for Sector 5's Continental loving crowd. Indian dishes like Biriyani or De Thali are not quite up to standard. But continental dishes like Mashed Potato and Pepper Chicken Steak and Stir Fried Chicken are a must try. My personal fav are Spaghetti with Meatballs and Grilled Betki with Lemon sauce. Also the pan shot Pappataci is a unique option for those who love to experiment with drinks.

Firstly I would like to thank Zomato for the food voucher to this place.
I visited it twice to fully utilize the vouchers and get a perfect idea of more items and how good they taste...
They say the first impression is the last impression...Well for me it rarely holds true when it comes to Dine Outs
I will start with the negatives first and then go for the positives, I will leave it to you finally to take the call
Firstly it is inside Globsyn Crystals, that too on the inside so until you know about this place rarely will you come across it. KFC's presence on its premises may act as a boon for it but then KFC is more towards the front.
Also when I entered I from the pics expected it to be larger in size....Its a very small sized eatery...
The impression of the theme would have been better had it had more lights setup in a way in which Paparazzi's originally use them big stand ones and maybe they can throw low light on each table.
Next flaw again I felt that the movie in the projector was Zorro and the music in the background was Hindi and the theme is Tollywood....Oh my God I was so disappointed...These subtle touches make the difference between the right ambiance and the wrong. I would have preferred some good Bengali movie being played with low volume being played by their system rather than some random movie on star movies....
Then comes the wifi, showed 85% strength tried to connect to it with laptop got connected but no page opened....Was utterly surprised.
I was also not very convinced by their buffet spread either I mean by the look of it so went for a la carte instead
Now comes the good things,
1) The alertness, everyone serving was always on their toes and never needed to be looked at twice before you wanted to call them they try to comprehend your look and will be beside your table in few seconds. They know their food well and probably the small menu helps them specialize in their food(now, though I do see a new menu in place)
2)The food-Yes the most important thing....It was great...Not that  I have never tasted better but rarely at such a price range...The price is pretty reasonable for college goers to occasionally treat themselves to some good quality food and prices are pretty competitive compared to other restaurants and is reasonable to attract the software gurus and the big shot managers or even the BPO, call-centre employees. They make some excellent fondue, great lasagna, nice salad; we tried the Country Caeser, Chicken Spaghetti Bolognaise, stir fries...everything was good could not complain of a single thing here....However we did not like any drink I had ordered a la dolce vita, did not like it asked them to make it a bit sweet if possible then it was pretty okay we had also ordered another drink which seems simple syrup water you get everywhere...This needs improvement a nice drink makes a good first impression
However all in all a very good place to eat at if you value quality and taste most....You will surely not return disappointed and the food is very fresh.
They also have a nice couch like comfy seat in the corner in red. Located at sector five if they had a better location or if they advertise it a bit then they will have huge takers and if they make the slight few changes I noted above am sure they are going to be a super hit in the area.....
I hope they keep up their standard in food and pay heed to my suggestions....This will help them take that extra step towards perfection.
Please do not increase the prices, I already feel attached to this place for its quality and if they keep it up I plan to visit here more often(despite it being pretty far from my place)...Once you gain much more popularity then think of raising the prices...They are perfect right now....Of course I read some people have some issues regarding the Indian here well I really did not try to go Indian so cannot say on it....

A very nice and cozy Dine-inn place for the groups who wants to try the expensive items on the continental menu. And trust me guys they serve one of the best Italian authentic cuisine on a little bit in an Indian touch. The prices are pritty okay but the best is their Fondue's & Stirfries. We tried from their Christmas Menu as well like Satay chicken, Cocktail fish fingure and Prawns Cocktail was amazingly awesum. Only the missing part is the BAR. For me its a 5-Star and nothing less.

Worthless place. Never one should go. Food is like yawk !!!! Service is very poor. I took the buffet  and was not worth a single penny. Dishes are not at all tasty. Complete waste of money. Very less number of dishes in the buffet and not a single dish tasty. Not at all recommended by me. Owner should go ahead with complete revamp of the buffet menu. Just 40 odd members can be served in total but staff takes huge time to prepare & serve the dish asked for. Never go to this place.

I can understand Mr Owner that not everybody can be pleased. But atleast the chef can put the right amount of salt in all the dishes. Moreover none of the buffet dishes were at all tasty and were dead cold. If you have to serve your customers better, please have a decent buffet and tasty food atleast. If the food is not tasty, I am sure nobody is going to visit you again. You will just have them visited once. In order to refrain people from visiting your place, I have put down these details so that people dont make a fool out of them visiting your place. Thanks so much and hope you do not need to put in some words of comfort and really go ahead and implement something positive.

It is always nice, to have a mindful attention of the waiters when you enter a restaurant. I found exactly this at Ppaparazzi. We were a group of 10, some of us had buffet but we enjoyed the ala carte as well. They have amazing fondues (Cheese and Chocolate) both. We had salads and pastas in white and red sauce, it was simply hat's off to them. The chinese Starters from the buffet were very tasty Specially Sangdong chicken. All in all it was great experience having our time here, a total 'Vasool'. 
   I can say in one line that Ppaparazzi is a very cool destination to have perfect 'adda' with amazing food and nice people around.

A cool, funky place to dine in, at Sector V, Ppaparazzi's popularity has grown by leaps and bounds in the tech-hub of the city. The ambience is very cool, and has an international feel to it. The cuisine is varied and justice is done to each kind of cusine. As another reviewer pointed out, this is probably one of the few places in Kolkata which has a Tollywood theme to it. When it comes to the food, the Ppaparazzi Fondue is truly worth the price!

it was neat and fresh, with lot of air. food was excellent and the best i ever had. nice place to dine at. 
what make this place a standout is the menu. i found several items which were not know to me. some of them which i had were orange chicken and barbeque grilled prawn with something something. though i don't remember the name perfectly but the thought of it is still tinkling my taste buds. have to visit ppaparazzi to have that prawn again.

O yaa and before i sign off, the person who gave the top review, seems to have good talent with words, i wonder is that what he does for living. Anyways he definitely have a problem with his taste buds.
PAPARAZZI ROCKS

I was planning to go to Aafraa, but my friends forced me to go to Ppaparazzi gor having dinner.
I was quite surprised to see the decor and I think it is one of the only  Tollywood theme restaurant in Kolkata. As we entered on the red carpet I felt special.
The menue was quite elaborated and had a lot of options, so we chose Cesar Salad, veg Pasta, Cheese Fondue and thin crust chicken Pizza. All of them were very tasty and presented in a yummy way. The service was friendly and helpful.
As desert we had chocolate Fondue and chocco Paparazo which I never had before in Kolkata and it is a must try!!!!! Only for this experience I will keep coming here.

Heard bout this restaurant alot in recent times, so came to check during durga pujas with a bunch of friends. Though the restaurant was full for the lunch so we had to w8 for a while, in the mean while was checking the other restaurants in that building but then decided to go for Ppaparazzi coz we wanted to have italian and chinese. Fortunately we got a table for 15 of us. Despite the place was very busy that day but the waiters were very attentive and courteous. We ordered for Fondues,Nachos,Orange chicken,Lasagne,Pasta ranch,Spaghetti with meatballs,Baked chicken fettuccine,Grilled bhetki,Deviled chicken liver were all brillent in taste and then we ordered some more in their American Chinese section with some prawns and fishes which was again lovely to smell and taste. 
Later we ordered for couple of never herd biryani sizzlers and it tasted like heaven. All in all Ppaparazzi gets 5stars from all of us for not only making our day but with their smiles in their faces all the time, good services nice and warm ambience at a very resonable pinch in our pocket as well.
 We will come again soon with larger groups.

We were a group of 13. I liked the italian (chicken ala, spaghetti) and chinese (hakka noodles, fish) dishes. The Indian dishes (veg biryani and chicken masala) were ok. The soup (chicken sour) and starter (crispy chicken) were also good. The ambience was nice. However, the restaurant did not seem equipped to handle 13 of us coming in a group - the food ended too soon and took some time to refill. The refilled items were not as delicious as the original servings - they seemed to be diluted to make up volume. Instead of the advertised mocktail welcome drink, we were offered either soft drinks or fresh lime soda. Dessert (strawberry cheesecake and chocolate icecream) was also ok. Overall, a nice lunch for two or a short group - with some exotic tastes in italian food can be expected. An abundance of chicken may or may not be appreciated.

Yesterday I had planned for a family dinner at HAKA (@ City Center 1). But after going through the all goody goody comments about Ppaparazzi I had decided to visit the restaurant before going to Haka once. My wife and I, while entered into the restaurant the internal decor gave a lot of impression on my mind and after going through a complete view about their menu we decided to have Dinner over there.

Their staffs were also very cordial and yes, they had a complete knowledge about their menu items which is very rare for other restaurants. The location is also very good and it was also very comfortable out there.

Food, I can say excellent. We had tried 4 starters. Chicken along with vegetables in Oyster sauce was really awesome among them. Chicken in ginger wine sauce and crispy chicken were good too. Only I think Drums of Heaven could be made better as those were more crispy than juicy. If it would be little more juicy and spicy it would taste great.

Main course items like hakka noodles or Sczhewan fried rice both were good but the winner was Orange chicken. We really acclaimed the one as real surprise of the lot. It was too good to taste. 

On a whole we had a great time over there. Food, Decor, ambiance, staffs everything were good and very friendly. And also none the less it was pocket friendly too. We were 4 people and had our complete Dinner @ 1141 only (incl. tax). 

I wish I will visit the restaurant very soon and will try their Foundae for sure

some days  back during puja time i and my family visited the joint . Although ambiance decor was very good but problem was that time between order and serve was quite high.
  But fine point was that their staff were very friendly, accommodating-and always with smiling face.  

 We had some food voucher but we didn't get the blue berry cheese cake which we were looking for.We also tested fried rice and chicken biriyani. The size of chicken pieces was quite big but my wife had a issue with the grain size of rice.Grain of rice was quite short and thick,they could have used large grain basmati rice. 

 At the  end we tested chilly baby corn which was superb

Since there is no arrangement for negative rating,hence I had to give this place a 1 star.Firstly,there were only 3 waiters attending to around 6 tables which was causing the food to be served really late.After a 45min wait,the food finally arrived "cold".We had to wait for 30 mins just to get a mocktail.The taste was not upto the mark and seemed to be a sheer waste of time and money.Half of the things mentioned in the menu were not available.Finally when i gave a bank debit card for payment,there machine wudn't work.they took 10 mins to swipe the card.All in all,the experience was horrible and I would never recommend anyone to visit this place.

We went there on Sunday to celebrate my husband's b'day. The overall experience was good and more friendlier as we were the only guests for lunch(maybe bcoz the place is new and placed in an office area). Waiters are polite and helpful. The food is good but can be improved in taste. Their "Paparazzi Fondue" is great and a must try, but my husband was very dissapointed with the "Fish and Chips" (he said it was more of Chips than fish). It was good that they specially prepared no onion garlic pizza and veg thali for my in-laws. I had ordered Crispy fried chicken with soft noodles on a sizzling plate, taste was fine but sadly it was just fried and not crispy fried chicken. My parents enjoyed their fish thali and garlic prawns with fried rice. Ended with blueberry cheesecake. 
So overall a good experience except for few problems with the food here n there. Can be tried once in a while.

To be honest, I was aware of the restaurant's existence but never really got an opportunity to try it out until today. Luckily, I had some time in hand so I decided to try out the Lunch Buffet.
Chronologically from when I entered the restaurant, I was satisfied with the ambience around me. Small, but well maintained, to be very precise. Hope it stays that way. The staff and their behavior was pleasing (read "we were greeted with a smile and cordiality") and that counts. But I would have given it a 10 out of 10 if they were a bit more patient with us. Behaviorally good, but diners do look for an opportunity to sit, eat and most importantly, talk. So coming and dropping by to inquire at regular intervals if the next item was wanted is a strict no-no.
Now, it comes down to food. I would have been more than glad if the food could sweep me off my feet, sadly wouldn't say so. However, that need not be mistaken for bad food. It can be branded as 'can be improved' to an extent. Another important aspect not to be missed is that buffet must be served hot, which was stark when it came down to taking a bite. Number of items did justice to the price (Rs. 249 + taxes). An addition of a soft drink can work wonders though.
Last but not the least, the mouth freshener disappointed me. It's kind of safe enough to not venture out and keep it as simple as fennel paired with crystallized sugar cubes. 
Final verdict on my behalf, not disappointed, but however would like to visit anytime when a few very basic aspects have been improved. Best of luck with your endeavor. Thank you.

Ok. I decided to be lenient with my review because the staff were so accommodating and believe in service with a smile. However the reviews on Zomato set the bar high and I wasn't swept off my feet. I appreciate the effort in trying to bring uniqueness and individuality to the table. However...

The Golden Fried Prawns, one of the costlier items on the Menu priced at around Rs. 250 consisted of 6 pieces..the batter coating was too thick and the dip a common tomato sauce. The Ppaparazzi Fondue seemed to be the silver lining and I did in fact enjoy it. However the story ends there. The Penne dish we had ordered had a base which was the exact replica of the Fondue and gave my wife and I sense of Deja Vu for the next 15 minutes..the garlic bread sprinkled with Parsley tried in vain to salvage the reputation of the dish. All was not lost I thought as we ordered the Blueberry Cheese Cake.

Unfortunately there are few places which can do the Blue Berry Cheese Cake Justice in Kolkata. Lets exclude your average 5 Star hotel and look at restaurants. 'Afraa' does a pretty good job and 'Mama Mia' tries hard. Ppaparazzi failed miserably. After a few bites, I was sure the Rs.150 for the cheesecake was definitely not worth it. The crust must have been the thinnest I've ever seen for a cheese cake. The Cheese Cake itself tasted too cold as if it had been jus taken out of the freezer.

So why have I rated it as good? Now a days its about the overall experience and I left happy thanks to the smiling staff who, I was quite sure, were trying their best. A little guidance and course correction will ensure this little place goes a long way.

Good variety of food,since I miss my country food in Kolkata very much especially the italian dishes like lasagne, pasta, cheese fondue and Tiramisu fulfills my taste. Also I tried chinese here, the yummiest ever cantonese rice and of course I forget to mention their amazing Biryanis. 
Interesting ambience matching with the Name, attentive service and I can watch the german soccer matches on a big giant projector they have.The only thing I am missing is a good glass of red wine with my italian dish.

Ridiculous is the one word. They have the best location, nice ambience and nice seats but what they lack is decent food. Awful Chinese, Italian or bengali for that matter.
