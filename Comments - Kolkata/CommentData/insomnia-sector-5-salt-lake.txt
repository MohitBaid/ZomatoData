This is a fairly new place at Sector 5 - situated just opposite of ocean grill. It has an unique decor - tent style sitting arrangement - which is great for adda with a group of friends. They serve decent variety of hookahs and quite well done. Food is a let down. A lot of the menu items were not available - no fish or prawn , no main course items either. However we ordered for devils chicken and chicken mexican sizzlers. The devils chicken tasted sweet !!! Probbaly devil has become  a nice guy ! The sizzler was just okayish. On top of that they were supposedly facing connection problem in card swipe machines.
Overall - an unique concept but needs quite a bit of improvement !

We chanced upon this place when we were at Sector V during the pujas, and could not get a seat anywhere else. Not heavily advertised, this place was rather new for us. When we entered, the ambience immediately attracted us, with blue neon lights and tent like seating arrangements (yes, you have to take your shoes off). Service was rather slow. We ordered French fries, non-veg pizza and sandwiches. The food was okay. A friend later ordered a strawberry milkshake, which not only took forever but also tasted very bland. Upon close inspection, we also realized that the seats were not as clean. Food is not very heavy on the pockets but would probably not be a regular visitor here.

üè©Location: Caf√© Insomnia is located on the 1st floor of Infinity Benchmark (opposite RDB Cimeas).

üéÜInterior & D√©cor: There are 2 types of seating arrangements. One side the place is lined up with normal couches and tables while on the  the other side, there are small cabana kinds which I simply loved. These are done all in white with frills and curtains. There are soft cushions and pillows. It can easily accommodate around 8 people. This sitting area is so cozy and comfortable that I could easily doze off.

üçïFood: They offer a wide variety of items, not to forget different menu cards for Veg and Non Veg. I tried their Peri Peri Pizza and Crispy Chilli Babycorn. The pizza was too good, loved it!! But I didn't like the CCBC that much. I felt it was undercooked. Pocket pinch was not that high. Rates are reasonable enough.

üíÅService and Hospitality: Service is very veryy veryyy slow!! I mean really, one can take a power nap between each order!! üò¥ Staff were nice and courteous.

Overall, I liked the place, will visit again surely! üëç

Went there few days back with friends. They had a one on one offer in hookah. We ordered KitKat shakes, chilli garlic noodles and potato wedges. The food was decent but the service was really slow. Oh boy! They take a really long time to get your food... I guess they have very few staff. Need to buck up on their service fast.. else it was okay. Price was decent.
