We went with little coupon.
They treates us very well but unfortunately the hookah was not upto the mark while the babycorn and lime soda were perfect.
The staff behaviour was very good.
Overall a nice place to visit

Spacious cafe and nice ambience with neon lights. Lively place.
Had ordered mocktails, cheese fondue and kabab platter.
We ordered for veg platter but there was a miscommunication and the waiter got us non veg platter. On clearing it out and politely requesting to replace the platter with veg one several times, the waiter still did not budge and refused to replace the order saying it was our fault for not specifying veg earlier. Agreed, it was a miscommunication, but out of courtesy the least they could do was replace it as the whole purpose of having dinner got defeated( we being vegetarians). Disappointed by my first and surely my last visit to this place.

Had a very nice experience recently at this place...
Ambiance is sporty as one would expect from the name...Something worth mentioning about the ambiance is that...they have something different n innovative going on here...as when they turn off the main lights...some dim violet lights r just on to give the hookah cafe type dim light effect which is cool.

But if you're wearing  light coloured clothes...get ready to see yourself popping up as neon light lights...never experienced something of this sort anywhere till now...Liked it very much...Innovative oneüòéüëç(See my picture below n u'll get to know what the hell i'm talking about.. ;) ) 

Coming to hookah...Took the 3 Chillam(customisable) one with Pan flavour...It was great...Flavour was bang on!!! Neither too strong nor too light...just as you would like...Full points for this one!! 

Among other items we tried...

Brownie Shake-- It was good but a bit smoother would have been better...Taste was really good...

Kitkat Shake-- This was smoother than brownie shake and also tasted better...:) 

Hookah was expensive but they have less priced ones as well...Drinks were fairly priced...

Had a nice evening hangout with friends...Will surely visit again n recommend to others as well...
CHEERS!!! :)

Compared to other lounges they serve the best schezwan rice and their BBQ chicken pizza is a must try.
Loved the cheesecake and the sheesha too.
