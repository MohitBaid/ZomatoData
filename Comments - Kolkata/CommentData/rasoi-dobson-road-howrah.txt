Pretty average food. Do not order nachos bhel, buy a pack of nachos instead. There's no difference. No such thing as a bhel was given to me in nachos bhel.

Food is quite well but the problem is the interior and kind of service. Service is not well at all and even serving is not upto mark. Rates are also according to area but interior and servica maters alot.

We had ordered Crispy chilly baby corn and Schezwan noodles at home. The Schezwan noodles was replaced for Schezwan Rice. Baby corn was pretty good but the rice was the below average but they did not charge for the rice.

Food is of a poor quality. It is not a restaurant worth visiting. Complete waste of money. Please don‚Äôt consider this restaurant in your visit list.

The Veg Handi Biryani is really not what I expected.It was seeming more of a chilly fried rice rather than a biryani.Is it really a taste of biryani!!Am highly disappointed by the taste and found my money to be wasted on the dish.I don't know what else to say more!!

Food is nice. I have visited 2-3 times but AC does not work properly. Staff is not trained to handle in the rush hour. However food is good.

They have staff who have no knowledge what the food item was about.When asked what's the difference between the two noodles he merely replied both taste different.They were reluctant and took 30 odd minutes for just one order..The ambience was ok .Hardly people come to this place .Food quality was just satisfactory. Food quality and quantity is not worth the price they ask for.
