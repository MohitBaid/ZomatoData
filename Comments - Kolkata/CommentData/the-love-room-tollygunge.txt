The best place for pet lovers. Petting dogs will always be the best part. Good care of hygiene. Delicious food. We had ordered grilled chicken and harrisa grilled fish. The grilled chicken is highly recommended, even though both tasted good. Located in tollygunje and easy to locate. The staff is very polite and nice service. Happy Eating!

Apart from the food being great........it is a lovely place for animal lovers. The place is very well-maintained which is commendable. And the food is amazing. The ambience is lovely. And having the pets around makes it so much better. A definite must-visit.

Best place for dog lovers in Kolkata.
It's a pet friendly restaurant.
Nearest metro station would be Rabindra sarovar metro..10mins walking distance from there..
All the pets are well maintained..
We didn't have the opportunity to meet all the dogs..but met only some of them..as most of the dogs come at afternoon..and especially on Wednesday's..
Coming to food we had Chicken popcorn and Chicken wings in BBQ sauce.. which was pretty good.

I heard about this place. And I love pets very much. So I was very much curious about this place. 
Went today with my sister. 
Food is good. Won't say it's very good. Price somewhere is higher than its food quality. 
But what an ambience. 
Totally worthy. 
Worth going if one is a pet lover.

The place is located on the 1st floor and there is a spiral stairway which you have to climb to reach it. Pretty nice it was!

There is a yard type of an area on one corner where the fur-babies were lying and sitting.
The food area was on the other side with nice wooden tables and wooden floor.

We ordered a variety of dishes, among which Chicken ala kieve and chicken strognoff were not upto the mark. The other dishes such as the Chicken steak , brownie with icecream were good.
The waffles were tiny and I have had better.
So food wise it was sort of a disappointment but the showstopper of the place (and for which we visited ) are the fur-babies !
The pug was the cutest and the most active one. There were 3 other species of furbabies too, names I cant recall right now.
There were 3 kittens as well who played with us actively.
After waiting for more than an hour extra, we had the privilege to meet the husky- who is very popular here. (It was a rainy evening so he couldn't come out until it stopped raining , so the long wait ) He was an absolute darling, running and jumping about the place.

For the fur babies it was worth going!
Ambience - 5/5
Food-3/5
Cost- 3/5
Location-4.5/5
Service- 3.5/5

P.S.: We had a concern that some of  the furbabies could have been sedated cause they were sleeping and lying around (abnormally) a lot!

It was my first visit in love room... I loved the ambience.... All the pets were well maintained.... I loved ego (husky) bunny(golden retriever) was too cute, cats roam around the whole restaurant like a boss.... Wednesday is the best day to visit love room.... Now talking about food.... We ordered a non veg pizza, coffee and green tea.... Pizza was good enough... Rest was as usual... I would recommend this place for pet lovers not foodies....

A lovely place for the pet lovers. They have a fenced corner for the dogs where you can cuddle and play with them. The decor is nice too. Coming to the food, I visited this place during the pujas so they didn't have the usual menu. A special menu was given to us which didn't consist of as many number of items as that in the regular menu. We ordered chicken stroganoff, grilled fish and pesto rub, chicken bbq,   strawberry milkshake and virgin mojito. Apart from the chicken stroganoff everything else was pretty good.

Nice ambience and very friendly staff. A nice cafe to hang out in.

Am absolutely sure this place will win your heart. They have different breeds of dogs and cats. All in all you can spend a lovely time playing and cuddling them along with the delicious dishes which is equally amazing. Don't miss a chance and visit this place if you're fond of labra dog, husky, German Shepherd. They are adorable. 💜

I loved the food! The pizza had a very thin crust and the oreo shake was amazing! We also had chicken fried rice and fish manchurian, which was good too. The ambience was good too.  Dining with pets is a new experience altogether! I took my own pet, Mojo and she was happy too! The staff were caring and well behaved.

This place was quite in the news.. I personally love dogs so was super excited to try this place so finally went there..
Ambience - Do i have to talk about ambience? There are dogs who are very friendly so the ambience was great. And the behavior of the stuffs are really nice.

Food- We ordered a lasagnia and a chicken ala kiev.. And one oreo and one KitKat shake..

Oreo shake- Had the oreo flavor perfectly but i dont like oreo that much so didn't like it that much..
Kitkat shake- Loved it.. Perfect amount of sweet ness but both shakes have too much ice basically more ice less milk. So can give 3/5.
Lasagnia- very very cheesy.. When i took the first bite it was great but after 3-4 bites i didn't like it.
CHICKEN ALA Kiev- this was served with mashed potato and honestly loved this..chicken should have little more moisture because it felt little dry but it was better than the other dishes we ordered.

Pocket pinch- Too costly and not pocket friendly 
Verdict - if u wanna go there for dogs u should go more than once but if for food only i will not recommend this still for one time try u can go.

I finally managed to tick off this amazing cafe from my to visit bucket list.  A must visit for pet lovers. 

Located –  36 tollygaunge circular Road.  Nearest metro station –  Rabindra sarobar.

Ambience –  The place is spacious and comfortable. The Staff was courteous and friendly.  With seating available in high tables as well as normal ones.  They maintain high hygiene and cleanliness. They don’t only have dogs but cats as well and their section are separated from that of fooding area with the help of a wooden fence . ** All pets are not available at every point of the day except Wednesdays from 5pm – 7pm**


What we ordered –  1. Mocktail –  Virgin monito 

2.  Veg. Pasta in spaghetti and pomodoro sauce 

3. Chicken Wings in BBQ Sauce  

4. Margherita Pizza 

I was extremely satisfied with the food.  The presentation and taste was both amazing and mouth watering.  Specially the Margherita Pizza which looked and tested both excellent.  The thought of it stills brings water to my mouth.  Looking forward to visit this place again.

Horrible service. We had to wait for an hour for our Chicken. Pets are not even looked after properly,and they cannot deal with crowds. Also,I remember one time we had taken a rescued kitten to the cafe. It was our first time and he hadn't been vaccinated. We were unaware of the fact that only vaccinated pets would be granted entry.  The owner threw us out. Despite us telling him that we needed help with the adoption,he didn't help us one bit. It seems that only pedigree's are appreciated at the Love room.

A great atmosphere and a nice place to go with your pets!
Children would love the sight of animals at the time of dining!
Houses a Den of Dogs and a Cat Room where one could enter to play with them while your food is prepared.
Service is okay.
Main USP of this place would be a specialised Menu for the pets you bring along, that also includes Desserts.

We ordered Chicken Ala Kiev and Spaghetti, which were well prepared. 
Food Ratings: 4/5

But those who r not purely pet lovers must Not visit the place.. cz pets r not only locked in a glass room and in different zone.. pets roam in the restaurant.. over the table chair bags.. n everywhere.. even when u r eating.. so One must be very very comfortable with pets.

In my wish list since long time. A special place and it becomes more special when you  are with your Bae. As I m very fond of pets so as she. Ambience is great and their little hosts (Bush and Bobo) even make it more enjoyable. 
Started with their KitKat shake. It was nice but it could be more tastier. Ordered Grilled Chicken (recommended)  and Chicken straganoff. Food was good. We both enjoyed playing with dogs more than food. You have to take your shoes off and sanitise your hands before entering the pet arena. Eagerly waiting for my next visit..

A pet friendly restaurant where you can see the cutest dogs n cats playing and enjoying themselves and you can cuddle those munchkins too.
They bring up the ambience by a huge margin
Also how beautifully they maintain the hygiene is commendable.
Coming to food
We didn't have much because we weren't that hungry so we decided to take up a beverage and Brownie with Icecream and Hot chocolate sauce.
Food was also really good .
The brownie just melted into my mouth.
Woow 💓👍

A pet friendly cafe nestled on top of the bank of baroda branch on tollygunge circular road..this place will lift your spirits with their canine friends and some very sleepy cats. The staff of the restro are as friendly as the pets....yeah and really courteous...never seen better staff at a cafe....cause they make you follow the rules while still maintaining their friendly attitude all the way..the food is close to being really good cause there are some aspects that need a fine touch but the quantity and the quality is right up there....you have to take of your shoes off before you can play with the dogs or take pics..and u can wash your hands before you eat...but the pets are probably more clean than you'll ever be in winter...so that's a major plus for people freaking out about sanitation...and you'll have to order your food before you can play with the dogs otherwise the dogs just keep barking at you or might just rip your pants off....... :/.....just kidding it's just one of their rules...but lets just say if u have a friend who loves dogs or cats and you're just getting there...this cafe will push you off the edge...cause the whole idea of it and their attention to detail with the dog bowl bill carrier and the dog portraits on the walls will make sure you go back puppy :)...sorry happy.

I didn't have any idea about any pet friendly restaurant in Kolkata. I came across this place while searching randomly in Zomato and planned to organise my friend's birthday party here. And I must say my experience with the restaurant was of a lifetime. First of all the restaurant management was very helpful in the decorations and arrangements. They put up a really good effort towards the event. The restaurant is quite spacious and the interiors are quite appealing. Their service is fast and efficient. We had ordered Chicken Wings in BBQ sauce and Peri Peri Chicken Pizza. The food was good. Though they do not have much options in the food menu but whatever is on the list is commendable. The Pizza could have been better if they had used a thicker base because the crust had become stiff and hard to chew. The toppings were great. If I had to rate the restaurant on the basis of their interiors, customer service and food, I would have given them a 3. But what adds to the experience are the pets with whom you get a chance to interact with. The pets are very friendly and they are well taken care of. I wouldn't mind waiting for the food as long as I can play with the pets. I had a great time with the pets and they are so adorable that you just wouldn't feel like stepping out of the place at all. If you are a pet lover, you cannot miss the place at any cost. But if you do not like pets, its better you skip the visit because the pets might be roaming around at times playing with people. But rest assured, the hygiene is maintained as far as the food is concerned. Overall, You Guys Rock!

The Love Room is located in Tollygaunge Circular Road, right beside a branch of a Bank of Baroda. The nearest metro station is Rabindra Sarovar.

I visited this place a few weeks back as it was on my wish list for a long time. This is probably the first pet friendly cafe in Kolkata. Indeed the name does justice to the place. This cafe has a variety of fur babies (read - dogs and cats). The dogs are kept in a fenced area. You need to remove your shoes if you want to go inside the fenced area to pet/play with the dogs. The preferable time to visit the place is after 5 pm as by that time almost all the in-house dogs are brought to the cafe. Before 5 pm, there are generally two to three dogs. All the in-house dogs are available on Wednesdays. The cats are kept inside a glass room and are sometime let out to roam inside the cafe. Of course people are allowed to bring their pets there. This is also a kid friendly place.

Coming to the food, we had Peri Peri Chicken Pizza and Orange and Basil Mojito. The pizza was well made and good both in quality and quantity. The drink was okay-ish. The people there are courteous and the ambience is really nice. Also, I have been suggested to try out the Chicken Lasagna, thus I am planning to go back there real soon. A much recommended place.

Great concept and the place was neat and well-kept - the 2 cats were fun to watch and pet, the two dogs were kept in a cordoned off area with one of them (the pug) quite loud and aggressive. The staff was friendly but the main problem with this place is its substandard food fare and ridiculous policies. 

1. Cappuccino - flat AF, more like milk and some coffee powder. Had to ask for mine to be frothed and the server kindly made a fresh one which was just passable. 

2. They serve pancakes for 175/- and charge 90/- extra for maple syrup 😁 I mean who serves pancakes without anything to have it with - might as well club it and charge the full amount right? At least it won't be embarrassing like when I asked the server if he'll have to charge me another 90/- for additional maple syrup and he said yes 🙏

3. No regular water served and when it took pushback to get them to serve regular water after they initially refused to serve that. 

Place: lovely. Food: lousy. Policies: thoughtless.

Only known pet friendly restaurant in Kolkata.
They have a fenced area inside where you can play with this place's dogs and a separate glass room for the cats.
You need to remove your shoes and sanitize your hands before entering the fenced area.
We only tried the shakes - Kit Kat, Oreo and Ferrero Rocher. They tasted good enough but very average as per their high prices.
They have a separate section in the menu for your pets as well.
Very eager to drop in with my dog next time.

If you're a pet lover, specifically cats and dogs, then this place is a must go. You can even bring your pets to this place. The dogs are really friendly and they maintain the hygiene while keeping the pets. But they won't let you play with them unless you order something 😛
We ordered for chicken pizza, KitKat milkshake, chicken ala Kiev 
All of them tasted good and the chicken ala Kiev is a must try. 
The staff was friendly and well behaved. And the ambience was awesome 🙂 will surely visit this place again

This is only for Ego and Tipsy, the two dogs there. Food is pretty average. But you can surely give it a try, if you want to try something new. As a cafe the ambience is pretty nice, but as a dog cafe it's pretty claustrophobic. An outdoor option would have been better.

The cats are well trained. One of the cats were with us. They had continental dishes.

The cats are well trained. One of the cats were with us. They had continental dishes.

Bascially i am a pet lover.. so this restaurent is like heaven to me... you wont feel any concern once you entered into the restaurent... bobo the pug did a warm welcome to us... dogs were so cute and well trained that it will melt your heart.... we ordered hot cheese fondeu,  cappucino, chicken parmigiana, meat lovers pizza, non veg pasta with pesto sauce... food was extreamly cheesy and will melt your heart and taste buds...  this is not your place if you dont love pet..this is a must see place for all pet lovers...

One of the few restaurant of India & probably the only one in the Eastern India that allows you to bring pets(well,dogs mainly and cats,if you may!) along or gives you the opportunity to mingle with the furry residents of the place itself.That makes it quite unique of a place for the animal lovers,actually a must go!There is a separate dog enclosure where after removing your shoes & applying hand sanitiser you can cuddle with the beautiful dog friends as long as you wish.The bonus is they are very photo conscious also!Cuteness overloaded!The cats are in another glass room,always dozing & unperturbed by the guests around.Now the food.Virgin Sangria was really refreshing,Along with nachos it was a nice start.Then we tasted Meat-lovers pizza(average),Chicken stroganoff(creamy) & Harissa fish steak(enough to set your ears fuming!).We signed off with caramel ice cream.Frankly speaking,the food was strictly ok and apart from the pet factor it has no distinct character in terms of food or taste.I found the staffs are bit inattentive even.The decor is neat and the metal staircase outside makes it a bit difficult for the people with bad knees to reach the restaurant situated at the first floor of the building.So the people who prefer to maintain a safe distance from the pets won’t find a logic to visit this place situated at the chaotic Tollygunje Circular Road.But for all others like me will prefer to visit Love Room repeatedly for their fur-fetched dreams!

Let me start by saying that Zomato dosen't allow zero as rating and that is why you have got a one. 
Ok, so like this one was one of the worst, oh sorry the worst experience of my life. Like we walked into the restaurant and found nobody other than us. One hour later we understood why!
We went there for the dogs. Like 25 kms to see dogs🐕🐕🐕 and what we get were mother effing cats!! 🐈🐈🐈🐈
Anyway coming to the factual part their food tastes like used tissue paper.
We ordered french fries which tasted like biscuits warmed in milk.
Lasagne in which there was unboiled vegetables.
Strogonoff came more as a cheesecake.
My brother was the only one who could have his food for the grilled chicken was edible.
They took 50 years to serve a dish for pongo - my dog.
I guess the ine he got was tastier than ours.
And we were exuberantly stupid enough to order pizza. It was baked masala papad.
I have never tasted such horrible food!
Oh and as an icing over the cake, one of their waiters dropped a whole glass of sangria over us.
The bill came to 3003.I felt my heart die inside.
As a method to prevent the shock they gave us one "complementary" virgin mohito. Which was 80% ice inside.
I wish I would have never been there

An amazing place for pet lovers. The name "love room" couldn't be more appropriate. It was a beautiful experience to visit this place. We tried the chicken wings with barbeque sauce, meat lovers pizza and tea. All of which were delicious. The staff were polite, helpful and very jovial. We had the most fantastic time. 
And the furry patrons were the best part. But what impressed me the most was the way the staff took care of every tiny detail and the hygiene of the place.
Will certainly visit again.

A very nice place for any animal lovers. Even though that's the highlight feature of this place, that doesn't mean the foods are unnoticed. The quality of foods served are very good, and the staffs are friendly, so no complaints there. 
My only gripe is that the place is a bit over priced for the quantity you get. But given the food quality is top notch and the ambience is good, and they have various dogs and cats that you can spend your time with while there, I'll definitely recommend this place.

Food - I was here during the festive season (durga puja) so they didn’t serve their regular menu but had a special puja menu. Unfortunately the menu didn’t have much items to choose from. I ordered for chicken bbq, chicken strogonoff, grilled fish and pesto rub, strawberry milkshake and virgin mojito. 
The chicken bbq was delicious. Perfectly cooked and perfectly juicy.
The fish and mocktails were also good. 
The strogonoff was disappointing as it was very dry kind of.

Ambience - A cute little pet friendly place. 

Service - Helpful staff. 

Rate - Absolutely Appropriate

A lovely place in Kolkata for all those foodies who're also cat and dog lovers! Beautiful ambience with a great staff and splendid food. Spending time with the little fellas was pure love and we enjoyed it thoroughly.

1. Lasagna - This lasagna was delicious! It was well cooked, served hot and presented elegantly. Definitely one of my favourite lasagnas.

2. Pizzas - We had Margherita Pizza and Peri Peri Chicken Pizza, the breads were flimsy but the overall taste was quite good. It was relatively sized as medium pizza so nothing to complain there either.

3. Deserts - We had Sizzling Brownie and Waffles, the Waffle was good but the Brownie was delicious ! A must recommendation for everyone.

4. Burgers - The burgers come within three small buns, honestly, they look kinda cute but that's all, they're limited in terms of taste and pretty much not worth it. Better stick to the rest of the menu for better delicacies.

5. Beverages - One of the better places for Beverages. We had the regular stuff, a few Chocolate Shakes, Oreo Shakes, Kitkat Shakes and Cafe Frappe and they were on point.

This place has been on top of my bucket list since a long while. Courtesy, its pet-friendly atmosphere! I am very passionate about pets, so the moment I rushed in there, we ordered some items quickly and headed to the pet zone. Not only do they care for their customers but also they are very much aware of the hygiene as well, which I liked the most. 

Now coming to the food, I ordered  
1) Oreo Milk Shake, which was recommended by a friend and I'm more than impressed! ❤
2) Red Velvet Pancake 

The Pan cake was good too except it was a bit dry. Should have ordered any syrup for it. But nonetheless, my visit had been awesome. Will love to visit there again... For the pets (for the food as well) ;) ❤❣

I would give this place full 5 out of 5 for the pets and the environment.... The trainers for the pets are really good and friendly.... Butbthe waiters are not at all friendly or they easily don't come up for your service, you need to call them quite sometime then they respond back.... I found them a bit rude.... The food was okayish.... Peri peri chicken pizza was good.... Cafe frappe was good too.... But the chicken wings were smelling and tasted horrible.... Otherwise everything is perfect.... Would love to visit them again..... Cats are also adorable....

I Particularly Liked Grilled Chicken And Pasta. But My Advice Will Be Not To Try The Pancake. Go For Other Desserts. But Yeah If You Are An Animal Lover You Will Be So Happy Over There. You Can Even Take Your Pets With You. They Have Whole Other Menucard For Your Furbabies.❤

If you're dog lover, and if you are not allowed to have/keep pets in your house. Then yes! This is YOUR place. They have more or else eight dogs and two kittens. The dogs are of great breeds. Eg - Labrador, Siberian Husky, Lhasa, Pug Etc. But unfortunately, you will not get them all in one day. At a time only three or four pups stays there and plays with you. Playing with them, is the ultimate Satisfaction you will get. ^_^
They're all AWW-dorable. ❤️

Coming to the food and ambience part -
The Ambience is cosy and beautiful. The cafe is very neat and clean. And they strictly maintain hygiene. Which is also good for the health. The cafe is situated on the main road. And you will not find any hassle to find the cafe.
We further ordered -
Brownie Milkshake, Caramel Milkshake, All Rounder Mocktail, Spaghetti With White Sauce (Non Veg) And Zingara Pizza. The milkshakes and mocktail were undoubtedly very much delicious. And, also I wasn't disappointed with the pizza and spaghetti. Because they taste great.

But, I am unhappy only for one thing that is - the prices a bit over priced. And not everyone can afford it. The authorities should think about it once.

At the end, the staffs were also very friendly and polite. And were actually happy persons. None of them behaved rudely. We stayed there for like 3 hours. But, they didn't seemed irritated. They were accepting all our tantrums. ^_^

Won't mind visiting for a second time. ^_^

We went for a coffee meet so didn't really have anything to eat other than Garlic Bread as a side. The garlic bread was AWESOME. Hands down the best I have had in Tollygunge area.

We took a Macchiato and a Camomile tea. The Camomile was so so. Wasn't really a good flavour in the tea. The Macchiato was good.

Would I like to go again? Oh yeah!

It's a great place to hang out with your pets. The staff is really helpful and friendly. The food could be better. We went on Dashami, and the special puja menu was really brief, not much options. We tried out the pasta in red sauce and also in white sauce. It was good and upto the mark. We followed it up with a pizza. For dessert I tried out the brownie with icecream. It was too hard. But the staff promptly replaced it. Hygiene might become a problem if you have pets at every table with fur and drool flying around. Maybe a more spacious seating area might solve the problem.

One of the very few cafes in Kolkata that allow pets. The location is not exactly Tollygunje but New Alipore or it's just before the Phari Bridge when you are moving from New Alipore towards Tollygunje. 
Locating is easy. Their major USP here are the pets they have here. They are friendly and always ready for cuddles.

On inside the ambience is comfortable. The service though is a little sluggish. The BBQ wings tasted good and the portion was decent. The sizzling brownie that I ordered later was a little burnt and the vanilla ice cream melted by the time it reached my table.

Littles improvements are needed.

Cheers!

This was a surprise from my nerd. He didn't tell where we were headed untill we reached this lovely place as the name suggests. The Love Room is the place to be for all animal lovers, especially dog lovers. They have cats too. The staff informed us that the animals leave by 8.30 pm. Since we reached at 9 pm we missed them. We plan to go back again. They have various breeds including two huskys. Decor is neat and simple. Its a spacious restuarant with fencing for the dogs. One can go inside the fenced area to cuddle them. Coming to the food, we ordered a salad which tasted very fresh, chicken a la kiev was well made too and we had some good darjeeling tea. Their cutlery and presentation is also impressive. 
P.S. Visit this place specially on a Wednesday, 5 pm onwards. The staff informed us that all breeds are brought here on Wednesdays.

Tollygunge does not have a lot of cafes to visit and due to this reason love room became instantly popular amongst the people and also it is the first pet cafe in Kolkata. This cafe gives an opportunity to people who cannot have a pet due to some reason and for all dog lovers it's a heaven. The ambience is excellent and the place is spacious as well as clean. The food is average, nothing bad, and little pricey.

This place truly lifts up the spirit of people. If you are a dog lover, this place is sheer heaven for you. Ambience is very lively. The cafe is quite spacious with proper lights all around. I went there with my best friend and her brother. We ordered meat lovers pizza, virgin mojito, sea cooler and sizzling brownie.

Sea cooler- this was quite refreshing. They provided ice cubes instead of crushed ice. So it would have been a bit better if i was served with crushed ice.

Virgin mojito: this tasted beautiful. Flavours were well balanced.

Meat lovers pizza- i loved it. Being a non-spicy lover i liked it completely but my friend didn't because she found it quite bland in taste. 

Sizzling Brownie- this was like ethereal. How ca  brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream go wrong? 

Now the best part, the dogs. Oh my god, those fluffy cute dogs will steal your heart away. They were adorable. You can plat with them as much your heart wants. 

Definately a nice place to go.

Well the area where this cafe is located have less restaurants and cafes.So somewhere due to compulsion we had to step into this cafe.And as we didn't search this cafe before in zomato we didn't had any idea of pets there.After we knew we spent some time with them.They were so adorable.Now coming to food it was not satisfactory.We ordered chicken and cheese ball,Grilled Chicken.Both of them were hard and lacks taste.And secondly we had to ask for every single things which were supposed to be there on the table like spoon, ketchup etc.Staffs were good enough to provide us with everything that we wanted without any hasitation.Well this place has a good ranking,or may be I chose some improper dishes.But I was not satisfied and humbly suggest the management to standarize the food.

Being a regular is never a bore in here. Especially when the host welcomes you with a wide smile and a warmth of recognition. The feeling is indescribable. 
The place is very dear to me, such a coming-home feeling these little fellows provide can't be overlooked. 
The food as well, they never disappoint. The myriad of ways they serve the drinks are a definite look out. 
Today, to greet the agomon of Maa Durga they even played the Dhaker baaj- how can you not fall in love with the place!

Love room... What an apt name for this place. Rather than the food, you would wanna visit this place for spending time with all the dogs and the cat out there. From the time you get the table till you gobble off all the food, you can spend time with the dogs... The staff there are very helpful and will let you take umpteen pictures with the dogs. The dogs are very friendly out there too. They have also been very well.looked after and the place doesn't  even smell a bit. A wonderful place and an amazing concept. 

Coming to the food, it isn't that great. I wish they would concentrate on the food a bit. The food doesn't justify the price on the menu card. But after spending time with the dogs, you forget about all of that...

The place was awesome and the food was also very yummy. We had chicken pasta , grilled fish and fish finger. Among the mocktails we had virgin Cosmo and virgin mojito with pineapple and mint. Both were refreshing. The presence of those super cute dogs was of course the main incentive for us visiting this place. We met 5 of them - Barney, Shadow, Gogo, Ego and Tipsy.
But I would like to make one small suggestion here. Please do not allow so many kids inside the dog arena at the same time. It irks the dogs as together so many kids shriek and shout. They run around and the dogs do not get enough space to move. Otherwise I loved everything about this place.

(That's particularly my honest review)
The food, um okayish. Overpriced.
Had a crispy baby corn in schezwan sauce and a bowl of chicken soup and also a great pinch in out pockets. 
Ambience is good. The place is well maintained.
Now coming to the main attraction of this place, the dogs! They have Golden retriever, Irish setter, Pug, Lhasa, Labrador retriever, Siberian husky and a few Indian cats. All of them are lovable ❤

But we went there for the cuties though we didn't get to meet the entire lot. A must go to place for pet lovers. It was truly a stress buster afternoon. For a change Monday was made extra special.

Located in New alipore this place has been in my and my friend's bucket list from a long time. This place is for those who love pets and we were lucky because in that particular day there were around 5-6 cute dogs. 
Now coming to food we ordered an Oreo shake and a Mexican pizza, the food was ordinary but I guess who goes over there for food😛.

I was so happy when Kolkata got its first pet-friendly restaurant. Well, not that I have a pet. But The Love Room has a solution for that too-they have their own pets for cuddling! Housed on the 2nd floor, it has a mood-uplifting ambience with a huge, airy, bright decor and of course, the owner's pets! I loved the seating arrangements-quite funky yet comfy. There were some very well-trained cute dogs and cats. And who cares about food when you got them? I loved the pasta we ordered. They have a huge menu for pets, though! So if you want a treat for your pets, this is the only place in Kolkata. Prices are reasonable. I want to go back again and again. An overwhelming experience!

The place was awesome and the food was also very yummy. We had chicken pasta , grilled fish and fish finger. Among the mocktails we had virgin Cosmo and virgin mojito with pineapple and mint. Both were refreshing. The presence of those super cute dogs was of course the main incentive for us visiting this place. We met 5 of them - Barney, Shadow, Gogo, Ego and Tipsy.
But I would like to make one small suggestion here. Please do not allow so many kids inside the dog arena at the same time. It irks the dogs as together so many kids shriek and shout. They run around and the dogs do not get enough space to move. Otherwise I loved everything about this place.

Seriously though, we went here for the dogs.
(That's particularly my honest review)
The food, um okayish. Overpriced.
Had a crispy baby corn in schezwan sauce and a bowl of chicken soup and also a great pinch in out pockets. 
Ambience is good. The place is well maintained.
Now coming to the main attraction of this place, the dogs! They have Golden retriever, Irish setter, Pug, Lhasa, Labrador retriever, Siberian husky and a few Indian cats. All of them are lovable ❤

Suggested by a friend we planned a lunch at this place which happens to be really far from my home and it was absolutely worth it. Such a cosy place. With amazing food and ambience. But we went there for the cuties though we didn't get to meet the entire lot. A must go to place for pet lovers. It was truly a stress buster afternoon. For a change Monday was made extra special. Many thanks to 'The love Room' team for this wonderful effort.

This was on my list for quite a long time and I finally visited it last Saturday.
The best thing about this place is that it is a pet friendly restaurant and till now the only pet friendly restaurant in Kolkata.
The food here is okay and not something very great.
We tried burgers,pizza and pancakes.
The burgers and pizza was good.
The red velvet pancake was not at all good.
They also serve dog food here, and we ordered chicken steak and vanilla ice cream for my pet which she enjoyed a lot.

Coming to the ambience and staff, it's a nice place and the best part is they have their own pets and you can spend time with them.
The staff are really friendly and welcomes both you and your pet with equal love and respect.
If you are a pet lover, you should definitely visit this place at least once!

The place is Haven for me. A cafe with so many furry friends was quite unexpected in Kolkata. But finally we found it and gotta go there. This place is full of friendly puppies n dogs and you can easily cuddle and play around with them. Yet so hygenic.
And lastly food was yumm.
Great service.
I would love to go there again and recommend too.

A cute place amidst the busy tollygunge.. Situated on the second floor of a building.. It has cute dogs, specially EGO and naughty cats as special attraction.. they love doing small mischief all day long which makes your visit even more memorable. We can interact with this pets, but seriously its for pet lovers as the animals will go all over the place but ofcourse they are well trained. So anyone having issues with pets should not go in and make it uncomfortable for those inside. Coming to the food part.. Its good if not extraordinary. Service is quite fast and staff is warm and friendly. One minus point.. the salads should be cold, not warm.

I am a dog lover and this pet friendly is just for suitable for people like us.the food was good but the pizzas were little crunchy could have been soft. And if the pets would be available timely it would be good as a suggestion. A very sophisticated and clean ambience and the service was very full of warmth and welcoming. The food should be little looked up just.

Been there a couple of times with my pupper. He enjoyed more than us. They even have a menu for pets. I was searching for a place to take my baby for a long time but this is the first of its kind in Kolkata where they allow pets. And we loved it a lot. They even have a few cute babies of their own. Please take the vaccination certificate along with you for a smoother experience.

If you are a real dog lover, you won't like this place. Dogs here however cute or adorable are pretty irritated with people around them all the time and you won't get the dog-ish vibe from them. They aren't needy for your attention or love, all they want is to sleep or go for a walk. Food is fine, nothing great, nothing disastrous. Service is a bit slow(which is good, considering the theme and everything. I would've rated this lower if I had let my animal love(and caring about their liberty) get in the way. But I think as a profit-making organization, the idea isn't bad as it will surely attract a lot of wannabe dog lovers.

I called The Love Room on 15th August morning and asked whether they have dogs or not and whether they allow kids to enter the playing area or not.
To which they replied yes they have dogs and also kids are allowed.
So me along with my 2 kids reached there and to my surprise found only 2 dogs and never allowed the kids to enter saying they don't allow.
When I told them you all said you allow they said no we don't🙄
Since we had already been there we decided to be there for a while and ordered pizza.
The pizza was not a pizza at all they used tandoori roti for pizza slice and ready made spices and chicken.
It was pathetic 
The main surprise was while giving the order of the food I ordered a soft drink and a virgin mojito.
Which they never provided till my last stay there.
They say they are giving ultimately they didn't.

Overall a pathetic experience 
Please stay away from this place.

If you ever wanna take your pet out for a lovely meal then I guess The Love Room is the perfect place to visit. It not only has variety of meals for your fur baby but also for you. On my little boy Carlos's (Chihuahua)  birthday I took him to The love room and believe me he really enjoyed the food the ambience everything and so did I. There is also a cute pet corner where you can go and spend time with the pets of the owner and it's just lovely. Three little cats who are very very friendly. My boy even got a large scoop of vanilla ice cream as a treat from them since it was his birthday  I am gonna share a few pics of my visit. Hope you'll like it and do visit it soon. 🐶😊

Located​ at the tollygunge circular road. One of my favorite places. Being an animal lover i loved the idea of making it a pet-friendly cafe. I felt delighted to get in there. Unfortunately i Don't have a pet i saw others bringing their mushy ones. Not only you, your pet will have a good time here too!
Who cares about service and all where the ambience is heavenly. I had a very special time with those little buddies. It is undoubtedly flawlessly​ planned and very well maintained cafe. I'd love to drop by again. If you're a doglover this is your ultimate bliss!

From Barney to Gogo to Ego to Shadow to Bruce to Tipsy, they're all love. The food is no doubt very amazing and well the service, I can't say anything about it. It's totally up to the mark.

The concept is to let your pets enjoy while you gorge on some food and talking. The place is cosy and nicely done with a separate area for pets to play. Something that bothered me was the staircase leading to the cafe. While my four-legged fur-ball was climbing up, I could see she was struggling as the stairs were steep and narrow. Apart from this, I completely loved this cafe. Neat and clean to carry your pets. Food is average though.

Located in New Alipore, this place had been in my bucket list for a long time.
First coming to food, it was quite ordinary. 
We ordered chicken popcorn, chicken peri peri pizza and Oreo shake. The pizza was a bit disappointing, to be honest. 
Now coming to the main part- our furry friends😍.
There were 7 of them today as it was Wednesday. 
They were extremely well trained and my personal favourites are Gogo, the pug and Barney, the Golden Retriever. 
There were 3 cats too 😄
It was pure delight spending time with them.
However I feel the area of enclosure for the pets should be increased as sometimes it was getting very crowded there.
This place is truly a love room ❤

Great concept.
A must visit for the unique and awesome concept.
My visit was on a rainy afternoon.Didnt found any dogs arround.But yeah,there were three cats.They made our day.They were very well trained and they were arround only till the food was served.After the food reached us,they went away to their own place.
Coming to food,it is not extra ordinary except the Fish Fingers which were the best i have had till date.
Other than that,Grilled Chicken and Chicken Parmigiana was our orders which were good.
Altogether a memorable experience.
A must must visit.
And yes,Staffs are really good and highly friendly.

The place located just a 5 min s walk from the bridge could be a complete delight if you are a dog lover! The place is pet friendly and has several dogs! But only a maximum of 2-3 are present at a time except Wednesday 5-7 pm when 7 of the dogs are present! The owner has a total of 9 dogs in all probability! The best and the only good part of the cafe is this which deserves 3.5. Coming to the food part, we ordered an aqua blue and an orange shake for the drinks part! We were tremendously hungry but found nothing special in their drinks! To add to this we ordered pasta and the quantity compared to the price was so little which was completely dissatisfying! The total bill was near about 700 rs which was a complete disappointment to the amount of food they gave! 

Next time , I went with mother. The ambience to my mother was a complete disgust. Dog hair flying all about. The tea was over priced and the only thing which was good was the chicken pakora! 


Overall not satisfactory except the dogs which can uplift your mood! Cheers to that!

Pets are well trained as well as the staffs. Food was also very delicious. We had grilled chicken, grilled fish with pesto rub and waffle with maple syrup. Liked the grilled chicken most...

Well the reason for visiting this place is the dogs and cats they keep so when we went there we tried baby corn which was pretty good and the Oreo shake and virgin mojito was okay but we didn't really like the BBQ chicken I don't know whether it's thw sauce or not but it tasted weird . Other than that the cafe is a great time visit .

This is a place full of happiness.. starting from jaunty balls of fur to great hospitality. A must visit for petlovers. And also to nice food. But I would say it's a better place for the vegetarians as they have a good variety of veg dishes. Though the non veg one's were also nice. Much more than just a cafe it is. A must visit for the pet lovers 😍😍 had chicken pizza thin crust. Chicken bharta which was okay and naan.

5/5 for this wonderful warm pet friendly place. Have been waiting to visit this, since the day heard about this place.. wish it was more centrally located.. u take ur pet along. N if u don't happen to have one, bt would love to cuddle, they even have their own dogs.. when we went, there was this 6 months old retriever named Rambo, and a Lasso named Gucci :) Also after 6;30 u can meet HUSKY named Ego <3

Coming to food, they didn't compromise with the food quality and hygiene. Our food tasted good, and the way our dog ate hi food, guess his food tasted good too :P

They are also very attentive​, in case ur dog takes a leak, they clean instantly.. don't miss on observing 3 dog portraits, that looks so cool n classy! 

Also to add, cat lovers can also cuddle cats. They have 3 cats too :)

Being a pet lover,this one had been on my bucket list for long .  There's a winding spiral staircase that leads up to the restaurant. The pet section is separated by a wooden fencing,and they follow stringent aseptic measures before entering it. And I went bonkers over the pug,Gogo,and the Golden retriever Marley. Adorable creatures !😍
Coming to the food next. We ordered a variant of their grilled chicken sandwiches,and pineapple mint mojito. The sandwiches tasted good,but the mojito was a tad too sweet for my liking.
The staff are extremely well mannered,and the restaurant lives up to the hype surrounding Kolkata's only pet friendly cafe.

Went there with one of my friend and my 6 month old dog OREO on a Tuesday afternoon for the first time. The only reason I took my dog along with me because everyone says its was a pet friendly restaurant.. So i thought my oreo would love being there and also he'll be able to meet the other dogs of the love room.

But It actually turned to be a nightmare for me as they didn't allow my oreo to enter the premises where they keep their dogs saying its against their policies. Please note my oreo is a 6 month old pomeranian puppy and is hardly 10kgs in weight with all his vaccinations done. He is extremely friendly and sober too. 

Anyway so we took a table in a corner and tied my oreo in a leash with the table. But he was already very irritated because of the long wait we had to because of the unavailability of table and now restricting his movements by tying him up. He started barking and whining and would not let us eat the food we ordered. 

It was complete let down as they say its a pet friendly cafe but doesn't have any proper arrangements for the guest pets. 

Talking about the food, we ordered a mexicana veg pizza and a penne creamy pesto pasta also a vanilla ice cream for my dog. Price was a bit high and food was okay. Staffs were courteous. I found it a bit overrated though.

This cafe is unique in its own way and cannot be compared with the other cafes of the city. We ordered  Peri peri chicken pizza, Brownie shake and Waffle. Food was okay. Like, who cares about the food when you're surrounded with such adorable fur-babies? The dogs are well trained and we did not realise how we spent hours in the play-arena cuddling and playing with the dogs. The cats here are adorable too. This has been an experience I'll cherish for a long time. This cafe is a must-visit for all the pet lovers.

This really cute cafe is located on the main road towards Tollygunge Phari, right next to the Mahabirtala petrol pump. The concept regarding it being a pet friendly cafe, is the first of its kind in the city and does justice to the same. We ordered a Penne Pasta in Cream Cheese Sauce, Cheese Fondue, two Lemon Iced Teas, Lasagna and a Kiwi Rita. The food was really nice and so were the drinks. I found the Kiwi Rita to be a little too sweet for my taste. But the dining experience and the service were appreciable. The ambiance is a standard one but I'd really appreciate if the music could have been a little louder. It was nearly inaudible. Keeping all this aside, the pets are to be talked about. They are absolutely adorable. At the time we went, there were 4 dogs only. No cats this time. But spending time with them amidst our visit added to the whole experience and made it worth our stay. 
Looking forward to try other dishes on the menu and meet the pets again, sometime soon.

Now this is a place I never thought would exist in this city, a place that not only allows you to take your pets (it should be vaccinated regularly), but also let you hug and play with their own, and boy there are so many pets in that place. I can only name a few. The primary attraction is a Husky and he only comes on Wednesday. Then there are one Labrador, one Pug, one Last and one that I don't know of. There are also four cute and beautiful cats roaming around the place (be careful with your food)  I am sorry that I don't have any photos of that Husky with me right now or the food because I was super busy hugging and playing with them. The food was also quite good. We had a plate of chicken wings in bar b que sauce, harissa grilled fish and chicken lasagna. I had an Earl grey tea and on the dessert we had one Alfonso mango ice cream and one coconut flavoured ice cream. The food was really nice, but the fish was too spicy for me. They said it was supposed to be spicy so who can argue. But the environment was really nice and the team is really friendly when you chat with them or make a conversation. But like I said, the real attraction of this place is the Husky and all the other pets. If you want to see the Husky go on Wednesday evening. It's the only day the owners bring him to the restaurant. Also, I feel like telling you this, I know hugging those beautiful dogs and cats can be really tempting, but remember they get irritated too. So take your turn and wait for them to come to you. They are really nice and lovable so enjoy them.on their terms. That's how you make a bond with them. To the owners and management, you have created something amazing. It was a pleasure to be there. See you soon. 

I only have one photo right now and I'm uploading it. Will upload the rest of the photos soon. Thanks.

Ok . This place is ideal for people who love pets. And i think this is the only pet friendly cafe in Kolkata. So my experience was really good as i adore pets <3. 
The mocktails were really good. And so were the tea and the coffee. XD
Now coming to the food. We ordered​ cheeseballs for starters and it was really good.
And we ordered a Zingara pizza well it is no doubt the worst pizza someone can serve. It was like they served the toppings over a big roti. So it was a waste of money. 
Recommended though for pet lovers.
Would love to visit again for the pets.😊

This place is heaven on earth for canine friendly people.
The variety of dogs and cats are overwhelming and acts as a laughter therapy session for all.
The furry friends are amiable and the hygiene is on point. If you comply with the rules, you can get your pet to the cafe as well.
The arrangements need to be made better though as we waited for almost 35 mins to get a chance to play with the dogs as there were others who didn't want to leave the play area at all. I wish there were a better set of rules so that everyone can get a fair chance of playing! Till the time you order, you have to wait to play with the fur babies. 
The glass windows with a busy street view and hilarious dog portraits add a fun and a slick element to the interiors.
The food was a big let down.
Ordered Chicken Parmigiana which was okay,
Chicken lasagna was too tangy and spicy for our taste, Chicken wings had a weird smell but they rectified the order again, Chicken Al-Kiev was okayish, the Cheese Balls were a joke because they literally charged ₹200 approximately for 5 small balls which can be eaten at one go and the presentation of sizzling brownies was amazing. The lime sodas were really good. 
According to the price, the quantity was really not filling. Can be visited if in the mood for finger foods and lots of cuddles with a wide variety of pets! Approximately ₹1k for two if you want a proper meal.

It was a beautiful experience. 
The food is a bit costly. But worth it. ❤
The plus point is they let you stay there for as long as you want. 
Make sure to meet Barney. ❤❤

The whole idea of a cafe catering to the comfort and needs of our pets alongside us deserves a big round of applause. The spacious ambience is very soothing. Their pets are very well maintained and they have a strong sense if hygiene about the dogs which made me very happy. There is a different set of menu keeping our furry friends in mind. 

For us however we ordered : 

1. Peach & ginger , Aqua blue : These were the suggested mocktails. They were refreshing but a tad bit extra sweet in the beginning. However the staff soon changed it as per our request. 

2. Chicken wings in BBQ sauce : Four big pieces of wings tossed to perfection in a spicy bbq sauce. It was good.

3. Fish & chips : This is one of my constant favourites everywhere. Here they served a wholesome portion of fish ; soft inside and crispy outside. It came with a side of boiled peas and a dip. Totally recommending this! 

Will come back again!

I heard about this place last night and was so excited I came here today for visiting fur buddies and evening snacks. I reached this place at around 4:30 in the evening.

Location : Tollygunje Circular Road going towards Taratala from Tollygunje Fari. There is a petrol pump Bharat Petrol pump this place is located few steps ahead of this petrol pump. Not very difficult to locate if you know this area well enough.

Decoration : The spiral Iron stairs leads to to the first floor and that is where the outlet is located. The stairs were spiral and was decorated with flowering pots. The outer walls are glass made and transparent to the outside view. The interior of this place is bery beautiful. Simple yet glamorous in its own way. The entrance is made up of wooden doors just to protect the fur babies not to get out.

There are two sections in this Oet friendly cage. One for people to eat and chit chat. Watch TV. Enjoy their meal. And on the other hand tgere is a section where the fur babies are let loose to play and enjoy themselves.
There are Five Four seater tabled and Huge Sofa with a table for the customers.

Upon entering the cafe I was welcomed properly by the Cafe manager and I was given the menu card and the instructions regarding interacting with pets. The menu card has a lot of options of my regular choices and the instructions were prettyuch apt. I loved it.

I ordered

Kit Kat Shake : The Kitkat Shake was really good served on a glass milkshake bottle and on the top was a kitkat chocolate itself. It was delicious and smooth in taste. Loved it.

Chicken Orange Salad with Goat Cheese : This Salad I had in another outlet was pretty much delicious. But over here the amount of salad which was served was quiet low in quantity and I didn't like it because of the bitter taste it had. Turn off!

Chicken Stroganoff : Chicken Stroganoff was something which I love the most and over here when I ordered it I was really disappointed because the chicken Stroganoff was very much salty in taste. I couldn't finish off the whole thing.

In the dessert I ordered Chocolate Icecream : The chocolate Icecream was really good. I loved it.

To sum up the food stuff it was pretty much ordinary if we compare to the prive range this place offers. The price is on the higher side although the quality of the food should be good. But it wasn't.

Now, coming to the real fun part is that I didn't just came here to enjoy my evening snack I came here for the Sheer LOVE of the cannines. When I entered there were only two of them over there. Bruce and Shadow. Bruce us very calm and playful while Shadow us very rufe. I was expecting the Golden Retriever to come bit it didn't. But later a 5 months old Indian Golden Retriever came his name was Rambo. Quite a jolly and naughty fella. The Husky Eco couldn't come because of the damn weather.

The owner of the cafe as I heard has 10 dogs and on every Wednesday the cannines gather over there. They're doing an wonderful job to let the people interact with these animals. It's a kind of awareness. I liked the Complete idea of this joint. So I've decided to visit this place next week again on Wednesday.

I also asked the manager to check on the food issue he ensured me to visit again and he'll help me out with the menu.

Looking forward to visit the place and try out other dishes and play with Cats next time. 

Cheers!

This was the first time the city has seen something like this, a great concept!
The décor, the service and not to forget the food,  everything was great and will definitely make you fall in love with this place. Hence, they got the RIGHT name for this right place!

The best place for a pet lover! Burny(golden retriever) is so very friendly and poses like a king! Ego(husky) is a bit egoistic, as the name suggests. No question about the hygiene, as some people might hesitate to visit. But frankly speaking the fury friends are so well maintained! We ordered chicken grilled sandwich, tea, pan cakes and a mocktail, all tastes so good! Wish to have some more pet friendly restaurants in kolkata! Visiting such places is a wonderful gift to present oneself!

They have 13 furbabies yet the restaurant is so clean that you will not get a single shaded fur of them here and there.

Cozy quaint little place, perfect for an afternoon or an evening out with friends. 
Absolutely loved the dogs- Gucci, Shadow, Bruce and Rambo. But really wanted to meet Ego the Husky and Pogo the pug. But the four furry guys who were there were so sweet and adorable. 
Spent less time eating and more time playing with the dogs, mostly with Bruce. 
A really amazing place for dog lovers and a must visit if you're in Kolkata.
The fish and chips and the brownie milkshake were just delicious. 
Going to come again whenever​I'm in the city. 
Came for the food. Stayed for the dogs.

The place is slightly difficult to locate the first time so my advice would be to take an uber. Otherwise 42B and 37 are some of the buses that go directly to the cafe. It's not very far from Rabindra Sarobar metro either. A spiral staircase leads to the cafe on the first floor which is cozy, well lit and nicely decorated. Coming to the star attraction which is the furry friends, kids from 4-15 years are allowed before 6:30 inside the play area. During this time only the smaller breeds like the pug, lhasas and the golden retriever are present. There are two golden retrievers...One is a pup...Rambo while Barney is a huge furball who is the most active and enthusiastic of the bunch. The husky Ego comes at around 6:30 along with the Irish setter tipsy. Though Ego is certainly majestic he's true to his name and doesn't like cuddles much. Tipsy is quite friendly and fond of neck rubs. The love that the dogs have for each other is evident in the way they get excited when one of their friends is coming. For those who are also cat people, there are 3 cats. One is actually a kitten. They usually stay fast asleep but are very soft and cuddly. As anyone who knows cats will know that they take time to warm up to people. 
The cafe is extremely hygienic. All the pets are well trained and there are two trainers to keep them in check at all times. 
The food is really secondary but still tasty and quite at par with other cafes. The chicken lasagna is quite filling and delicious. The chocolate ice cream is extremely rich and delicious. They have different flavoured ice creams available on different days. We tried the nolen Gur to our satisfaction. 
Coming to the pocket pinch, I found it reasonable. There is no vat, only 4.5 ℅ extra taxes as the service tax. The 3 of us together had a bill of 725. 
Definitely worth a visit and in case of animal lovers like me...Worth many many visits!

It is located in tollygunj circular road. From tollygunj phari towards new alipur, just after the bridge. Next to Dr. Lal's Pathlab.
This place actually does justice to its name "The Love Room". As you will feel love and only love. The only pet cafe in Kolkata. They have a total of nine in-house dogs or as they call them " Fur Babies". People owning fur babies are allowed to bring them as well. In house dogs are well trained and friendly. They also have a cat section with a total of three cats living. All the nine dogs are only available on Wednesdays. Extremely hygienic place and also safe for kids as well.
As for the food, it is average and so was the beverages. The only selling point of this cafe is the pets.

Dogs are really the biggest attraction.. N i truly fell in love with ego and tipsy... But i guess kids below 10 or 12 aren't allowed to meet the big bosses... They can meet the lil pups n smallers dogs till 5...so just make a confirmation about which breed is available to cuddle if you have lil kids.... Food is overpriced... But not pizza.... It is worth the sum!

Most of our kind tend to have a soft spot for canines and felines. Be it through our own pet dogs, or the furry ones next door or even the "funny cat videos" that keep flooding our social media feeds, the love for cats and dogs have been in our genes since eternity. This, is what The Love Room is all about.

Leading up to the cafe was a quaint flight of stairs till the first floor. Upon entering, I was impressed on seeing how well lit up the place was, combined with simplistic interiors, pretty wallpapers and a cosy enclosure for the seven in-house dogs. Hygiene is maintained beautifully, with shoe racks and hand sanitizers available outside the enclosure. Do ensure that you visit after 7pm in order to interact with all the four legged gentlemen out there. :)

Moving on to food, we started off with
(i) Aqua Blue, and
(ii) Orange & Peach,
both of which were totally refreshing in the peak afternoon heat. Aqua Blue seemed way too sweet in the beginning, which was politely fixed to perfection by the staff. 

The menu isn't really vast (and that's good!), comprising simple, no-nonsense finger foods alongside pasta and pizza.

(i)   Chicken Wings with BBQ Sauce : 
The chicken was soft, juicy and cooked to perfection. Four delicious pieces smeared generous amounts of sauce heightened our spirits already.

(ii)   Fish and Chips :
We were served a huge, succulent portion of fish enclosed within its perfectly crispy outer layer (whose thoughts are making me drool as I type), accompanied by a decent portion of fries. On the first look, you'd expect a more pleasing (read : bigger) portion of the fish, but then as you dive your fork into it and grab the first bite, nothing else seems to matter.

Service and hospitality were top notch. Good place, good people and good food. All garnished with endless hours with the lovely pups equals to a beautiful experience. A must visit if you love animals. :)

Cost for two ~ INR 1000.

I loved the concept of pet cafe... I personally loved each of the pets.. They were friendly and very well trained. 
Yet coming to the food, it is really high priced.. And I didn't like the food much. 
Spaghetti was good but chicken ala keiv lacked spices. 
Can be tried once to adore the pets.

This place was on my bucket list since so long. Finally yesterday i planned to come here with a friend because i had heard that it is only on wednesday evenings  that we can find all breeds of the fur balls . I loved the decor and the entrance , a perfect themed restaurant. The first thing that caught my attention was that all breeds weren't there because it had rained and they do not bring out ego and tipsy in such weather. Nevertheless i loved the cat , it was so adorable and loved sleeping on my lap . The dogs bruce , shadow and gogo were love. It took them just some time to open up and then they were running all around me and gogo was so active . I just didn't want to leave the place . I will be visiting again very soon.

Coming to the food. We ordered cheese fondue and sizzling brownie . Both tasted delicious . A bit overpriced but its ok to treat yourself lavishly once in a while. 

A lovely experience we had.

As you cross the road from Prince Anwar shah road,take the bylane from RSV hospital and go straight unless you spot this completely adorable and happy place.
The name is so so APT.
Being an animal lover, and more importantly a dog lover 😍 I loved the place. You get to bring your own pets, complying with their rules though.
And you have heaven right there.
We spent most of the time playing with the dogs, and they just took away my heart. Shadow, Brucee, Gogo were the ones we spent our time.
And FOOD here was really secondary for us, but the standard and taste was amazing.
Spaghetti Aglio Olio is recommended.
A big thumbs up to the managers and trainers of the pets here, doing a smooth job.

Coming back very soon!

Loaded with cuteness all over the place, this cafe is highly recommended if you are a dog or a cat lover. 
Having quite an amount of sitting area and ample space for the pets, this place gives you a cozy and comfortable feeling after a hectic day.

Staff: A big thumbs up to the courteous staff who have been supposedly trained really well and spread positive vibes all over the place.

Food: We had a spaghetti aglio olio. Which was really good. We were too busy in playing with the dogs so food became secondary for us. Though the other friends have greatly been impressed by its food.

Pocket pinch: Moderate. Average of 250 per dish.

End Note: If you havent been here with your pet, you havent gone anywhere. And if you love dogs or cats, this place is made for you.
A MUST TRY.

The concept of bringing pets to the restaurant is wonderful. I really enjoyed playing with the dogs there. There was only one cat but it was fast asleep in another corner of the room. A paradise for animal lovers.

Even the food is fantastic here. We ordered chicken wings in BBQ sauce (Rs 220/-), chicken lasagna (Rs 280/- plus Rs 60/- for chicken add on) and vanilla ice-cream (Rs 100/-). All the dishes were wonderful, especially the lasagna.

Amazing, awesome, fantabulous, wonderful, mindblowing, out of this world experience-- all the adjectives put together would also fall short in describing this place. It can be aptly called the Mecca for all animal lovers. There is a corner wherein you may go and play with the dogs. There's a husky, a golden retriever, a shiatsu,a Lassa, pug and many more. There are 3 cats as well who are cuteness overload-- Butter, Tigger and Sparta. Anyone who loves furry beings, should definitely visit this place. The food is also pretty decent. They have a pet friendly menu as well. Kudos to the owners who came up with this concept.

You'll never eat alone, coz your love will always be with you. Yes i'm talking about the first ever pet friendly restaurant opened in kolkata. It is near new alipur and easy to locate.The Elegantly decorated interiors are not to pamper you but rather for the dogs. All from pet doors to dog house gives us a visual treat.
We ordered ferrero rocher milkshake,fish finger,fried chicken burger and the love room special burger. The show stealer was the nutella waffles. Everything was top-notch. Staffs are friendly and will definitely help you make a good decision.
Pocket addition: Don't visit the place before 1pm, you won't see the dogs. Hangouts on Wednesday evening will make you play with lot of trained claws than the usual days. Best part you can treat your own dogs with dog beer and pupcakes.
Your visit will make you fall in love with the love room!

This place is ofcourse known for the dogs. Great concept, the pets are indeed really cute. The ambience is okay, usually crowded and people have to wait for 10-15 mins to get a table. The bad part is that they can not enter the pet area before they get a table. The food is okay, they take a long time to bring it. We tried the waffles, it was not crunchy thus didnt taste great. Pizza was okayish pretty spicy. Babycorn was okay too. The service can be improved. The waiters tend to have a careless attitude sometimes.

Excellent place to hangout just to relax yourself from your daily part.

Located in Tollygunge circular road just above the Bank of Baroda ATM. The place has a minimalist decor with the most adorable features in the world: Dogs. It is well maintained and hygienic under the circumstances of creating a open pet room fenced with protection so that the dogs can suffice their own playzone without disturbing the privacy of the restaurant. With an alternative shift there are 3 dogs mostly for a shift duty of 3 hours. If you are lucky enough to bump in Wednesdays after 12 you can see all the 9 dogs.

FOOD
Zingara Pizza - A large thin crust pizza which has a mixture of chicken minced in small breaks with cheese and olive garnished with special spices as the name suggests. Although the chicken went up nicely with the cheese but I felt the spices were not so strong to attract the pizza as individual speciality.

Non vegetarian Penne pasta with Alfredo red sauce - If you like penne pasta with cream and cheese then you'll definitely want to try this dish. Mixture of herbs with Alfredo sauce in red had a good essence of a red sauce pasta.
4/5
Chicken lasagna - The perfect dish for cheese lovers with cheese and chicken all over to make it more tempting and delicious to eat. You can see cheese and cream all over the dish but yes in an adequate amount. Okay! won't be biased but yes the food is really nice and recommendable.
5/5
Kiwi Rita - Well it's an innovative one according to the restaurant people with a sweet and sour feel. Would not recommend if you really want to suffice your thirst in a long hot summer afternoon but yes if you want to experience an innovation from the restaurant you can develop your taste buds with this drink.
3.5/5

HOSPITALITY
Hosting is really recommendable out here since they have friendly atmosphere all over but the only let down I have experienced during my visit is with their payment option since they don't accept any credit or debit cards. Although there is an option of Paytm wallet but this was a let down for me during my visit in demonatising period.
4/5

Very nice place,nice ambience ,you can play with the dogs as well and no service tax that's one plus point. If only the big dogs could be brought before 6.30 it would have been more nice.

This place is one of my favourites. The food is amazing. But the main attraction is those furballs who are definitely strong enough to steal people's hearts. The Love Room is a dog lover's Paradise.

This place is an absolute must visit for animal lovers! Located on Tollygunge Circular Road, it's got wooden interiors and two pet areas, one for the cats and one for the dogs. My friend and I ordered a strawberry milkshake, a mushroom soup and a non-vegetarian spaghetti with creamy pesto. The milkshake was nice and thick, not too sweet. The soup was flavourful and had plenty of mushrooms - could probably be improved with a touch of cream. The spaghetti was yummy, although I did find it a bit bland, though that could be because I generally like my food to be very spicy. Of course, the main attraction was the pets, and they didn't disappoint! Two cats soon appeared after their lunch, and they were great fun to stroke. We went into the dog enclosure, where there were three fluffy dogs with absolute quantities of fur, and a pug exactly like the one in the Vodafone ads! The pug was the friendliest and submitted quietly to being petted - the fluffy ones were scampering around a lot! This is a lovely concept, one can spend ages here. And I don't have pets, so playing with animals is extra special! Definitely check it out! :)

Are you an animal lover?The company of some adorable pets make you feel cheerful?The Love Room being a pet friendly cafe provides an opportunity to spare some of your time and be lost in the world of some adorable pets present in their cafe.Starting from Husky,Lhasa,Labrador,Doberman,Irish Spaniel,Shitzu,Pug and some other breed of dogs are to be found playing in the cafe.Oh wait!The naughty cats won't even fail to put a smile on your face. The quality and the decent price of the food make the cafe more attractive. Periperi Chicken Pizza tastes really very good. The time spent at The Love Room cafe over some good food and coffee in the company of their well trained pets would make an individual cherish the moment forever.

The most adventurous anyone who does not have a pet at home can get is visiting this place. Food is great. Nice cosy place and the most exciting part is getting to play with beautiful dogs. I can't expect any cats in a roomful of dogs obviously, but would like if they expanded it to that portion in the future as well. Its lovely for a great hangout place. And I absolutely heart how they give the bill in a dog's bowl.

^What greater selling point can there be that you get to take your four-legged friends with you to lunch? The Love Room is the answer to all your problems. No more smuggling your pets into restaurants by hiding them in your bag! Say goodbye to the guilt of leaving your best buddies and hello to bonding time! Give your best buddies a treat (literally) with a swig of Dog Beer or maybe a Pupcake?

I think this place does not even need any rating or review. It's the most beautiful place I have been to. With so many little paws running towards you and wet noses rubbing your cheeks, this place is nothing short of a dream. The amazing food is the cherry on top of an already delicious dessert. A place to love. A place to treasure.

It's located near Tollygunge, above a Bank Of Baroda Branch.
The cafe houses several dogs and cats, an is must visit for all the pet lovers out there.
The in-house pets are kept in a seperate fenced area, you can go in and play with them (but lifting and hugging the pets in not allowed).
One can take their own pets along wih them to the cafe, they even have a specially crafted fur-baby menu for the pets.
The staff is friendly and well-behaved.
The ambience is nice, with big dog portraits being put on walls.

We went there on a Sunday afternoon.
Sadly the Cats and the Husky were not present at that time.
But the dogs present there were playful and hyperactive.

We ordered:-
French Fries- Not evenly salted, but nice.
Garlic Bread- Cheese topped garlic bread, was really very good.
Veg Lasagna- Creamy and tasty.
Kit Kat Shake, Nutella Milkshake - Nice.
Spaghetti with AOP sauce- It was undercooked, so didn't taste good.

The food and ambience was nice.
Even tough I am not a dog-lover, still I loved my experience there.

Would definitely love to visit this place once again, with the hope of meeting the cats.

It's a cafe located near new alipur. The ambience of the cafe is pretty cool. The main attraction of their cafe is their fur-babies (once you visit you will get to know) . It's the only pet friendly cafe i have visited and liked it a lot. The food quality is also very good. Looking forward to visit again.

Kolkata has a reputation as a city that's not particularly pet-friendly but that's set to change now.  It is located near tallygange. Loveroom has a special areas for pets. The visitors who want to go the other side,have to take their shoes off. The staffs will give you the sanitizer to wash your hands before entering the pet's section. The decoration is awesome. Set up by a passionate duo, this Tollygunge café, which opened last year.  will allow pet owners to spend quality time with their fur babies. The café will have its own set of nine pet dogs for people looking for cuddles! yes i forgot to mention there is also a cat section. 

Coming to the food : food is testy and very pocket friendly . i ordered for a coffee and melon & watermelon salad . coffee was fine and that salad was full of with pomegranate , mint, arugula and watermelon, tossed with virgin oil. sufficient for one person.  which was just perfect . i was in hurry so i could't taste other preparation. but i yes am gona visit very soon for taste some food and for those cute lil puppies :)

The only restaurant where pet lovers can hook themselves is the love room.after entering you will be  able to see all pets are roaming around though there is a barricade in between the room.food is well enough staffs are also friendly.my main purpose to visit this place is to cuddle the cute pets though one of them named ego is quiet egoistic as he didn't like us and was shouting at us continuously .😁

There's no tax, but of course what else do you want when you see such cute puppies all around you and you get a chance to play with them. This place is a piece of heaven among the hustle and bustle of the city and do visit it once guys!

In Kolkata I haven't seen any pet friendly restaurant this is the first one I have seen. The interior isn't that much but the quality of food is good, staffs​ working there are friendly but the amount of time they took to serve a dish is really too much we waited for more than half an hour. You can take your own pet with you in the restaurant. Overall it's a very good restaurant and I liked it.

As the famous phrase says" looks can be deceptive" , in this case the name is deceptive. The Love Room fails to live upto its name. From being named as pet friendly cafe its quite the opposite. My friend brought her little girl Heidi all the way from KANKURGACHI to give her furry little girl a good time, which ended up unsuccessfully as we were not allowed inside the cafe. According to them her vaccination was not upto date , while the veterinary doctor has postponed the date due to medical reasons. They thought they are more knowledgeable than the doctor and refused to budge. This was just not all , you are only allowed to look at the pets or just pat them once or twice, maximum take a selfie. They will constantly come and interrupt you from cuddling them by saying dont pick up dont cuddlw or touch so much. The staff has an indifferent expression on their faces. The pets theee, are just as showpieces flaunting their breeds which is quite shameful. And this is not the first time even my friend faced it when she wenta few months back. As an ardent animal lover i was quite put off by their obstinate and arrogant behaviour. If you love your pet definitely dont  visit the love room as your pet may get insulted. Looking forward to a pet cafe which will opened by a real animal lover where the pets will be allowed with respect. Very very disheartening experience.

A very nice concept and a first of its kind in Kolkata. There are two pet arenas, one for the dogs, the other for cats. The animals are very friendly and will not harm you. The restaurant is spacious, has good food and does not charge extra taxes. We took a peri peri chicken pizza which was loaded and very tasty. We also took the chicken wings in barbeque sauce, which could have been better. However, it's a perfect paradise for animal lovers.

Two pet lovers, some cuddly fur babies, bright decor and good food. That is love room. The cafe houses several dogs and cats for all the pet lovers out there.
With a specially crafted fur baby menu alongside a stellar cafe menu, this place is the stand alone pet themed menu in this city. Any cafe in this city is marked good or bad by the food it has to offer irrespective of the theme.
The love room has quite an exciting food menu to offer. A few highlights from the menu are,
The watermelon and melon salad, BBQ chicken wings, Harissa grilled fish and classic nutella waffles!

Cute place with some really epic portraits of the dogs 😄. When I visited there was a husky and a cocker spaniel. Very cute dogs. Everything about this place is alright except the grilled chicken which I ordered. It was more of a mashed potato dish. The chicken seemed like an accompaniment to the mashed potato instead of it being the other way round. For starters, we ordered cheese fondue. Well, it was good enough. Not sure if I'll be visiting the place again. For people who love pets can go there to play with the dogs but won't recommend anyone to go there with an empty stomach like I did.

I've been waiting to visit this place since a very long time and finally I made it to "The Love Room" which is located at Tollygunge Circular Road, Kolkata (full address below).
So, the most exciting part about this cafe is its a pet friendly cafe.🐶 The love room is the first pet friendly cafe in kolkata where you can bring your pets along with you and spend some quality time with them. Also, those of you who don't own a pet love room has got a couple of them for you😉. They have 9 resident dogs in total and few are always present there to play with you. Trust me they are so friendly and omg!🙈 literally nothing can match their cuteness level. 
I went there on thursday at around 1:30 pm and there was 3 dogs present there at that time. They bring others after 5pm🙃. 
Okay, now coming on to the food, it was pretty good.✌🏻️
We ordered 3 different dishes meat lover's pizza, chicken stroganoff and chicken wings.
🔹 "meat lover's pizza" 🍕( Pic-1&2) which contained of salami, sausage and olives. It tasted good and would be sufficient for 4.
Price- Rs.390/-
🔹 Next thing we ordered was "chicken stroganoff" ( Pic-3) 
This is something you'll enjoy only if you are not a fan of spicy food and prefer to keep your lunch simple. 
Sufficient for 2
This was for Rs.290/- 
🔹Lastly, we ordered "chicken wings"(Pic-4) it had two choices bbq/tangy sauce we took the barbeque. 
It was really delicious and had 4 pieces of chicken wings. 
Price- Rs.220/- 
Really enjoyed playing with the furr babies and having lunch at the love room. Surely visiting them again really soon. Do visit this place I assure you, you won't feel like leaving this place.😌🙃
Also, you can follow them on insta or facebook @theloveroomcafe to know more about this place.😊
Address- 36, tollygunge circular road, above bank of baroda, kolkata.

Only a pet lover will understand the feel good  factor  of this  place. 
We visited this on a monday afternoon, the ambience  is well made and we completely enjoyed the presence  of dogs and cats. We can bring  our pets too.
All the dogs have pretty fascinating  names. (Shadow,  Gucci)
Although  husky and pug was missing but they  had valid reason  for  their  absence.
We ordered a lasagne which  was average. The service  was pretty good  but dogs are kind of non friendly.
Overall the place  is nice. Must visit.

Food: The food was good. We ordered All Rounder and Virgin Mojito as Mocktails. As a starter we had Chicken Popcorn and our main meal consisted of Chicken Stroganoff. To end it with,we had Sizzling Brownie. The food without any doubt was very yummy and the quantity was normal. 
Service: They were very friendly and should i say..helpful in choosing our food menu.
Ambience: It was nice and comfortable . The dogs....Ego(Husky) is so sweet and adorable,naughty even;Shadow(Shih Tzu) is always over excited...hahaha..,and they had a Lhasa Apso and a mixed breed who were simply beautiful. The cats for the maximum time were sleeping..Everyone tried to wake them up but they just simply ignored us.They must be feeling very tired..But I should say they all are well trained.
There was this lady who brought her labrador to  celebrated his 1st year birthday here. Thank you so much Love Room for opening such a pretty restaurant in Kolkata for all pet lovers here..
One thing I really want to say is that it would be nice if you increase the playing space for the dogs and the cats. They need a bit more space. Keep it up!!!

So a pet friendly cafe finally here in Kolkata! After a lot of plans getting cancelled , I finally go a chance to visit this place.  The cafe is on the 1sd floor and there is an iron staircase to go there! We went on a Tuesday and all the dogs were not present at that time :( We ordered Chicken popcorn , veg lasagna(non-veg wasn't available) and french fries. The french fries were almost tasteless ! The quantity is a bit low compared to the price ! But they totally deserve 10/10 for maintainence and ambience. We plan to visit on a Wednesday next time since we got to know all pets are there on Wednesdays! ^_^

It's a pet friendly cafe with adorable little pets. Had the pleasure of meeting Shadow(shitzu) and Gogo(pug).And the staff is very courteous and well trained with how to handle pets. Loved the wooden interiors and the fence that separates four feet from two. 
BUT it's extremely unfortunate that the food was such a let down. The aglio olio was dripping of oil. Would put reliance petro's godaveri offshore oil refinery to shame. As I write this which is 2 hours from our visit I have a terrible headache. And I feel it's the oily pasta to blame.
The fries could have been a little crispier on the outside and were a little undercooked. Hope these are taken care off in my next visit!

Hey guys, this is an amazing place to visit and though the quantity of food might seem less it's very fulfilling. We order Peri Peri pizza, spaghetti with creamy pesto sauce, au gratin and Mexicana pizza.
Starting with the pizzas they're delightful. However a little more cheese will make it amazing. It's filled with bell peppers which I do not like and I guess there are people who does not like it as well so it's better if they reduce it a little. Otherwise a pizza is enough for three persons. And it's tasty. Au gratin is a dish containing cheese (yummmm) and filled with cube veggies and papaya and pineapple. If you're not a great fan of veggies do not go for it. Lasgna will be a great choice then. I however loved it and we were 4 and it was totally fulfilling. We made a wrong choice in the sauce used for the spaghetti and didn't like it much, others might like it, individual choices. We took two bottles of water, one was complementary I guess. Tax is inclusive most probably. I was happy about the food
. Talking about the fur babies we had only two which I was sad about, while we were leaving we met Ego and two other different breeds of dogs, while we were there Bruce and Shadow were the ones we played with. Had a lovely time and I would suggest everyone to go.

Loveroom Is the first pet friendly food joint in Kolkata. It is located near tullygunge. Loveroom has a special areas for pets. The visitors who want to go the other side,have to take their shoes off. The staffs will give you the sanitizer to wash your hands before entering the pet's section. The decoration is awesome. The staffs are friendly and well behaved. Now come to the food, we ordered French fries, chicken wings with bbq sauce and fish fingers as starters. You will definitely fall in love with the wings. Then we ordered zingara pizza which was not so good. We tried a mocktail named all rounder. We ordered sizzling brownie with vanilla ice cream as dessert. This joint proves that happiness comes in food and four paws.

The Love Room is in Tollygunge and is quite easy to locate. The place is famous for the small little dogs found in the cafe. The food is not very good, especially the oreo shake which tasted like nothing but ice. The food is average and so is the service.

Going to the ambience of the place.. this place is nice and comfortable. I like the fact that we the visitors are given hand sanitizer to use before touching the dogs and wishing your hands after playing with them provided with soap in the café itself. Adding to it, the dogs are not kept well. The dogs are kept inside a small area fenced on all sides which is not a pleasant thing!!

The in-house dogs, 7 in number, are extremely well-trained. They stay in the cafe by turns and at any point, around 3-4 are present at the cafe. The eating section has been fenced away from their play-area, and willing visitors can enter the play area, but only after taking off their shoes and disinfecting their hands. I somehow couldn’t muster the courage to go onto the ‘other side’ but two of my friends didn’t waste two seconds before entering the arena and cuddling the curries. In addition to the dogs, there are a few kittens too, with a separate corner to themselves.

At Loveroom, not only can you see, hold and cuddle the pets there, but can bring in your own pet too. The visitors can now have a meal with their pawed babies here, and there’s a separate menu for the pets too where one can choose from. The only conditions are that the visitor’s pets have to be on leash and properly vaccinated.

Now coming to the food, Loveroom has come up with a new, revamped menu, of which I tried out quite a few things. They have a Melon and Watermelon Salad, with pomegranate, mint, arugula leaves and a drizzle of balsamic dressing. It looked like a party on a plate, with the bright, summery colours. It tasted fresh and hearty, and is a must try for those who love salads.

The Chicken Wings were good too, but I am not too much of a wing fan so I skipped that and moved onto the other things. My favourites, apart from the Melon and Watermelon Salad were the Harissa Grilled Fish, and of course the crispy Chicken Ala Kiev with an ultra buttery core, over a bed of smooth mash and peas. Aaah!

The meal ended with warm Waffles with chocolate, whipped cream and fresh strawberries. And with that, there was no way I could not love the Love Room 😍.

Most probably Kolkata's first pet friendly food joint. 
I found it on Zomato. This newly opened canine and Feline themed eatery caught my attention instantly. 
One fine day went to check it out. Main reason was obviously the dogs but I found they opened a cat section too. Ordered meat lovers pizza, Oreo milk shake and brownie milk shake. Thin crust pizza was brilliant and Oreo milk shake is worth mentioning. 
There I met Mr. Gogo, shadow. Looking forward to come again.

"Untill one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened"
- Anatole France 

Perhaps that's the concept which has led two young enterpreneurs Ankush & Shruti to come up with a brand new concept, that the F&B scenario of Kolkata has ever witnessed -

"THE LOVE ROOM"

The first ever 'pet friendly' restaurant  of Kolkata welcomes everyone hereby to walk in and be a part of a complete new experience.
Located on 'Tollygunge Circular Road', the restaurant  exudes the exact charm through its ambience where one can enjoy some delectably delicious  bites, while the pets move around and play, letting you enjoy each and every moment of your stay. Even one can bring his/her own pet in the restaurant , as there is a list of specially prepared alluring offerings, which can be an absolute delight 'for your pet', apart from the provision of safe keeping!

So, what are you waiting for??!! Walk in, and be a part of an experience worth cherishing!! 😃@

A one of a kind cafe - A room full of furballs!

Due to my special affinity for dogs, this cafe was on my bucket list.
So this is owned by Ankush & Shruti & I happened to meet Ankush when I visited the cafe. Opened around a year ago, he owns about seven dogs. You are allowed to bring your own dogs as well.

Food- Small chicken sliders: The chicken patty was crisp on the outside & soft on the inside. The burgers also had other usual ingredients such as caramelized onions, lettuce and a slice of cheese. These were accompanied by a small portion of fries which were perfectly made crisp. Overall, a good dish to try.

Nutella Waffles: These were a treat to my eyes. Served with fresh cut strawberries with cream on top, the warm baked waffles won my heart. A generous amount of nutella was drizzled on top making it look drool worthy. Do give it a try!

Ambience: I like the concept of putting a huge fence in between to segregate the dining area from the dog play area. Not every person is pet friendly & due to this fence, Even non-dog lovers can visit the cafe with ease. Its a spacious cafe with dog portraits being put up on the walls.

Hospitality: Ankush, the owner, was humble enough to answer my questions about the idea germination & etc. The staff informed us about sanitising our hands before we enter the dog play area. A thumbs up to this routine of hygiene again.

Overall experience: Overall, its a great combination of good food along with dog watching. A great concept. Do visit the cafe to build your love for dogs!
Thanks Saurabh for having me invited.

The love room is located on the way to new alipore from tollygunj phanri on the top of Bank of Baroda in the same building.
Decor- Decor is amazingly soothing, clean , customer friendly, prompt. Very well planned playspace for all fur babies.
Food- We had ordered chicken popcorn which was okay . Crispy chilli baby corn was tasty. Sizzling brownie was good too with one vanilla scoop. Quantity wise it could have been better.
Now coming to the actual theme, making it pet friendly , it has quite a large space for the doggies to play. 3 Lhasas, one retriever and one pug were there in the afternoon. They keep rotating the pups. All of them were extremely adorable and will make you cuddle them in their very first sight.
Frankly, being an animal lover, what i noticed is as soon as the cafe got crowded many people got into the fenced area with the only motif of clicking pictures with the dogs. As i could see they werent really comfortable with such unwanted human attention.
This cafe is a very good idea to come up with, but the very fact where animals are involved , they must not make them do anything against their wishes. Allowing so many people to disturb them just for pictures is not something i personally encourage.
Rest being an utter fan of pets , it was a delight to be there. :)

Located on the way to new alipore via tollygunge, which is also the tollygunge circular road is the present heart throb amongst pet lovers of Kolkata. Now I know why, as you move up through the staircase you find blackboards with drawings of different dogs, cats making the thematic relevance. They have two storeyed cafe, but the upper one was closed so me and my friend sat down stairs where the pets are. 
It was amazing ambiance with the dogs and cats felt like home, the breeds they have is really of a good choice plus all of them are happy to take selfies and meet new people 😁.
Anyhow, we had cafe latte and day's special milkshake. Presentation was nothing brilliant but taste was so good of my milkshake! 
I am yet to try out their food, so saving few words for the next visit!

So today I along with one of my friend decided to visit this place. We actually were excited to play with the dogs. But from the moment we entered we were hugely disappointed. The place has a nice ambience, but we were hugely surprised to see so much less options to order. We decided to order the barbequed chicken wings, Virgin Mint and Iced Cappuchino. The current menu is not available on Zomato. The service was clumsy and very bad. They took a lot of time to take our order,then they served us our beverages but we had to wait for another 30mins for our food to be served. The Chicken wings were not upto the mark, though it was priced moderately. Then we went to play with the dogs but they were not at all well trained, the trainers didn't had any basic idea about dogs they were unable to control the dogs. It was merely a zoo as there were no restrictions or discipline followed. At a time we found around 10 people trying to take selfies with the dogs. No one cared to follow the mentioned rules and even the management was careless. I advice them to atleast take care of the animals as those living things are  earning them money.

The Love Room

The first ever pet-friendly AND pet café and restaurant in Kolkata, The Love Room is a must-visit for pet lovers in the city. You'll be greeted by a family of nine adorable, furry canines, and if you're more of a cat person, even four kittens. The owners, Ankush and Shruti, have put in a lot of dedication behind the pets, and it really shows.

The most innovative bit here is the specially curated dog menu – a full four-course meal! You get two soups, four different snacks including pancakes and tacos, six different mains complete with pizza and steak, and three varieties of desserts including a frankly adorable cupcake. We wouldn't really be able to tell you about the taste, but the dogs surely seemed to love it. You also get dog beer here if you'd want to share a drink with your tail wag, and the owners are also working on introducing cat wine to the menu, soon.

Moving on to what's on offer for us humans, The Love Room's new menu includes two soups of the day that keep changing. Our mushroom and vegetable soup was fairly decent, but a tad too heavy. The menu is still somewhat basic, but offer quite a few popular choices. For instance, you get cheese fondue, cheese balls, chicken wings with a choice of barbecue and tangy sauces, and more. The chicken wings we sampled were well-flavoured and crisp, but was probably slightly overcooked. The taste, though, is quite strong and enjoyable.

Italian cuisine heads get seven pizza variations and three pastas in four sauces, and four salads. The melon and watermelon salad we sampled was sautéed in olive oil and garnished with feta cheese – a rather unusual combination. Nevertheless, there is a distinct freshness to it, and yet it carries its own weight. It also serves the purpose of looking quite interesting, sprinkled with pomegranate on a watermelon bed.

You also get two variations of burgers – veg and chicken (fairly simple there). In mains, the vegetarian a la Kiev is quite well-cooked, but we would have liked a little more flavours and butter. Perhaps the best dish we sampled was the grilled fish in pesto rub – not just well-cooked but presented really nicely, with strong flavours to suit most palates. The pesto base is wonderful, with the fish being grilled to near perfection.

Our journey at The Love Room concluded with waffles served with strawberries and fresh whipped cream – enjoyably light after a full course meal. You can also add on Nutella or maple syrup for an added charge, for added sweetness. Those who favour light desserts would definitely love this. The Oreo milkshake seemed quite popular, garnished with an Oreo on top, and the virgin sangria is also refreshingly tangy.

The thing is, The Love Room is a restaurant for the pets where you also come to enjoy a hearty meal, and not the other way 'round. You get a sense of affable hospitality as you can walk in with your pet any time between 11am and 10pm, and even get to spend time with one of the in-house fur balls. Be sure to say hello to Ego the Siberian Husky, and you will be leaving The Love Room with a bright smile on your face.

We only wish the location was more to the main road as that would have made The Love Room more accessible. Seeing how they attract a hearty football in peak evening hours already, you may soon see a new branch opening up somewhere else in the city. It is a wonderful, unique experience that is bound to bring a smile to your face.

I always longed for a pet when I was a kid. I had parrots, a rabbit and even an owl! But I could never keep a dog owing to the fact that I have been living in small flats all my life. So must have been the case with most of our friends and readers. If you are a dog lover and would trade your bae for a pair of soulful eyes, four paws and a tail then you are reading the perfect thing now!
                                                                ...

Don't want to leave your fur baby at home when you're out with your friends?
No worries!
Take them along (Don't forget the vaccination card)
Well, for starters you can try the French tries, chicken balls, chicken pocorn.
For main course, chicken lasagne and chicken a la Kiev.
The quantity of fish and chips is good as well.
I liked the fresh lime soda.
They have special food for your pawed babies and they serve them water as well!
Play with the other fur babies(There's 9 of them) who will be equally ready to make your day!
Best part?
The food comes without taxes.

The theme is really cool and the place is awesome! Had an awesome experience with my friends! Being a canine lover, visiting this place was first priority and then as i expected the place did not disappoint me at all! Ordered perri perri pizza which was on the spicier side but the ice cream really soothed the taste buds!! And hanging out with my better halves (🐶) made my evening! 😇😇

We went there on Valentine's Day, a perfect day for showering some love on the babies present in this cafe. We opted this place just to go and play with the dogs. The staff was extremely friendly and cordial. Waiting here for a table is never an issue because you can play with the dogs while you are waiting.
We played with Gucci, Bruce, Gogo and Shadow in the beginning. The dogs are well trained and playful and they were kept in an enclosure so they never bothered the other people who were having there food in the dining area. We had ordered pancakes and Oreo shake. The shake was rich and thick and I really loved it but the pancakes were disappointing. It was dense inside, instead of being light and fluffy. After finishing our food we waited till 6 for Ego and Tipsy and it was worth the wait. Ego was so playful and he looked like he owned the place and Tipsy was always happy and ran about the entire place. I loved my experience there and for a dog lover this place is really awesome. We also saw the kittens which were rescued and those furr balls were busy playing with themselves. The cafe maintains strict rules for customers playing with the dogs and its amazing to see that being the first Pet Cafe in Kolkata its doing a great job... Love you guys and I will come back again to meet the fur babies.

Location-Tollygunge,Kolkata.

The Love Room is the first pet friendly cafe and is quite different from regular themed cafe that are opening these days in the city.They have a different section in the cafe for dogs where one can go and play with them.The whole place has been given a wood finish and the ambiance is extremely calm and soothing.The service is also extremely fast and reliable.The food served is sufficient for two and the dishes we had were just finger-licking.We had

1:Cheese Garlic Bread-This garlic bread comes in a foil wrap and inside you will find the whole bread flooded with cheese.This was just finger licking.

2:Oreo Milkshake-This oreo milkshake was just the best we ever had and the presentation of it was also excellent.

3:Nachos-These nachos were quite regular in taste.Nothing much to say about it.

We would definitely love to visit this place once again just to try their other varieties in food and oreo milkshake.

Food-4.5/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Service-4.5/5

Forget the food... just go there for the love. 
Usually am very particular about food when I choose a restaurant or cafe, but this is definitely an exception. Am not saying the food is bad. It's just that I did not pay too much attention to it because I was too busy playing with Barney Stinson, Shadow, Gucci and Mr. EGO. 
The place is aptly named. The minute you enter the place, you are greeted with a warm woof! Happiness has paws here. 
In love with the place.

Where do I begin?
This is the best place a dog lover can ever go❤

The place is on the first floor above a bank of baroda branch and is quite easy to locate. The place is neatly decorated, though minimalistic but neat.

Now the food, we had the chicken fried burger and oreo shakes. The oreo shake was amazing and had the right amount of everything. The burger was pretty good as well. The chicken patty was pretty thick and tasty. The burger comes with a side of french fries.

Now coming to the most important part.
The furbabies ❤
My God, they're absolute cuties.
The owner has 9 of them, which visit the place in turns.
When we first went in, we were welcomed by Bruce, Gucci, and Shadow. They were pretty jolly and playful.
After playing with them we ate, then came the Golden Retriever, Barney and Gogo, the pug. Those two were on a different level of energy. Specially Barney.

For anyone wondering, they are kept in a separate area and will not come to your tables. You can go and play with them only after taking your shoes off and sanitising your hands.

P.S. There's also two little rescued kittens. I didn't get their names but they were sweet.

Overall,
Ambience - 9/10
Food - 9/10
Puppies - 100000/10❤

Would highly recommend.

Amazing place for dog lovers, with great ambience and cosy seating arrangement. The place has nine breeds of dogs. The decor is simple yet elegant.

Now coming to my order:
Pineapple Mint Mojito: Satisfactory.

Oreo Milkshake: Delicious.

Mushroom Sandwich: Delectable. 

Nachos: Good.

The Love Room Special Burger: Definitely the best burger; pretty huge with four layers!👌

The staff was courteous and service was top notch. Undoubtedly worth the money.

Must visit for all the pet lovers.
Must visit for all the 'not so pet lovers' to enjoy the food.It was awesome.
Must visit for all the 'pet-haters'(if there is any) to go there  and see their view changing.
The service were courteous and perfect.No doubt about that.You will feel homely.
The dogs are quite well-maintained and trained.
I omitted .5 as the food is  a bit costlier (on an avg 50 bucks)than others but it is justified looking at the taste of food,the ambience, the welcoming, and obviously the fur babies.See u soon 😊
And try Lazania here. You will love it😉.
Happy dine-in to you.

This place has been a talk of the town in recent times for being the first pet friendly café in the City of Joy. Came here with my sister today who is an avid dog lover. To be honest and frank, I am afraid of dogs and I came here only for her. In this regard, it is important to mention that the dogs are really friendly and they are so well trained that they will hardly bother you while you're dining unless you're interested to interact with them. There are few rules that the café has imposed which you have to follow and I think it's perfectly alright to maintain the hygiene and health of both the clients and dogs. The way how the dogs welcome you is really warm. When this is coming from a person like me, who is utterly afraid of this four legged furry creature, you have to be totally okay with it.
The place have nine breeds. There were one Golden Retriever and two Lhasas today. Management keeps on rotating the dogs. All of the breeds remain present only on Wednesday from 5-7pm.
This pet friendly café hosts a pretty ambience, well lit up, dogs can stay in the enclosure or roam around. If you have a furry friend at home, you can also take them over there but they are not allowed inside the enclosure.
Food was good. Not excellent. We ordered -
Milkshake of the Day - Nutella Milkshake it was. The flavour of Nutella was strong, with a dollop of Nutella and a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream on top. Loved it!
Waffle with Maple Syrup - This too was pretty good. Baked perfectly and the maple syrup had a tantalising aroma. Nice.
Chicken Tikka Kebab - There were six regular pieces of kebabs which were tender inside and crisp outside. I didn't like it very much as it was too spicy and the waffle's maple syrup saved us for it. If you have a spicy palate, go for it. Also, the pudina chutney was thick and nice.
White Sauce Pasta - Penne with add on chicken made with a super thick white sauce. While you make pasta, the fluidity of the sauce is very important. Too thick or too liquid, none of them is granted. In this case, it was the first one. Hence, this too was okayish. Something I will not recommend.
Pricing is a bit on the higher side. The food wasn't great but not bad at all. Overall a good experience it was. Service was prompt, warm and courteous. The best part was the time with the furry friends people had over there. Although I didn't enter the enclosure but I had a great time seeing my sister and other people at the café playing around, cheering loud with such lovely creatures. Will come back again for this experience solely. Happy Dining! :)

I loved this place. Just loved it. The Decor was simplistic yet elegant. The staff was extremely courteous. 

The food. I had the best burger ever here. Best! It was huge, had 4 layers between the buns. To wash it down with I had a lemon iced tea which was just perfect; not sour not ,too sweet. Just perfect. Along with these the fish fingers were succulent and very fleshy. It was served with tartar sauce. 

Now the most important bit about this cafe are undoubtedly the pets. The owner has nine dogs which are regularly rotated during the course of the day. I was lucky to have been in the presence of the sweetest retriever-Barney and the naughtiest pug-Gogo. We are allowed to play with them after sanitising our hands. It will just make your day.

I did not find any downside to visiting this cafe. Everything about it seemed perfect. Please visit this cafe. Show some love! Peace.

If u are an animal lover,then this is the place to be.And,especially if you have a pet dog,then you can also take him/her along with you.When,I came to know that a pet friendly restaurant has opened up in south kolkata,I was really excited.The owner has 8 dogs.
The Siberian husky named Ego absolutely stole the show on a saturday evening when I visited this place.Besides,the golden retriever,cocker spaniel are also there.If you are an ardent dog lover,you will fall in love with the place.
Now,lets come to food part.I ordered Cheese fondue,cheese balls and pizza.The food was really tasty and the prices were also reasonable.
One can also try the varied mocktails and milk shakes here.
The staff was also very polite.
Special mention to the non-alchoholic dog beer which I bought for my dog(Coco),a cocker spaniel and he loved it.
Overall it has a great ambience.

It was great to see pets play. I wish the pets are not meddled with all the time. The pug was too cute. I would have loved to meet lhasa apso and shitzu. Keep it up guys! Hope you have something like it in Bangalore.

Really a paradise for dog lovers. The restaurant is elegantly decorated and when we went there Gogo the Pug and Shadow(Lhasa) was there to greet us. They r very cute and highly professional n trained dogs. They have a nice play area where u can play with the "fur babies" and take photos with them only after u have sanitised ur hands. Now coming to food, we ordered Virgin Mojito and Pineapple Mojito of which Virgin Mojito was much better. We also ordered chicken pizza which was thin crust and was pretty good. A must visit place for every dog lover.

Good if you are going to play with the dogs but obviously you have to order food so there goes the weakness, horrible food and DO CALL BEFORE YOU VISIT coz all dogs aren't available always.

The place, the dogs , the staff, the food, the ambience .. everything is just perfect. You can just never get enough of this place. The best place you could think of to spend some quality time with dogs and your friends. The friendly and welcoming behaviour of the staff would make you wanna come here again and again and again.  And the food is also yum and you can fill yourself up without burning away your pocket. One of my favourite desserts among others is the sizzling brownie. Brownie served on a hot sizzler topped with icecream and chocolate sauce. That is some heavenly thing. You might also wanna try pancakes and waffles too. So the next time you're anywhere near, do visit this place.

It is probably the first pet friendly café in Kolkata and it certainly doesn't disappoint. Located on Tollygunge Circular road with the bold welcoming sign of the place and glass walls, it isn't a hard find at all. The café has got a lovely ambience. With so many friendly faces of the canine species and good food, it is a pet lover's paradise.

You are allowed to bring your own pet here It's maintained very well with proper hygiene; all the dogs are vaccinated and the staff is very friendly. There is a special menu for your pet dog, so they won’t feel left out while you are enjoying your snacks!

Let’s move on to the food!

Mocktails:

1.Virgin Cosmo - A fusion of Cranberry juice, triple sec syrup and lemon. It strikes a nice balance between sourness and sweetness which makes a really refreshing drink. The flavour of cranberry and lemon makes the drink standout.

2.Orange Basil Mojito - It’s a soothing drink prepared with a combination of orange, basil, lemon and soda. The touch of basil gives this drink an extra dimension that makes it a crowd favourite.

3.Kiwirita – This is cucumber based drink with pineapple syrup and with chunks of kiwi. The fruits were fresh and this drink turned out be really a smooth and clear one.

4.Virgin Sangria - The presentation of this one caught the eye. It's served in mason jar with mint leaves and slices of apple, lemon and orange in it. This is a colourful drink, revitalizing with the nice smell and freshness of the basil.

Titbits:

1.Chicken nachos - Simply nachos as we know it and though it was nothing special, it was a nice dish. There were generous toppings of cheese, sour cream, olive, onion and capsicum. The only drawback was that it had too much vegetables in it which was sort of overpowering anything else on the dish.

2.Lasagne- It looked delicious on the plate, but it did disappoint a bit on the palate. It wasn’t cheesy enough like the traditional lasagna and could not really bring out the classical flavour of a lasagna.

Cost for two: Rs.800

WOW! What a place to spend your time with the cute and playful dogs and its completely fine if you abide by the rules while playing with all of them!
The food is really worth it,  I had the ginormous juicy burger after which,I was  literally gasping for breath but really relished each bite! The tandoori was finely cooked, good quality of food I must say and the place although far but you people should go there to refresh your mood! Not a single dog will scratch you or bite you, they are playful and indeed friendly! The price is a bit high, not too much which I think because of the maintenance they have to put! So, go there, enjoy the good food and have fun!!

A wonderland for cynophiles, Love Room is surely one of the best places to spend lovely time with the 'fur babies'. Being a dog lover, one cannot help but fall in love with the adorable creatures they have out here. Ego, the husky grabs all the limelight but it was hard not to notice the pug's infant innocence.Sandy The Golden Retriever was so friendly and so were the Lhasas.It was sad to see some people irritating them just for the sake of selfies. The fur babies were exhausted and needed a break. 
Coming to the food, we took the Chicken Mayo Sandwich and oreo milkshake. The sandwiches were decent and well grilled. They served it with French Fries. The milkshake was nice too. Friendly staff and excellent service made the experience really good!

The love room, initially I thought it must be some place for couples for celebrating their kind of days, but was surprised when I got to know that it is a place where one can actually cuddle the furbabies.
Located near the RSV, Tollygunj Tramdeport on top of the the Bank of Baroda to be presice, this place caters to a variety of Italian dishes, indian dishes, sandwiches waffles and mocktails.
The place is nicely decorated and has 9 furbabies. The staff is quite friendly and helpful. Rakesh was the person who made us aware about the rules and regulations.
Coming to the food, we ordered 1 chocolate pancake with white sauce, 1 coffee latte on our first visit. The coffee was excellently made, but however, the pancakes did disappoint me a bit. On the second visit we had orange mojito basil (which was beyond perfection) and margarita pizza ( the pizza crust tasted more like the cream cracker biscuit).
Managing furbabies and food at the same time is tough, but I would really sugest you guys to pay a bit of attention to the food section.
But, thank you Team Love Room for sharing your knowledge about furbabies and keep up the good work. Best Wishes. ☺

My 2nd visit. I won't say it's one of my favourite places, rather it is the most favourite destination. 😍
I have no words to appreciate this place.
The food is something to die for and the fur babies,no matter how much you love them it's just not enough.

The staff is so good and friendly. The staff member I interacted today with was extremely cordial but sadly I don't know his name.

The lasagna is a must try. So delicious. 😍
Can't wait to visit again. 💟

First of all to the guys who gives -ve comments to a restro should really be careful with their reviews
1st i want to point out that as some people said that its like a mini zoo there and They aren't happy. Not at all. There's always a guy or two with the dogs to make them comfo.
2nd its spacious enough for a husky to run around.
3rd as some reviewed that the lasagne isn't as much as it costs. Yeah the quantity isn't sooo much but its a multilayered dish so its heavy and make you full.
So far as the hygiene related concern, one word 'NEAT'. we were lucky enough to encounter and play with siberian husky. They are well trained and friendly. 
Food is yum. Ambience perfect. Stuff 5star.

Why such a bad rating? because I haven't seen sadder dogs than the pups here.  Firstly, why is the space so small? the dogs can't even move freely. they definitely deserve free space to move. plus whu are they forced to interact and play in the afternoon? its their nap time and they were so damn tired when we reached. they just wanted to be left alone and sleep at that point. Very sorry to say but a person who understands animals can never like this place. Also how do you even allow people who don't like dog go inside and yell? I feel rather sorry for the dogs. Also none of them are spayed/ operated, If you're really responsible owners I think you know how important it is for their health. on top of it the ACs werent working properly and the dogs were restlessthe drinks were very bland and over priced for the quality you provided.A lazy saturday afternoon was wasted and why am i saying this? because I've been to pet cafes in other cities. if its really a pet cafe, where's a menu dedicated to them? also been to creches but never saw such unhappy faces. Take it from a person who had fur babies all her life. I felt like its a mini zoo. :)

It is I guess the first pet cafe in Kolkata. My friends and I were all very excited to visit this place and finally got the chance to hop in there. The place has got a very warm and cosy ambience. There's a separate place for the dogs. You can get inside and play with them. When we were there, we were welcomed by Gogo - the Pug, Barney - The Golden Retriever, and Tipsy and Shadow (don't know which breeds they were). Okay, I personally am extremely scared of dogs..but lately I have been trying to develop some love for them..and that was solely why I visited this place with my friends who are just crazy dog lovers! 😄 And the only dog I could dare to spend time with was cute little fluffy Shadow 😊 We stayed there for quite a long time and clicked many pictures.
Now, coming to the food. It was a bit on the costlier side as compared to the quantity which was way too less! Although my friends were not happy about the quantity but I guess that's completely fine cause they are giving an extra facility to play with the dogs without charging anything extra for it. So I personally feel its justified. We ordered for Chicken Lasagne and Mized Sauce Chicken Pasta (350 bucks each) Our total bill came around 745 bucks which means very little tax.
Altogether, a great unique experience. A MUST try for all dog lovers out there.

Overall a nice experience!

To pamper ur dog, treats and meals are also in the menu. The must try dishes are chicken satay, chicken parmigiana ,chicken zingara pizza and sizzling brownie.  Price is very reasonable. Pet parents need to produce vaccination card if dogs come along. Would love to visit the place again and again.

Ticked off the wishlist, finally! Amazing place... And equally amazing minds behind the cafe. The owner, Ankush was present there at the moment, we had a chat with him too.
The staff are totally cool especially Rakesh who helped us from the time we entered.
They are extremely particular about their rules and regulations that you need to follow, anyhow.
We visited this place with the sole intention to play with the dogs, so didn't really order much.
We had lasagna with chicken added onto it. It tasted great, just the quantity was a bit less compared to the price. Our bill came to Rs. 405, taxes included already.
We spent a solid 2.5 hours playing with the dogs. Barney, Gucci, Shadow and Gogo who were there at that time.
Can't wait to get back.
Awesome time guaranteed.

More like the war zone with my dogs. To begin with love the concept. It was long over due. The place is exceptionally well maintained and the staff keep it spotless. Not easy with dogs peeing every where. You know the staff handles dogs very well. This is a dog lovers paradise specially if you love the cuddles and free parking . Also loved the play area which had some 3 dogs hopping around. Good place to hang out as a family if you don't want leave the pet at home. Now for the cumbersome bit. 
1. The metal stairs leading upto the cafe is not suitable for mid sized dogs like mine. Do ask to use the other stairs. 
2. The interior is beautifully designed but bar stools when dogs on leashes are running around is a disaster waiting to happen. 
3. The food takes forever. We ordered 4 chicken satay which was nice but served really really slow. 
4. This place is still only cash. Tough during demonetized times. They don't have a vat or tax component in their bill either and they have opened up good 2 months back or more. For 4 vanilla ice cream and 4 satay we paid 1300 that's without taxes.

I not only love the place and the ambiance but loved all the staffs and especially the owner Ankush with whom I met and had a good chat.
The way they made things comfortable for us.
Pet lovers must visit this place and most importantly if you carry your pet then no need to pay any cover charges.
Maintained highly with hygiene, cleanliness, smiles and good food for both pets and us. Besides you won’t feel and difference between the love room and other restaurants in the city.
Encouraged to know more plans and projects are coming up soon in Kolkata for our dear pets.

All the pet lovers know that the socialization of the pets are very much needed and there must be some provision that they can play with each other. They too need to make new friends and spend time together. So, hope to have this very soon in the coming days.
A+ for this great initiative and hope to receive the same awesome service forever. Cheers guys.

The name, though tacky, is exactly what this place is. A room where love is as pure as it gets. The food was good and affordable enough to get this place a 4 star rating but what makes give this a 5 are the dogs. Yes you can interact with them, cuddle them, sit with them for as long as you want to. A minimum bill of 300/person (150 for students) is required but it is more than worth it. Not a romantic place at all, but if you are looking for a place that will instantly lift your spirits. This is it. The waiters are friendly and there is no VAT involved. Probably my favorite restaurant of all times.

Initially when I heard the name of this cafe, all I thought was, wow, that is tacky! But when I found out there are DOGS involved, all the thoughts flew right out of the window. We reached Love room by car which isn't very far from tollygunge and even has parking for about 2-3 cars. Upon entering guests need to pay a sort of cover charge to enter the premises which isn't really an issue, the cafe owns 9 dogs and keeps rotating them, when we went there was a pug, a golden retriever, a shih tzu and a lasha. Some of the dogs have funny names and I must add, they are absolutely well trained, they let the humans play with them, no barking nor any licking goes on. That in my opinion is a wonderful thing.Coming to the cafe aspect, hygiene is maintained to utmost standards and I didn't find anything wrong with any of my food or drink items even while sitting right next to the fence where the dogs are kept. I ordered the love room special burger which comes with 2 pieces of fried chicken, a fried egg and cheese and even though I had skipped lunch, I could not finish the burger.

Overall, if you're someone who loves dogs this is the cafe you must visit, it is absolute bliss, ended up spending 3 hours at this place and not realising. The service is on point as well and somehow, unexplainably there's a friendly atmosphere created by the staff.

I apologise, but I guess this is the only restaurant till date which gets a 5 star from me, can't deny the dogs that!

The ambience is great. Great place for foodies and animal lovers too. We had white sauce pasta and sandwiches both tasted good and quantity was sufficient for two people. I went there with my pogo. There were other dogs too. This is a pet friendly cafe and the behaviour of the staffs are good specially with the pets. They have got their own dogs too. There's a Siberian huskey it is probably the star of the restaurant and the retriever, lasa all of them were very cute. They are separated from the guest's dogs i wish they could play with pogo. Overall a great place to have snacks and spent quality time with your four legged friends. Here are some pictures of us.

Walking in to a cafe without your dog would never be a problem again. Kolkata has its first pet friendly cafe now. Welcoming the furry creatures, big and small is the one-and-only Love Room.
Besides its warm ambiance and highly maintained setting, the cafe also serves to you delicious plates of food. This includes a diverse variety for your furry buddies too.
When we first walked in with our little spitz, she was welcomed and showered with love regardless of her fiesty attitude towards them.
Not taking that to heart, we all were shown our seats.
We first ordered their Kiwirita- base of which is made out of cucumber. Adding a splash of pineapple syrup and Kiwi with chunks of fruits was our tasty drink. A full marks goes to this one.
With this we had a plate of Aglio Olio pasta. As you might be knowing, this dish does not have a sauce. The main ingredient is olive oil. Another ten on ten on taste.
Since we liked their earlier drink so much we ordered another one called Virgin Sangria. The presentation was spot-on- served in mason jar with mint leaves were slices of apple, orange and lemon. The flavor of this drink did not disappoint my expectation either.

This is a must visit for all...both pet lovers and non lovers. The hygiene of the cafe is very well maintained as well as for the dogs. The staffs are very cooperative and decent. The food is also good and reasonable. Planning to go one more time before i leave the city and this will be in my checklist whenever i am coming home.

The Love Room. The name itself has an amazing and adorable feeling. Heard of it many times from my gf and at last we both planned to visit there. We specially wanted to go as we both are extreme pet lovers. So finally we visited.
As we entered we were desperately in search with retrievers and labradors. But for the time being they had lasa and shitzu. Then we sat down and ordered some food. 
We ordered two Aqua Blue and Chicken tikka achari. Trust me guys they were delicious. Loved the ambience. The serving and welcome by the staffs was very warm. Then we ordered laccha partha and chicken bharta which was another two mouth watering dishes. 
The best part is the proper care and maintenance of their pets. The rules before cuddling the pets are always followed by them and even we customers abide by them.
The soothing music always going on heating up the ambience even more is one more plus point.
Everyone should visit this place without any hesitation. It's amazing!!
It's a fabulous concept brought up in Kolkata. 
And pet lovers it's a place for you guys man.! Go cuddle with the adorable babies😘 
For non-pet lovers, trust me u are going to transform to pet lovers after meeting them. Keep it going Love Room. Keep up the good work👍🏻✌🏻️
Thank you :)

For non pet lovers,do visit this place for the ambience and the food.The dogs present here are very quiet and well trained.You won't even feel their presence,if you don't want to.

12 in the afternoon I walk into this cafe..only to be welcomed by deafening discotheque music. Upon requesting the management to kindly reduce the volume, they kindly refused stating that a private party was going on. Not too happy about that.😐 establishments hosting private parties should not be open to public, at the same time.
Okay coming to the food. We ordered cappuccinos and a coleslaw sandwich with chicken as an add-on.The first sip I took of my coffee, there was dog hair in my mouth. Now I know a lot of effort goes behind conceptualising and running such a place, and they are doing a good job in keeping the cafe clean(note-hand sanitizers on each table), but hair(of any kind) in my food is irksome. The sandwich was decent. 
Nonetheless, the dogs,were the ones who stole the show. They were very friendly and cute. But(and this is my opinion) the cafe must upgrade their food quality.

Have been waiting a long time for reviewing this place.To begin with,I must say the location is really terrific and eye catching.Secondly,Fabulous job by the whole team in maintaining such a clean environment.When it comes to the food,I was a bit disappointed.We ordered nachos,chicken popcorn and baby corn,all of which failed to match my expectation.The milkshakes though were really very good.However we definitely had a great time playing with the dogs(Irish setter,Lhasa apso,shit tzu and the golden retriever),while waiting for our food.That being said,the Irish setter and the shit tzu were looking a bit weak.Hope to see them in full bloom next time I visit.

Unusually beautiful
Well the restuarant is placed near mahavirtala on the right hand side.
From outside it is well decorated and looks damn grand. I like the architecture. Well after entering inside...one would be awestruck to view the very adorable Lhasa apso and other dogs (shadow,pogo and whisky)playing at a corner. Nicely decorated.
Well coming to the food section. Comprising of normal cafe to indian cuisine to Italian too. Well I found the vegetable Cutlet and English breakfast damn lovely. The crispy cutlets were damn good. Highly recommended for all foodies. Well the pizza was not available today but it will be available from November. The hospitality of the staff was very warm. Great concept. A must go for all.

Love room love for you... A #deadlycute concept of restaurant I have ever seen. glad to know that it is the first of its own kind in eastern India.. Although I love food but I simply visited this place out of my passion for the cute buddies they have...had a great time playing with them.. Coming to food we had ferrero rocher shake.. chicken mayo sandwich.. chicken satay.. and burger which they suggested as special one... Honestly for foody people this might not be the right place...as, if I visit next time I can have the satay and sandwich as  those were very good..but will not have the burger or the shake again.. Well as I said I went here only for those cool buddies..so it's pointless pointing the flaws of food. All the 5 points for you bani, whiskey, shadow, pogo and bruce... Next time I will bring your friend as well... And the points go for the decor, the hygiene, the smart staffs who will treat you in their best way.. Thank you :-)

This is the place you need to visit if you are a dog lover. It is located just near Mahabirtala. Igo and shadow were the most notorious as well as lovable dogs. Each and every one of the pets were extremely friendly. I've read all the reviews and I agree with most of them. Extremely hygienic cafe with all the sanitizers placed at every corner of the room. Room freshener and cleaning tools are always ready if a pet manages to excrete . Ambiance was great and good quality music was being played which was an added bonus . Coming to food, I had Aqua Blue (It was great and I recommend this one) and Chicken Lasagna (There were more veggies than chicken, I would prefer full on chicken if I'm ordering non veg) If it was a normal cafe I wouldn't have given 4.5 rating. All your pets made me soooo sooo happy :)

Amazing place, friendly owners and staff and ofc, 
very very well trained and well looked after doggos. 

Their cover charge concept is totally legit and understandable and to be fair, it isn't all that much either, especially considering they really have no time limit for how long you can stay and play with the dogs. 

Yes, their food is average at best but honestly I think with time that'll improve. 

I would recommend this place to everyone who loves dogs.

After planning for a long time,we finally visited this place today - the first pet friendly cafe in Kolkata !!

Located just on the main road,it was quite easy to find.They take a cover charge of Rs 350.If you are a student,they take Rs 150.This will be deducted from the bill amount if the latter is greater.
The decor and music makes the ambience fabulous.The best thing is that in spite of the pets,they maintain such a hygienic environment.They have kept sanitizers in all the tables.

Coming to the food,we ordered Ferrero rocher shake and Chicken Satay among the starters.Both were delicious.Chicken satay is highly recommended.In the main course,we had Chicken Zingara Pizza(not mentioned in the menu provided in Zomato) and Chicken Parmigiana. Both the dishes tasted awesome and the quantity was enough for three of us.For dessert,we took sizzling brownie,which was very delicious too.They do not charge extra tax on the food.

The service was pretty good and the staffs are friendly.

Now,the biggest highlight of this place is that they have dogs with whom you can play and click photos as long as you want to.You can also bring your own pets.The dogs are very friendly,playful and full of energy(though sometimes they need rest :P).It was a really good experience to play with them and cuddle them for as long as you want.

In a nutshell,they serve amazing food and it is the best place to hangout for dog lovers like me !!

Will be visiting again soon :)

So, this place is one of its kind. The very first cafe in Kolkata that not only caters to your needs but also your four-legged friends'. This is a pet-friendly cafe. Yes, so if you're out on a walk with your dog and feel like grabbing a quick bite or a drink, this is the place to go(literally, cause no other cafes would probably allow your pet inside).

So, we took a sandwich, which was pretty okay. An avacado drink which to be honest wasn't the best tasting drink in the world but the burger, the BURGER. OMFG! That deserves a paragraph of its own.

I personally have never tasted a worse tasting burger ever. On the contrary, for the price which I paid for it(180 for a chicken burger), you can get one of the best burgers in town from 'burgerU'. The buns were okay but the patty, well, the patty was non existent. It was actually a chicken cutlet and not a meat patty. Upon enquiring, I was told that its a chicken cutlet burger, if there is such a thing at all.

Don't get me wrong, place is not bad, it's a really nice cafe but you don't want to go there for burgers.

Overall, it's a great effort with a new concept but the food is not really why I'd give this place a visit until next time.

First ever pet friendly cafe in Kolkata. Very much loved the concept. Finding the cafe is not tough, located on the main road only. Parking is available. 
Now you can take your pets along and hang out with your friends at the same time. Going to be very favourite hangout place for many like me. There is lots of open space where the pets will feel free to roam around. 
Wide range of mocktails, and starters. Tastes are amazing. Liked the service of the staffs. Specially the kind of hygeine and cleanliness maintained is inpressive. Staffs here are always at their best to serve you. 
Overall, loved the cafe and the concept. And the amazing foods and drinks just adds more reason to why you should visit more often.

The Love Room symbolizes  as the name goes ie a room full of love and positive energies with the presence of many fur friends. It's a wonderful initiative taken for all pet lovers. I took my 1 year old Sophie (Lab) to celebrate her birthday yesterday and as expected it was a wonderful one. The hosts takes a lot of personal attention to all their guests. This place is conveniently located just after crossing the bridge of the Tollygunge Circular road. The host shared a nice gesture by wishing Sophie on her birthday and gave her ice cream as her treat. The food was great as well. Had Avocado milkshake, waffle, chicken satay and mushroom omelette.

The place would get you going for the sake of dogs. The first pet cafe in Kolkata, really grabbed attention. Love the concept :D
If you want, you can take your pets, or hang around with the pets of the owner. This place was dank :D
We had...
cheese fondue, chicken popcorn, Veg burger, chicken burger, love room special burger, Lasagne and white sauce pasta.
We even had ginger peach and Virgin mojito for mock tails. And a sizzling brownie for dessert.
The food is not at par with the price, but taking into attention the setting and the ambience, it's pretty alright. If you are a dog lover, this place is for you!

I could totally spend all my life here. The very idea of putting up a pet friendly cafe is very special. The concentration is all drawn away to the dogs from the food part. The ambiance is very good. The dogs are well maintained and are very friendly. The behaviour of all the attendants were very polite. The food is good. However they should be more specific and detailed regarding the entry rules.

Must admit that the concept of a pet friendly cafe really grabbed my attention. Various blogs and fb mentioned that there were nine dogs which were already present for those people who wanted pets but were not allowed to keep one. And pets from outside could also be brought in once the management approved that they were vaccinated and tick free. Totally fair. So I happened to visit this cafe a couple of days back. And I can't get over how disappointed I was. Firstly, there is a cover charge of Rs.350. Feels like an entry fee to a zoo or something.Tbh, It really felt like one. A Labrador, an Irish setter, a shih Tzu and two Lhasa apso lay there absolutely still in a small confined space amidst such loud music. Being an animal activist of sorts, it really hurt me to see such friendly dogs so confused and irresponsive. Coming to the food, we ordered a virgin sangria, classic lemon iced tea, chicken mayo sandwich and a fried chicken burger. The burger was undercooked and the fries were stale. The sandwich was good but had very little amount of filling. 
In a nutshell, if you promote animal torture please go to this place because the food isn't worth the prices at all.

The experience was wonderful and the concept of bringing pet and having a pet friendly place where owners,their pets and also pet lovers,can come together and have fun. The atmosphere was very homely and having dogs there,just made me and my friends over excited. Not only was the atmosphere epic,but the food was amazing........ We had ordered certain dishes which we always try at other places and honestly, the food here was one of the best tasting food...........I would definitely suggest everyone to come nd try this place once and if u r a dog lover then this place is a must for u.

Turn left from tollygunge phari,near RSV hospital,go towards new alipore and keep looking on the left foot. The cafe is  on the first floor and second floor is under construction may be. 
Overall experience is good.
Because the staffs are so polite. They are dog lovers, that defines their attitude as humans.
Food quality is good. Food option is less,may be it is new that is why. Menus are to be reformed and many other items should be included. Otherwise everything is perfect.

Wow....what an amazing expierience today. This cafe is one of the best I have ever been too in a long long time. The dogs are too cute. Though im personally scared of dogs but these cute little sweethearts made my day today...and the decor is beautiful and clean and hygenic. Perfect for me. And to top it all was the amazing food . I ordered a Chicken Parimiagana....it was served with mashed potatoes and garlic bread and some veges. ...loved it thouroughly. Then I requested the person attending me to make me some drink out of the menu ....and wow...this gentleman named Rakesh made me a Cinderella mocktail which was amazingly refreshing and too good. He did not only keep to my request to make me something different but also was very corteous. The owners Shruti and Ankush are brilliant ppl and they made it very sure that I was comfortable. The desserts menu looked interesting . But I had no space for them in my tummy..I really wanna try the lemon cheesecake and Bailey's mousse asap .....so I'm definitely visiting again in a few days and waiting to cuddle the dogs and try out some more amazing food and desserts. 
Good food is my weakness.
All the best .....THE  LOVE ROOM rocks !!!!!

If you are a dog lover, then this is exactly where you must drop in. You can also get your own pet if you are willing to ( but make sure they are well behaved in public, else it will be a mess.)
This cute and newly launched cafe is near Tollygunge Circular road.
The moment my friend and I entered , one of the staffs greeted us with a smile. The dogs were inside a fenced area inside which we can enter by keeping our shoes out.
This Cafe is a 10 on 10 in terms of cleanliness. Each table has a bottle of hand sanitizer kept for the customer's use. There are certain instructions(provided on a leaflet ) which one needs to follow while handling the dogs.

Coming to the food that we had ordered:

Avocado milk shake. ( Highly recommendable. )

Mixed sauce chicken pasta. ( Is tasty but a little bit on the tangy side. )

Cheese balls. ( Needs to improve. Adding Mozzarella cheese would help probably.)

Overall the place has got friendly staffs, good ambience ( with all the dogs barking :p ). All together it was a cute and lovable experience inside the fence with the dogs. Long way to go for Kolkata's first pet cafe. 🐶🐶

Great concept! Pet friendly cafe. You can get your pets or if you do not have one you can come and hang around with the pets of the owner. This place will be a great mood lifter. The food is great too. Ordered a veg pasta in white sauce, veg grilled sandwich and waffles with Nutella. The waffles were so fresh and warm. The pasta too was creamy and full of mushrooms as requested. Will definitely visit again. They are coming up with full Indian menu too and will start delivery as well.

It's wise that you guys came up with an exciting theme in Kolkata and also the food menu looks quite excitingly new for Kolkatan's who have not traveled a lot but for the rest I am sorry to say it will not be worth the cost.

The cafe is situated on the new alipore-tollygaunge phari connector... If you take an auto from new alipore towards phari then the cafe will be on the right side... The name is written in red.... Currently they have three Lhasa (gucci, shadow, bruce), 1 golden retriever (barney who always remains calm and ready for a pat), siberian husky(ego and he is very much energetic and runs around everywhere but he too is very adorable), pug, bulldog and some other... Their foods are excessively high priced but among them pastas are the only tasty ones....the cheese balls were really excessively crunchy so we couldn't eat all of them... They have hand sanitizers at every table to be used before heading towards the dogs.... And they also have some instruction to maintain about playing with the dogs... Overall its a new and innovative initiative to have a pet friendly cafe and a dog lover can enjoy the time there but they should definately reduce the charges...

The main attraction are the dogs with whom u can play and click photos. the restaurant feels open and airy because it has not been congested with tables wich i like. now comes the most important bit, the food is really good. tried the lasagne and it tasted delicious.i have fallen in love with this place and will keep visiting and to all of u who want to try it out, my advise to u is....go for the dogs, the food is a bonus....😊

Very nice place, it was about time Kolkata got a pet-friendly restaurant. I was missing that, to be honest, a place where I can go grab a bite and take the pooch along. So today I went to check it out: décor is nice, 5* for that, staff is smiling and helpful, and cutest dogs around you. What can you ask for more? Coming to the order: we ordered Virgin Mojito, Virgin Cosmo and another one (forgot the name😁) but they were all excellent. Garlic bread was nice, quite different than what you usually get in other restaurants, and sizzling brownie was delicious. All in all, had a pleasant time. The only minus is that their menu is not very varied, but I guess they'll add more items soon. If you plan to go, make sure you get your pet's vaccination card along.

Nice little cafe with good food. The lasagna is great and worth a shot. The doggies are the main attraction and hence worth a visit for dog lovers. All in all, we had a great time with Barney(Golden Retriever), Gucci, Shadow and Bruce (All Llasa Apso). Go in the evenings if you want to meet the Husky. Price could be lower but keeping in mind the concept of the cafe it's quite all right.

As for food,  we had nachos and oreo shake. Nachos was good, oreo shake could be better. Don't go here just for food. The dogs will makeup for anything else you feel lacking. I'm definitely coming here again!

Being a pet lover, my review is going to be biased but if you really like to try new places and want to cuddle with the little balls of fur, well not talking about you Ego (he happens to be a husky!), You should visit them. The food is good and the options are just about right.

The Love Room – The FIRST PET CAFE in the City of Joy! 
=====
Intro & Location:

The Love Room is a pet friendly cafe and belongs to one of my beloved friend.  I had visited this cafe yesterday with one of my close friend. The cafe’s logo was glowing red from the outside and is situated on the first floor. As soon as you climb the stairs, you suddenly feel lost into the pet’s. The music, the pets jumping around specially shih tzu and lhasa makes a person drool. The best part about the love room is that they have specific instructions on how to deal with the pets and have hand sanitizer in each and every table so as to keep it clean and hygienic as necessary. Another thing to be pointed out is that people can bring their pets but they have to keep them in the leash. The staffs are quite courteous and it’s quite a new cafe. The ambiance of the place has been kept simple and there is a special area for pets where the customers can just go inside and play around with all of them at once. There is a special store supplies love room which is coming soon so stay tuned!! Currently, they are focusing on Continental dishes. They will be incorporating Indian food soon.

There has been some fuss about this cafe being in Tollygunge but let me clear it out. This cafe is located in 36, Tollygunge Circular Road which is between the stretch of Mahabirtala and Hindustan Sweets. More precisely, near the Ganges Residency or the SBI (T.C. Road Branch).
=====
What i had:-

• Avocado Shake – It was really good. I personally loved it. One could get the crushed avocado in the palate. Highly recommended. ✌✌

• Mix Sauce Pasta (Chicken) – The mix sauce pasta was really good. The portion size was enough for two. It was a little tangy and i have already given my feedback for improvement. The chicken was added enormously so that makes up for it. ✌✌

• Cheese Balls (Veg) – The presentation of this dish was excellent. However, it was a lot more crunchy and there must be some more cheese inside it. Overall, it was nice.
=====
Pets you will find here: 

• Lhasa Apso

• Shih Tzu

• Siberian Huskey (If you may be lucky enough, you might spot it)

• Irish Setter

• Golden Retriever

• Cocker Spaniel

This place has recently opened at tollygunge circular road. It's the first and one of a kind dog cafè in Kolkata. I was thrilled to visit this place. My friend and I had come here and we had peach ice tea, lemon ice tea, nachos and stuffed mushrooms. The ice teas were good, the taste was well balanced and they were not too sweet. The nachos were good too, although a few more vegetables would have uplifted the dish. Something like more cheese, sour cream, capsicum, onions , olives , could have been used. Nevertheless, the taste was good. Coming to the stuffed mushrooms , the coating was a bit hard. But the mushrooms inside were tender and cheesy. The dip was served as a smear and consisted of mayonnaise. Lastly we had waffles which were really good, as though they resembled cakes and Nutella was served with it. 
We finished all this in a hurry only to play with the dogs. They had four dogs there at the time , but we were told more would be coming. You can even bring your own pets there. I think it's a great startup, for animals and human beings and I wish them good luck for the future.

Woof-Woof! WooHoo! Kolkata or Calcutta as we like to call it, now has a pet-friendly cafe. There’s much to celebrate. The Love Room opened it’s doors yesterday to both four-legged and two-legged beings. The owners, Shruti and Ankush are both pet-lovers and, felt that our city needed a place where you could go for a nice meal and take your pet along. The cafe has nine resident dogs and great food and accompanying drinks. We tasted the starter fare and their cranberry sangrias and were blown away. Wait for a bar to open up soon too!
