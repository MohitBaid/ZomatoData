The dessert items are so good but the savoury items are not so tasty. But the cakes and breads are really fresh and tasty. The price range is average.

I had whiteforest cake and rainbow cake.  Amount was 120rs in total.  Rainbow cake was not good,  the base was not at all soft.  The whiteforest was just okay.  Not a very nice experience.  So many staff are there.  They assisted me to choose the cakes and everything and after that the taste is not good.  Please improve the quality cuz u had high expectations.

Tried their donuts. They were neither fresh nor soft. 
Had a bit of difficulty chewing them. 
Tried another paneer savoury item. It was decent but nothing wow!

Had this outlet in my wishlist for many days...  Finally went there to try some pastries.  Belgian chocolate it was,  not that soft... I expected it to be dark bitter taste but it was very sweet.   I think they need to bake more fresh stuff.

The white forest cake was not that great. But the quality of the cakes are very commendable here. The variety is also good. Prices are affordable too.

This is an outlet of Paris Bakery in Nagerbazar. I would firstly like to appreciate the warm welcome and attendance of the staff of the place. I visited the outlet with 2 of my friends, we ate some savouries, and pastries. The vegetable patties and the pizza was amazing in taste. We further had vanilla cupcake, and mud donut both of them which tasted fresh and amazing.

Went to the bakery today evening. Loved the variety of fresh breads, cakes, biscuits nd pastries.
All the items r nicely displayed and the staff is very friendly.
I picked up the white forest and the Belgian pastry.
Both the pastries were dry and I think they weren't fresh.
Prices are normal but no point eating stale pastries.
I might try their breads, but no more pastries for me.

A small cake shop located near China Mandir bus stop. It has a sitting arrangement of around 4-6 people. The staff is friendly and professional. I tried the red velvet pastry and fresh fruit pastry. Tasted really good. The price tag is reasonable. One of Thr best bakeries in the area. Must give it a try

I had expected a lot more from this chain given my experience at Paris Bakery in Bhubaneswar, but i was really disappointed. The food was not fresh and the staff showed indifference when we pointed out the our order had mushroom, when we had specifically asked them not to put mushroom. The overall experience was not good...and I don't think I will ever consider going there again.

Recently opened outlet near the jora mandir bus stand in bgauiati. This outlet is still not visible in zomato though but within no time it has a good impact i guess.. me n my friend while decided to check in the place with what they are serving.. as we entered we could see a wonderful cozy place which is beautfuly decorated with all the food displays they are serving and fresh baked breads on one side too.. not only its about cakes or pastries here.. they serve a good variety of savouries too including cookies, puff, mixtures and many more.. the price is also very pocket friendly i guess. This place though has a seating facility for 6 ppl. They also have a menu fr the table too which has pasta, burgers and sandwiches too.. but it serves only vegeterian which was a great thing fr my friend..
We decided to order for a cream fudge chocolate pastry, masala panner roll and a baked samosa to gulp on.. evrything just tasted perfect but somewhere i felt the bread of the masala roll could have been baked more as it tasted somewhat raw from inside.. the baked samosa was unique with a potato and vegetable stuffing inside.. the pastry was creamy as expected and fresh too..
While billing we got an additional discount of 10% too after showing the corporate card to the cashier..
All these we ate at a pocket pinch of just 86 bucks (including tax and disc) ..
So a definately recommended place for all the foodies.. give it a try.. cheers.. üëçüëçüòäüòä

A small cosy bakery with fresh breads, pastries, confectionary goods, all that a bakery should have. The staff are good. Yes, very limited number of seats, if that can be increased, please do so.
            The price is easy go on the pocket.  
             Coming to the food, we had Red Velvet cake which was quite good, the Almond pastry was a turnoff though, the chocolates are really good and the rich cocoa doughnut is really a must have here. Will like to recommend the place.

I've been to Paris Bakery stores in a lot many cities around India. This was my first visit to one at Kolkata and i am sorry to say it didn't impress me at all. The approach of staff was a lot less professional. It feels like they are working in a Mio Amore store.

located near chinamandir bus stop this bakery is pretty darn glorious,the pastries are massive look damn glorious and quite impressive variety of pastries here.

The red velvet brownie was rich,fulfilling and was juat great and so were the others that i have tasted apecial shoutout to the rich chocolate used in all these delicasies.

One con is the pricing,the cakes being massive@ in size packs quite a punch the red velvet brownie alone cost 130 rs plus gst but the taste sort of makes up for the pocket pinch.

It was a 3 in 1 occassion for us. Janmashthami, Independence day and Birthday of an acquaintance. 
The cake was perfect for the day. Pineapple cake with lots of cream. Everyone loved it. Beautiful and tasty.
