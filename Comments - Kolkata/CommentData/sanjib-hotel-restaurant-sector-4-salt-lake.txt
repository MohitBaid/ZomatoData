This is place where I once used to go for lunch and dinner regularly.  This is really a good place with the facility for having regular meal along the restaurant types food. Although I never tried that restaurant type of foods over there. But the simple mutton meal was really good.  You'll love the test.  You may find various types of Sobji and fish with the meal.

চিংড়ি ঘাটার কাছেই , কাজেই কলেজ পড়ুয়াদের আনাগোনা লেগেই আছে । একবারই ভাত খেয়েছিলাম । সাধারণ মানের লেগেছে । পকেট হালকা না থাকলে আলাদা করে খওয়ার কোন কারন নেই ।

A decent place for the college going students, but the quality of food and ambiance needs to be worked upon. Located near Chingrighata crossing, this place is mostly an average eating option.  Had tried the a vegetarish dish, which was a bit on the oily side. The service too needs to be improved.

Needs to improve a lot. The quality of rice, vegetable is not at all satisfactory. Need to improve their way of dealing with customers. Sometimes, I have seen the owner talking harshly with the customers over issues like price, change coins etc. But, it is good for the engineering college students as they come here in flocks to eat daily.

Located very near to Chigrighata this place is mainly a take away counter as most of their customers prefer delivery option. They have non AC very sitting arrangements and not that fancy as well.

Food according to the pricing is decent. A bit too oily I agree but it is expected from places like this. 
Tasted both Chinese and Indian from here. Chinese is more of Indianized  version which tasted decent and the Indian among which the Bharta and Laccha paratha is one of the best from here. An average restaurant in this area specially when you dont have much of the options around.

It's a place at Sector 4 for regular dinning for college students near Chingrighata...
 Though the food is normal for daily dinning... But the service and the ambience is too dull... Place is very congested...  some dishes is good to taste like Paneer butter masala , Chicken Varta , Lachha Parata, Gobi masala etc.
But now the price increased in illogical manner ... even charging extra 10 bucks for AC is not cool in spite of having claustrophobic environment... 
#Just For Regular dinning for students

The Food isn't healthy at all. Still it's like a Heaven Food Stall for all the College Students like me who don't get anything Spicy or Delicious to eat at our Hostels or PGs.

Rather eat at a footpath dhaba. If you want basic SERVICES like cleanliness, hygiene and atleast tables that are not soiled with yesterday's chicken find some footpath dhaba. For the 33 minutes I was there the only thing bothering me was if this is the seating area(which is open to the consumers' eye) then what will be the kitchen like. God help those eating here, at least save them from food poisoning. I thought it would be good to try this place too which is in the vicinity of my place and my earlier try. But instead I lost 230 bucks as I didn't have the ordered food.

Pros: Cheap Chicken (made from really cheap chicken, I guess)
Cons: No hygiene, cleanliness, ill ventilated, ill behaved staff, and no importance is given to the customers.

I would rather be fasting if forced to go there again.
