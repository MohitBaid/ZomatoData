Horrible food.
Worse is the fact that I got a severe bout of food poisoning after eating here.
Best if skipped, now that better options like Mitra Cafe and Noodle Story have come up.

I ordered dry Chilli Chicken and it was good. Taste and quantity was fine. Service was fast. 

It was a perfect one for an adda with my friend at the food court.

I was not satisfied by their food although service was prompt, we ordered mixed noodles with drums of heaven, none of the foods were good enough to satisfy us, even the chicken was not fresh. Noodles quantity was appropriate.

Situated inside Diamond Plaza, spacious sitting arrangements. The main attraction over here are the combos available here. The cooperative staff and quick servicing helps in a hell lot ways.

This is the only chinese outlet in the food court of diamond plaza. We had their non-veg combo. The noodles tasted good but the rice was a disappointment. The accompanying chilli chicken was very average. The price is high compared to the quality.

Chinese at a reasonable rate - that pretty much sums it up. The concept of combo meal is a win-win. I tried mixed fried rice and chilly chicken. Good portion size, comforting to the pocket and stomach alike.

Located inside the food court of Diamond plaza mall,nager bazar. This place is mainly run on chinese items however they do serve other north indian dishes as well. So far Ibhave seen they have got a nice speciality in customized combo menu. 
Last week me and my wife went over there and ordered for one egg chicken noodles and a garlic chicken. Quantity wise what I felt was they should rethink as its not good enough to fill the apetite of two person considering the price. But the taste of both items were really nice. Definitely recommended to visit here and have light lunch or high snacks.

Absolutely horrible! Bad food,bad staff,and bad service. Horrible beverage. Should be avoided at all cost. And they also tend to not give all the items mentioned in the combo meal,most often one has to ask for it.

We have been to Shanghai street quite often, given our love for Chinese and the proximity of this place. Located in the food court of Diamond Plaza mall, this place serves good food. The hakka noodles, chilli chicken, schzewuan chicken, crispy Babycorn is good. The combos are also good and is enough for a person with average appetite. Their service is also quite prompt.

Located in the food court of Diamond Plaza, this place serves almost every cuisine from Chinese and continental to north Indian and south Indian. But I always prefer to have the sizzlers from here, specially the chello kabab sizzler, which is amazing. Another recommendation here is the tandoori chicken which was very nice !

Well the worst I've tasted,about the ambience its always crowded,the class of the people here is so-so,not a nice crowd I would say,I've had there non-veg combo and another friend of mine had a sizzler and a grilled chicken sandwich before that,and another friend of mine had a took a sizzler as well,all of them were equally bad the chilli chicken in the combo smelled nasty,the noodles were undercooked with oil everywhere not at all hygienic nor calcuttan chinese,the sandwich was hard enough to break the teeth and that chicken too had a nasty smell,and the sizzler goodness gracious that was something awful,they don't know how to cook,they should replace the cook and try to improve it,an not only dat we found hairs in the chilly chicken and both the sandwich,when we complained they denied so we had to show,after that also they were arguing as if we committed the mistake by complaining and not only that when we complained about the nasty smell I told them to taste,they denied that too so three of us left without eating and then we ordered pizza from Dominos there,our money,time and specially the mood was wasted totally.

Location : Food Court, Diamond Plaza.

Few days back, had gone to The Diamond Plaza Mall to watch a movie with my mom. As we had reached quiet before our show timing, we decided to visit the food court for a quick snack bite. There, adjacent to the far end corner, was Shanghai Street and I could envisage the babycorn and spring rolls already.

It took some waiting for the food to arrive. And when it did, it wasn’t worth the time expended. The quality of the food was reasonable, correlating to the reasonable price of items. The only saving grace were price tags and quantity and the quality in relation to given conditions.

Shanghai Street is small outlet/stall that is doing well all-in-all. You may be surprised to find their menu spread which is pretty global, contrary to the name. But don’t expect too much as most of the items aren’t available majority of the time. The service may keep you lagging but the price will  surely compensate for it.

We ordered chicken sizzler along with chicken hakka noddles and chilly chicken.  The food is ok. Having sizzlers from other more 'sophisticated' restaurants, I can safely say that this food is worth your penny. Unfortunately you will not get the best of ambience you would have otherwise enjoyed, neither you will get the best of treatment from stuffs. But if you only consider food, then this restaurant is worth a try.

If you ever eat here, try one of their combo meals, especially the CHICKEN SIZZLER, served with any drink of your choice. This dish is something to die for. The presentation of the dish ia perfect and neat. The dish includes GARLIC RICE, BBQ CHICKEN pieces (mind you, the chicken pieces are cut and cooked properly to perfection). In my opinion if you have no problem with Chinese cuisines and are okay with spices. You should try this dish. 
Seating arrangement is a little cramped, but if you are a early bird here. You'll get loads of free space. At an affordable price of 170/-, you cannot miss it.

This teeny tiny little place serves some amazing food which to be honest I wasn't really expecting. The seating arrangement is kinda cramped and unless you're out with someone who likes small places with no public and has their hormones under control thank to the food you won't really like sitting there and eating. Their Schezwan pork is TO DIE FOR! UNBELIEVABLE CRUNCH AND GLAZE THAT DISH HAS! The noodles were just as good and were filled with condiments. At 150 and 130 rupees a plate inclusive of tax it's absolutely fabulous. A very under rated place this is.
Absolutely FABULOUS food.

A word of advice, you might wanna try their food when it's raining and you can smell the petrichor. PERFECT COMBINATION IT IS I SWEAR!
