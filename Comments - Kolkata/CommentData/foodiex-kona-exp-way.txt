Homely ambience and great service... The food is good.. It serves awesome momos, fish fries, crispy chicken and fried chicken... The coffee is too good... The main course has varied options and they are nice...The restaurant is budget friendly and goes with the phrase "value for money "

The ambience is quite, calm and good for a meal.. The price is in budget and the food is more than VFM..


Some must try dishes are Mixed Fried Rice with Wine Chicken, any kind of Momo from the menu, the Fish Fry, Crispy corn and potato and the Masala cold drinks..


Great for a budget hangout with friends or family.. There is a great parking spot too..

The interior decoration always creates a soothing effect for lunch or dinner. Chinese is been the best course to have but one may try indian too. 
Specially Pan Fried Momo brings water in the mouth. 
It's a small restaurant with perfect atmosphere for couples and family. Behaviour of staffs are also good. Food is much in quantity and tasty as well. 
Will recommend to visit atleast once.

I've taken away for 3 to 4 times from here, but never dine in...

this is actually one of the newly growing restaurants on Kona Expressway. . .
so, location is good. Just right across 2nd Hooghly Bridge. if you're driving through this expressway, you can stop here and have your lunch or dinner . .

not much specious, only 4/5 tables there, but they've decorated the place very well . . .
service is also good...

Food is very good and quantity is great,¬†
I had only Chinese, but I found the rice & noodle items are much more tastier than the gravy items . . .
Price is a bit high, nut according to the quantity I think it's adjustable. . .

to conclude, try once.. ¬†you'll not have a bad experience . . . .

Foodiex is a place where you can visit casually during any day for snacks..
They made delicious momos..
But other than that food quality is below average... Although the price is much cheap compared to others in surrounding...

This is a small place but surprisingly cozy. The Chinese is not bad at all and one can enjoy a meal with family. They also have a take away counter which serves quite tasty rolls and kebabs. Neat by Howrah standards and the service is quietly efficient.

The Best Chinese restaurant in Howah! Good food, (not Indo-Chinese).. Proper ambiance and pricing.. The only drawbacks Are it's small setup (Hard to locate) and the Name.. "Foodiex" sounds more  like a Mexican fast food joint than Chinese restaurant..

Loved the food quality. Taste was pretty good. We love to have their chinese preparations whenever we pay a visit here. Pricing is decent and very much affordable. The only drawback is their small setup. Its like a medium sized room, decorated and converted into a restaurant. Would also suggest them to do a proper marketing of their restaurant since they serve good food.

Foodiex has UNDOUBTLY BEST chinese food ever found in kolkata. My family and I come here almost every Sunday. Now look at the interior decoration; you can see it's Chinese. The food is like descended from heaven; the best starter is Chicken sweet corn soup. In the maincourse, you have a LARGE array of choices, like chopsuey, kababs, sheczwan rice (pardon my spelling), roti, alu matar, fish, and whatnot. But I like the best is chowmein with chilly chicken and fried rice with chicken. But they make mughlai food very poor... We tried tandoori chicken it was very bad... and, to be honest, only Muslims can make good mughlai food. 
Verdict:
best 4 course chinese meal -  chicken sweet corn soup, fried rice, chilly chicken, icecream
"        "  "            indian    "         -  chicken pakora, naan, chilly chicken, cold drink (we can break the rules, right?)
"        "  "   veg  "              "         -   veg pakora, naan, alu matar, lassi
