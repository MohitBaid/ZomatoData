Extremely cheap and ordinary place to have dosa idli, but it's a heathly joint. Mainly a joint where office and school goers have their breakfast or snacks..well no sitting arrangements are there...that's one negative dig!
The dahivada they serve is one of my favourite picks....other than that the food is quite healthy...
Hence 
RECOMMENDED!

Nothing extraordinary about this place.
It is all about a food shop for students and office people to satisfy the hunger. Nothing special about the food,  I would say that it is standard. Doshas,  dahi vadas,  chole bhature at reasonable prices.

Visited here today with hungry stomach and ordered a plate of chana bhatura for a friend and a dahi vada for myself.
I'm directly taking about the food because from the other reviews it is prominent that there is no place to sit and it is a hole in the wall kind of a place.
Anyways, talking about the food,
Batura was soft and had less oil. Chola was tasty and served with raw onion and tamarind chutney, it added a zing to the dish.
Dahi vada was great too. Perfect balance of dahi and spices with soft vadas definitely satisfied me.
We paid Rs. 47 for our order and left the place satisfied. From my bill you can see how cheap the place is.
When you are around the place, running low on budget or craving for some veg items, do give a visit here. Recommended!!!!

It's just a small hole in the wall place. It serves both north indian and south indian food. It is always crowded as it caters to office goers and students.It is really cheap and you have to eat standing around.The food itself per se is not bad.
