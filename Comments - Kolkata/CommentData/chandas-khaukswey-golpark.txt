If you are planning to go here and reading this review right now, don't go.
I went there today with my mom. Initially we had planned Momo I am Golpark but then I thought let's try something new so tried this one. The place is real small with 3 tables and absolutely lack of privacy with feeling that staff watching you constantly. The place had no other customer throughout the time.
First item was Chilli Pork. It was tasty and that's where taste ended. Next came Barbeque Pork Ribs. I was explaining to my mom about the ribs I have eaten in Momo I Am many times and else where that pork ribs have a bone followed by soft meat and an upper layer of fat. What we got here, dumbfounded me. 6 pieces of bone with a little shred of meat on it and absolutely no fat. An absolutely shame for money as well as item name.
Next was their iconic Khaoskuey. Extremely bland, didn't understand the hype and would prefer roadside noodles anyways over this abomination.
The desert was some Jaggery type cake Mak win something. It was okayish.
An absolutely disappointment and I regret not utilising my money, time and stomach somewhere else today.

Went there for a light dinner on 31st. Honestly, highly disappointed with the food. They took a lot of time to make fresh lime soda. And then, around 20 mins for a plate of Chinese sausage fried rice and chilli pork. The pork was not bad, but the sausages present in the rice smelled of coconut oil. We even told them this personally. Paying rs 940 for this food, absolutely not worth it!

A very decent place with perfect burmesse foods.
The foods tastes good and the service was also good.
ONG NO KHAUKSWEY and PORK RIBS are a must try..

A slice of Myanmar in the narrow lanes of Golpark. The oriental decor, the cosy ambience and heavenly delicacies are the reasons, why this restaurant is a repeated affair among foodies. I had this deep stuffed balachung (shrimp cakes) and the renowned khaukshaw. The peaceful culinary affair accompanied with excellent service has made me a loyalist of this place.

We visited Chanda’s Khaukswey for dinner after having read the reviews by food lovers.

The restaurant is a small, quaint place, well done up with ethnic décor – perhaps, a 16 table eatery.

The person attending to guests was quite knowledgeable and walked us through the Menu; since we are not fond of dried fish, we had to say NO to their signature Dish – BALACHUNG -  a dried shrimp speciality.

Instead, we opted for a Chilly based Pork Starter and followed it up with another signature Mains – Ong No Khaukswey – a Chicken Broth based Noodle Meal.

The Chilly Pork was good to taste, though they had put a tad more salt. The portion served is good for One and not TWO as the person suggested.

ONG NO KHAUKSWEY was not to our liking – too bland, though we added the table laid condiments – Lemon, garlic and some PAPRI.

The price points are OK

This was our FIRST tryst with Burmese food – honestly, we did not relish

This one is for the pork and the music. 

So when you come for the 1st time have khaukswey
And then you have to come back again because you missed the pork curry rice last time.
And then you would be writing a review like me.

The chilly pork was full of fat ... which we understand can be the case of a bad batch of meat. However the attitude of the staff named Pankaj was completely out of place. He had the audacity to argue with us that there was meat in the dish.... which was like a tiny spec of meat and throw the meat on our plates .... when we expressed otherwise.... he went on a bizarre frenzy and starting misbehaving to the extend that we had to leave the resturant without finishing our  meal .... 
When we asked them to connect us to the owners... the guy had the guts to say he is the owner and there is nothing to discuss.... finally the security helps us to comment with the owners 
and the issue was escalated ....The most unaccepted behavior EVER... wouldn’t recommend the place after this at all.

This is a very warm and friendly Burmese joint situated near Golpark. My daughter and I dined here on Astumi night and we both were surprised to see that there were no flocking of people here and luckily we were the only customers....we ordered Wet Tha Si Biyan. Instead of pork, the preparation was done with chicken as per our request. The chicken was very nice and tender and so was the hospitality and behaviour of the staffs...overall, it was an awesome experience. Would definitely visit again and would recommend to all....

Really a wonderful place.small but really cozy with really beautiful interior decoration near golpark beside noni .today for the very first time i and my husband tried the burmese cuisine.we ordered wong no khaukswey which was the main dish.it was basically a soup with noodles and chicken cooked in coconut milk.the taste was awesome so subtle.for the dessert we ordered a khao pyne which as per my taste buds was basically payesh as this dish comprised of sticky rice in coconut milk.simply awesome dish .the sweetness didnot overpowered the dish.last but not least we had the honour of meeting Mrs Chanda Dutta wife of Anjan Dutta.she is a very sweet lady.so to all foodlovers who want to try some different cuisine this resturant is a must try out and prices are also very affordable

Chanda's Khaukswey is a gem of an eating house . I say that inspite of not being a Burmese food expert . But being a food enthusiast , I have gone through numerous videos in YouTube and i can somewhat concur that food served here is intended to not just focus on the ingredients but also the flavors that come from them . And that is the reason why I believe this will not fit right on everybody's plate . Coming here either you have to be a little bit familiar about at least what's Khaukswey is all about or you really have to be a food adventurer who likes to play with flavors . I am kind of both so i loved my experience here but those who are looking for just another weekend lunch which mainly constitutes mughlai , continental and Indo Chinese then please think twice before visiting . 

° Location :- This restaurant is located at the lane between the famed  mouchak and the lane that houses Santa's Fantasea at Golpark . The outlet is close to the front of the lane so you will be able to see it once you reach there .

° Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- It was empty on a Sunday lunch time so I really don't know when it actually gets the real crowd . So I believe the joint will be devoid of much noise . Pretty neat furniture is maintained and the cutlery is proper too . The washroom is adjacent to the restaurant and that is the only downside since it will not look good in the eye but still manageable . The staff is polite , well versed with ever that is served and is pretty approachable all the time for suggestions . The serving time is just a little less than 10 minutes which is quite acceptable . 

--------------------------------------

° FOOD :- Firstly the menu is not updated in the Zomato so you will see one or 2 new items in the restaurant . The joint also encourages a separate " today's special " menu with interesting items like spicy wings or the drier version of Khaukswey or a noodle dish . I was on the look out of tasting the original items from the menu so we ordered :- 

1. Spare ribs ( 4 / 5 ) :- I have had pork ribs from quite a few outlets in the city where all of them have dissapointed me . None of them had enough meat or was juice . Mostly a hard layer of fat which will give your jaw a hard time . The ribs from here are some improvement . There is tender meat ( still could  have been more ) on the bones perfectly grilled in sticky sweet sauce . Pork meat normally goes well with sweet flavors and this compliments it well . But the ribs are a served with their special chili sauce which makes the ribs classy . The sauce is really hot and spicy and provides a superb dip for the ribs . Still not the best pork ribs dish but quite an improvement than what is served at other outlets .

2. Ong No Khaukswey ( 4 / 5 ) :- Certainly a bowl of happiness as it brightened my day . Khow Suey is a noodle based dish which mainly consists of mildly rich broth based on coconut milk . The sauce is made from ginger , garlic shallots with coconut milk added at the end just before simmering the liquid over heat . The broth also consists of small chicken pieces which were cooked together while making the sauce . And egg noodles is the main ingredient here from the noodle point of view . The last time I had a khow suey , I found the broth rich in coconut milk and sour like a sambal . This however is mild and the coconut milk is not overpowering .But khow suey is incomplete without it's condiments . The condiments include crispy fried shallots , boiled egg , some fried seeds , green onions , lime and most importantly chili garlic oil . The broth itself is mild in flavor but what enhances the dish are the condiments . The fried shallots , lime , egg and most importantly the chilli garlic oil simply elevates the noodle dish to a whole new level . Be generous will the chilli garlic oil as that is simply lipsmackingly good . If you are someone who has genuine interest in flavors then you should not miss this .

3. Wet Tha Si Biyan ( 4 / 5 ) :- This time you will be a little bit familiar with the flavors . This is touted as the red and gold pork curry but I will say this is similar to the oily and rich version of Bengali mutton Curry. 4 pieces of pork is superbly cooked with a lot of ginger , garlic and onions . It's a rich gravy and goes really well with the steamed rice . As you tear down the meat with the spoon and have a bit you will.acrually be confused whether it is pork or mutton . The meat is tender and awesomely good . Along with the curry and rice you will be served with a veg of sauted veggies . These are basically sauted bok choy in sesame seeds . Bok choy us generally a tad bitter so you may not like it . I love veggies with meat so I enjoyed the bok choy along with the rice and meat . Rich but really flavorful and since the quantity is not that huge you will hardly feel the oilyness . I loved this dish and have heard that this is a crowd favorite . Those who have not tried it yet can definitely go for it .

---------------------------------------

° VERDICT :- My verdict is that this restaurant is a gem . And I mean it , specially for those who give attention to every detail in the ingredients . Whether it is the fried shallots or the squeezing of like . You will get a chance to add the condiments to your Khaukswey and make it heavenly . What more can a foodie as for ? I have seen noodle dishes being prepared expertly in Asian region from YouTube so many times and have always wondered about when we will have a proper noodle serving joint in our city . Although this restaurant do not fully specify in that category but it is somewhat close enough . If you play with flavour then this is the place you must visit atleast once .

I know that Chanda dutt is a serious foodie so when i think now about her idea of opening a burmese restaurant in this city, I kind of get the feeling that she is asking us to let our tastebuds explore all the possibilities . And you must because I believe you will be delighted .

Awesome Khauk Swe. If you know how to eat a Khauk Swe. Service is very fast. Food is fresh. But they have limited supplies! It's better to visit them for a lunch/brunch so that you get the best quality of food. Only drawback is the handwash which is outside the restaurant. So after our lunch we had to go outside to wash our hands.

We ordered the Red and Golden Curry with White Rice, A Khauk Swe and a starter. My friend Debashish Dey - Petukbangali.com a great foodie suggested this restaurant and its well worth the time and money.

Loved the overall ambience of the place, which was livened up by some Burmese guests at the next table. The pork ribs alongwith the dip was awesome, and khaukswey was filling with a subtle taste of its own. Had enough appetite to try out Chicken Tha Si Byan, akin to the Bengali mangsho bhaat, but with sprouts and fresh herbs. But the real enriching experience was discussing about Burmese, Tibetan and Naga cuisine alongwith the owner and the Burmese guests. One request is if they could add Mohinga to the menu.

Let me confess first, I am not a burmese food champion and definitely not someone who is extremely familiar with the cuisine. So, I won;t be able to talk about the authenticity here and rather will talk about the taste and overall experience here. Frankly, this is a small joint just beside golpark and pretty easy to locate. The interior is done tastefully with the dish of the day/ week is shown clearly. We took the help of waiters while ordering and frankly, they seemed to know their food and what to suggest. On his suggestion, we ordered for Balachung (deep fried shrimp balls) and Hto Boo Thoke (tofu salad). Both were great- thought the salad was of slightly unusual , but the taste was great. For main course, it was the famed Khauksway (simple yet brilliant) and Wet Thi Sa Biyan (best of the lot). This was basically rice with golden pork curry (just like the mild Pork jhol with 4 pork cubes floating in it) and the salad served with it. All the dishes that were served, had pretty good portion sizes and can easily be divided in between 2 persons. For dessert, Khao Pyin- a slightly unusual dessert with red sticky rice and coconut. 

All the food items were good and having good portion size. Overall, nice experience.

Limited menu, but its not a negative point. The dishes they have are fabulous. New item for the foodies for kolkata. Pork starter, also the prawn dishes makes you happy. The authentic khaukswey is a must try.  
Small but well organised with polite service style.  
Choose the seat that face the road.. And if its rain you have a day of your life.

I went there on 30th june for dinner with high hopes but came out thoroughly disappointed. The dishes are way overpriced and disproportaional to the quantity served. Each dish will cater to one person only at the most. We ordered the special Khaukswey on the menu. It was a chicken preparation but there was no trace of chicken. Thoroughly disappointed. The Menu had very limited options. Won't go there ever again.

I wanted to visit this place ever since it has opened and finally made it yesterday. And I am sure I am going back! The place is easy to locate and though quite small, has a cosy feel to it. We tried pork ribs for starters. On the day's special was a tea leaf salad, which quite intrigued us and we decided to give it a shot. And I think it should be on the menu! It is very differrent from anything I have had before and needless to say tasty. It also has a few textures, slighlty chewy, crunchy (the very thought of it while writing about it makes me salivate!). For mains had Si Chet khaukswey, which is khaukswey minus the coconut milk. We liked this too. For dessert we had khao pyin, which is nothing but red sticky rice with coconut and jaggery. Reminded me a bit of our good old pithe! This slightly chewy dessert was also wonderful! A meal, which made us so happy that we forgot to click  pictures of the food!

Easy to locate ( near golpark, in the alley where NNONI outlet is located), Chanda's Khaukswey is a small eatery (with a serious space crunch as the tables are really small, however, it's decor is pretty cool, with a red umbrella hanging from the ceiling, an LED tv up on the wall and 4 tables to serve its customers) with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff was very friendly, very patiently answering all our queries about the Burmese cuisine, and attending to all our needs.
We tried the spare ribs which had a fair bit of sweetness, which wasn't to our liking, however, it tasted better with the spicy sauce.
Next we tried the signature dish- chicken khawksuey- noodles, in a coconut milk and chicken soupy broth with coriander, lime, boiled egg, fried onions,garlic, tiny chicken pieces. This dish was certainly a revelation. It was unlike anything else I've ever tried before and it was DELICIOUS!
Finally we went for the rice, chicken curry and sauted vege dish. The curry was similar to a bengali chicken curry but still had a unique taste. We also had the fresh lime soda.
All this added upto about 1180.
Overall, it was a good experience. My only source of dissatisfaction was the quantity with respect to the chicken curry dish. Keeping in mind the price, the quantity can be increased further. But if you are bored of eating Chinese, continental, thai and Mughlai, it's time for you to give the Burmese cuisine a try. It'll be a nice change from the mundane.

Average. Meat quality on the ribs was tough, good sauce though. Eponymous khowsey was actually very bland. Overrated in my opinion. You might want to try the shrimp cakes. I was told they were quite good.

Had heard a lot about this place, but it turned out to be disappointing. The food was only average, and the signature Khau suey was​ extremely watery, you could barely taste the coconut milk in the soup. I will not be returning.

Thank you Auntie Chanda for opening up this restaurant in Kolkata.

Next we tried the signature dish- chicken khawksuey- noodles, in a coconut milk and chicken soupy broth with coriander, lime, boiled egg, fried onions,garlic, tiny chicken pieces. This dish was certainly a revelation. It was unlike anything else I've ever tried before and it was DELICIOUS!
Finally we went for the rice, chicken curry and sauted vege dish. The curry was similar to a bengali chicken curry but still had a unique taste. We also had the fresh lime soda.
All this added upto about 1180.
Overall, it was a good experience. My only source of dissatisfaction was the quantity with respect to the chicken curry dish. Keeping in mind the price, the quantity can be increased further. But if you are bored of eating Chinese, continental, thai and Mughlai, it's time for you to give the Burmese cuisine a try. It'll be a nice change from the mundane.

Average. Meat quality on the ribs was tough, good sauce though. Eponymous khowsey was actually very bland. Overrated in my opinion. You might want to try the shrimp cakes. I was told they were quite good.

Had heard a lot about this place, but it turned out to be disappointing. The food was only average, and the signature Khau suey was​ extremely watery, you could barely taste the coconut milk in the soup. I will not be returning.

Just like my home... Hkaoswe, Hkao nio, Hkao pyin, Nga pyin Chet and tea leaves salad.. 😋 very very delicious. I would like to bring all my friends who have never tasted sticky rice and tea leaves salad... Even I was so surprised in my first visit... Thank you Auntie Chanda for opening up this restaurant in Kolkata.

We had a delightful evening at 'chanda's Khaukswey last night. I had been to Myanmar on a business trip a few months ago and liked their food there.
Here in Kolkata my friend told me about this cosy joint serving only authentic Burmese food.
I could not hold myself back.We loved the ong-no-khaukswey, noodles in coconut chicken thick spicy soup.
That dish reminded me of the food I had tasted in Yangon. I shall come back again very soon. For starter's I even ordered for la-phet those;(tea leaf salad). Love every spoonful.
Please friend's if you have to taste authentic Burmese food this is the place.
My wife will have the red and gold pork curry on our next visit.....

I had bookmarked this place a year ago. But sadly none of my family members or Friends were courageous enough to try out a completely different cuisine and that too at a restro which does not serve any other cuisine. Today I somehow managed to persuade my friend who was openly doubtful and was somewhat hesitant of this venture. A tiny establishment with intelligent utilisation of space and the open kitchen is sure to give you an oriental feeling.

A small menu yes but somehow I find small menus comfortable to choose from. As starter we wanted chicken spring rolls which was not available. So we opted for Spare pork ribs which came with a tangy lip smacking dip. The dip complimented the predominant sweetish taste of the pork ribs perfectly. Only complain that I have is the meaty portion in comparison to the ribs was quite low.Moving on to the main course we ordered​ the traditional Burmese specialty "Ong no Khowksuey" and Chicken curry with bok-choy and rice. The Khowksuey consisted of a myriad of flavors which is sure to give you a foodgasm once you start spooning mouthfuls( don't forget to add chilli flakes and squeeze the lime wedge like me. They are indeed huge taste enhancers). It's a very low calorie meal and ideal to beat the heat without compromising​ with your tummy. The chicken curry was different in flavor and to be frank was quite ordinary in comparison to the Khowksuey. However my partner was of the opposite opinion and preferred to stick to his own dish after having one spoonful of the Khowksuey!! Quantity is exactly enough for one person but choose your dish wisely as the spices and sauces used are quite different from what we are used to.

While the ambiance is surely a class apart, complete with statuettes of Lord Buddha and crafted potteries, service is okayish.The washroom is outside the restro ( which is a big letdown)! Overall if you love to experiment with your food then definitely recommended for a shot otherwise you may not find this place justifiable to it's rating.

A tiny little outlet, designed with care. They have a fabulous starter of pork ribs. That's about it. The lamb Red/Gold curry is quite average, while the Khaukswey in itself is quite bland.

Located near to the South City College, Golpark. This place serves Burmese dishes. The place is nicely decorated and can accommodate a maximum of 15 people at a time.
Had opted for their 'Signature dish', 'ONG NO KHAUKSWEY' and Chicken Spring Roll. Frankly saying, liked their Spring Roll more than their Signature dish. Have had better experience in Asia Kitchen. 
Pretty unsure of visiting this place again.

This was my first time I was trying Burmese cusine and I am glad I went to this place. A very small, yet cozy and comfortable place - well curated, and cared for - it shows - in the food, the service and the overall experience - that they care.
Had a really nice experience!
The best thing is they have very limited options in the menu - this works good for me. We ordered 'ONG NO KHAWKSEY' and some dessert made up of red rice and jaggery. The main course was amazingly awesome - perfectly mild in taste - not too spicy, not blunt - just the right taste. I personally didn't like the dessert much - it was okay okay.

All the pork lovers this is a must try with the perfectly spiced red curry and soft pork portion with pork fat makes this place a heavenly abode.

This is a cozy little place serving burmese food. We had chicken drumsticks and crabcakes as starters. The crabcakes were very tasty but the drumsticks were quite ordinary. The rice and chicken curry felt like our home cooked food ...nothing exotic though supposed to be burmese. The  we had khausuey....very tasty..light on palate with lemony aroma..loved it. We also had dried fish paste...tasty if you can overcome the smell . Its best to give dessert a miss as we were found the taste of the sticky red rice with coconut and jaggery very horrible.

A late review.. I visited this place in the month of October during Puja.. 
Burmese cuisine!!  Never tried before. However my first experience went pretty well. Tried 'chicken wings' which was in their special menu, 'Ong No Khaukswey' a classic burmese speciality of noodles in chicken broth & coconut milk, though not fan of coconut milk but really enjoyed this dish. Second was a 'dry spicy khaukswey' (don't remember the name), that was also really good. Accompanied with 'Ngapi Chet' (recommended for dry fish eaters), a spicy dry fish paste, it was good giving some tongue tickling experience. Overall will turn out to be good experience for people who are interested in trying different cuisines. It is once a while visit place. Looking forward to visit again someday.

I was taken to this place by a friend who suggested for having " Burmese " cuisine. On my visit I found that it is a nice cozy place to grab a quick bite.

Location : 4/5 Located just beside Anjali Jewellers Golpark. Parking to be done on the adjacent road.

Ambience 4/5 : Comfortable. Space for 20 people. Well decorated. 

Food 3.5/5 : Have a wide array of food. Serves pork , shrimp , chicken , fish. I tried shrimp cake and pork spring roll which was good. However I felt it could have been better as I had much better Shrimp Cakes @ Golden Joy , Tangra.

Staff recommends Khaukswey which is the signature dish based on which the eatery is named.

Service 4.5/5 : Helpful staff. Orders are delivered in nominal time.

Value For Money 4/5 : Meal for two would cost around 600.

Overall : 4/5 .

On a short visit to Kolkata, I was happy to meet up a friend over Burmese food. She zeroed in on this place and on a cool winter afternoon we slurped and chatted in this cosy den. The shrimp cakes served with tangy chilly sauce laced with sugar had the perfect crunch. The 5 pieces were polished off in no time. The staff were kind enough to serve the Khaukswey in 2 bowls and all the accompaniments came in delicate little bowls. The soup was thick with coconut milk but just right and the flavors were enhanced with a dash of garlic oil, fried garlic, browned onions, shredded cabbage and crispy noodles. We had it with cold sliced egg and yumm it was.

We are in love with this restaurant serving delicious Burmese cuisine. We visited this place twice and both time, were bowled over by "Khaukswey". Presently, this restaurant is celebrating it's 1st birthday. adding to it, some special dishes are being served. We tried "sausage rice with braised mustard leaves" and loved the dish. The dessert "Khao pyin" also deserves a special mention. Together, Chanda's Khaukswey rocks, as always.

Loved it! 

This place has some of the most succulent spare ribs I've had in the country. Authentic Pork curry and rice in typical Burmese style. Chanda's has a very homely flavour hidden within every dish on the menu, also the ambience is extremely cosy and romantic. Great value for money on most of the dishes. 

Do not come here looking for anything other than extremely original and authentic food, if you have the palette for authentic Burmese food, you won't regret it.

It was probably the most unwelcome place i have ever encountered. Its unnecessarily pricy, with the most disgusting customer service. 
Let's not talk about the people at service in this crap. The waiter welcomed us with this "ap log kya order karenge ya bas baithe rahenge?? " ~ just because we were lil indecisive about the unknown Burmese dishes.

Trust me Mrs. Chanda this is the worst contribution you have ever made to the society.

So my dear eaters please visit this epic place because it is like the ultimate experience of crappy hospitality management. 

If you visit this place; you are a fool, and if you don't visit this place then you remain a fool. 😂😄😆

It was Christmas. Santa's Fantasea told us minimum wait time will be 45 mins. So we went on to find some place else. I was surprised to find this place just at the next alleyway, that too without any queue. I did my usual routine, checked Zomato and to my relief found out that this place is highly rated.
The restaurant's location is quite attractive. Near to South City, Golpark college opposite to Zoom, Mission Cafe. This place has changed ownership several times in past decade. Last time I checked it was Mango People. The restaurant has tremendous space constraint. A maximum of 12 people can sit at a time. The staff are cordial. Now let's come to food part. I was intrigued when I came to know that it's a Burmese restaurant. I don't think if there is any other in Kolkata. But the problem was I didn't have any clue about Burmese food. So I asked for recommendation. There are some combos which has a very reasonable price tag. But I was informed that those combos will only tickle my taste buds but won't fill my stomach. So I opted for SEL Chet khaukswey, as that was ONE portion and should be enough for a single person's dinner. Before I comment, u can check attached picture to know what they meant by one portion. The taste was quite different than regular Chinese noodles. A bit oilier but Tasted good. But I can not comprehend the fact that how one portion meant such meagre quantity. For such quantity price was sky high. With tax one plate of that dish costs around ₹330 and it will only tickle your taste buds.

Pros:
1. Location
2. Celebrity branding.
3. Food taste is different.

Cons:
1. Space crunch.
2. Steep pricing for meagre quantity.
3. Very few offerings in menu.

Kolkata for me is The Food Capital of India. Not bcoz m born here or my palette is well-prepared to the taste here, but bcoz you can get authentic food from most part of the world here, especially from Asian countries. And each joint has its own distinctive taste which lingers in your mouth forever.
I still remember my first taste of pork momo way back in early 90s and fell in love with Tibetan food. That same momo is now a household name and is sold in small kiosks in every part of the country.
So during my present visit to Kolkata, when I learnt that there is a new joint opened for Burmese (Myanmar) food, there was no way I could leave without giving it a try.
And now having tried it, I can only say that before leaving Kolkata, I have to eat here atleast once more.
Fabulous food! Another to-visit place everytime I come to this city now!

Only disappointment which remained was I didn't get to meet Anjan Dutta, the singer, actor, director, writer and the celebrity hubby of the owner of this restaurant.

This is one a new breed of Kolkata eateries which gives the gastronomically adventurous a chance to expand their palate. Given the long relation of Bengal with Burma (or Myanmar) it is indeed surprising that there aren't more restaurants in Kolkata focused on Burmese food. Anyways this is a good start. This is a small restaurant with just a few covers. The menu is short and to the point, zeroing in on just the specialties, a fact I appreciate a great deal. I tried one of their combo options which enabled me try out quite few of their specialties in one go. It had the shrimp cakes, deep fried tofu and of course the ong no khaukswey. In addition I also ordered the pork ribs. The tastes were OK without being great. I would like to see more bold, robust flavors. All the tastes seemed a bit too toned down, a bit too bland for me, as if the chef was deliberately trying to westernize the dishes. There were some availability issues as well. Desserts were not available because I am told, that they couldn't get hold of sticky rice.When I was there, they were giving away small plants to celebrate the first year of the restaurant, which is  a nice gesture. I wish they were putting them in plastic bags though, otherwise carrying them is difficult.Overall this is a decent restaurant offering us a chance to try new dishes. This is something which I deeply appreciate. We desperately need more restaurants in Kolkata willing to go beyond the usual biryani/chowmein stuff.

Dropped in here for lunch after meeting. A small restaurant tucked away in golpark just opposite the mitra cafe. The food was good. The reason for giving 3 is because of the staff. We started of with a pork ribs starter. It was delicious. Sticky and cooked to perfection. The prawn cakes were equally good with a sweet chili dip on the side. The famous khaukswey was a bit liquidy but with all the garnishes it tasted good.  The ones I have had before were more creamy. Weill that depends upon restaurant to restaurant. My friend found a ant on his khaukswey and on informing this to the server he took the dish and said the oil must have had the ant and they would just remove it from the dish. They actually did that and returned it. Amazing won't you say?

If you like khaukswey,  and one the been well made,  you will refrain from eating it at most places.  There are very few people in the city who actually  know how to cook a good one. First visit,  I dried the chicken wings,  golden chicken  curry and the khaukswey,  and absolutely  loved the food at the first bite.  The batter on the wings had so much texture .  And they were cooked to perfection.  

The broth was absolutely  stunning.  I am tired of the thick kadi like broths all over the city.  This is by far my most favorite. 

I was lucky to have the special  chicken curry.  The balance of flavors  cannot be matched.  Pure excellence.  I could see the love and effort that has been put in the place. 

I also had some balachao and it tasted delicious  with the rice. There was so much flavor,  I could eat just that with some greens.  

Been to this absolutely  fabulous  restaurant  twice and the second  visit was in the presence of Chanda di herself.  Unless you meet her,  you won't know how much care she puts into feeding you. Looking forward  to another visit soon. 

Kudos!

Finally I got to visit Chanda's Khaukswey! Was on my wishlist for a long long time.

Location - very easy to locate. It is in the lane which has South City College. Centrally located.

The interior is really cute. It really amazes me how they put such a small place to such good use. Very cosy and comfortable. 

Now the food.
Frankly speaking, I've been wanting to try out Burmese cuisine ever since this joint opened. And I had no clue whatsoever about the items. However, the person serving us was very helpful and really recommended the specialities of this restaurant.

• For starters we chose Pork ribs. Okay, it was extremely tasty and had 5 pieces. But I wasn't really happy with the pieces. That was one disappointment.

• My friend chose Wet Tha si byan as his main, which was basically rice and red gold pork curry. This was amazing. Full marks! The curry was a bit oily, but it's okay, it tasted out of this world. The rice was of good quality and the curry had 3 chunky pieces of pork.

• I decided to go for Si-chet Khaukswey from the special menu. It was dry and had a great amount of chicken pieces. Sort of resembled dry hakka chow. Taste again was awesome.

• We had also ordered 2 glasses of fresh lime soda. Needs no detailed description.

Now coming to the biggest letdown of the afternoon, lousy service. Like really. When we were given our bill, it came to a whopping 1540. I realized that taxes had been added, now that the restaurant was booming. Still I found something amiss. My friend not bothering paid his share and asked me to pay my own, which is when I noticed that they had added Wet Tha si byan twice. 
Seeing our confusion another staff came up to us, and started explaining to us the contents of the bill, which made me feel quite dumb. However, we pointed out the mistake to him, and he was apologetic.

After the whole fiasco, our bill came to 1170. Which brings me to the point that had I been a little too incautious, we would have ended up paying almost 350 bucks extra. 

Other than this little fiasco, my Kali pujo afternoon was made. The food was spot on and so was the visit. Definitely worth a visit!

Located in the heart of south Calcutta in Golpark, a stone's throw from south city college this food joint has a cozy feeling to it. The names of the items are indeed different from what we are used to buy the owners and their warm and friendly staff are more than eager to break down the syllables and explain the food items in appropriate details. We tried the pork ribs as well as the tofu salad as staters and neither of them disappointed. We tried the pork curry with rice which was a delight for the taste buds. Finally we reached the khaukswey experience where the host very graciously provided the instructions on how to mix it all in and enjoy the item. There are various condiments available at the table to ensure that the food can be enjoyed to the hilt as per your personal preference. We signed off with a sticky rice and coconut cream dessert that was topped off with jaggery that was the perfect way to end the meal. All in all had a wonderful experience with the entire family and the pocket pinch was also within Rs400-Rs500 per head. This restaurant would definitely be one I would like to go back to again and again just for the comfort food and the pleasant ambience. It is certainly a must try.

You might get to taste a dish for free if you are lucky enough. Have shirmps, tofu, Burmese Dessert and choose from a variant range. Names are a tad tough, but the host will always help u out there.

This is a quaint little place tucked in the corner near Golpark. If you want to attack in a gang, you may try to check availability of seating since the place has very limited capacity. I have been hearing a lot about this place. I had planned for a relaxed visit to try the delicacies. However fate took a different turn. One afternoon I was running errands and was very hungry. Was craving for something light. And I hit this place. I tried only what this place is named after. Although I was in a hurry I couldn’t help but relish what was served.

This was my first rendezvous with Burmese cuisine. Did I like the food? Yeah, sure. It was filling, creamy , with distinct flavours of fried garlic and onion; fresh greens on the side. Was I blown over by it? No, not really. It's what one might call comfort food. 

The place could really do with some more chairs. The staff was very helpful.

P.S. The pork was really tender 👍

Went to this place with a lot of expectations...have to be honest, was disappointed...I have had better khaukswey...I would seriously like to suggest to the management to look into the presentation of the dishes... had ordered for the wet tha sibiyan...The quality and the presentation of the dish put me off..The quality of the chicken was very very average...maybe it was one of those off days that's what I'd like to believe, after all the good reviews people have been submitting...

Wanted to try burmese for a long time and finally i managed to on astami afternoon.
Very nice place, good decor and very nice ambience.

A bit disappointed with the staff. What we had ordered was totally out of sync and we were informed about this after they served us the dishes. It would have been better if we had been informed while we were ordering.

Deep fried tofu for starters was a good choice.
Their specialty, " ONG NO KHAUKSWEY " is a must!
The dessert was a very good combination of rice and coconut milk. Unusual but delicious! Loved it!

Never had tried Burmese cuisine before.
So....5 stars at the first place?...Yes, they deserve it!😊
To begin with, we had ordered #ChickenWings for starters and it tasted something different from the usual chicken wings I had tried. Sorry I m unable to explain the taste😐 but it was delicious 😇.
'Khaukswey' means noodles in Burmese. The #NaOngKhaukswey is a preparation of noodles in chicken broth and coconut milk. The taste was definitely class apart from the normal chinese noodles I have had till date. This is a gravy dish and we also tried the dry and spicy preparation of Khaukswey. Our next try was Fish paste which is a spicy delicious preparation of dry fish and deserves a try by anyone and everyone who visits #Chanda's Khaukswey.
Great food, cozy ambience and 'at home' hospitality earn them 5 stars from me.
Will visit again, SOON 🤗

I just came back from Delhi yesterday and like the usual ritual had to hog today!
The initial plan was a bit of last minute Pujo shopping and then a meal at Santa's Fantasea...but I guess fate had better plans...it was a wait of 1 hr after some 30-40 odd people at 3 pm!..we were starving and cudnt wait ..heartbroken we left the place with a plan for some other day ...and I am thankful we did leave..Coz just in the next lane was this amazing place which was about to serve us one of the best lunches ever.
Beautifully done up with a seating arrangement for not more than 12-15 people ...and it was empty! I don't know why on earth...people please visit this place and you will not regret.
We took a 3 seater the best arrangement in the entire outlet just over the road with a glass wall from the roof to the floor..a good view and the weather was just apt..it was raining.
The menu is crisp with not too much options since we don't really know Burmese food atall..with a little help from the restaurant manager and mom we ordered chicken wings for starter it was on the 'today's special' board not in the main menu.
The chicken wings were nothing like anything I had before ...was coated with a rice powder batter as much as I could gather ..crispy crunchy well marinated and flavourful..it came with a super hot chillie dip.
Then came the famous khaukswey... soupy noodles with a creamy coconut milk broth ,chicken pieces and an array of condiments to go with...a tray with sections each carrying a bit of boiled diced eggs, fried onion bits, fried garlic bits, spring onions , fried noodles...these are supposed to be added to the noodle broth ... hell of an experience..rather heaven of an experience ..only beautiful is the word.. my taste buds are still on a non stop dance.
Kyet tha sibiyan was next it's simple white rice with a chicken curry..but nothing like any curry I tasted before..subtle flavoursome and unforgettable it came with a garlicky steamed spinach.
Dessert was sticky rice with jaggery and seasme seeds..khao pyin ... this was more of an acquired taste..a lot like our payesh/ kheer but again a variation in the taste.
A great experience tasting Burmese food...I think it's one of the tastiest cuisines .
A highly recommended visit.

It's the cosiest beautiful small place you will find in the opposite of Ramakrishna Mission,Golpark(on the lane next to Anjali Jewellers). 
They have a limited Burmese menu but that's a nice trick to indulge the Indian foodies into Burmese delicacies because we know a little about it.
Their signature dish Khaukswey is brilliant and pure culinary brilliance along with the golden pork curry which is a well made spicy finger licking main course.

They have good starters and we had spring roll,chicken wings and Shrimp cake. I didn't like the shrimp cake but the wings and rolls are amazing.

Nice initiative Chanda and Co. Me lickey!!

Visited this place for dinner . Before commenting about the food, I would like to talk about the hospitality. It was the nicest greeting I ever received in a restaurant. We were guided very well as all the items were unknown to us. Coming to the food, we tried almost every item on the menu along with special menus of that day. Everything tasted very fresh and unique and were perfectly served. It would be better if the quantity of some of the items can be increased a little. Overall it was a nice experience. Some more items should be added on the menu.

Visited this place today with one of my best friends as we wanted to try something new and totally different. This was our first experience of tasting Burmese dishes. The restaurant is a cozy little place with a sitting arrangement for not more than 12 people. The interior decoration is very classy.
We had a very little option to chose from.
We tried Pazun gyaw which is basically a type of shrimp cutlet served with a special Burmese dip. It tasted like any other fish cutlet with almost no hint of shrimp in it. We also tried Khao pyin, a Burmese dessert. It was rejected by my taste buds right away and even after trying so hard we could not have more than two spoonfuls.
Although the experience was not at all good for us, we will still like to visit this place again to try other dishes.

We are all for quaint small eateries located in narrow lanes. Oh the joy of discovering cute little eateries serving a storm! Chanda's Khaukswey is one such place, serving delicious Burmese cuisine. We totally loved their Khaukswey. Ong No Khaukswey, being their house speciality, is a classic Burmese delicacy with noodles in a traditional chicken broth and coconut milk. It comes with different ingredients and spices and each one adds a distinctive flavour to it. The flavours just compliments each other so smoothly and a hint of lemon adds freshness to it. Such a delicious comfort food! We think its time we visit this place again ❤️

Tucked in the South City College Lane in Golpark,  I have been looking forward to go to this place for dinner considering it's 3mins away from my place. 
One starter and Khaukswey that's what my order. Solo dinners and all that shizz.  So I ordered the chicken wings which was on the special and Ong No Khaukswey.  The chicken wings were okayish,  it was batter fried and were mostly drumsticks instead of wings.  I loved the Khaukswey, served with all the condiments like boiled egg,  baresta (fried onions), herbs and veggies,  fried noodles,  fried garlic.  The broth perfectly spiced tasted good with the noodles. 
Value for money and a perfect place to spend done quiet time.

Burmese cuisine is one of my favourite and this place definitely didn't disappoint when it comes to that. A simple menu and nicely prepared food. Very helpful staff as well, especially with regards to ordering, since a lot of people may not be familiar with Burmese food. Their house speciality khaukswey is good enough for the main course. The chicken wings starter can also be tried if you're looking for some variety. Reasonable pricing as well. Hope they expand their number of tables in future, unless the intention to restrict the footfall. Overall, a good experience.

If you want to try Myanmar food then this is the place for you. Located near Golpark this cozy little place with its window seats and great ambiance really takes the cake. I tried Burmese food for the first time and was not at all disappointed.  We ordered the signature dish of Burmese Cuisine Ong No Khaukswey and in sides Balachaung.
Ong No Khaukswey is the traditional food of Burma. Its a Noodle based soup made from Coconut milk with various spices and protein like egg and various meat thrown into it. Balachaung  in the other hand was sun dried Prawn shredded. Both the items in terms of taste was delicious. 

Overall rating...... If you want to try new cuisine then this is definitely the place to visit.... I know I will..... :)

The only Burmese thing that I've tried in my life before this was the Burmese harp. While the Burmese harp has its own surreal beauty, this restaurant surely has its own share of speciality. I have had the signature khaukshey dish both times I've been there and I kind of like it. My friend had a special pork noodles and we also tried the pork ribs. Both were really good and I wonder why they're not there on the menu. The wet tha si biyan is basically a pork curry rice combo which is not enough and I would warn you against it if you're really hungry. Also, this is very simple. You can make it at home. However, the khaukshey is filling and if you're not aversive to coconut milk, you'll like it too. The deserts are weird. There is this shrimp paste which I didn't like at all. Great service and great music ( obviously because of the owner), I will go there again only if I'm having a khaukshey craving.

Burmese cuisine..tried for the first time..well...good enough..cosy comfy place with simple decor and soothing background music...
We ordered Kyet Taung Paung(fried chicken wings) was flavoursome...some spices were unique...the accompanying chilli garlic paste was awesome...
Next the signature dish..ong no khaukswey..unique enough..rich coconut broth with noodles...and many adjoining spices along with basic proteins..i liked the smoothness of the dish...
Wet tha si biyan...the red and gold pork curry with steamed rice and sauted veggies..
Pork was rich and oily..though i thoroughly enjoyed the meat...tender juicy...the pork fat was well cooked in fact..the steamed rice was aromatic..the sauted veggies a bit bland..
The price being the setback..food was good enough...nice experience

It was raining all the day when me and my wife decided to go out as everyone was feeling bored for the non-stop rain. So we decided to visit Chanda's Khaukswey. 
The restaurant is located on the lane of Gariahat Road, opposite to RK Mision Institute,Golpark. Excellent location. The ambience was cozy and delightful.
We were 4 members and our kid. Chanda Ma'am welcomed us so beautifully.When we entered there we found so many interesting Photographs of Myanmar. Apart from that, I personally had a interest of visiting here. Yes, the reason is no one other than my most favourite star, Anjan Dutt. Chanda Ma'am is his better half. I have heard and seen in movies, pictures, interviews of Anjan Dutt about her, but never met before. 
This was the first time I had tasted Burmese food ever in my life, same for my family also. And due to rain, it was a perfect weather to try some hot and delicious Continental foods. We tasted all famous delicacies of Myanmar as suggested by Chef Pankaj and Chanda Ma'am. Here are my individual rating. 
Food - 8/10
Service- 9/10
Assistance- 10/10
Ambience-10/10
Location-10/10
Menu-8/10

Hope to visit here very soon. Great going Chanda Ma'am!... And thank you so much for the appreciation to my daughter, Maithili.... We all will cherish the memories for the time we spent here.

chanda's khaukswey is a little joint located near golpark. based on myanmar/burmese quisine, the retstaurant is very small in size but packs a big punch. the menu is really short and options are limited to the menu and day's specials but as i see it, less options is proportional to less confusion while ordering. the food is really very simple but tasty. tries the pork and chicken curry with rice and the shrimp fritters. everything tasted really delicious. prices are moderate. If u want to try something new and good, then definitely drop by and explore the culinary delights of Myanmar.

We visited this place for the Khaukswey and the Pork. And none of them disappointed us. 

The Khaukswey tasted lovely after adding the fish sauce. The red and gold pork curry was heavenly. Both are must try items if you visit this place. 

The outlet is small, but very cozy and we liked the decor. 

As pork lovers, hope there would be more pork dishes as daily specials. Also if those are posted in the FB page in advance, that will be really helpful.

If you are a food lover , i mean only if you appriciate the art of good eating then this is the right spot where you can try Burmese food. A small restaurant and apt for a family dinner. A very short menu but i prefer that way because you can try out everything at one go. My parents enjoyed the cozy atmosphere with some classics.......

Absolutely Fantastic ! Has to be probably rated higher but guess rating a notch lower cos we couldn't try the desert as they had run out of it is OK ... The Red & Gold Pork Curry served with Rice & Pak Choy on the side reminded my parents of something similar they had eaten in Kalimpong 44 years ago ... Simply Divine ! The melt in your mouth Fat on the Pork enhances the flavour as well ... The Fish paste we ordered is really exotic & to be had mixed with steam rice ... The Khauk Swey was excellent and is served only with Chicken ... The Spare Ribs in the starters were so good that we ordered thrice ... The Shrimp Cakes were very good & the Chicken Spring Rolls are actually a lesson for all eateries that simple & Pure is always the best ... I strongly recommend this place to all & look forward to going there soon again 👍👍👍👏

Located bang opposite to the Mitra Cafe outlet(road leading to South City College) at Golpark, this place is housed right where Mango People used to be. Their take on Burmese cuisine is worth talking about and this place is a must visit destination for people who love south east asian cuisine. The interior is a bit crammed up but done up quite nicely(There are a total of four tables). The staff were extremely courteous.
John Lennon and John Denver gave us company while we tried out the Balachaung and Wat Tha Si Biyan. The Balachaung is a deep fried shrimp dish which in pati bangla means minced shrimp shutki. But the dish that stood out was the Wat Tha Si Biyan!! This is a golden red pork curry with about all the pork fat a person will probably consume in a year's time. This curry is prepared perfectly in a Burmese style sauce with the garlic flavour sticking out. The pork was perfectly simmered and it melted inside the mouth. Having tasted many pork recipes till date i can vouch for this particular dish being one of the best I've had so far. It's served with steamed rice and sautéed bok choy with sesame seeds. Do give it a try folks!

A good place to eat Burmese food..but i feel the menu needs to be increased..there are very few items to choose from. Ambience and service is upto the mark.

Chanda's Khaukswey is a cosy little place in Golpark. As the name suggest's the highlight of their menu is Khowsuey , its a meal in a bowl consisting of noodles and a protien (beef,chicken being the most popular) made with a coconut milk based soup and served with a variety of contrasting condiments which enhance both the taste and the texture. The dish originated in Burma, and came to East India with Indians who migrated from Burma. For me its an old favorite made by both my Maternal Grandmother and my Mom and I absolutely love it. 
We headed over to Chanda's a while back (this review is long overdue) and we ordered Wok Tossed Spare Ribs and Chicken Spring Rolls along with the Khowsuey. The Spare Ribs arrived quickly and we tucked in, good to taste but portion size could be a bit more generous. Our Soup followed and I loved the plating give it a good stir and squeezed in my lemon and dug in ... I enjoyed the soup and loved all the condiments. The Spring Rolls followed and though they were generously portioned I was disappointed with the taste of the filling which was rather bland . 
However we were quite content with the soup which made up for what the Spring Rolls lacked. I believe they serve a yummy Red and Gold Pork Curry which I am eager to try soon. Loved all the assorted curios and the gorgeous umbrella that they have used to decorate the place. The tiny open kitchen is also something I quite like ... you can see your food being prepared for you.

Very small place. Disappointed  with taste as well as the quantity. Heard a lot about Mrs Dutt's cooking. On the table.. pray why would one pass soya sauce as fish sauce!!?
Khaukswey very ordinary, presentation not good.why would you put all the condiments in the soup? The condiments need to be put  out in bowls thats the fun of Khaukswey.
Pork golden curry a rip off for four small pieces of pork FAT no meat!!
Don't recommend it at all :(

Authentic Burmese food centrally located near golpark. I love the tables placed just next to the windows so you can see out, and the open kitchen. The food was definitely different than anything I have tasted before. Especially the dessert made of black rice. The star of the show however was their special noodle soup, truly amazing. Try it if you are looking for something new!

Really, really good food. I am a repeat customer there but what I have noticed is that their presentation (gastronomical) skills go down once they are familiar with you. (I don't know if it's my face that's putting them off, LOL), otherwise I would have rated them a full 5 stars.  

The picture that I have uploaded was the first time I visited the joint a couple of months ago and then have managed to take my friends and family on several occasions there. The menu is short, sweet and delivers exactly what they promise.  Their khowsuey is delicious and can only be rivalled with the one available at One Step Up on Park Street.

It's a good place near to my very own college South City morning. Loved the ambience and the service too. The people who served us also guided us too.  We took Ong No Khaukswey, the typically Burmese preparation and that days speciality as a starter,couldn't remember the name! When we took the Ong No Khaukswey it was like "oh what kind of taste it is" but later it was "wow! Bhalo khete"....

This is a small but very warm and cozy place near Golpark.  This is just a stone throw away from South city College.  The place can accommodate a maximum of 15 people at a time, but the ambience and staff make you feel very comfortable. 
I had dropped in to have the very famed KHAWSWEY and it did not dissappoint. It was absolutely brilliant. The taste,  favour,  texture,  presentation all are great.  Also the portion size is very generous and also they don't mind serving you extra if you loved it. The lady who manages the place is very sweet and warm. 
They also have some pork and chicken dishes which I assume are also good. 
A big thumbs up to this place for serving arguably the best KHAWSWEY in the city.

I am a huge fan of oriental food. And so when I cam to kniw about this place, and it being so near to my place I had to visit this.

I don't think that the location is inconvenient or anything of that sort. To put it in the best manner, it is conviniently located just opposite to the historic Mitra Cafe. Location cannot be presente in better words.
Even though the restaurant is quite small yet it is cosy. It has a charm of its own and I must say that they have used all their options and possibilities in the most efficient manner.
I just ordered their signature dish, 'Ong No Khaukswey' although I also wanted to order their Shrimp cakes and Pork ribs. Ah, next time probably.
The house-favourite Khaukswey arrived in a slurpy, thick coconut milk broth with noodles and curried chicken, dressed with fried garlic, onions, greens, chilli powder, hard boiled eggs and zest of lime. It tastes comforting, with the marriage of smooth coconut milk and a tinge of fish sauce. The entire preparation had an incisive revolting twist of indo - southeast asian cuisine, which turned out to be magical. Also, when you go for this dish, you might want to put in and mix all the possible spices and condiments you see on the table. As I've already mentioned, the cocunut milk broth gives a beautiful flavour and this added to the aroma the ambiance the accordingly set furniture and decor gives all together a wonderful experience. I'll have to visit this place again for pork and shrimp cakes. Recommended.

Bon apetit 👌

In our(me and my gf) quest of trying out something different to surprise the taste buds we ended up here..The experience was mixed,starting from a cold welcome by their staff with not much introduction to their menu,gradually gaining courage of ordering what we decided to be safe according to us amidst the limited options,ultimately we somewhat enjoyed the food and the ambience..Ong No Khaukswey and Pazum Gyaw seemed the safest options,while we were clueless about rest of the items.

Went there one fine afternoon with a friend to have lunch.Truly speaking didnt expect this place to be so freaking good!we ordered pork ribs which was suggested by neel dutt and it was heavenly.Next was ong no khaukswey which was served on a bowl like plate with many ingredients on the top.One has to mix all those with the yellow gravy and the noodles then have it.It is a burmese delicacy which was quite different but I liked it.But the best dish was yet to arrive on the table.It was wet tha si biyan which was basically steamed rice served with pork kasa and some pakchoi leaves.Being a bengali my taste bud is used this kind of kasas and this pork kasa full of pork fat did satisfy my tastebuds to the fullest.Overall a pleasant experience
P.s.prices are inclusive of tax and that makes it a little light on the pocket.

My first try on Burmese crusine and I completely loved the food. Ong no khaukswey and Pazun Gyaw were the dishes we ordered. The glass window seat was really nice and cozy. For food I would give 4/5.

The only problem was finding the location and the staff. Over friendly and flirty. We felt uncomfortable the whole time because there was no other customer at that time and we three girls were all alone. They clicked pics of us then later on we deleted it. Horrible experience.

Chanda's Khaukswey - A very average experience.
=====
Intro + Location:

I went with one of my friend here. The place is located in one of the bylanes near anjali jewellers. It's a very small place with hardly 2-3 tables. It's ambiance is nice and staffs are courteous. However, they serve very limited items. It is a purely burmese eatery serving only burmese which makes it distinct from all the other eateries of kolkata. 
=====
What i had ordered:

Fried Tofu Chips - It was like aloo to me. Really waste of money for me. I hated it like anything.

Chicken Khaukswey/Ong no khaukswey - It was well presented. The taste was just okay with respect to the prices charged. It felt to me that it lacked coconut milk flavour. 
=====
Pros:

• Courteous staffs
• Good Ambiance
• Only serves burmese. Makes it distinct.

Cons:

• Very short menu.
• Taste of the dishes did not appeal me much. Large scope of improvement. 
• Fried Tofu Chips seemed really very ordinary.
=====
Meal for two: 400-700 approx.

Summary: 

Food Presentation 3.6/5

Food Quantity 3.3/5
Taste 3/5
Hospitality 3,2/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
Value for money 2.6/5
Ambiance 3.6/5
=====
Conclusion: I will not visit this joint again solely because of the fact that they serve limited dishes. Second of all, the fried tofu chips were not good at all. Thirdly, Khaukswey or khao suey was not as good as i expected. To me, even if you are serving limited items of a particular cuisine, serve it the best.

This tiny little place with its Burmese menu is a welcome change from the Mughlai,Chinese,Italian joints all across the city. 
We had the fried tofu chips as starters which were quite good. Next we had the Ong no khaukswey,their special dish. This one was a delight. Serves as a full meal for one person,could be shared by 2 people as well.
The khao pyin we had for dessert was really bad. The sticky rice and jaggery mix did not suit my taste atleast.
So except the desserts, the food was wonderfully made. Its the kind of food that relaxes you and makes you feel so good. Prices are perfectly fine,given the quantity and quality. The place, though tiny and comfortable, could be decked up according to the Burmese theme,I feel.

This is the first time we had ever tried a Myanmar dish so it will be difficult for me to compare this dish with other place which we never tried.  We had taken only 2 dishes just to try out - Wet-Nanywaybaung (Wok Tossed Spare Ribs) and Ong No Khaukswey. Starter quantity was too less (Wet-Nanywaybaung) and the taste was average sort of and this Ong No Khaukswey per plate was good enough for one person. This Khaukswey is made out of thick coconut gravy. Chicken pieces are dipped into this gravy along with noodles, garlic fry, nicely chopped onion buds, chilly flakes, a dash of lemon and few small pieces of boiled eggs. Overall the Khaukswey was light, nice and edible.

I had my eye on this particular joint and their cuisine for a few months now. Burmese!
Tucked away in a bylane near the Golpark Golchokkor, with only 3 tables, a huge group is best avoided.
We tried several of the dishes. The names are so interesting, although they are very hard to spell, that you would be inclined to try all of them!
We started with the Pazun Gyaw and the Hto Boo Thoke (fried shrimp cakes and Burmese tofu salad). Amazingly light shrimp cakes and the tangy taste of the tofu salad, these appetizers are a must-have. On to the mains we went with Ong No Khaukswey and Wet Tha Si Biyan. Ong No Khaukswey is like a broth of mixed noodles with eggs, fried onions and chicken, along with a very subtle hint of coconut milk. Wet Tha Si Biyan is basically pork curry with steamed rice and veggies. We opted for the chicken version of this. If you are a true-blue Bengali and you love your Mutton Kosha, this dish is made for you. We also tried another dish, Wok tossed spare ribs. It was the day's special but i just couldn't manage to memorise the name (apologies for that!!) The ribs were juicy and delectable, cooked in a sweet honey sauce. Again a must-try.
What will make you love the restaurant is the owner herself, Mrs. Chanda Dutt, who is almost like a doting mother, recommending the dishes, asking us if we liked them, and so on. But the best part was when we were treated to a traditional Burmese desert, on the house. Consisting of sticky rice, topped with mango and cream, it was the perfect way to finish a meal.
All in all, a lovely experience. This restaurant is a must-try for all foodies out there for the very different yet refreshing cuisine, and the absolutely adorable host. Ting! :-)

Nice experience. A cozy small joint opp Mitra cafe, nd this is a place where mango people used to be. An interesting thing is u can see the kitchen where the food is prepared. Nice decor nd ambience. We entered the place when there was a storm outside. We were 6 people, so we took our seats. Chairs complementing the decor. They explained us well about the burmese food that they r offering. Suggested us to take the spare pork ribs for starter, which was among their special menu. Next we ordered wet tha si byan, balachaung, si-chet khaukswey( from spcl menu), khayo pin. pazun gyaw was not available :(  it was 3pm already, they used to close their kitchen at 3:30, so requested us to place the order soon and also asked whether we need anything else or not. Though we stayed there until 4pm. The staffs r helpful nd friendly, they have clicked pics of us on asking.
Coming to food.. The pork ribs were somewhat chewwyyy nd a little sweet.. But tastes good with the dip,which is spicy. I hv already told this to the staffs. Next, wet thi si byan where the pork is superrr yummy..served with plain rice nd sauted veggies. Balachaung is also good to taste. It is actually deep fried "chingri shutki". People among us who didn't liked shutki before, liked this dish too. Si-chet khaukswey tasted delicious with small pieces of pork nd fried noodles in it. Last but not the least, the dessert khayo pin was good too.
Amazingly, no added tax nd pocket pinch is good for budget foodies! Cheers Chanda's khaukswey!

I went to this joint to have lunch on 22/05/2016.

I feel there is a strong need to put things in the correct perspective.

I was born in Rangoon, Burma and spent the first twelve years of my life there.

Let’s take the starter, Pazun Gyaw first. This is a delicacy in Burma, prepared with small shrimps only and one can identify the shrimps while eating. There are no diluents like potato in the fried dumpling. What was served at this joint was simply CHINGRIR BORA in Bengali. They have mashed the shrimps with potato, fried it and served it with a sauce. When I took the first bite, I found the stuff to be sour. It was rancid. The potato had decomposed in the summer heat and they were happily serving the stuff to guests.

Then comes the much hyped main course – ONG NO KHAUKSWEY. The ONG should be removed and what remains - NO KHAUKSWEY - is the true nomenclature of the crap that is served. Khaukswey and Mohinga with Gnappi are the mainstay of Burmese cuisine. Khaukswey has the following components which are the mainstay of the dish – egg noodles; chicken; coconut milk, which goes into the gravy of the chicken cooked; crisply fried potato and golden fried onion shreds; red chilly powder (may or may not be added) and at least half a boiled egg to a plate of Khaukswey. The stuff that was served to us had three 2 cm x 1 cm pieces of chicken as a compliment; the richness of the coconut milk was absolutely absent – it was a dilute yellow broth with some noodles swimming around. And one could make out from the taste that the coconut milk used was not fresh. The specific taste of the coconut milk gravy, which is so famous and equally tasty, was not there at all. There were six or seven shreds of fried potato, hardly doing any justice. Three small pieces of boiled egg – not contributing to the taste at all. We also found fried garlic – it is not served, only shredded golden fried onion is served. The noodles were just not egg noodles.  The owner of this joint just does not know what Khaukswey is, has never tasted it nor has ever set her or his eyes on this dainty dish. And they are fleecing the people of Kolkata charging Rs 275/- a dish.

Lastly, Khao Pyin – described as made from special red sticky rice with season’s special jiggery and coconut cream. I remember my days as a kid in Rangoon. This was my favourite evening snack. The rice was brownish red and really sticky. It stuck to my fingers. On the top a dollop of scraped coconut was added. The cooked rice was really sweet. And yes, it was served on leaves.  The crap served by this joint is not even a remote compromise. They do not know what sticky rice is. The rice served is very much our Kolkata rice coloured dark brown. It was not even boiled properly; one could feel the resistance while chewing which is not the case with well boiled sticky rice. The sweetener is dilute jaggery. And instead of scraped coconut, a white cream is served which does not remotely taste of coconut. What a SHAME!

Ladies and Gentlemen, this joint is taking all of you for a ride. Do not be fooled.

I planned a surprise for my wife well ahead of her birthday on 9th April. 

Like always , I did book seat for two of us on 9th Nite and was excited to have a dinner at a very "special " place. Sad , I failed to return home early due to work but ensured to keep a lunch for both of us next day on 10th April.

On a very hot Sunday , we arrived at Chanda's Khaukswey for lunch. I did keep Signature Dish and Menu secret to my wife till she went through all and finally ordered a Khaukswey. I ordered Golden Red Chicken Curry and Rice . We mixed and matched as we were about to taste Burmeese food for the first time in our lives. Khaukswey in few spoons grows on you and you feel having entire pallette in no time.  

We shared dish till we eat , enjoyed and finished the lunch at more than usual time. By that time and fortunately for us Chanda Mam arrived at the restaurant and we could share our experience and joy having one best lunch in recent times. 

I did introduced myself and assured to return next time around. She in turn asked us to tell her in advance for a special occassion if we planned one.

My wife all this while never didn't realise who she was and why seemed so familiar face till - I sang an old Anjan Dutt , "Happy Birthday" One liner to her. 

She was happy , It was her Birthday treat too.

When you start for something else in mind (blame it on zomato reviews) and end up somewhere else! Was reading about this restaurant view days back in TOI and today was on our way to some sea food joint (though I am allergic to it). Found this place opposite to Mitra Cafe. The staffs are courteous and the manager is friendly! The outlet is really small but cosy! 

Starters made me confused, wanted to order everything and finally zeroed on Hto Boo Thoke, the tofu was nice. Pazun Gyaw (was too greedy to try the prawn cakes) was yum!

In the main course options were not too many, so ordered Khaukswey. The portion was more than enough for two. 

The dessert was ultimate, Khao pyin. Sticky rice, looked a lot similar like Binni chal! 

Moral of the story: My first Burmese dinner (at 7 pm :D ) and  it was all about love and food! Highly recommended!

Well, this is a hole in the corner kind of a place in Golpark having Burmese cuisine only. We ordered Hto Boo Gyaw (fried Tofu), Wet Tha Si Biyan (which was basically rice and pork curry) and then chicken spring rolls which was that day's special. Though the food was not bad,  but I did not find anything special. Just normal everyday food. Though the service was good the place was really small.

First tryst with Burmese food. To begin with..the cuisine has a homely feel to it. Chanda's khaukswey is a small joint...interiors are done nicely. Staffs were extremely courteous and helpful. A limited menu turns out to be a blessing in disguise. We start with the shrimp cakes. Extremely delectable. Served with a dip that resembled the sweet chilli sauce served with momos. For the main course we go for the house special khaukswey. Noodles served in a broth made of coconut milk with shredded pieces of chicken...seasoned with chilly flakes and coriander leaves. Very flavourful... Taste buds were satisfied. Next up was a day's special li-chet khaukswey...this one doesn't come in a broth...quite close to Hakka noodles but flavours are different. Between the two varieties the former was more impressive. Finally on the server's suggestion, sticky rice and red dried fish curry. Basically an extremely spicy 'shutki maach' preparation...which I am sure is going to impress my 'bangal' friends. Being a 'bangal' myself, l loved this dish. Thus tasted almost half of their menu...portions are decent...prices absolutely reasonable. Hence definitely recommended.

I am not too fond of Oriental cuisine but went to this new Burmese restaurant at the insistence of a friend, and was pleasantly rewarded by the experience.  We had the special khaukswey of the day, the shrimp cake and the pork curry.  The shrimp cake and the pork curry were very similar to Bengali cuisine but the khaukswey stood out. Very helpful staff & reasonable prices. Would probably have rated it 4 if I liked this kind of food.

It's been a long time since I've given a restaurant a 4/5 . Since I did not have time today , I decided to get food packed and eat it at home instead. I ordered for the deep fried shrimp cakes and their signature khowsuey. The shrimp cakes were out of this world ! They were soft and full of taste and were served with a sweet chilli dip. I absolutely loved it. I then had their khawksuey which was a yellow broth , with noodles and four things to garnish it with. There were crunchy onions , chopsuey, shredded cabbage with limes and red chilli flakes. I just mixed up everything and had it. The gravy was neither too thick not too thin. It's important that the gravy is cooked well because that is what the entire dish is about. And it was so rich in texture and taste. It got me wanting for more. There were little pieces of chicken and coconut milk. The gravy was spicy and it actually got me wondering about the spices used in it. Usually I am able to detect what was added , but for this one dish I just could not. There was mixture of many flavours and at the same time it was light. I am definitely going to dine in this place again and it's worth giving a try.

The best dish we tasted was the traditional Burmese tofu salad or Hto Boo Thoke, it had a crunch n freshness, perfect for my palate. Shrimp cakes or Pazun Gyaw was good. We had the special dish on offer for the day. It was Si Chet Khaukswey/ garlic fried noodles, we had the chicken option. It was tasty too. Want to visit again n try out the other dishes. The place is only a 12 seater so get a reservation on weekend evenings, however it's suitable for throwing a small private party.

A nice cozy place sitting at one corner of Golpark presents a different cuisine with limited options. The short menu definitely helps both customers and chefs - lets them concentrate on what they are good at. 

Ordered "Boo Thi Gyaw" as starter which is basically bottle gourd marinated and fried served with a dip- tastes good, nothing exceptional though. Of the main course, we ordered Khaukswey listed as days' special (not in the menu) and "Wet Tha Si Biyan". Khaukswey with crispy noodles was superb, perfect combination of spice and delicacy. I haven't tasted burmese food before, hence cannot vouch for its authenticity but it is one of the best dish that I have tasted in months. Wet Tha Si Biyan is a combination of rice and pork curry, less spicy and goes easy on people who doesn't prefer hot food. 

The outlet can sit only a handful but it has nice decor inside. The staff was very welcoming and treat their guests well. Had a nice little lunch there.

A small hole in the wall place, in one of the Gol Park 'Galli's', where the focus is on serving great food, that is full of flavour.. That is what Chanda's Khaukswey is all about.. Ordered the Wok tossed spare ribs (special of the day).. cooked to perfection, with amazing flavour's bursting in your mouth. Then ordered their signature Ong No Khaukswey, Wet Tha Si Biyan (Burmese style Red and Gold Pork served with rice), and Ngapi Chet (Fish paste with red hot chili and garlic). The Khaukswey was quite good, but the star of the  main course was the Pork and the Fish paste (made with 'Shutki maach'). Such a balance of flavours is only possible if the Chef cooks truly from the heart.. Keep up the great work, and please stay consistent.

A Burmese joint that has recently opened up at the very spot where the erstwhile Mango People was, Chanda’s Khaukswey promises to deliver a surprise to the foodies of the city, as it is possibly the first dedicated Burmese joint in Kolkata. We entered to a warm reception by the staff – the first thing I noticed was the interiors which have been tastefully done, and the playlist which is well selected, taking you back to the glorious 60s and 70s.

We started with the Hto Boo Thoke, which is a traditional Tofu Salad. The tofu is cut into small slices, and dressed and garnished with peanut oil, dark soy sauce, rice vinegar, toasted crushed dried chili, crushed garlic, crushed roasted peanuts, crisp-fried onions, and coriander. Crushed flour crisps were also added as a topping. The salad tasted quite piquant and unique, and the portion size was quite big. The two of us, though we liked the salad, could not finish the entire plate, as we had to save appetite for the mains. Then arrived the Ong No Khaukswey, the flagship dish of this place. It came as the usual coconut broth with noodles and chicken topped with a variety of garnishes. However, I found this dish to be a little disappointing compared to my expectation. It tasted a little bland to my palette, and I felt the garnishing was a little frugal. However, the garnishing was not the problem, I felt that the taste hadn’t flourished in the broth as it should in a Khaukswey. It is the most widely available Burmese dish in India, and the versions I have had in Bombay or Pune have been better tasting. However, I cannot comment on the authenticity of flavors or taste as I haven’t had it in Burma!

Then came the Wet Tha Si Biyan or the Red and Gold Pork Curry, and Balachaung or a spicy Dried Shrimp Powder, with steamed rice and sautéed Pak Choi. The dried shrimp powder was good, tasted the same as some of the dried shrimp powders I have tasted in Kerala food joints, and was great with the steamed rice. However, the winner of the meal was the Pork Curry. Tasted thoroughly Indian, very much like a mutton curry, and the meat was fabulous. It was soft and tender, and parted under the spoon with ease. The fat on the meat was also good quality and tasted great. The spices in the curry were proportioned quite well, and I have a feeling this preparation is inspired by Indian spices or style of cooking. The stir fried greens helped to maintain the balance, and by the end of the meal, we were satisfied and full.

I think I will come back some time to try some of the other starters and the pork ribs. But a suggestion would be to include more authentic Burmese dishes in the options rather than deep fried starters. Burmese cuisine is quite elaborate as I have learned, inspired by the country’s many ethnic groups, however sourcing the correct ingredients and finding interested customers may be a little challenging. Dunno, just a suggestion.

Lip smacking good dinner last night, thanks to Chanda's Khaukswey. You can literally taste aunty's warmth in the dish. Full marks to the shrimp cakes too that she recommended. A wonderful gastronomic addition to the city's culinary map. And a must try for those who love and want authentic Burmese cuisine. The restuarant, though small, exudes intimacy and is devoid of the noise and chaos one associates with most city eateries these days. A perfect spot for a snatch of quiet and good food!

I'd never tasted Burmese cuisine before. So when I came to know about this place through Zomato it was inevitable that I'd be visiting this place sooner or later. Today went there with a friend of mine who matches my enthusiasm for tasting new cuisine. The place is located on a lane from S. C. Mullick Road and can be located easily. After entering we found the place to be rather small and can accommodate at most 12-13 customers at once. However luckily no other foodie was present so we promptly took our seats. Very well maintained place with nicely decorated interiors. A waiter quickly appeared to take the orders but rather fumbled at first while describing the menu. We decided to order traditional Burmese tofu salad(HTO BOO THOKE) with Chicken Spring Rolls. Both were decent but the salad tasted somewhat different. Then for the main course we decided to order ONG NO KHAUKSWEY which is their house speciality. The dish is basically noodles served in chicken broth with coconut milk along with spring onions,roasted onions, paprika and one boiled egg. We were asked to mix them together and found the dish really delightful to taste with unique blend of the flavors. We also decided to order the specialty of the day (SI-CHET KHAUKSWEY) which was dry garlic fried noodles preparation with pork. It also tasted good. Then for the desserts we went for the only option available which was sticky Burmese rice with jaggery served along with coconut cream (KHAO PYIN). It was beautiful to look at. When you taste it you can sense honey was also added along with the coconut cream which gives the dessert an unusual flavor. For some it can be a unique offering but not for us. Cost us about eleven hundred rupees so budget friendly place. Will definitely come there in future. A must visit.

Location: within 100m of a lane from raja s.c.mullik road. it's on the ground floor on the street. 
The ambience is calm and decent. The eatery is very compact in its interior.
Seating: 13 seats
The waiters are polite and courteous and the owner was present who checked on us if we were comfortable and enjoyed the food.

Coming to food...
1. Wet tha si biyan : it's a Burmese styled red and gold pork curry which was served with steamed rice and sautéed lettuce and sesames seeds. The pork was tender. Oily though. The taste was good.
2. Ong no khawkswey : it's noodles in a traditional Burmese chicken broth with coconut milk. It was awesome.. It was served with paprika, roasted onions, spring onions etc. The taste of noodles in coconut milk broth was something which I hadn't tasted earlier. The dish had a unique aroma. Loved it!
3. Khao pyin: it's a traditional Burmese dessert made with red sticky rice and jaggery and coconut cream. I fell in love with this. The soft rice in jaggery with coconut was something out of this world. On being asked, I was told that the rice is of Burma and the dessert is prepared.

They also have a few specials for the day which are put up on a board.

To be honest i never tried Burmese cuisine before so commenting assessing the taste of the Burmese cuisine will not be an apt thing to do. But yeah, if i had to say something from a generic foodie point of view i would say my taste buds were extremely delighted with the Burmese delicacies served in Chanda's Khaukswey. I went to this place for lunch with two of my friends and trust me the coziness of this place, the amazing playlist, the warm reception and the politeness of the attendant is sure to sweep you off your feet. The presence of Neel Dutt over there added a lot of brownies points to our visit. Coming to what we ordered, it was Shrimp Cake as the initial starter which proved to be a fantastic one raising our expectations to an atmospheric level. Later as per the suggestion from the attendant we ordered the house special wok tossed spare ribs which was so perfectly cooked and succulent that it truly justifies the #tag of house special. In the main course we ordered the ONG NO KHAUKSWEY which totally satisfied our appetite and did the ultimate justice with our taste buds again. The attendant even took out time to explain us how the KHAUKSWEY was made which was so generous of him. I would like to mention that the prices are so pocket friendly that everyone can visit Chanda's Khaukswey, shredding off the thoughts about the pocket pinch. We also took a selfie with Neel Dutt which was one of the yaaay factors over there. Finally i would like to conclude by saying "I am definitely coming back to this place again and again!!"

Perhaps, India's first "only #Burmese" speciality restaurant. With a limited Menu option Chanda provides an authentic selection of popular (Khow Suey) and uncommon (like the Red and Golden Pork Curry with Sticky Rice). Reasonably priced   (Rs 1000 for 3) - a neat, open kitchen restaurant with barely 20 covers - appears more a labour of love. Not sure if pure #Myanmar cuisine will have that many takers even in a food-loving #Kolkata. But, certainly a refreshing addition to the city's culinary repertoire.

Today I visited this place for the first time. Greatly impressed. Small, cosy , no- hang-up place. The menu is brief, no frills - only Burmese. The owner, Chanda( Mrs Anjan Dutta) is a very gracious hostess- guiding the guests in choosing the menu, and also very sweetly helping mostly first-timers - how to go about eating  the particular dish in the correct way. She is always present but never imposing on privacy.
I tried Khaukswey - did not try to be too experimental the first time- excellent quality, reasonably priced. Will surely go back soon.

I am totally in love with this restaurant. Yesterday, I dropped in here with a friend and perhaps had the best meal of my life. Neel Dutt himself came and took the order. We ordered the Khaukswey and the red and gold pork curry. We wanted to have something for the starters, and we were suggested to try the house special wok tossed spare ribs. The ribs were succulent and perfectly cooked. It was infact 'finger licking' good. The Khaukswey was something I tried for the first time. We were instructed well how to have it. It was tasty and the portion given was very filling. Next was the red and gold pork curry. This, was the best pork I have ever tasted. I have eaten pork many times before, but this has made me a pork lover. The soft tender pork pieces with generous amount of fat in that absolutely tasty gravy blew my mind off.
Chanda's Khaukswey is the place to be if you want to taste very good food and if you want to receive VERY good service.

I tried wet tha si biyan and balachaung and i really loved it.  I had authentic balachaunge before as one of my relative brought it from Myanmar. I found the same taste here in this place.  Wet tha si biyan is very tasty... I never had pork cooked in such style before its same like our bengali kosha mangsho but generally we never get pork in such kosha mangsho style in any restaurant of Kolkata.  A must visit place atleast in every month. The rice quality is very good,  it will be sufficient for two if you already ate something as starter. 
You will meet someone there who is already a celebrity...I knew he's a musician but never had any idea that he has a great love for food. I guess he has any connection with Myanmar before else the food can not b so authetic under his supervision.  It's a very good experience visiting this restaurant. 
Key note: The price is inclusive all taxes so no extra billing. 
The restaurant is small.... Around 16 seats I guess so you must have time in your hand and even if you wait it really worth.

This is my first time trying burmese cuisine and guess what ! The experience turns out to be AMAZING ! The restaurant is located in the lane of Nnoni jewellery showroom, Golpark. This is a nice cosy place with minimal decor. The attendant was very generous and helpful. Now let's come to the matter of interest, FOOD. We ordered Ong No khawkswey and Wet Tha Si Bian.
•The khawkswey was fresh and flavourful. The lemon juice on the top made the dish more appetizing. It was a pleasure for the stomach, joy for the heart.
•Wet tha si bian is basically a pork curry served with steamed rice and sauteed vegetables. The pork was cooked to perfection. Every bite was a melt in the mouth experience. The curry was light and delicious.
Moreover, this place is quite a pocket friendly one considering the food's quality and quantity.
The only drawback was, you have to go outside to use the washroom which i didn't mind.
Will surely pay another visit to try out their other dishes. :)

I was notified about this place by one of my close friend and fellow foodie, when I told her that something new had opened at Golpark,and I had chanced upon it one day while returning from Gariahat. She told me that it was called 'Chanda's Khaukswey' and it was an entirely Burmese cuisine restaurant and apparently the food was to die for, or so she had heard from another friend. And if was then that I decided to look it up and drop in sometime soon.

The menu is tiny, which for an indecisive brat like me, is a boon, because your can choose from only so many options. I went there earlier today for a late lunch with a friend, and I was just so mesmerized by the soothing simplicity of the décor and the homely atmosphere and all the amazing Michael Buble and Beatles songs playing in the background like a beautiful hum. 

Chanda ma'am herself, attended to us, like a doting mother, guiding us through the menu and what would go best with what and most importantly how to pronounce the names, which we obviously messed up, because ignorance. :P

We ordered a Pazun Gyaw, which is a deep fried shrimp cake, and my god was it delicious! It was served with a beautiful sweet chili dip, which was divine.

Then we ordered one Ong No Khaukswey, which is a chicken and noodle broth cooked in coconut milk, and one Wet Tha Si Biyan, which is the signature red and gold pork curry served with a side of steamed rice and sauteed vegetables, each. Needless to say both the dishes were heavenly. The Khaukswey is a perfect summer dish, refreshing and light, because of the lemon that we were advised to squeeze in lightly, and to add a little fish sauce to lift the taste. The pork curry is richer and more of a winter afternoon dish, I personally felt, pardon me if I am wrong. But that did nothing to take away the taste and the tenderness of the pork. And let me tell you, I've had my share of good, bad and ugly pork, but what I ate today can only be described as a gift from the Gods.

The service could not have been better, and the pocket pinch could not have been less painful if anyone wanted. All in all I am very pleased with the experience, and I do recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves food, because I will be going there again till I have eaten everything they have to offer.

Enjoyed the red and gold pork curry. It was tasty though a little oily for my taste. The portion size was disappointing though..

The khaukswey was not up there.  It had all garnishes already mixed which took away their crispness. The portion was filling but for one person only.
The staff was prompt... Ans so was the service...

Location: Quite accessible

Food: The Pork Rib was good. The other two dishes you see weren't according to the Burmese way I believe. The gourd fry usually has a rice flour batter. Okay not significant. 

However, the main course which the store is named after was WAY OFFCOURSE. That is not how you make Khaukswey. The preparation was missing something, cant figure out what. Presentation was not done as the toasted garlic, caramelized onions, roughly grounded roasted nuts (missing), was already put in the dish. Not cool. 

Ambience: Had a nice charm and liked it (a tad bit small though). Staff was very hospitable. Clean place with a semi open kitchen.

Verdict: Wish to come back for the pork. Not for the Khaukswey. You can visit the place if you in the area. But nothing to write home about. Best of luck. Hope that the Khaukswey improves.

Note- (Try Asia Kitchen for the Khaukswey and not sushi.)

I was quite excited about trying out this place but I was slightly let down. We had the ribs and the rolls as we did not want a proper dinner. Options were very little. The portions are quite small. The menu is also quite small. Located in an area which has so many options, I guess the menu and the food could do with a little improvement.

Located at the lane towards South City College, Golpark.~~Chanda's Khaukswey calls for being exotic with its name and claim. It keeps up the appearance with the difficult to pronounce dish names. But, makes the job easy by describing the contents below in understandable language. Ambiance is simple with small accommodation.~~Hto Boo Gyaw is fried tofu served with a 'Burmese' dip, which tasted chilly-garlic to me. Not that great.*Wet Tha Sa Biyan sounds really kinky to me. However, it comes with steamed rice, fruits, vegges, and the red and gold pork curry that everyone seems to be talking about.  The pork curry carries a flavorful infusion of spicy-yet-not-hot aroma. The meat was succulent. Went really well with the steamed rice. 'Myanmar' felt really close to home with this dish.~~It was nice but as it comes to me, I have had better for my penny. ~~Service may be described as the good lady & the dumb waiter. The pretty boy who seems to be the one supposed to wait tables should try his hands at something else. Complements to the friendly lady.~~The day we went, it was not open till 6:30 in the evening, though it says else-wise in Zomato. Watch out for that.

The location is very convenient, the service personal, genuine and focused. Don't miss the spare ribs as starters coz they are the best thing in the menu. The Khao Swey is ok, but I guess I'm not a great fan of the dish. The red and gold pork curry is staple fare. Prices are moderate. All in all, the starter stands out as does the niceness of the management.

I selected this place based on an article in t2 and whoa! Thankfully I did.
This is a small place with minimum seating and the ambience and the tables and the kinda open kitchen counter makes you feel at home.
The music that played was one of the best and it would be cause of the dutta connection.
We ordered the shrimp cake and sweet lime soda to start with. And the shrimp cake was delicious to say the least.
Next the server suggested us the pork ribs and that was the best pork i have ever tasted. This is what orgasm tastes like. Superb! Juicy, succulent, seasame flavor with that sharp dip. Perfection in a nutshell.
Next we went for the house speciality Khaukswey. The caramelised onions in the dish elevated it manifolds. Again just superb.
The server took time talking to us and informed about burmeese cuisine and the procedure to make Khaukswey.
Neel dutta himself was present and inquired if everything was okay and then finally was happy to pose for a selfie with us.
The pocket pinch just 1635 after all this for three!
Am i going back? Obviously!

It took me a while to pronounce the name of the restaurant, but quite easy to locate. We happened to reach the place around 12:25, buthad to wait for it to open at 12:30. The owner was present and advised us a few dishes to try. One was tofu fries with a sweet chilly sauce. The tofu was soft and the batter crisp.  The next dish was a broth style dish, which had chicken broth, noodles coconut milk base garnished with boiled egg pieces and many condiments like fried onions and sauces. It's light and easy to have, many different tastes from so many flavourful ingredients. 
Staff reception excellent, very polite explaining every dish well and the owner came to our table to know our feedback.

Brief: The establishment offers experience of exotic Burmese cuisine, served with warm and personalised service, at a very reasonable cost.

Promise of Burmese cuisine was irresistible, because of our total unfamiliarity with it; we decided that Sunday lunch had to be Burmese. So we called up the restaurant; we were told that for vegetarians they could only serve starters, nevertheless my wife, who is vegetarian by choice and not driven by any “Art” dictate, insisted on going for it.

The establishment is right in Bengali Kolkata heartland, Golpark. The person attending calls at the establishment was kind and patient to guide us to the address in this residential neighbourhood. The establishment is cosy and charming and we were lucky to have, what I consider to be the best table, one in the alcove opposite the kitchen and overlooking the street.

Now came the difficult part; ordering from the unfamiliar menu. Kind ManFriday, dressed in his livery which included an ornamental apron, did the guided tour through dishes with unpronounceable names, on the menu card. So what we ended up savouring was as follows:

The tofu salad (HTO Boo Thoke) is a dish made of ‘tofu’ and greens. But it was explained that the tofu was not the standard bean curd tofu, but made of lentils. The serving was delicious as a salad. Being consumed as a main dish we ordered gourd fritters (Goo Phi Gyaw) to go with it. I think this dish could make the Ramdev recommended vegetable popular.

Now, for the non-vegetarian forage, I went for the signature dish, Ong No Khaukswey. This is essentially soupy noodles cooked with chicken. Being used to ordering a side dish with the main, I requested for help. ManFriday was not sure that I needed one. But finally ended up ordering Balachaung, a dry shrimp preparation, although I was given a warning in the form of a question that whether I was used to dried fish (shuntki mach). The serving of soupy noodles was huge, and tasted different from a comparable dish, the Tibetan equivalent, Thukpa, which is very bland. The gravy was thick and curried. A few more pieces of chicken would not have been too much though. The shrimp savoury was rather pungent, and I realised the import of the interlocution by ManFriday.

Taste enhancers served includes fish oil sauce and red pepper paste.

We rounded up the meal with a sweet dish, Khao Pyin, a serving of sweetened dark red rice. The rice colour was astounding. Taste wise our payesh is much superior, but we have been having that so often since childhood days!

Burmese green tea was served complimentary and was good accompaniment as a pallet cleanser.

The warmth of the owners in greeting and helping to make our experience singular, was moving.

Meal for two was very reasonable at ₹ 763/- .

To conclude, I intend to return when my daughter is in town to savour the pork delicacies. But the establishment could consider tempering the preparations to the local palette, like Tangra Chinese which after popularising it throughout India has now exported it even to Singapore and possibly beyond (but stopping short of Aggarwal Sweet Corners of Delhi, which serve chow with a dash of chaat masala).

This is a small joint near golpark with nice decor and excellent music to go with the food.  It can manage barely 15 people I think.. But as a place its nice. 
Now I will explain the average rating.... For a start there are only two main dishes in the menu... Both non veg items and I think my vegetarian friends can give this place a miss...
My wife ordered the special of the day... Chicken yellow and red curry served with boiled rice and pak choy. Scattered greens are never pak choy and steamed rice was the regular basmati. The chicken was nice to taste and the two average pieces were soft and fresh. What surprised me was that the curry was exactly what my grandmother, mother or my wife cooks at home. General chicken er kasha jhol with extra oil to give the colour. .... My wife smiled at me and told me that if I wanted to eat this then she would have rather cooked it for me. The gentleman in the next table ordered the pork yellow and red curry.... Left muttering that this was just mangsher jhol
Then I ordered... Something which translates to dried fish paste which they suggested I eat with boiled rice. Now that turned out to be extra oil mixed in the Bombay pickle which you get at Spencer's.... Whether it's the same Bombay pickle or not I can't say but it surely tasted and smelled same. So essentially they suggested me to have pickle and rice.... I don't think they have any idea of the very limited menu.
Then to top it all they said that the only desert item was not there as they had no sticky rice.... Burmese food without sticky rice as an option.
I have traveled a fair bit and have had Burmese food and I can't say they taste like this... Unless they serve this specially in Burma it tasted like Burmese food made in Calcutta jhol style. But the catch is how many people have had this before.... My wife and another friend who recommended this place told me that they thought this was Burmese because the restaurant suggested it was.... I think that sells

I haven't had much opportunity to eat khauksweys in Kolkata or anywhere rlse for that matter. I remember school fetes where a warm, friendly Aunty would put up a stall which served steaming hot khawkswey. She would have extra fish powder in it for me.
Chanda's Khaukswey reminded me of my old school days. 
This is located in Golpark, where Mango people used to be. It is easy to spot. A small and cosy joint which can accomodate 10 diners at a time. Can easily get stuffy if over crowded but I am not complaining. I went on the new year's eve for lunch, found it relatively empty. 
Service is considerably swift and gives you just enough time to catch up on conversation. Server was very friendly and helpful. 
For starters we ordered Pazun Gyaw which comprises deep-fried prawn cakes with house sauce. Loved the prawn cakes which were crisp on the outside and had ample flavour of prawns in the stuffing. The most interesting part of this dish was the sauce which was a blend of hot and sweet and acidic, will leave you begging for more. For main course we ordered Ong No Khaukswey and Wet Tha Si Biyan. The Khaukswey was fresh, soupy and flavourful and it was filling. One bowl of Khaulswey is sufficient to fill the stomach and heart of a hungry person. However my favourite was the Wet Tha Si Biyan which is basically a pork curry served with plain white rice. The pork was so tender and soft that every bite was a melt-in-the-mouth experience. The pork curry was light and well-seasoned. It was not spicy or aggressive on the taste buds. On the contrary it tasted like fresh homemade comfort food. 
And the price is quite reasonable considering the quality and quantity. Let's hope Chanda's Khaukswey is here to stay.
Do visit and enjoy :)

This place is amazing! !  I was curious since I heard of it. So finally today I made it. We took pork ribs for the starter. It was brilliant.  
For mains we ordered for khauskswey , pork curry rice and a fish paste (side). Khauskswey is their speciality and no one should doubt that. But I must say that all the adjectives will fail to describe the pork curry . It is the most fanastic pork dish I ever tasted. And last but not the least, if you are a shutki lover then the fish paste is the perfect one.  It is Pocket friendly and serves superb food. Will be visiting it often :)

Walked in with the folks at 9.30 for dinner. We were urged to order quickly as the kitchen closes at 9.45. Which is an acceptable practice. What was a little strange is while the kitchen staff walked out they switched off all the kitchen lights. The place is tiny with a glass enclosed kitchen so immediately the place plunged into darkness when there were still 2 sets of customers dining. Of course this could be a one off when the cat's away situation. 

The menu is quite select which increases expectations way more out of each course. A vegetarian main would have been great for the mother. 
We opted for the shrimp cakes as a starter and the khau swey for our main.  Loved the shrimp cakes and had the kitchen staff stuck around would have asked for more of it and the tofu which sounded delish. 
 khau swey  is a family favourite for us and we make it at home far too often. The broth was lovely however would have preferred if the garnishes like garlic , eggs etc were served separately as in other restaurants and even at home. Infact when I did say so to the manager the diners on the next table also echoed the same. 
It's good to see they have retained the manager from mango people which was also very popular. I am looking forward to the pork curry now that I have read other reviews .

It was the first time i went to have a Burmese lunch in a restaurant dedicated only towards Burmese cuisine, and it was lovely, the food, the ambiance, the music, the glassed walled kitchen and most of all the behavior of the guy who was serving us, he was very friendly and helped us through our lunch. The food starting from the pork ribs to pork curry rice and the khaukswey to the desert made up with sticky rice was lovely. I'm a pork lover myself, so i got a great place to enjoy pork in town, thank you for that. I was going through the reviews and found some peoples complaining about the oily food and some other stuff, but with due respect i'm just sharing an opinion " you cant go to a rock concert and complain about  the heavy distortion sound it is meant to be like that". Thank you

Never tasted Burmese food before. was apprehensive at first. However once we were seated and the starters literally flowed in I was floored. The variety in sauces and dips each with its distinct taste bowled me over. The shrimp cake deserves special mention and I could have gone for a second and a third but was shy bitten. Main course for me was rice and pork curry and that had a taste my taste buds had been deprived for all these 60+years. 
A very friendly cosy ambience where personal care is the icing. I will be back any day

Went here with a friend on his recommendation. It was my first time trying Burmese cuisine. Overall experience wasnt bad. The restaurant is located near Golpark, around 100 meters from the signal. Calling the place is the easiest way to reach. The restaurant is pretty small, and a bit cramped up. Parking is available on the street itself, thou its difficult at times. 
Pros:
1. Small & Sweet place
2. Good ambience
3. Personal attention to most customers
4. The food is good, if not excellent
Cons:
1. Except for a few items ( Read Khaukswey and the Pork ribs ), the other items aint exceptional

Went there for a midweek lunch on a wednesday. Nothing much of an ambience,the place is really small and quite cramped.

Coming to the food,we ordered pazun gwaw or the deep fried shrimp cakes.The cakes were light and crisp,but the taste and smell of shrimps were quite non existent.if was more like deep fried rajma patties.We pointed this put to the owner who asked for our feedback.But she was of the opinion that rajma has to be used as a binder.It is unfortunate then that you can only taste this binder.not recommended.

Pork red and gold curry - tasted just like normal bengali mutton curry with rice.Nothing more,nothing different.

Khawsuye: this is their signature dish and rightly so.This is the only reason the restaurant gets the 3.5 rating. Would have rated 3 otherwise.Light,comforting and flavoursome.adding the condiments on the table makes it tastier.might return only for this dish.

Service was friendly and no extra tax.

Will I return.well,only if I am seriously craving the signature broth,or there is an increase in the no.of items

Loved the gold and red pork curry with sauteed veggies and rice, the khauksuey, the shutki and the wok tossed spare ribs. A really homey place that is warm and welcoming.
The pork had layers of beautiful fat and meat, alternatively, just the way I love it! <3

Coming back for more Burmese lunches!

Visited this tiny joint yesterday night with my family .We ordered the tofu salad, shrimp cakes, gourd tempura, pork spare ribs for starters. Khowsuey and pork curry and Balachaung for mains. The Khowsuey ,pork curry , balachaung,spare ribs and tofu salad were really good .The sauteed greens that came along with the pork were excellent. Gourd tempura was ok but I was a little disappointed with the shrimp cakes since the cakes had a mushy texture and felt more like potato cakes rather than shrimp. Overall though its a nice cozy place and the food is quite good.

Sorry, didn't find it up to the mark. Wasn't impressed. I've had much better Khaukswey or Khow Suey, quite a few times in my life.

Also, the Ngapi wasn't that sharp! I have much sharper, spicier Nampla & Belacan in my larder.

Wonderful hideout from the usual Calcutta lunch options available for someone on a short trip home, Chhanda auntie's little Burmese eatery, is a delight! We were lucky because the place filled out within minutes, that's also because it's  really tiny, but quite charming. If you're the curious kind, only a glass wall separates the kitchen so knock yourself out. Service is polite and Bangal, so plus plus. The food is awesome. Period. Those who run at the mention of dried fish, stay at home, you don't know what you're missing though. We tried both the house specials and we loved it. The dried shrimp relish was perfection. Next time home, I'm trying everything else on the menu. And then some.

As the name implies, this place serves mouthwatering Khaukswey.. Noodles in Chicken broth with coconut milk and exotic flavours creates perfect harmony of rich creamy sensation on the palate. The service is very warm and polite. The decor sticks to its theme with matching interiors to fancy chairs and the upside down umbrella (i suppose). A must visit for the people bored of usual north indian and chinese fare. Pricing is moderate and no added tax. Happy eating :-)

Located in a prime location of Kolkata, chanda's khowsuey is an authentic Burmese restaurant. It can accommodate 14 foodie at a time. We were warmly greeted by Mrs Chanda Dutt. 
The interior is decorated nicely with a Burmese theme. Soothing music is played on the background. 

The menu is brief but they always keep some different special items displayed on a black board. The table attendant explained what to order. We settled for gabyanleik, which is chicken spring rolls and ong no khaukswey, which is a Burmese delicacy. The spring rolls were nicely prepared with minced chicken stuffing. Having Khaukswey was another delightful experience. In this dish, Chicken broth was mixed with coconut cream, diced boiled egg, shredded chicken, veggies, chili flakes and boiled noodles. It has nice non spicy rich flavour. It was quite filling as one Khaukswey is able to fill two stomachs. They also served Burmese green tea as a complementary drink, a nice gesture. 

Service is very cordial and commendable. Pricing is reasonable as they don't charge VAT or service tax. Overall they have successfully created a beautiful Burmese ambience. 
RECOMMENDED for People who wants to taste something new

Horrible food. Just a big waste of money. Never ever visit the place.  I ordered their specialty Ong No Khauksuey, and when it had been  served I found it was nothing but masala maggi with lot of water in it. And intolerable stale smell of dried fish was coming out of it. It was a bitter experience.

No, just no. I guess my palate isn't refined enough to fully appreciate the dishes that were placed before us. The menu isn't exhaustive and it wasn't long before we zeroed in on the only two mains which were highlighted. One was the in-house special Khaukswey, a thick broth consisting mainly of noodles and shreds of chicken which you would be lucky to get on your third spoonful. The condiments accompanying the dish did nothing to salvage it. The other was the Wet Tha Si Biyan, which came in the form of succulent and well cut,albeit bland chunks of pork and buttered rice with a side of steamed vegetables. Mild, extremely mild flavours,any milder and we would have downed the gravy in one go. Oh and the shrimp cakes aren't anything to die for but the 'traditional Burmese dip' , as they put it , was what made us lick our forks and then our fingers. Khao Pyin ,the jaggery dessert wasn't available for us to round off the pretty unsatisfactory meal.
The glaring nitpicks aside, the place is quaint and cosy inside with Chanda,the owner herself, supervising the dishes and helping the guests choose their food.
I surely can't say I have had better since I have not as this was my first brush with Burmese cuisine and judging from the likes of it, probably steering well clear off it.

A small place with amazing food that packs a punch in terms of flavours and a small pinch in terms of prices.

The place is small and it can only seat about 12-14 people but the ambience is very warm and homely. Chances are you might get an equally warm welcome from Mrs. Chanda Dutt herself, who will make you feel that you are at home.

I had the "Wet Tha Si Biyan" which is a Burmese style pork curry served the steamed rice. The pork was very well cooked and succulent and paired with the rice, its a very good dish.

The flagship dish in the menu is the "Ong No Khaukswey", which is essentially a big bowl of warm chicken broth with coconut milk and noodles, with generous chunks of chicken and vegetables and topped with fried noodles as well as boiled eggs. It is packed with flavours and has the perfect balance of hot, sour, sweet and salty. A dish that can warm you up instantly and leave you satisfied.In my opinion, the Khaukswey tastes even better when paired with "Balachaung", which is a deep fried shrimp relish.People with a palate for Asian food should definitely try this place. It is absolutely worth the money. I would definitely go back again.Cheers!

Good thing in a small package! Very succinct menu and tiny seating, but what they offer is good.
I tried the Ngapi Chet - a spicy fish paste that went well with steamed rice. The Red and Gold Pork was also delicious, with generous portions of fat in it. But the Ong No Khaukswey is the uncrowned king here - a heartwarming coconut and chicken broth, with noodles and chunks of chicken - topped to perfection with crispy noodles, shredded veggies, shallots, bruised garlic and boiled eggs - a real treat for the Asian palate. But this place is strictly for non-vegetarians. 
Expect a warm welcome and cool pocket-friendly prices.

I had the "Wet Tha Si Biyan" which is a Burmese style pork curry served the steamed rice. The pork was very well cooked and succulent and paired with the rice, its a very good dish.

The flagship dish in the menu is the "Ong No Khaukswey", which is essentially a big bowl of warm chicken broth with coconut milk and noodles, with generous chunks of chicken and vegetables and topped with fried noodles as well as boiled eggs. It is packed with flavours and has the perfect balance of hot, sour, sweet and salty. A dish that can warm you up instantly and leave you satisfied.In my opinion, the Khaukswey tastes even better when paired with "Balachaung", which is a deep fried shrimp relish.People with a palate for Asian food should definitely try this place. It is absolutely worth the money. I would definitely go back again.Cheers!

Good thing in a small package! Very succinct menu and tiny seating, but what they offer is good.
I tried the Ngapi Chet - a spicy fish paste that went well with steamed rice. The Red and Gold Pork was also delicious, with generous portions of fat in it. But the Ong No Khaukswey is the uncrowned king here - a heartwarming coconut and chicken broth, with noodles and chunks of chicken - topped to perfection with crispy noodles, shredded veggies, shallots, bruised garlic and boiled eggs - a real treat for the Asian palate. But this place is strictly for non-vegetarians. 
Expect a warm welcome and cool pocket-friendly prices.

Awesome food. Awesome Burmese ambiance. South East Asian cuisine at its best. Amazing experience. The chicken spring roll was the best I ever had. Tried Khaukswey before. But today's taste was simply mind-blowing. Eager to go back to try the rest of the menu.

This was my first experience of Burmese cuisine. We tried Ong No Khaukswey and Pazun Gyaw. It taste good , although I really don't know what those actually taste like. The accommodation is only for about 16 people. But you will receive a warm welcome and will be provided with a quality service.

Chanda Dutt is no unknown name as far as Calcutta food circle is concerned. She had been organising Burmese pop up dinners, named Authentic Taste of Myanmar, at her Beniapukur residence for the past few years. Hailing from Taunggy, Burma, she is an expert cook of the cuisine and these pop ups were the only place for Calcutta foodies to relish Burmese food, as there used to be no dedicated joint for the same. I was eager to attend one of these pop ups, but unfortunately the dates clashed with other important jobs always. So, when I heard she will be opening a restaurant, a dedicated Burmese one, I was really excited.

Somehow, I have stared loving the warmth of this place. 

If love food and if you are comfortable in experimenting with variety of food, then you must try this place. Its easy to locate. At the lane of Nnoni, just few steps from there at your left hand side. I went there on a Sunday for the first time. If you are going on a Sunday, you may book a table for yourself. The place might be packed and you may have to wait for sometime. 

The ambience of the place is very cozy, very warm and very neat! Kind of minimalistic place with a sitting arrangement of 14/16 people approx. 

I feel the service there is very customized and warm, very polite and friendly. Which makes me to go there over and again. 

The quantity they serve is not huge. 1 meal is just perfect for 1 person. I have tried Ngapi Chet which is fish paste with red hot chillies and garlic. The best part is its not too hot and it will not make you cry, kind of taste that I like. I ordered it with the white sticky rice. 

I made my visit again and had Wet tha si biyan which is Burmese style red and gold pork curry with rice. Very simple food yet delicious. The pork pieces are perfectly tender and juicy. 

They serve salad along with it which I simply loved, fresh leafs in oil and sesame seeds. 

Overall a nice and warm place where I would like to visit over and again.

Chanda's was recommended by one of our friends for a treat to celebrate Burmese food in kolkata. Well, didn't click the best chord. I found the menu very short with limited choice. The fried shrimps was too fishy! The pork curry was average and very oily. I loved the pak choi sauté and the veg fritters. They could improve the texture of the khaukswey by improving the quality of coconut milk and the condiments provided. Anyway this is my personal opinion and I hope the management won't be offended. Cheers!

First time to this place. Very small. Not many options on the menu. And what's really uncomfortable is the strong pungent smell of fish sauce. The ong no khaukswey was bland while the way tha si biyan, Burmese style red & gold pork curry served with sauteed vegetables and rice was a disappointment. The curry had tons of oil floating in it without any other taste. The balachaung, deep fried shrimp relish tasted awful even for someone used to having and loving shutki (dried fermented fish). All in all, am not coming back a second time.

Located near South City College, Golpark  this little eatery though pressed for space serves delicious Burmese food at a very reasonable price. The place is really small with only 3-4 tables and thus prior reservation especially on weekends is advisable. The menu is brief and simple and you cannot miss Ong No Khaukswey. The shrimp cakes for starters were average. We were a little disappointed as no desserts were available from the menu. Service was prompt and the pocket pinch totally bearable!  Overall an interesting new place where you must try that warm and delicious bowl of Khaukswey.

I was goin bout my day and i was conversing wid dis frend who said she was cookin some pork curry. In an instant the words had immediately provoked my senses n made me want some pork curry. So for the first tiime i actually jus typed in jus the food i wanted. As it appeared dis is the only place which serves pork curry. Since I had known wat to order, i didn't hav to lose hair over it(although not that one was spoilt for choices either). Though i wished to try the khaukswey too. Thankfully my frend decided to order that, so i could get the best of both worlds. Service was swift. Food looked amazin. I dug in, and as per my appropriation the pork curry was great. I went on praisin the food till i see my frend eating very quitely and not as cheerful as i had been. So time for me to try out the other. I was gutted . The khausway was WEAK. The texture was like over cooked noodles, with an overpowering taste of garlic powder. The coconut flavour wasn't not really there. No real chicken pieces except for extremely thin shreds of chicken which u might find if u maneuver through the whole bowl. There was sheer imbalance in flavours and conceptions. It is surprising as it is supposed to be the signature dish of the place and its strange how far off the mark it was. I jus hope it was an off day with the khausway. But for me its still a win cos i'l jus get here anyway whenever i wanna hit that pork curry. The pork had excellent texture which means it was cooked to perfection. The meat was soft and the dish had enough fat to break u into a sweat even on a cold winter night.(i mean Calcutta winter, go figure)

Kolkata is indeed adopting to the different types of global cuisines and even to cuisines which are not that highlighted in the world food map. The most recent example of it is definitely Chanda's Khaukswey bringing Burmese cuisine to the city, an initiative I guess unmatched in any other city in the country. A very small joint managed and run by Chanda Dutt, this is the new hidden gem in south Kolkata. The restaurant is quite small, with very limited sitting, hence a prior reservation is recommended. We ordered  Pazun Gyaw (or Shrimp Cakes), their specialty dish the Khaukswey and Khao Pyin ( a dessert). We were two and since none of us are big eaters one portion served us quite well. The Shrimp Cakes were very tasty, Khaukswey was light, the broth was very well balanced and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The dessert had a very different taste, the use of jaggery was very well balanced with the sesame seeds and the coconut shavings. A very wholesome meal for two at a very affordable price in a very convenient location - One cannot ask for anything more. It's a brilliant effort and definitely a must visit for all foodies in the city.

P.S - The music they play adds charm to the food with all the songs from Sound of Music and songs by Abba, Joan Baez and The Beatles. But on second thoughts, if you don't have nice music playing here, then where else in Kolkata :)

Chanda's Khawsuey is the brainchild of Chanda Dutt, wife of Anjan Dutt who has hosted annual Burmese cuisine spread at her residence till she translated the success of her culinary affair to this restaurant. It is better to reserve table and also reach on time since the first shift of the restaurant gets over by 3:30 pm. It is a small seater and neatly decorated with a live kitchen counter facing the door.
We ordered Hto Boo Thoke which is Burmese salad, Ngapi Chet, Hto Boo Gyaw and Ong No Khawsuey. The Burmese salad was a refreshing treat for the taste bud and I would rate it the best among all. The khawksuey was equally enjoyable. The other two items were fish preparations and was a welcome change from the usual fare. Burmese food stands out for its healthy content and so full marks to the place for that.

P.S. The service was extremely cordial and despite our late arrival they were quite courteous with their reception

My maiden tryst with Burmese cuisine and trust me, it is a wonderful beginning. The place is easy to find. If you are approaching golpark from gariahat, from the golpark signal you will find mouchak on your left. Next left is nonni, take that lane to your left and its on your left. A small and cozy place with minimalistic décor. Loved the Elvis on the wall. Chanda was right there in the restaurant when I entered by around 6.30 pm, a bit too early for dinner but didn't want to take a chance post reading the reviews that it gets crowded at times and closes early. The menu is simple and authentic as Chanda mentioned. She grew up in Burma, so what you see and eat is what she loved and has carried along. She trained the chefs herself. This is her humble initiative to bring Myanmar, erstwhile Burma to the world. Apparently Khauk Swey or "khao soi" name is just a derivation of khao swè, the Burmese word for "noodles", which literally means "knock and pull" which is the method for making noodles.

I can't compare the food here with any cuisine but it is definitely inspired by Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese and Indian. Having said that, you just can't draw a comparison. It's was unique in several ways, the flavors, the taste, the aroma, everything. I enjoyed every bit of everything I ate. I had the tofu fritters "Hto boo gwab" which didn't taste anywhere close to the Chinese tofu. The fish paste "Ngapi chet" was just mind blowing. The strong pungent flavourful taste was cutting through the pallet. The succulent pieces of pork in "Wet tha si biyan" cooked in its own oil in a thick gravy went so well with white rice and bakchoy. I was so full that I couldn't keep place for the dessert. There's always a next time and I am gonna be a regular there i guess. But just a caveat for all food lovers, this food is authentic Burmese and not customised for the Indian pallet and I hope it stays that way.

Highly highly recommend :)

This tiny restaurant has recently opened in the Golpark area, close to City College. The place is very small & the menu is limited but the food is awesome. For starters deep fried burmese tofu was surprisingly tastier than deep fried shrimp cakes. The house dip was lip smacking. Loved the Kauknyin Baung (which is actually sticky rice) with Ngapi Chet (fish paste with red hot Chillies & garlic). The house specialty  Ong No Khaukswey was good. But Balachaung, a shrimp relish was sadly dissapointing as was non availability of the single dessert item present in the menu.
Thanks to Mrs. Chanda Datta for opening this unique restaurant in this part of the city which  boasts of many varieties of eateries.

They say bad gives way to better. Chanda's Khaukswey opening up where Mango People used to be reinstates my faith in this dictum. Located in Golpark, on your way to City College, Chanda's Khaukswey is a cosy little place on your left. They have a small menu too, with a few option to choose from- but which I am personally thankful for- for it takes me ages to figure out bigger menus. To start of with, we ordered the Boo Thi Gyaw, which are crispy gourd fritters and a Pazun Gyaw, which were fried shrimp cakes. The shrimp cakes were tasty, the filling mixed with lentils ( I think) and shrimps. Not a big fan of gourd since I was force-fed vegetables at childhood, the crispy gourd fritters were a pleasant surprise. The tempura batter fried gourd is crispy and light, and teamed with the dip, is good to taste.For the mains we ordered for the Ong No Khaukswey and the Wet Tha Si Biyan, which is a dish of rice and pork. The Khaukswey was light and flavoursome, but I think I personally preferred the pork. The preparation was rich and the pork was soft, and when had with the buttered (?) rice, it tasted exceptionally well. The dishes are decently priced as well, with the quantity and quality at par with the cost. What might be something that can be worked upon is the service, which was a little slow.Apart from that, this is a place I'd recommend, and if you're lucky, you might get to share your meal with a Parambrata or some other city celeb! ;)

On a Saturday, we decided to check this place out after hearing rave reviews about it. A tiny cute joint situated at Golpark. The ambience is cozy with nice photo frames of Kolkata and old classic music. 
One needs to be there by 8 or latest by 9 if we need a place to sit as most of the time it's full due to its small capacity (15 seater). 
The food is mind blowing. The Khoukswey is authentic and served in large portions. Service is quick and staff is friendly. I only wish in the future they would increase the time to 11 (as it closes by 9 40).
Recommended!!

We had four dishes here. Hto Boo Gyaw: which was tofu fried. Then we had Pazun Gyaw: shrimp cakes with lettuce and finally the signature dishes: Khaukswey and rice with pork sausages. All of these were great along with the price. The eatery was too small but well decorated. This was my first attempt at  Burmese dishes so at the end, loved it.

Ong no khaukswey... awesome by looks, quality and quantity... don't forget to add the ingredients available on the table... it will increase the taste extensively... Mrs Chanda is very happy go type person greets every one very well... also it an gr8 experience for having dinner with Moon Moon Sen and Rima Sen on the second last table... staffs are very courteous and pocket pinch was quite friendly...

A nice little place serving hearty Myanmar food is what this place is. The tables are too small (I was anxious that my glass of water will fall down and break), but otherwise the place is cosy.
Had their shimp cakes which were a tad bit too salty. 
Then came their signature khausuey and honestly I was a little disappointed. It could have done with more flavours and condiments. I was expecting them to serve the different garnishes of fried garlic, ginger, lime wedges, chillies etc in small bowls which we could taste according to our taste, like I have had at a few other places, but sadly this wasn't the case. 
The pork and rice however, was wonderful! The gravy was rich, oily and amazingly tasty and the pork was tender and fatty. 
However, they had run out of desserts so had to come out and hunt for chocolates. 
Will go there again for their pork and rice, and to sample their desert too.

I was new to this cuisine; but I Absolutely Loved whatever dishes I tried. So seemed all the people around. Even the Chilli Garlic Oil was awesome!

The kitchen is very hygienic. The ambience is very good; very warm, cozy... and great music to top it off!

The service is fantastic and I hope it stays this way. It's located pretty well too!

Food lovers, this is an entire new amazing cuisine to discover!

Chanda's Khaukswey is a great place if you want some "cozy" food, especially during these chilly winter months. Tasty, piping hot items.... but once you take that out from the equation, there's nothing much to blow the roof off.

So let's start with the ones we ordered:

1) Hto Boo Gway: Deep-fried tofu triangles were superb. Things went fantastic with the Burmese dip. I didn't try the other two starters, but this one is surely something to order. You're gonna love it if you're fan of tofu.

2) Ong No Khaukswey: Coming from a personal standpoint, I don't like coconut milk. But the lightness of the chicken broth along with the noddles and toppings deserves full points. Plus, the quantity of the dish is enough to fill up any hungry tummy.

3) Wet Tha Si Biyan: Loved it! The quality of the rice, bok choy and the pork was awesome. Felt like a real home-cooked meal. However, the taste of the pork gravy is identical to the 'Mutton Kosha' we are so used to having in Kolkata. If you are eager to replace the mutton pieces with that of pork, this one is definitely for you.

4) Balachaung: The Burmese version of 'Shutki mach' with shrimps. No complaints... it was well-cooked (though slightly oily) and big in quantity.

Loved the simple decor that was done with this small place. Above all, the biggest draw of this place (according to me, at least) is the hospitality. From the doorman to the servers, you're bound to receive well-mannered warmth and congeniality.

It'll be great to see the road ahead for this restaurant owned by the Dutta family, which I expect will flourish given the fact this is the first Burmese joint in the city. And even I'll plan a second trip sometime in near future, too. Fingers crossed...!

The place is easy to locate and offers authentic Burmese food amidst excellent homely ambience. We had hto boo gyaw complimented by a dip which leaves you craving for more,ong  no khaukswey_ sumptous ,wholesome and the balachaling with its refreshing flavour took our dining@ experience to the next level.pocket friendly with very knowledgeable staff Chanda's khauskey really is a much awaited respite from the mundane indochinese cuisines.

A place that titilates your taste and takes you to Burma all the way. Right from the Ong No khaukswey a perfect winter food...warm and cozy to Balanchaung...which is crispy and flavourful. The icing in the cake was the Ngapi chet with Kaunknyin Baung ..a perfect blend of spices and a great combo.
However the desert khao pyin was a spoiler ..something one can avoid ordering.
In a nutshell come get the feel of Burma closer to home.

The nip in the air and the chill of a winter's evening should make you find your way to Chanda's Khaukswey at Golpark. Dive into the perfect Ong No khaukswey, a blend of coconut milk and chicken broth with crunchy garlic, boiled egg, shredded chicken and lime. Garnish with home brewed garlic chilli oil and you have a slice of heaven. We went on to Pazun Gyaw or deep fried shrimp cakes served with a sweet chilli garlic dip, Wet Tha Si Byan or lovely red pork curry served with stir fried greens and rice. Again another bowl of khaukswey and Balachaung (deep fried crunchy dried shrimp with spices) and we almost had no place for dessert. But we did end up trying Khao Pyin or black sticky rice served with molasses and coconut cream. I will be back soon for the khaukswey that stole my winter's heart. The impeccable hospitality of the hosts will make you want to revisit time and again. Go on folks to Chanda's Khaukswey for slurping on a slice of Myanmar!

After reading the advertisement in a newspaer I visted this place. I think it is perhaps among the very few food joints which serve Burmese food. I was surprised to see Chanda Madam was there to greet every guest there. I never expected that. She was very polite and friendly too. Decor was very uniqu and sitting arrangement was of approx 10 - 12 people I have never tasted Burmese food. So each one in the menu was new to me. We tried Pazun Gyaw which was tasty. Then tried their speciality ONG No Khaukswey which was very tasty. I will ask everyone to taste it atleast once. Then tried Wet tha si byan. which was a pork curry with rice. Then have very limited menu. If they can increase the item numbers then it will be much more interesting. It is a must try for all. I am sure that it won't disappoint you

In terms of food,
We ordered Pork Curry with rice, which were really authentic. It was supported with some awesome sauce and nicely done salads to enrich the flavor.

On a whole a perfect value for money and a place which has the caliber to get in repeat customers.

Was quite disappointing unlike the rave reviews I read here. I live on southern avenue very nearby to this restaurant and decided to order a takeaway. I ordered Khaukswey and Wet Tha Si Biyan. I wanted to order Balachaung and Ngapi chet which are side dishes but was told it was shutki maachh so did not go ahead.
The Khaukswey had Burmese flavours in it and was very soupy but I literally had to hunt for chicken pieces in it and quantity of noodles was less. The pork curry was tastier and had many spices but the flavour of pork was missing and it much tasted like home cooked spicy mutton curry. 
Ambience - 3/5
Value for money-2.5/5
Food-2/5
Hospitality -2/5
Menu-1/5
The gentleman who took my order was busy attending calls while taking my order when I was talking which was kind of rude.

A small cosy Burmese food restaurant near golpark.I was dreaming of going there from the day i read its review on T2.So inspite of being on a diet decided to  eat here with my family.We all loved the food.The colour smell and taste of all the meals was very good.We ordered the Deep friend Prawns ( Balachaung), followed by Rice Pork Curry and Sauteed Greens(Wet Tha Si Biyan) and finally the most awaited dish Khaukswey(Ong No Khaukswey).All the items tasted very good and the quantity was also very good.And like someone said that the smell of coconut milk was not there only in the Khaukswey i so agree with him.Would love to visit this place again some day. Thank you once again for warm hospitality and great food.

Had lunch on Sunday. Had to wait as we hadn't made reservations but the wait was definitely worth it. Went straight to the mains and ordered Khaukswey and Red and Gold Pork Curry. Awesome is an understatement. The Khaukswey is simply divine. Hearty, simple, delicious fare. The pork curry was not as spicy as I had thought it would be but superb nevertheless. Perfect balance of spices for those who can't handle too much heat in their food. The chilli oil - fried garlic accompaniment in little pots on the table that you add to the Khaukswey deserves a special mention. Addictive. Will be back to try the other dishes. And the personal attention given to each diner by the warm and friendly Chanda Dutt is the icing on the cake.

It is strategically located. As it has a seating capacity of about only 12-13 people, we had to wait for almost half an hour to get in at peak lunch time. We ordered Tofu for appetizer as the shrimp cakes had exhausted. The tofu was soft and crispy. However, the Burmese tofu based dip was quite bland and didn't complement the tofu fry. Next we ordered the 2 entrees on menu. The khaukswey was delicious with subtle flavours. However the chicken was not distinct in flavour. For the pork curry, the gravy was floating in oil but the meat was tender. It was served with sautéed pakchoy. The gravy didn't have a blast of flavors in my mouth as I had expected. On the whole it was fine.
We ordered a parcel of the Shrimp cakes and were not highly impressed by it. The accompanying dip went well with it but the shrimp flavour was quite subdued. It is made primarily of shrimp paste and kidney beans.
Nevertheless, I appreciate the venture and the opportunity for Kolkattans to have a taste of Burmese cuisine and hope they introduce new items.
P.S. They do not take reservations and haven't yet started taking card payments.

Kolkata has always prided her streets with cuisines of all kinds, but if there was one that was needed to be ticked, it's authentic Burmese cuisine. Stumbled upon a cosy little establishment in Golpark and folks...this is not to be missed!

We started with Hto Boo Thoke which is a traditional Burmese Tofu salad, followed by their house specialty Ong No Khaukswey ( you better carry your appetite there) 

The best part was to come after this with the Kauknyin Baung (which is just sticky rice) with Wet Tha Si Biyan (this is a red and gold pork curry)-the kind you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere...

And to finish off, we had a jaggery based dessert called Khao Pyin

This was easily one of the best meals I had in Kolkata yet. Also it is super reasonable price-wise, you can never go wrong there!

After having a little chat with the lovely folks there, I was told that the main ingredients are not even locally bought but procured all the way from Myanmar giving it quite a stamp of authenticity. Its a small place with really friendly staff who will make sure that your experience will be an enjoyable one.

I will definitely be back there...for those who haven't, go ahead and check it out...you won't be sorry!!

Chanda's Khauswey, the latest and perhaps among the very few food joints which serve Burmese food is located at Golpark, in the bylane leading to South City College. My friend had been there last week on its opening day and recommended the same to me.
Yesterday afternoon we went there in a group of five, and Chanda Dutta (the owner) was herself there to welcome us. The place is very small with a seating capacity of a mere 15 people.
Having never tested Burmese before, we ordered Boo thi gyaw ( Fried gourd), Pazun Gyaw ( shrimp balls) as starters & Ong No Khaukswey (Noodles in Chicken Broth) and Wet Tha Si Biyan (Rice and pork curry) as Main course, which were all recommended by Chanda and her staff. The khaukswey and the Shrimp were truely fabulous, so were the other two. The servings were also generous and the price extremely moderate (since they don't charge tax, Vat etc yet). One thing is that they have just opened up, and have very limited options in their menu.
I liked their food and definitely would come back here to try all of their other specialities.
P.S - The owner is the wife of renowned singer Anjan Dutta.

Best and pocket friendly Burmese restaurant in the city. Situated on the lane of mitra cafe ,opposite to Zoom outlet where the restaurant 'mango people' belonged earlier. Nice ambience with seating capacity of 15 people. Here the name Chanda's refer to Chanda Dutt (wife of Anjan Dutt) . Ordered Ong No Khauwswey, Hto Boo gyaw. Though the names were odd,but the dishes were awesome. Must try for foodies. I am sure that it won't disappoint you. Hope to visit soon with my foodie friend

Excellent food. Wonderful golden pork curry with sautéed greens and a great tofu salad. The only let down was the Khau Swey which was a little short of salt.

Kolkata welcomes Chanda's Khaukswey - Taste of Myanmar, a contemporary Burmese food joint with casual, laid-back vibes. Don't expect anything but authentic Burmese fare here. If you're a fan of Burmese cuisines, then you're definitely going to swoon over their newest concept - Taste of Myanmar, in the heart of South Kolkata, Golpark area. This hidden gem makes for a great spot for quiet dinners with loved ones, small group of friends, families and transforms to a cosy space with some seriously delectable dishes of Myanmar.

We requested Mrs. Dutt to select our menu for lunch as she is undoubtedly the most knowledgeable person in the city on Burmese cuisine. She suggest to try out Burmese Hnapyan gyaw and Tofu Thoke Salad with dips for starters and for main course Ong-No Khaukswey (Chicken Coconut Noodles) & Burmese Red and Gold Wetha Si Byan (Red & Gold Burmese Pork curry), for sweet ending she recommends Kha-Pyin (Red sticky Rice with Palm sugar and Coconut). There is only glass partition between the kitchen and the seating area, so you will get to observe the cooking process and ingredients they are using, also savor piping hot dishes fresh out of the kitchen!

We started with Burmese Fried Tofu fritters (Hnapyan Gyaw) and Burmese Tofu Thoke (Typical yellow tofu salad of Myanmar) with dips — it’s so good you might just forget the accompanying dips are there. Here fried tofu & tofu thoke are genius; fried tofu was crispy, light and soft at the same time, appealing even to those who don't like tofu.

Tofu Thoke was much creamier, and almost like pudding-ish in texture, just one notch firmer accompanied with deep fried shallots which were sprinkled on top. The flavor is actually quite neutral, just like a chickpea would taste, and so it takes on whatever it’s combined with. I enjoyed the lovely balance of taste and texture.

Ong-No Khaukswey arrived next, arguably the most famous Burmese dish in Myanmar. The founder's family-favourite recipe, Ong-No Khaukswey should not be missed —noodles in a curried chicken and coconut milk broth and garnished with crisp fried bean fritters, sliced raw onions, chillies, crisp noodles, and slices of hard-boiled egg, the heady aroma will instantly make your mood better.

This dish was generally considered the predecessor of the famous Northern Thai noodle dish Khao Soi. It was a wonderfully subtle, lightly curried dish, vaguely like laksa but more comforting and flavoursome without whacking you in the face. Of course, you can also adjust the seasoning to taste - adding more fish sauce, squeezing more lime or sprinkling more chilli at the table. The chunks of chicken were fresh, flaky and smooth — perfect for a healthier option. This was perfect one pot get it done kind of dish, very much filling and incredibly mouthwatering.

The Wetha Si Byan was excellent as well: cooked flawlessly and served with steamed rice and boiled vegetables. Well, this spicy Wetha Si Byan was so good – meat was slightly crisp on the outside, extremely juicy and chockfull of flavours inside and that beautiful red spicy gravy, just look at them calling out to you. You might require a temporary break from that diet of yours. The incredibly tender pieces of pork with a top layer of melt-in-your-mouth fat will leave you helpless! You may not want to share this dish with your friends.

Finally for something a little fancier, go for their dessert Kha-Pyin that comes with red sticky rice with palm sugar and coconut. It was a light yet great dessert to relish after a heavy meal.

The approach to both the food and the space is similar, one that has found a delicate balance between honesty and flair. It is wonderfully refreshing to experience a fine menu in such a comfortable space, one that retains formality while keeping you at ease.

The dishes at Chanda’s Khaukswey were definitely playful and authentic; look forward to enjoy more and more refined concoctions at this establishment. This is the kind of soulful food that is best shared among a group of friends — you'll definitely leave with full, warm, happy bellies.
