This place is near my college. And, I really wanted to explore the place. This is basically a hookah based cafe. And the music system is way too loud. 
And Maybe this is why, I didn't liked the place much. The quotations on walls are pretty good. And, the lights on the ceiling are beautifully decorated. :)

The pocket pinch is quite a bit expensive for their quality of food. Pizza was not-so good and not-so bad. But anyway, they should work more on their presentations. And quality of food. 

PS - The hot brownie on vanilla ice cream, was ONLY thing, I loved there. üòåüòã

Good place to unwind. The live music is the main draw of this place and pretty much the main reason why it's so popular. Food is nothing to write home about. Overall , a decent joint if music is your thing. P.S : No conversation possible out here

We were on a midnight stroll to Howrah and a hungry friend of mine after vigorously going through the Zomato contents suggested to go to Jam House. 

The Hookah is a perfect turn on for this spot. We ordered a Pan flavour hookah with candy. Total worth it! The live music is the icing on the cake. They have got some really nice singers.

What makes this place a great hangout spot is the ambience- young, to the point and warm. If you love music, this is a great place to appreciate it.

The food was quite disappointing. We ordered a corn pizza with peri peri sauce. It took us some time but we realised the cheese üßÄ was the missing ingredient.üòê Too basic but the key ingredient of the dish .
We had 3 kinds of chocolate shakes- Kitkat (3/5), Choclate (4/5) and God know what the other was (3/5).

We also tried the strawberry ice tea and Lemon ice tea both were an okay. I guess I left the strawberry ice tea mid way. The outlet really has to improve on food. At the end of the day great hookah and great ambience are just value add-ons, the core still remains the food.

The food, the mocktail and the live music, just made my day at this place! What a lovely ambience. The best place to hangout on a lazy or tired evening and regain your energy with the songs sung by the singer.
 
Recommendations : some non veg dishes in  the menu and a separate sitting area for hookah and non hookah visitors!

Visited for the first time, this tiny hookah lounge was not very hard to locate. Ambience was good. Live singing was also good. But what dissatisfied me was menu. Nothing new or nothing special. Cheese jalapeno Balls and Pasta was ordered. Cheese balls were quite good but pasta wasn't too good.Virgin  Moijito was also ordered but was not up to the mark . So we decided to go to other place . Moreover service charge of 6.5% was taken as part of their mandatory policy. Special Hookah was also ordered and god knows what was so special in that hookah. Completely dissatisfied with service and food. Will never recommend this place ever.
