Been here with family sometime back. I liked the dimly lit interior. The staff were friendly. We seated ourselves and ordered for Chicken Tangri Kebab, Two special Mutton biryani and one chicken biryani. The food took really long to get served. Meanwhile we could see that people having cocktails were assisted with the food very quickly. We didn't hustle much. The food was good in taste. But the kebabs were disappointing as they were too much roasted. The fresh lime soda was the best. The tutti fruitti icecream could have been better. 
One more suggestion is to keep the washroom clean.

Last night when i was on my way to  now barracks i saw ‚ÄúAmber‚Äù , a nostalgia worked for me with others ! I was with my wife and a friend ! So after visiting bow baracks we came to your restaurant to eat ! We waited for half an hour then we got our table , but service was very bad as you guys were too busy to keep a bottle of water to the table and take orders ans aecondly when we ordered you guys suggested ‚Äúcheese chicken kebab‚Äù for starters and we were surprised to get it half cooked !! We asked the guy who was taking care of everything he said it was ‚Äúcheese‚Äù i was surprised then we asked for the bill he was so cool that he didn‚Äôt bother to sat sorry or the manager was also cool with the fact the food was half cooked ! Not done actually we are paying for the service and food you should take care of your attitudes 
Only thing i want to say that serving food is the greatest work on this earth and you guys are making a joke of it !

Yesterday I visited Amber after a long gap on an assumption that the food is as good as before but that was not.I ordered for Dal Makhani,Vegetable Jhalfrezi ,Mutter Paneer and Tandoori chicken with Masala Kulcha and Tomato soup. Chicken and Masala Kulcha was good rest items were tasteless. In my opinion one should not go there remembering good food of Old days.

We visited this place for lunch on a weekday. The interiors were dimly lit. The ambience was soothing. The waiters were a bit indifferent. We had to call them repeatedly for taking the order. Coming to food, we ordered murg reshmi kebab, mutton moti biriyani, butter nun and chicken vorta. All the dishes were just average in taste. The biriyani particularly disappointed me. It's without alu. The price was high compared to the quality and quantity of food. We are not going for a second visit.

This is one of the best restaurant I have ever been ..I am coming here for last 15years or more and till now they have not dissapointed me .The price of food is not economical but the price totally justifies the quality of food.An amazing ambience with an extra ordinary food quality.The last time we went there for lunch, we had ordered mojito, caprioska in drink and fish finger ,tandoori chicken, chicken reshmi kebab,fish liver gin ,chelo kebab , butter naan,chicken bharta in food .They serve you the best fish finger with tartar sauce (trust me you will not get this taste in any other restaurant) and don't forget to order  tutti fruity ice-cream. üòç So with no doubt I will recommend this restaurant to everyone .ü§ó

A very good place to visit with your family. The starters are really well cooked with the correct proportion of sauces and spices. Especially the tiger prawns. The main course was also really good. Biriyani being one of the best dishes to be served. To end Ina smiling note do try the tooty fruity . It is indeed very well made.

Aahh. Hurts to write an average review for such a well known restaurant. But got say for what it is. Went there on a week day lunch. The food very honestly was average, it's somehow scraped through to the finishing line. We ordered for :

Naan

Kaali dal : average again.

Keema Matter : expected a lot from this but the spice or the punch was missing from this dish.

Chicken Bharta: this was the only saving grace. The taste was pretty good and it went well with the butter naan.
 

The portion of keema was on the lesser side, which was quite disappointing.

Service from staff was very good.

This was the first time I had food from Amber. Don't know if they were having an off day or not. But they need to buck up for sure!

Visited this restaurant during the Durga Puja Festival when I was in Kolkata.
Food and Service both was excellent.
One should try the Fish Finger and Chicken Tandori. Mutton masala and Roti is also good
One can try other kebab also.
This is an old restaurant and seems they have kept their reputation.
We miss this place and often go to restaurant in Park Street but I tell you food in no way inferior
Would certainly visit again.

Amber-this is the place I am solely attached with. I have grown up eating foods from here. After a long break recently I have tried some of the dishes which I used to like when I was a little girl. The dishes include:
1. Masala kulcha
2. Paneer Butter Masala 
3. Chicken Reshmi Butter
4. Fish Finger 
The fish fingers are my all time fav. Specially the white sauce made with Mayonnaise served with the fries are just finger licking. Paneer Butter Masala and Chicken Reshmi Butter were also tasted heavenly-just the same it used to be 10-12 years ago. But I found a little bit difference in the taste of Masala Kulcha. Personally I didn't like it too much. But Amber means a lot to me. Will visit again and again ‚ù§Ô∏è

Elegant restaurant with classy interiors.
Great food except the chicken bharta which was weird in taste.
Had ordered butter naan(such a great naan after a very long time), chole masala(not too spicy, just perfect), chicken tandoori (It was marvellous). 
Our server wasn't exactly quite hospitable, he lingered a lot, messed up the dessert order and behaved as if we had to consume the dessert despite it not being our order.

Quality of food is downright bad. Service pathetic. After being assigned a table was asked mid-way to shift to a different table as it would allow them to join another table with ours to accomodate a family of eight. We objected right away to this and that made them unhappy.
Coming back to the food. Ordered chicken biryani, the rice was somewhat half cooked and tasted more of a steamed rice with boiled chicken.
Asked them for chili chicken dry and was served a gravy one instead.
Tandoori chicken was not that great.
Lastly GST (in this case 18%) should be charged on the MRP of packaged drinking water, but was falsely charged on ‚Çπ75 which is Amber's price for a litre of Kinley mineral water (which is actually ‚Çπ20). Will need to put this up with the consumer forum for sure.
Really unsatisfied by Amber and its staff.

The restaurant is located in the heart of the city of joy. Have been to this place a number of times in my childhood but somehow we lost touch with this heritage of a place. After a frantic search on the internet for a good place to dine at, with a pocket friendly rate card, I decided to visit Amber. I came back to this place after a gap of 10 years and my oh my, I wasn't disappointed at all. The simple yet elegant decor manages to open up ones appetite. They have managed to retain most of the old staffs, the only thing which has changed about the staff is that now they sport grey hair (humour intended).
For the starter we ordered Chicken Badami and Fish Orly. Unlike other places, the Chicken Badami was extremely soft. It can be said that it was 'melt in the mouth'. It wasn't chewy, but was tender and juicy. The Fish Orly was delicious too, Vetki strips fried in cornflour batter accompanied by sauted vegetables. I was missing tartare sauce so i asked the waiter as to when will the tartare sauce arrive. He smiled and said, "Sir we do not serve tartare sauce with this dish." He probably could see the sadness on my face and excused himself. Within a minute he came with a small bowl of tartare and said, "we do not like it when our guests are sad while doing the most important part of living i.e. eating". The hospitality is a big A+. Very gentle, caring and helpful management.
For the main course we ordered Butter Nan, Fish Tikka Masala and Chicken Jambori. Butter Nan was soft as cotton and spread with ample amount of butter. The Tikka Masala had 6 big chunks of Vetki fish dipped in a reddish brown thick gravy, with cream on top. The Chicken Jambori is not on the menu card. It was the suggestion from our kind waiter, and it was worth taking his advice. The chicken breasts were scrumptious. Chicken breasts cooked in white sauce accompanied with veggies. The flavour of oregano, thyme and pepper in a single sauce can never go wrong. It looks like Chicken in Creamy White Sauce, but the taste is different. It has a more fresh and Mediterranean flavour compared to the latter.
On a whole, we had a great dinner and were full till our head. The food, in terms of quality and quantity has impressed me to a great extent. It is a beautiful place for family time or a romantic evening with your special one. The dim light is an add on to the classy ambience. They have maintained their legacy and the flavours are intact. Overall a very good experience.

This is an age-old restaurant which my dad too visited lots in his younger days and loves it. The interiors are simple and decent. The service is okay. I liked the mughlai dishes better. Continental and Chinese options are also there. Must haves: pineapple blossom, fish & chips, fish orly, trutty frutty and kebabs

To fulfill your sudden north indian food cravings during office lunch hours where do you head? Voila! Amber. Great food, taste and quality one can blindly enter Amber and come out satisfied. Slightly on the higher end and yes they can improve a bit of the service. But yes for that authentic North Indian taste this is the best nearby option in Chowringhee and central Avenue area. Do drop by and you won't be disappointed

Being a Delhite, I had no clue about good places in Kolkata but a foodie does all to know about it. So my cousin told me about this famous place and its food and going here became mandatory. Going with him was a good choice since he knew all the famous dishes. 

When I entered, the ambience was calm and cool and it was a well reputed family restaurant. The service was quick and good. What we ordered - 

üîπPrawn Cocktail - Oh man! The name attracted me the most and it was praise worthy. It was so good that as soon as it landed on our table, it disappeared in few minutes and went in our stomachs. 

üîπChicken Malai tikka - Soft, juicy, spongy pieces of chicken wrapped in malai and spices. This was absolutely delicious. Loved it. Just the way I wanted. 

üîπTandoori Chicken - Again,  I was mesmerized. 4 big pieces of chicken spiced up in tandoor and served with lemon. 

For the main course we ordered - 

üîπChicken Bharta - I have never heard or had such a dish so having this was a bliss. I had this with naan and the chicken was properly minced and blended. The chicken bharta was one of their famous dishes and indeed after having it, I could believe it. 

üîπKeema - Well, we eventually wanted Brain Curry but since our order was late and there was no brain curry left, so Keema was our alternative. Keema was good and up to the mark. 

üîπDal Makhani - I loved it completely. Since I am a big fan of dal makhani, ordering dal makhani was necessary and I had no regrets. It was amazing.

üîπJeera Rice - Finely cooked with right amount of jeera, these rice added another flavour to the food. This just completed everything. 

üîπ Tutty fruity Sundae - Yay! A desert is always needes after such an amazing dinner. So the tutty fruity sundae had ice cream, nuts and jelly. Perfect, just perfect. ‚ù§

Glad I came. üòá

Apparently the first time I visited this place; I was just 2 years old. Was talked into coming here this time by my parents who wanted to relive the nostalgia.

Coming to the food; we ordered a huge Fish Fry, chicken ala Kiev and Chicken Shaslik. All the items were displayed well, scored high on my taste buds and were a good revisit to the heyday of Kolkata during the British Raj. Would also give full marks to the homely service as expected from any restaurant in the city of joy. 

The ambience was a tad classy for a place which has sort of lost its former glory as rumours suggest. However, there is still some work to be done in terms of internal decor as compared to it's peers in Park street. Also the dingy location and outer look might turn off some people as a bistro of its stature would be perceived as flashy and located somewhere more accessible. 

However; would still recommend this place owing to the food options, taste, service and the whole nostalgic Calcutta feeling written all over it. I would also term it pocket friendly compared to the restaurants in Mumbai of similar stature that are relatively overpriced.

I cant give this restaurant ¬†less than a five star. An all time favourite restaurant since my childhood. ¬†With so many childhood memories of having mouth watering foods.¬†

Food Quality - Awesome ¬†(5 star)

Ambiance - Now a days life is much more advanced so i can't give 5 as per the new lifestyle. But mumma papa will surely give the ambiance a 5 star. ¬†So overall (4.5 Star)

Quantity - Ofcourse 5 star

Value for money - visiting such a old and renowned hotel is itself value for money (according to me) . So 5 Star

Recommendation - Before trying anything ask the duty person he will advise you the food according to your taste and liking. ¬† For me i have tried almost everything since my childhood and never disappointed with their foods .¬†

Keep up the good work Team Amber.

I have been visiting this restaurant since childhood. Over the years, they have reduced the quantity and increased the price. They have changed their ambiance from traditional to western. But, whenever their Baked Fish and Mutton Moti Biryani come on the table, they can make you forget the whole world. Perhaps I have eaten the best Chicken Bharta here. If you want to enjoy the food journey of Kolkata, this place is a must try.

Amber actually disappointed me alot this time... I've been visiting this place since my childhood..But in my recent few visits am hurt..! 

Food quality has degraded..! 
If the quality is not up to the mark then the quantity doesn't matter!
*BUT* the biggest disappointment is that they have hiked the price drastically..! Wich is NT appreciable at all looking at the quality of the foods..! 
Recommended Dishes - Tandoor items

Best north indian food. Sitting arrangements are fine to accomodate a large number of guests. Prior booking is recomended as the mouth watering foods drive huge customers. Special mention includes masala kulcha n chiken bharta.

Had heard a lot about this place, it's also the favorite of my in-laws who are complete foodies.

However this trip yesterday was a downer, the food was a let down. We'd ordered garlic naan and tandoori roti, which looked so fresh when they arrived, but within moments became rubbery and a drag to chew. Rashmi chicken malai was very untasty too. The only saving grace was dal makhani.

Starters comprised hara bhara kebab (very uninteresting) and worly fish fry which was the best of all ( so I heard from others as I don't eat fish myself).

The service and ambience are good though.

Overall below expectations.

I have being in there for last 10 + years, today I visited the restaurant ¬†and got place in the ground floor area (as 1st floor was closed). Surprisingly the food was served with unwashed fork, used by some other customer. Once complained, the waited changed it with a casual approach and with a very mechanical expression as if nothing much serious has happened. Maybe there are some newcomers those certainly require some training. Such things definately requires management attension otherwise the food is of same old taste and quality.

This was one of the place to be for all the get together and family dinner in the 90's ,was not expecting the same level of service and quality but was amazed to see nothing changed from the ambience to taste everything was perfect
If you love north-indian food this is one of the place to be

What do you feel when you come from out of town to a place you have grown up visiting and adoring. That kind of feeling! Shame I have 20 mins only to dine as had a train to catch. Would have loved to spend some more time to soak in the feeling. Chana masala, kali dal, paneer butter masala, haven't changed over decades, reason why the place has services for that much time and will for more. From the person at the entrance to the one standing at the toilet, all greet with warmth that make you feel at home. Old world charm! Can't wait to be back here.....cheers!

One of the older restaurants in Kolkata, it has somewhat been able to maintain its food standards throughout these years. However the service is somewhat average as I have personally found most of the waiters to be a bit laid back. Another drawback is the limited selection in the desserts menu. But overall it is a nice place for a lunch/dinner with family.
Ambience 3.5/5

Good old fashioned place near Esplanade and very near to Chadni Chowk Metro Station as well. The restaurant is big and the ambiance is quite good. I had ordered a Chicken Onion Steak. The food is tasty, although the main problem is with the service. The waiters are a bit laid back, and the starters had arrived after the Main course was served (and eaten too). Maybe just a bit off day, but when the food is good, some adjustments can be made. Looking forward to try their special "Moti Biriyani".

Great place to eat in this part of the city.

We also tried few other dishes including reshmi kebab, fish liver gin, etc and they didn't seem to impress me. I wouldn't say this is one of the 'must eat' places, but yes you can definitely try it out!

¬†" take the bill also, don't leave¬†anything in the flap'''"

This was said because I did not¬†leave any tips there.

Masala Papad, Masala alag se lana. They took this order literally. What do I mean? We usually order a masala papad with the topping on the side because slow eating makes them soggy and hence, inconsumable. Most of the restaurant understand that by the above. But Amber is different. We ordered and then got the salad on top and literally the chat masala on the side. To this day we laugh on it.¬†

Amber is one of my favourite restaurant for Indian food in Kolkata.¬†
Food is still the same excellent and so is the quality. The ambience is good.
Their fish fry and chips with tartar sauce is heavenly, so are the other mutton and chicken preparations. The fish begam bahar and chicken do piyaza are simply awesome main course preparations and the same could be said about the chicken pulao. The tutti frutti ice cream is a perfect way to wrap up an awesome dinner.

Despite having ordered the food from the original Amber, they made the decision to deliver food from their Park Street Branch. The food was absolutely terrible. The mutton (Rogan Josh) was undercooked and tough as leather, and the gravy was unbelievably greasy and had a terrible consistency. The Dal Makhani was bland and tasted stale. The Chilli Fish was god-awful. It was basically fried fish in cheap chilli sauce (the bottled kind). And don't even get me started on the quantity of food they offered. I couldn't fill a basic (shallow) serving bowl with three packets of Dal Makhani.¬†Absolutely disgusted at their blatant lack of respect for their customers. I have been to the restaurant (not the Park Street branch) and I love their food, but I sure as hell will never ask for home delivery again. And judging from their food quality, I'd stay clear of their Park Street branch. Despicable service.

If you're looking for a place that serves delicious north Indian food and a good ambience, this place is a must visit!
Located in Waterloo street, this restaurant serves undoubtedly the most juiciest kebabs. Last night I visited this place with my family for the second time, and both of my experience were good.
For starters we ordered mahi malai kebabs, chicken Reshmi kebabs and chicken sheekh kebabs. The meat was cooked perfectly retaining a highly intriguing delicate flavour of the aromatic spices that didn't fail to impress our taste buds. Especially the mahi malai kebabs, they just melted in our mouth. 
We also ordered a platter of fish fry which was served with chips and mayonnaise, giving us a feel of the authentic English style fish and chips. It tasted heavenly and probably the best I have ever had.
For main course we ordered murgh bharta, brain curry and masala kulcha which again didn't fail to impress us. 
Cooked in an amazing combination of a variety of flavours with a rich creamy consistency, the murgh bharta and brain curry were a perfect treat along with the kulcha.
Lastly for dessert we ordered a chocolate sundae, which was again very delicious.
In all, though the food is a bit pricey it does complete justice in terms of good taste, quality and quantity.
I will definitely speak highly about this place while recommending to my friends.

AMBER ZONE...

There are some childhood memories attached to this place when my father would bring a parcel of kababs after finishing his official meeting with some corporate clients and would enter home with that smoky surprise. A casual ordinary dinner would at once change to something special and classy. Those nights were remarkable. My dad never forgot that tiny mouth waiting and mouth watering at home ...

For me the Amber is full of nostalgia, and great memories, dating back to the early 1970's when Amber was ruling the scene of North Indian cuisine in the city! It was one of the few centrally air conditioned establishments and the food and service were great! Often in the evening there were lines of hopeful patrons out on the streets !
Today, decades later, the Anber still holds a firm place as one of Kolkata's wonderful eateries! It's a must: chicken Makanwalla and paratha for me please!

Well, we had a hard time locating this restaurant but it was none of their fault üòÖ...so can't complain. The ambience is nice for a perfect dinner. The staffs were good. Didn't take much time to get our food served. To start, my parents had Iced Tea; I had a Virgin Mojito and there was Murgh Reshmi Kabab and Gosht Seekh Kabab. For the main course, we had Chicken Biryani and Dal Makhni and ended with a Vanilla Ice cream. Parents had Kulfis. Can't really complain about anything except the price which was a bit on the higher side. But that's what you expect at such posh restaurants. So yeah, overall it was a nice experience. Would be looking forward to the next visit.

You Cannot fault the food. The kebabs are still the best in the business, the prawn cocktail still a class apart and the Keema mutter masala kulcha combination still unparalleled. 
Old timer service and a full on nostalgia Trip. 
The interiors have seen better days , though it's spacious and opulent, the furniture  needs to be reupholstered. Cheap lounge bars have mushroomed in the neighborhood, with their loud music and very questionable clientele . Find a good parking away from these and you are sorted.

There is something about these places, like the saying goes 'Old is Gold'! Went with family on Navami night and came back satiated and üòÄ
Great things:
- Despite being a Puja night, they didn't keep us waiting beyond the promised 15 minutes 
- Extremely polite and attentive elderly waiters 
- For a crowded night, fast and efficient service 

Now coming to the food, we ordered the following:
Chicken sweet corn soup - Good
Fish finger - Superb
Chicken tengri kebab - Good
Chicken reshmi kebab - Good
Gosht nukti korma - Superb 
Mutton rogan josh - Superb
Aloo jeera - Great
Keema, butter & garlic nan - All good 
Tutti fruti - Good
Bloody Mary & Mojito - Great 
Crispy fingers, juicy kebabs, succulent mutton pieces,  distinctly different gravies, everything just how it should be, what can I say... üòç

My dad said he used to come here in the 60's, food is still as great, so go ahead and indulge üëç

Been here tonyt for MahaNabami dinner with friends ... I.e. 10/10/16.

A very posh restaurant indeed.... With nice interior n comfortable seating arrangement (a soothing background music would hv enhanced the ambience)... Vry calm n quiet atmosphere !
The hospitality is good.

Very costly... Quantity is not really worth the price.
Food quality was good.
We ordered.. Chicken drumstick, lasooni betki, veg friedrice , chicken boti rara.

Wat surprised me is that the waiters asked for tip explicitly... Although there was enough service tax levied in the bill.

This must visit restaurant has been one of my favorites since childhood. The best part is that the rate of the food has remained the same over the last 20 years if not more. It's rare to find a restaurant that has excelled tandoori, Indian as well as continental dishes. A special mention about their Baked Fish , Bharwan Aalo Tandoori and Prawn Cocktail. Other than thosethe following list of dishes are also just tries and just have to be mentioned (not in any order as it's difficult to pick one).
1. Fish Liver Gin
2. Fish Orly
3. Murgh Malai Kebab
4. Mahi Peshawari Tikka
5. Murgh Bharta
6. Chicken Tetrazzini
7. Chicken Ala Kiev
8. Chicken Princess
9. Naan- one is enough to fill you.
It's a family restaurant with an extremely well mannered staff. (It's also a good place for vegetarians to visit, their veg kebabs, kaali dal and veg continental dishes are pretty darn good too).

Amber is a place closely attached to my memory. My dad used to bring us here whenever we used to visit Kolkata. During the early 90s it used to be our favorite restaurant.

I still remember sitting in the family section in the crowded cubicles enjoying a lavish Indian meal. The North Indian had a distinctive taste of its own.
The gaiety of the place astounded me during those days.

I revisited the place a couple of months back. Sat in the bar section. Sipped a mug of beer and went for a chicken stroganoff. T'was so-so.

Do visit the place if you have old world nostalgia bothering you and enough time to kill.

My father is a fan of this place. ¬†They have some great continental dishes, Chicken Au-Gratin and Chicken Tetrazzini being my favourite here.¬†The North Indian and Tandoori dishes are great too, specially the fish preparations. The Baked Fish is worth mentioning. So is the Mahi Peshawari Tikka.¬†The kababs are delicious, Gosht Peshawari Barra and Murgh Malai kabab being at the top of the list. My parents love the Dal makhani, Kulcha, Chicken bharta and the peas pulao and end up ordering it everytime, whatever else might I order. :D The cheese-cherry-pineapple deserves a special mention, I heart it completely. :)The ambience is nice and ideal for family get-togethers. The pocket pinch is a bit high, but it's worth it!

Amber is no longer the same old #Amber of 1980s and 1990s Selling poor quality food and perhaps to the target market of petty cheap people media...SHUTDOWN AMBER.

It is one of the best that I would say. I did not click that much of picture so I am just writing my feedback. It you want to see Bengal Dynasty you can see it in Amber. From the point you get in and to the exit point you will be pampered as a King and you will love it. Service is good, taste of the food is awesome.. Loved it fish fingers..baby corn, cheese cheery pineapple..lastly butter nun and tikka butter masala..loved it's food and service..please visit this restaurant to see what it gives you as a foodie..

What can I say? Heard so much about this legendary restaurant but what I experienced was not even average ! Went there with my friends for lunch on a weekday...First of all, the ambience is really nice and classy which makes this place appealing. We order our food....usual north indian menu...Paneer tikka,Chicken reshmi kebab,Butter tandoori roti,chicken biryani, Paneer butter masala, and 1 dal.
To put it simply...the taste was very basic, nothing new or extraordinary. And that tandoori roti was tough as hell...I never had such bad experience with a simple tandoori roti ever! When the bill came the whole experience was not at all worth the price we paid. Never going back or recommending to anyone! That's all.

This review comes after my numerous visits to this place over several years. If this review was written before my recent visit, then the above ratings would have been some where between 4 - 4‚Ä¢5. So it means there is something due to which the standards have dropped and that is definitely the preparation of food. They are still good with their service. Very courteous staff, quality of food still good but preparation for some dishes have  detoriated. For starters we had ordered Fish liver gin, which was sort of a greasy fish and chips, but tasted different and decent. Fish fingers were over fried and not at all recommended. One can try their Cherry cheese pineapple which is really good and refreshing. Panner tikka was decent too. Chicken do-pyaza was not good at all and was too oily. What was surprising to me that they couldn't make a simple dish like chicken bharta properly, ordering the dish was a total disaster so won't recommend it, but one can go for their chicken butter tikka masala, which was the best dish of the evening and highly recommendable. Now the million $ question is what will you have all these recommended dishes with ? Their breads are pathetic. Thick, hard and unpalatable. Though their garlic butter nan is not the conventional one and is very very thick but is soft and can help you to finish off your curry. I feel they really need to look in to the preparations, just because it's still a hit among a lot of Kolkata folks, doesn't mean they can sail through with this kind food preparations.

Its a nice nd old restaurant. Even i can say amber is a heritage of Kolkata. I've visited this place lot of tym. Amber is famous for Bengali food. Located near esplanade area .Exactly on the opposite side of new aliah, little bit difficult to find but food is decent enough.

Address: 11,Waterloo Street,Esplanade,kolkata.

About restro: Its a historical place. Ambience is good. Nd staffs r also good. they provided great service. Interior decor is average but nostalgic. As for food, we ordered fish liver gin and tutti-frutti.

Fish liver gin: this item was too good. Small bhetki batterfry served with veggies sauteed in butter. I can suggest that if u like fish then must try it.

Tutti-frutti: the icecrm was delicious nd beautifully presented. There was vanilla and strawberry scoops with lots of fruits and Cherry topping.

Amber comes with a lot of tradition.Visit here atleast once without hesitation.  A nice evening out. Overall i like this place..

This place has been an old favourite restaurant of my family ... The chicken Bharta of this place is just too blissful but the taste is no more the same as before it keeps changing everytime I go there at-least I feel so but then still it tastes awesome .. The bake fish of this restaurant is the one to die for .. It simply just yummmm and fantastic ... The cream of chicken soup is also a fav it's just fab ... So if you planning to go this place do try the baked fish if not everything .. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Another place to reckon for a good dining experience. I go way back to the 90s when Amber used to be one of those elite restaurants where one would take their non-Calcuttan relatives to. Spread across 2 or 3 floors, this place used to serve the best north Indian according to my taste. Even now, the food retains its distinctive flavours that sparks off nostalgia and heightens the taste buds as well. Kababs and any curry are worth a try. Low on oil and spice, it is perfect for the modern foodie.

Perfect for the authentic naan paneer chana black dal combo. Safe place to go for family outings. This place is very consistent with their food. Staff is courteous. They could work a little bit more on their desserts which still serves the famous tooty frooti but this day and ¬†age requires some flair in desserts and conventional desserts dont cut it anymore.
Love the place for its food and flair in using spices.
Thanks Amber.

I don't understand what is the fuss about this restaurant! I did not find anything extraordinary in the setting or ambiance. The food was very ordinary and the quantity was less given the prices..Two people can't share even a side dish.I felt prices were inflated to a great extent.

A long walk from esplanade metro towards lalbazar side, when you reach hotel aliah just on the opposite side you find this age old restaurant. Me and my friend went there for lunch, we had tandoori mushroom as starter, in maincourse we had chicken biryani and murgh bharta (as they named it). In drinks we took vat 69. This restaurant is mostly visited by local customers, office goers as the location is a busy office hub and its a decent place to sit among the entire area. Service and servers are slow and kind of stubborn. And the quantity of food plus price did not seem to be justified, though its age old restaurant but it can never add glory to kolkatas history of happening food joint.
Coming to taste of the food which we were served was really not worthy of trying and was not expected in amber.
With a lesser will of writing a review about this place, here i am after scribbling quite a few lines rate this place with 3.0 for a nice, quite ambiance.

We mostly had North Indian. After About N number of visits I can say that the paneer butter masala , the Chana masala and the black dal is one of the best served in the city..never liked them kulcha at the place but the tandoori roti was perfect. And ofcourse the paneer tikka was immaculate. The place has its own loyal fan club and if you come to like the place you are bound to be a regular

Have been visiting this place since childhood. My grand father was a regular at this place. This was carried forward by my father nd his brother. All the old staff have been replaced with new ones. Since then the service has dropped tremendously. All the lazy fools work here now. Very very slow service nd very lousy ambience with poor maintenance. This is the only reason i have given them 4points.
Now talking about their food quality. Nothing to complain about till now. They serve some delicious continental affair and have been maintaining their quality well. Their chicken princess nd fish liver gin are to die for. Pineapple blossom is a trademark mocktail which cant be compared with any restos. I personally dont like indian food but maximum customers opt for their indian items which still holds it value in their customers heart.

This is one place where I have been eating at since my childhood.
I was not very fond of it as a child...but as I grew up, I understood the consistency in taste that this place had been maintaining since decades. Their Dal s, Paneer, Chana and Mukka Pyaaz are all time favourites. I have not had better Tandoori Roti's than theirs'. It is a place integral to Calcutta and its food culture. A place which must feature in your list of regular dining options.

My personal recommendations would be Chicken tandoori(must have), Chicken bharta, Any bread items and Mutton Saagwala. Their sundaes are good too. I have not tried their continental so cant comment on that. One of the legendary places in Kolkata.

Amber is a historical place. Little difficult to find and park closeby.

Continental dishes were done better.¬†
Fish orli was good. Chicken kababs were also good served with a bunch of grossly cut onions which took away the presentation points.

Now coming to their north indian dishes; Naans and kulchas were brick hard in minutes.¬†
The chicken butter masala was really just ok. Dal makhani was bad.

This must have been the most sought after place in olden days but needs to sync up to the present times.
I think the presentation needs a lot of improvement .

Utterly disappointed. This place has failed to maintain its standard. I don't understand why cause they charge quite handsomely for their food. Visited the restro 2-3 days ago. Sampled mutton masala, kulcha, butter naan and chicken tikka masala. While the kulcha was adorable, the naan was chewy and harsh! Mutton masala was insipid. While the mutton pieces were full of bones, the gravy tasted bland.. Chicken tikka masala was regular. I have had much better ones. Though the chicken pieces were of a considerable size. Was thoroughly dissatisfied with the food. Service was prompt and the person managing the take away counter was courteous and amiable.. Amber comes with a lot of tradition. Hope the owner(s) of this place will manage to upkeep it.

Amber - One of the Best ever Oldest yet Splendid North India typically Mughlai Cuisine in Esplanade at the heart of Esplanade.. Went there a couple of times long before Zomato but now recently went there with my Friends after being an active Zomato user.. My Target was specifically to have their Pulao and Main Course in Mutton.. Ambience has improved and Staffs are good now.. Ordered Mattar Pulao , Nargisi Keema , Jeera Aloo and Butter Nun... The Keema was superb and melted in seconds in mouth.. Pulao in one word was superb honestly but would have been excellent if it would have been like a little more Ghee types.. Jeera Aloo was a surprise twist to the Menu but it won our Hearts.. Nun was very good also but the best was the Keema preparation that I took.. Overall in the mid-range priced Menu... you get to choose a variety of Options from such a legendary restaurant in a Metro city like Kolkata.. Looking forward to have another visit as usual..

LOCATION:

Situated on the ever so busy Waterloo street right off Bentick Street. This restaurant falls under the Legendary category so just enter Waterloo street and shout "Amber Restaurant Kothaye" and someone or the other will point you in the right direction:)

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

I have grown up eating Amber food especially during my frequent visits to the Calcutta Swimming Club on Strand Road where Amber runs the North Indian Kitchen. The restaurant itself on Waterloo Street is huge and housed on multiple floors. Decor is basic but nostalgic. I have heard they have renovated but have not been there after renovation so cant really write about that.

WINE & DINE:

The Amber Masala Chips is what legends are made of. People actually call for it when I travel believe it or not. The recipe itself is simple but I think the trick is in the red chilli powder these use. Many have tried to replicate it but failed over the years. However, on my last few visits, I found the chips to be stale. Also the chips did not contain enough of the spice or the onions.

The Chicken Masala Kebab is also really good. Its basically a better version of Chicken Tikka. This dish was good with the correct amount of spice and well cooked chicken.

The Paneer Butter Masala is thick, rich and creamy and there is a particular wow factor to the combination of Paneer Butter Masala, Pindi Chana and Dal Makhani here. By itself I feel the Dal is bland and weak but the Pindi Chana is the best you can get in the city. Have it as a main or as a snack with a mug of beer and it wont disappoint. But where it all went wrong for us were the breads. The Naan was rubbery and difficult to chew and the tandoori Roti was breaking like papad. While we got the same replaced, I have to base my review on what was served to us. Service was old school and good but the problem was with the pricing. Food did not seem worth the extravagant pricing being charged. We payed in excess of Rs.2500 for the 3 of us without any alcohol. At that price I could think of better options.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Agreed you are a legendary restaurant, but prices must be in consonance with food and ambience. It is not so at present !. I could still go there as I do crave the good old amber food at times, but then everything has to be spot on if I am to pay that much for it.

VERDICT:

Must go for the legendary feel and the combination dal, paneer and chana. You wont get that flavor anywhere else. Whether you return or not is a difficult question to answer.

Overhyped & overpriced are the 2 words which describes this place perfectly. Our client decided to treat us at this place for some light snacks post work. So the 5 of us decided to hit  this place.

The place is very spacious with full a.c & a mini bar counter in the middle. Since we were very hungry,so we quickly ordered the following:-

1. Fish fry- light crispy coated bhola bhetki served which shallow fried french fries. This was ordinary to be honest. The size was good though & the thickness of the fry was moderate. This cost Rs320 which was so disappointing since it was not up to the mark.

2. Paneer cutlet- Our veg colleague had taken this item. 2 medium sized cutlets served with potato chips

3. Normal tea- This was another bummer since the tea's water to milk ratio was very disbalanced.

They charge vat & service tax separately. Our final bill came to 2177 which i thought was too expensive as compared to the quality we were served. The service was good though but certainly i wont recommend this place

I have spent most of my childhood associated with this resturant . It has strong heritage , strong ambience and top class service : something which makes a brilliant dinner . Prior to the food expansions within the city this was a very important restaurant with brilliant food . The multicuisine has fair variations amongst Indian and Chinese delicacies . But the best part is the chicken pakora . The pakora here is totally different from any where you have eaten . It is the thinnest sheet of besan layer over boiled chicken which along with mustard sauce makes a voluptuous meal . The price tag is on the higher side but for first timers it is a must have . !

The restaurant's ambience for dinner is worth appreciating, for the interior's dim lightings and mellow decors. As for food, we'd ordered naan, dal makhani, paneer butter masala, murg reshmi butter masala and shahi korma. So far as North Indian food goes, Amber's cuisine's taste is average to above average, but definitely palatable. It fails to occupy a high place amongst the bigger restaurants who have won laurels for their North Indian delicacies. In all, an above average restauranr that can be given a miss. The guests dining with me had commented on the not-so-satisfactory  quality of the food. However if one's looking to try out just a North Indian dish and not the expected first class taste then Amber will dutifully cater to his or her epicurean taste buds.

Visited the place with a guest after a few years..must say utterly disappointed with food quality/service quality. The waiter serves the main course instead of starters and that too brings the wrong item ordered. Waited for a long time to be served the starters later on and equally for the main course. Cocktail and food way below standards in compariaion to price charged. Must say one of my most pathetic food experiences ever. Probably the management needs to step in. Thoroughly diappointed.

Amber is mainly a bar cum reataurant situated in the old office area of Calcutta. But still it doea not comptomise on food quality.

I just checked in for a quick evening snack & end up ordering their two all time favourite items.... Baked fish & tutti frutti ice cream.

'Excellent', 'Outstanding' will fall short to deacribe baked fish. It was awesome. Even it is better than the Fish mueniere of Peter Cat & Mocambo. This is a signature dish of Amber & a must try.

The tutty frutty ice cream is also great with fresh fruits.

Stuff were warm. But it is not a hangout place for young, neither for family. You can go these for good food & drink.

This is a legendary restaurant here in North Kolkata famous for its North Indian delicacies.. We took tandoori rotis, Nan along with chicken bharta and mutton rogan josh..all the items were very good.. Though the price is on the higher side,the quality is quite good for the price..Overall I like this place a lot..

Its been a family favourite for ages. I used to look forward to my treat in Amber for any good deed that I did. During a recent trip to Kolkata it was my turn to treat my parents in Amber and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The decor has undergone little change and the taste still the same. Amber is still Amber with their succulent and juicy kababs to the creamy curries. We had the peas pulao, paneer, fish kabab and chicken reshmi kabab. It still carries the Kolkata heritage of Mughlai and Punjabi cuisine; successfully.

Amber is a very old place in chandni which was very famous among people from my parents generation. Keep hearing stories about them and there college gangs. Recently been here a few times. Usually other their Kali dal, chola and masala kulcha. 
This is a nice place of someone wants to revisit an old Kolkata eatery. Quite rightly deserves a place in the legendary chart.

Recently we went to have dinner after a decade here. I had sweet memories of this place. I was eager to taste my favourite dishes. We ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Mutton Roganjosh, Butter Naan and Sweet Lime Soda. But I was completely disappointed with the food. The taste and standard has deteriorated drastically. Its a no match with the dishes it used to serve a decade back. Completely disappointed. None the less the ambiance still has the old charm. But all in all a big let down.

Three of us friends went for a friday night dinner. We ordered fish liver gin (not that great) chicken mayo ( tasted average) and chicken tandoori (strict no no). Then we oredered for dry chilli chicken. It was a disaster. 5 or 6 tiny pieces of coated chicken in some super awful sauce. Not at all satisfied with the taste of the food that too when its also overpriced...

Went to this place back in 2003 and can safely say after visiting this place after ten years that the decor and flavour hasn't changed one bit. I can still distinctly remember the taste of stuffed kulcha and tikka masala. Always a delight to come back here as I get to feel the essence of my childhood memories, the little tiff I had with the washroom attendant related to tipping.¬†
Come here for a mellow dining experience with family and friends owing to its dimly lit seating complementing the romantics.

Lovely food...no...awesome food. Fish kebab perfectly cooked. Flaky and tender. Succulent chicken tandoori. The tandoori prawn could have had some more added flavor. Chicken bharta and pindi chana was fabulous.
Management must stop bearers, lift man, door man asking for tips. It is embarrassing. 
Nay on the mutton sheek kebab. Too much dal and extra beer required to wash it down. 
Fish Malai Kebab was awesome, as was the brain masala.

Remembered our childhood when Amber used to be an aspirational place for food for us. Visited today and felt very nostalgic. My wife felt the same as she has similar memories of visiting with her Dad. We ordered Moti Biryani, Dahi Ghost, Chicken Do Piyaja and Butter Nun. One would rarely find Moti Biryani at any other place. The taste was heavenly. The rice was made so well that it held all the taste of the masala and the mutton. The Dahi Ghost was also great. I should also specially mention the Nun. It was fluffy, soft and a bit sweet, the kind of stuff one would get in Middle Eastern countries. It was so good that I could have finished my lunch with the Nun only. The Chicken Do Piyaja was not that good but who cared after having the Biryani, Dahi Ghost and the Nun!

We used to like the food at Amber but when we went on Sunday, we were sorely disappointed. The food had too much salt and the taste left us totally dissatisfied. It was just ordinary and mediocre. The place charges so much, the least that they can do is taste it before serving it. Not surprising there were hardly any people there. They had better "pull up their socks" so to say.

Visited the place after over a decade... thankfully some good things remain good. Brought back memories, all of them good! One place where we can still order for golden fried prawns and get a mean crumb- fried prawn and chips, and not the batter fried variety with soggy prawns which has become the standard nowadays. The tandoori chicken is out of the world with no food colouring; it has a lovely salty crunchy top layer, golden brown. We had the prawns, chicken kebabs, tandoori chicken, kaali daal and mutton korma with some butter naan. The naan is not your typical one footer tough piece of bread here; it is a one- inch thick porous and spongy bread: heavenly. The korma is lovely too, and the taste is just right and balanced. As I said, thank God some good things remain good!

To start with, a place which is more of the restaurants of 1990s, typical place that serves you dry bhujia with starters and alcoholic drinks. Ambience is not what the modern gen people would like, personally like me as it reminds me of those ancient places that I went to in my childhood. 

Though it seems renovated compared to old standards but they need to do a lot more to make it upmarket. A typical crowd, not what you find in most places in the modern day life. 

Rotis or breads like I call it or prefer it to be, are ridiculously thick... Vegetable though was delicious, the only thing that made my family happy was that they still serve Egg curry which is not available in most places nowadays...

To end with, I think this place is more for alcoholics than families, though the food is outstanding.

Service is good and upto the mark. The cost is in the little higher side. The amount of  fried rice is good enough for one person, better to take 3 rice bowl for 4 persons. Tandoori items are great. Only poor item I have encountered here in my 3 times visit is Chilli chicken. In drinks, I liked Blue Moon! It's just awesome! Try it.

We had a family dinner at Amber after several years. Since childhood this bar-cum-restaurant have had secured a special place in my family's and my hearts.However, this time it disappointed us . The starters were good-its legendary tandoori chicken and fish finger .For main course we ordered Chicken Bharta and Mutton Rogan josh with Butter Nan for bread. The chicken bharta was utterly disappointing with too much oil in it and nowhere near to the taste of the same that we had in my childhood and growing-up years. Mutton Rogan Josh was a very run-of-the mill stuff . The worst out of these was the butter nan. Each nan was huge in size and thick as a mattress ! Naturally the nan was not done fully throughout the thickness of the bread . Never did I have so thick nans in my life(don't remember if we had this kind of nan last time we ate at Amber ,several years back) .One thing needs to be pointed out here,hoping the management will look into - Quantity. ¬†This is not at all up to the expected amount compared to the price of each item. To finish with ,we had Tutty Fruity Ice-cream which was again nothing special for us.

Founded by the Khullars this is a Kolkata institution.

The three storied structure has family space upstairs.

If you ask me the real fun is in the downstairs bar.In the eighties and the nineties in a still thriving Esplanade and before the offices and corporates started moving South towards Minto Park,Elgin Road and Theatre road this was the place where the mid level executives congregated along with a few top ones as well.

The evenings were noisy,loud affair with some serious drinking always accompanied by the chanachur and the pudina/dahi chutney with onions that Amber invented.

Well today it was family time and you can make out the glory days are over.The swagger of the stewards are gone and so are the long waiting hours.The seats do not seem as plush as they seemed a decade ago or maybe the newer eateries has raised our expectations.

Tandoori Chicken,Kheema mutter,Brain Masala,Butter Chicken,Kadak Tandoori roti kind of nails it for us every time and this time was no different.Happy to note the food is still top notch.Maybe the service can be a little quicker.And the linen a little cleaner.

Else the legend lives on.....

Located right in the heart of Esplanade,Amber has been serving up quality food for more than a generation now.Now with the coming up of an innumerable number of new age modern sophisticated restaurants Amber may have lost out a bit in on its renown but it still offers pretty decent food and remains popular among the loyalists and the new generation of foodies alike.

I had visited Amber after ages for a quick lunch a few days back.The ambiance and decor though nothing exceptional or spectacular still carries a certain old world charm.The seating arrangements are nice and comfortable. The waiters here have mostly been working here ages and can be guilty of being a tad slow and also looking after the loyalists that bit extra.

Coming to the food,we ordered a nan,murgh butter masala and a brain masala.The Nan was nice and soft.The murgh butter masala was creamy and buttery.I enjoyed the thick rich consistency of the gravy and also the fact that the chicken was very well cooked.The Brain masala was also pretty good.There are very few places where you would find brain masala and the version served up here would rank highly. The Tandoori Chicken here also deserves a special mention. The continental fare here is decent but I for one would much rather prefer park street for continental. The drinks are well priced and the stock is decent too.But one would find many other places with a far better ambiance for having a drink.

Overall Amber is undoubtedly one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata which is still serving up decent quality food to go with all the heritage and nostalgia attached to this place.

People from all age groups fill up this legendary restaurant in the Esplanade area. It has come a long way over so many decades and has earned the trust of its guests.  

It has multiple levels with the top floor being the more family-friendly kind whilst the ground floor is primarily for men looking for a drink and some nice grub. 

My all time favorites at this restaurant include Chicken Reshmi, Chicken Butter Masala, their differently amazing Tandoori Roti- all downed with an On-The-Rocks of Chivas Regal.

While I write this review , I won't be able to resist writing about Sagar as the owners are same and the kitchen is same .
It's nostalgia whenever I think of amber / sagar . Guess all the 90's born kolkatan can  relate fine dining restaurant with amber and sagar . The interiors still remind you of the eating out scenes of the Bollywood classical movies of the 80's .
Infact those days  it was an exhibition of status if you were in the league of those who dined @ sagar and amber .
The butter chicken , the kaali Dal , the paneer matar , the fish korma was a gastronomer's delight and still continue to tickle the taste buds , though the grandeur may not be the same as it used to be . Not to forget the ubiquitous button onions dipped in vinegar The baked betki still remains a connoseir's delight which is a chutzpah to the new fusion and continental blokes in town . I still come across people who had been occasional visitors to Kolkata talking about Amber with their grandchildren . That's what Amber is but its sibling Sagar has already written its epitaph .  My childhood memories are never complete without Sagar as the reward which my dad gave for any accomplishment in school.

Amber; if I talk about food, it's good. Chicken butter masala was tasty and had very smooth gravy. Chicken was tender and juicy. Naan was hard so they replaced it with butter naan. Mutton biryani wasn't up to the mark; was plain and spice-less. 
Ambience is something I personally feel isn't segregated coz for the crowd. Mostly men, fully drunk seating beside our table. 
I feel one needs to understand that it's a place where all kind of food lovers will come and drinking randomly might make people uncomfortable. The smell really bogged me down here!!! Went to so many places where one can have hard drinks along with their meals but this palace is quite suffocating. 
The washroom has a keyhole where anyone can peep inside. So Alert!!! 
Take care guys!!! 

Thank you

The place is really good. The ambience the structure is a perfect mix of serenity and extravagance. The food was good. Just good. I tried the chicken tikka kebab, fish peshawari kebab, chicken reshmi butter masala, mutton shahi korma and chicken bharta. In continental I had space for only chicken au gratin. 
Now review: steer clear of the shahi korma and the bharta. They were two of the worst dishes I've ever tasted. The reshmi masala was good and so was the tikka kebab. The au gratin was very creamy and mouth filling with a perfect crust. 
The mojitos were  good and the service was average.

We've been going to this place for family dinners,since I was a child.
Amazing Mughlai courses.Amazing starters.
The dessert options are limited but good enough.

Cheese gold coins for starters.Do have it with white sauce. 
For the main course,The Baked fish in tangy sauce is out-of-this-world.It is saucy, a little spicy,soft yet a little crunchy on the outside.This is an absolute hit with me and my cousins.
Chicken Au Gratin was not good,it was chicken pieces swimming in a pool of cheese. :3
The Biriyani,Nun,paneer and chicken side dishes are delicious and spicy.

Ambience is nice,like a regular family restaurant.

I have been visiting this place since my childhood and after a long decade it was time for me to visit this place again, a bit nostalgic about this place. The lift still remains the same today. Spread across two floors, we were seated on the first floor.¬†

Ambiance is really nice, from the menu we first ordered starters, the Golden fried prawn and chilli fish and Tandoori murg. I really liked the Golden fried prawn and the tandoori murg. On the main course we ordered Murg Reshmi butter masala and Pulao, I wanted to go for a continental dish so I added up the Chicken Tettrazani. Loved all of them and no complains.¬†

I am looking forward to the next visit to this place.

Ordered different types of Paneer & Mushrooms along with other dishes.

A part of parcel pack consisting of 2 Mushroom dishes were sucking..BAD rotten smell...when informed them about this issue, they replaced ONLY 1 plate instead of replacing BOTH the plates. (If Mushroom is NOT in edible condition it could be dangerous to one's health)

Have been Amber foodie for last many years but FIRST TIME experienced such harmful quality of FOOD and poor service from Amber - I think, I'd go to other restaurants which are at least at par with Amber (used to be)!

Curious that after demise of its prime Founder few months back ,whether Amber has started losing its sheen ?

This place is good for every occasion and for going out with all kind of people.  The nicest thing about this place is its absorbing ambiance and it's awesome sense of privacy even when it's totally packed. The staffs are among the most experienced and efficient. They specialise in north indian food amd and one should go for the mutton items in particular to get a real feel of their chef's magic. Our starters comprising of golden prawn and the tandoori items were also delicious but their mutton preparation were on an altogether different level.  This place also serves good drinks at reasonable prices and the atmosphere absorbs everything from a college group to couples, families and business meetings.

Amber is one of those few restuarants in the city which have maintained its positions as a top spot joint for more than half a decade..For many foodies in kolkata Amber is not just another restuarant,its a status statement,its a symbol of luxury and elegance..Interestingly it was Sagar which was started earlier but it is Amber which rose to define the food culture of Kolkata with its unique assortment of Continental and North Indian dishes..I have frequented this place ever since childhood and whenever we crave for a fining dining experience this used to be the automatic choice of my father..It is probably this place where my everlasting bonding with Chicken Reshmi Kebab started and I believe they still serve one of the finest Reshmi Kebab in the city..The ambiance is one of those vintage looks.. old style sofa sets,classy decor,though they haven't upgraded much in recent times..
The main issue is defintely service which somehow lacks alot in recent visit,felt a sense of indifference among the servers..
Coming to the food as mentioned,their Chicken Reshmi Kebab is to die for..Other highly recommended items are Golden Fried Prawn, Mutton Reshmi Kebab, Roganjosh, Mutton Moti Biriyani, Baked Fish to name a few..Honestly I feel all their items are prepared with same level of expertise..but recently the quantity and even the taste has deteriorated much while the prices have increased steadily..To wrap up your dinner nothing feels better than their Chocolate Nut Sundae or Chocolate Mousse..period..Overall you might not get a taste of their past greatness but its still worth the visit..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

It's by far the worst but surprisingly well known restaurantin kolkata. Last week i was there at 5 in the evening . First of all the staff is all senior citizens who are very slow and related about everything. I ordered one vodka based cocktail wich was pritty bad as it did not seem to contai any vodka moreover it was like sugar syrup. Then came the fish fry whuch was good. Next i had to wait for the main course for 20 min though i had placed the full order beforehand. I had ordered chicken varta and 2 butter tandoori roti.... roti was without butter and cold... varta wass so so couldn't have the whole thing cos it tasted bad.

It's one of those special Indian restaurant which I adore like anything in spite of not being a fan of this cuisine. Amber is an old restaurant where you find a perfect blending of elegance and good food. Yesterday, had visited this place after a long time. And yes, I was happy the place hasn't lost its tradition. We had ordered lots of food because we were large in numbers. The list includes fish liver gin, fish malai kebab, chicken malai kebab. All of the were fantastic, but the chicken could have been softier. The main course menu includes mutton moti biryani, jhinga butter masala, lachchha paratha, naan, chicken bharta, mutton rogan josh etc. For desserts, we had mango cake, mango kulfi and kesar kulfi. Cannot mention separately, each of them were best in its own way. You will love their food. It's recommended to go for a lunch because they are always packed up during dinner time. I love Amber for its perfect food, ambience and the very aged experienced staffs who can guide you to the perfect tasting of fantastic food. It's a definite recommendation. Happy Dining! :)

The one Indian restaurant that I am never bored of. If my memories serve me well then the first time I had walked into this restaurant was when I still used to ride on my dad's shoulders. Since then this place had a special place in my heart. Be it the ambience or the courtesy of the staff. What overpowers me every time I visit is the food. The fish malai tandoori is my favourite. Alas they make it only on few days a week. Then comes Fish liver gin. Yum yum ! My mouth waters everytime when I remember the name. For the chicken lovers, you can never get enough of the Reshmi kebab or the Badami kebab. For the main course I prefer the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Butter Naan, though my mother prefers the Moti biryani and my father the mixed fried rice. So we end up ordering all of them. This is a restaurant in kolkata which cannot be missed. I make it a point to visit this place whenever I am at Chandni Chowk or Esplanade area.

"Amber is legendary".
That's how my father puts it. All his childhood was spent in eager anticipation of when he'd return to his favourite restaurant. This makes it very unsurprising that he frequents this eatery.
Now having had a comprehensive taste of their food items - by which I refer to only the various types of cuisine, I can come to a conclusion that Amber indeed is legendary. But, only because of their Indian segment.

North Indian Cuisine:
The North Indian food is absolutely phenomenal! Out of this world. Starting from the kebabs, to the Biryani and all the other delicacies in between. Amber makes it very hard to choose - ¬†be it appetizers or anything else, all of it looks lovely! The Biryani, although not their most marketed product, is still delicious. Make sure you try out the Kebabs. My picks would be:
(i) Chicken Peshawari Kebab (spelling?)
(ii) Mutton Bara Kebab

Continental:
The reason I haven't Amber higher is because of their below-average Continental Cuisine. I decided that because Amber presented such a nice spread of dishes, that I would take my time, dine out here multiple times before I wrote a review. Now that I have done so, I can conclude by saying that Amber, though tries very hard, does not live up to expectations in this particular segment. In case you have a hankering for Continental, and Amber is your pick, try to avoid dishes with gravy in general. The Soups however, are up to par.
The staff are friendly and unique. Their service should by itself earn them a rating of 4 at the very least. Value for money meets outstanding North Indian cuisine at a restaurant that can only be described as historical. Please do drop by, Amber rarely disappoints.
Thanks for the read and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made :)

It's a "just for eating biriyani" restuarant. Apart from that you don't need to visit this restuarant for any good reason that I could probably ever think of. No privacy & waiters aren't bothered to serve you. This place is only for biriyani and that's great. Feed your stomach here!

Amber - One of the oldest yet the best places to have north Indian food. 
=====
Intro: Amber is one of the oldest places which serves really good food and is the favorite of a lot of foodies out there. It is at the main road on the diagonally opposite foot to aliah hotel.  

I went with my family after a long time and was courteously greeted by all the people out there. 

The ambience of the place is simplistic and even at around 10:30 I somehow managed to grab a seat there. 
===== 
Food ordered: 

We ordered a couple of stuffs here. They are as under:- 

1) Chicken sweet corn soup - The soup arrived within 5 minutes and it was really quick. The taste was good. 

2) Fish in hot sauce - it was bhetki. The fish was sauted in the sauce. Soft in the inside. Had a little cheese as well. Lovely dish. #musttry

3) Chicken Badami kebab - The kebab was mouth melting. Perfectly served with onions sprinkled with red chilli powder and carrots. Very tender and it was something different from usual reshmi kebab. #musttry

4) Dal Makhani - The Dal was too good. Just felt a bit lack in salt. This is superb out here. #musttry

5) Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala - 6 Reshmi pieces sauted in butter masala gravy. The gravy was thick and the pieces were soft. #musttry

6) Paneer tikka Butter Masala - As they did not have paneer butter masala, we ordered paneer tikka butter masala. The paneer pieces were hard and chewy. It has been reported to the management. 
=====
Meal for two: 750-900 max
=====
Pros
1) Prime location.
2) Superb service. 
3) Really good food quality. 
4) Ambience is simplistic.
5) Tasty food at reasonable prices.

Food quantity 3.9/5
Food presentation 4.2/5
Service 4.5/5
Ambience 3.8/5
Value for money 4.3/5

Visiting it makes me nostalgic, and it reminds me the times I've always accompanied this place with my parents on various occasion..though I love the food, I really feel that the management should incorporate certain new things in the vegetarian cuisine..even a new decor would not be bad..I hope things always change for the better, and that this restaurant never feels the need to shut down...I'll always keep coming back here for more.. :)

It's a privilege to get an opportunity to visit and get a share of not just food but the experience. Amber is not just a restaurant rather a portal to it's glorious past. Calcutta hosts some of the legendary restaurants and Amber is one of the jewels of that crown.

Opened in 1959 with then to be a 98 seater restaurant, Amber has gained its rightful place in the heart of the city with around 400 seat capacity now. Started jointly by Mr. Rajpal Khullar and brother Mr. S.K.Khullar, Amber has served some of the most iconic dignitaries in the past.

The restaurant has a great feel of perfection to it and the ambiance is very elegant. It has that royal touch to it and stands out in its own way. I wouldn't dare judge the food here cause honestly, it doesn't need that. The taste, the quality, and the service speaks for itself.

I would sincerely recommend Amber to all as it's one of those legendary places which is a part of the face of this city of joy.

One of my all time favourite places in Kolkata, if you want authentic North Indian cuisine look no further! Yes it's a bit far and there's hardly any space to park your car, but if you can just avoid those little glitches you will be most certainly be awarded with delicious food. 
This place even offers continental food option and though I haven't tried it personally my mother swears by their fish liver gin.

As far as the Indian section is concerned the usual favourites like chicken tandoori, dal makhani, chicken bharta and butter nun are a MUST try out here, also for the hard core non veg lovers Brain Masala just has to be ordered. 
This place is legendary and legendary places do not need fancy settings to serve their food, sometimes the crowd is also a bit of a let down, but I don't have any complaints as long as the food served year after year is so very delicious and yes consistently good. I would honestly request the management to open up a branch somewhere in south Kolkata, the location is a little bit difficult to find and for girls to just hang out here might be a little uncomfortable. 
My family and I keep on visiting this place from time to time and we have never been disappointed even once.

This one is the traditional old place situated Waterloo Street, visited there last Sunday. Ambiance and decoration is moderate here. In starter we took Chicken Masala Kabab,it's there specialty item according to their staff and tastes delicious,just loved this. In main course Chicken biryani is average in taste,but Mutton Shahi Korma is very good. But one thing I really don't like is the behavior of their staffs.

I had missed visiting this place since long. This time during my official visit, I happened to be here with a colleague to feel the charm.

Entering inside, I felt that the clock had stopped. It still gives you a feeling that you are somewhere during the British Raj!! The d√©cor, tables, cutlery, waiters, ambiance, etc. do add to the environment.

The food here is a mixture of continental and Indian cuisine which is simply delectable!! As it has been a signature restaurant in Kolkata, the prices are on the higher side. The quality and warmth of the place makes up for it though.

A visit to Amber was once considered an upgrade of one‚Äôs social status. I have heard this story many times from my wife. She always had to remember this place whenever it was a special occasion in their family.

People of Kolkata must have tried this place once in their lifetime. My advice to my friends who are visiting Kolkata, do get in and enjoy the British era unfold in front of you once!! I am sure you will come out with a smile..

Amber had been the first restaurant that I had visited as a kid so I have many fond memories associated with this place. This eatery has retained its old world charm to this day and the ambience is very homely. I would rate its food as 3.75/5 as the food quality should also have improved with time but it hasnt. But nonetheless,be it with family or with friends, Amber has been my favourite whenever I have visited Esplanade and it woulf remain so hopefully in the future. And it is not too over the top so I may add that it is budget friendly as well!!

Being the most oldest restaurant in town U expect th food to be nice .. I was really very disappointed.. The quality of the food has degraded the service has become real slow.. I had ordered a paneer dish along with rotis.. The dish was flat and the rotis were half burnt.. I wouldn't recommend this place unless u only want to booze

Amber has always been one of my favourite eateries in town. Conveniently located at the Waterloo street in the Esplanade, this has been one of the legendary restaurants in Kolkata. Like many I too have fond memories of my childhood associated with this place. I remember making this place a must-visit during the pujas with my parents. Well they have seperate Veg and Non-veg sections. This place offers you luxury dining with beautiful lights, well managed staff and enchanting decorum. The North Indian delicacies are lip-smacking good. You have ample choices when it comes to starters- like fish fingers, pakoras, golden prawn and more. I love the reshmi kebab here, chicken tandoori, mutton rogan josh, daal makhani r equally good. I love the butter nan here. Its always beautifully done. They can upgrade the quality of their biriyani. I am not very fond of their desserts but one can definitely go for the tutty fruity. This can be an expensive outlet for students. So make sure you have enough pocket pinch before you plan to hit Amber. But make sure you hit this joint sometime if you have not yet else you'll miss much.

Been visiting this restaurant for the last 20+ years and still can't get enough of it. In a city like Kolkata where delicious food is not hard to come by, Amber raises the bar for restaurants and is a haven for food lovers. The Paneer Butter Masala, Chana Masala and Black Dal are a must try for vegetarians. This restaurant is a part of the old world charm that this city's restaurants still have.

No issues with the quality, at par with the 'overwhelming' price, but the quantity? Hell, not even enough for one person! One of those places that burn a hole in your pocket and give you only enough that fits through the hole!

Went on 14th Feb 2015
Ordered fish fingers that is still awesome
Prawn cocktail to was good
But main course Mutton shahi korma and chicken a la kiev were not up to the mark
Gajar halwa too was ok with less sweetness for the present taste these days
Beverages served chilled
pocket pinch for this menu with a 2 beer and a cocktail would cost you 2500 for two including vat and tax

It has been a place that I have visited quite often during my childhood days and it has some really precious memories that would never fade with time. Its been a famous place to visit with the family, almost every Sunday if not "Kwality" in Park Street as the food is delicious, the ambience has the old world charm and the service is good. The North Indian dishes, the Tandoori Chicken, the Dal Makhni, the Aloo Matar, the Paneer dishes, almost everything is a must try for sure. This place will not disappoint you especially if you are from the old school and like the old world charm that is slowly depleting from everywhere with the passing time and some of us simply love that and keep going to such places that makes you feel nostalgic ...

If it's Mughlai it has to start with Amber. People might not like the area it's located in... But there r some flaws in ol of us.. So just ignore and try it...once u r in Amber u will b happy and content with its atmosphere.

Amber's got the perfect ambience for a dinner with your special ones. The food is just MAMA MIA!!! Its got a wide range of non veg dishes, all of which are prepared wonderfully. 
Pros of the food
1. Perfect seasoning
2. Good quantity
3. Balanced proportionate in the tastes. Didn't overpower the meat with the spices.

Pros of the restaurant, service was awesome from the taking of food orders to the delivery.

Although i felt they charged a little more for the drinks than other restaurants. But that doesn't bother me , for the food was awesome.

We have been visiting Amber since several years (>10 yrs) and it has been good all these while. We went to Amber for dinner on 11/12/2014 with my brother's in-laws. The food is, as always, simply what you ask for... GREAT.

However, Amber Management, please note that it seemed that the quantity of the food has drastically reduced. Though PPL are on diet these days, but when they visit Amber, they would have left dieting at home with the expectation of having some awesome food there. Please look into the quantity. If you are finding it difficult to maintain the quantity with the prices why not increase the prices. I am sure folks will be ready to pay premium bucks for premium food.¬†

Quality of the food: 4.5/5
Quantity: 2.5/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service:4/5

Overall:3.5ish/5. (i would have given 4.5 if they quantity was decent)

Warm regards,
Sourav

Well this particular branch of Amber has been my personal favorite since a very long time. The taste of those fried fish, chicken tikka and mutton ghosh beriany still lingers on my tongue. But that was way back when I was in school. I guess its a difficult task to maintain fame and glory. The magnificence it had once is all lost now. The ambiance is decent enough and the dining space is huge. But the quality of food has remarkably gone down which makes me rate it low.

Have been visiting this hotel since i was a child with my parents and have got lots of precious memories connected to this joint. Well "Amber" is not just any restaurant but it is a living legend which dictating its legacy since decades. It is regarded as one of the sought after hotels in town. Located in waterloo street, it is a posh and provides a luxurious experience. They have seperate sections for veg and non-veg located on different floors. The decor of this joint has a classic and vintage touch which been unaltered till date, coming over here will let you get to experience the rich heritage and oddyssey of this city's glorious past. They specializes mainly in north indian cuisines and also continental savories. Call it a habbit or something else but since all these years whenever i visited here i have started my meal with starters like- golden fried prawn/ chicken reshmi kabab/ peshawari tikka. Then moving on to the main course, which comprised of- butter naan( one of the best in town), daal makhani, chicken butter masala/ murg saagwala, nargisi keema or brain masala etc. Some of their continental offerings which i liked the most includes- chicken stragnoff, chicken tettrazinni etc; and always endes with tutti fruity for dessert. After all these years i have never been dissapointed for a single time over here. Complete dedication to quality reflects on everything in this restaurant. The staffs are very cordial and helpful and delivers everything with perfection. I guess I don't need to say anything about the taste of their dishes cause i think you have already figured it out yourself. "Amber" is not just a restaurant, it is an integral part of kolkata's culture.

Amber is one of the most looked up restaurant in Kolkata and have never come across any adverse reviews from my friends and family. However, given acute parking problem, never been to the restaurant until today, a Sunday evening when I ultimately reched this restaurant. Given reviews of Zomato, I was super excited.

Reached this restaurant. The striking part was the well maintained old British era elevator with brass lever that is almost extinct from the city.
We ordered-

1. Prawn Cocktail - Rs215
2. Chkn Reshmi Kebab - Rs 265
3. Fish Peshawari Kebab- Rs 320
4. Fried Fish- Rs 320
5. Mutton Dahiwalla- Rs 245
6. Mutton Biryani - Rs 275
7. Raita
None of the above items tasted good except the Fried Fish that tasted awesome.
The Biryani is not worth calling Biryani. It was basically rice n pieces of mutton bone (not pieces of meat) with mutton botis (2-3 pcs, fried till it bears a burnt taste)
Ditto with Mutton Dahiwala where they served extremely bony pieces of Mutton cooked in thick gravy- taste was okay but paying Rs 320 for bones pinched our pocket much.

The Raita was so diluted, it ran from one end of the plate to the other messing the food.

The main fiasco started after the meal... Billing- after 15mins the bill arrived. We wanted to pay by Card, the orderly went away with our Credit Card and came back after 10 mins saying They have not billed the Fish fry (Rs 320 plus Tax). We checked the bill and shew the Orderly that it is already in the bill.

We understand that it was a mistake but restaurants of such strature cant make such mistakes.
After 10 mins the orderly came back again and said their Card swiping machine is out of order and we have no other option than to pay cash. He further added that its a regular issue. there and 6 more tables are facing similae issue and are without cash. I dont know which Bank are they attached to, but being incharge of Card Swiping machine of a leading Public Sector bank, it doesnt take more than a couple of days to replace a defective swiping machine.

I think the management is joking with the customers with such mismanaged service. Thankfully we had adequate cash to pay off for the spolit evening and came out of the restaurant. The doorman was courteous enough greet you unless you tip him !

Observations-
1. The quantity of food is immensely less.
2. Price is on a very high end.
3. Food taste is nothing ethereal to pay Rs 388 for 1 pc Fish Fry. And the Biryani was a pure mockery.
4. The service is good. People are extremely courteous. Even the liftman carries a smiling face. Feels really good.
5. The management is pure bogus with all quality of mismanagement - cant manage the bills and card swiping machine in such a heavy footfall restaurant.

I shall never return to this restaurant owing to the mismanagement and overall fooding experience. However the service people are really good.

One of the marquee restuarant in Kolkata. Most visted restuarant of earlier times, Amber offers great food and decent ambience. This joint would be one of the top and most visted restuarant on everyone's dads list. The delicacies to try here are quite simple and traditional - Chicken Reshmi Tikka, Tandoori Fish Tikka and the ever green Chicken Bharta. Tough its a tad expensive it never lets you down on the taste and quality of its food.

One of the marquee restaurants in my list. It offers great ambiance and delicious food. Though, the cost is a tad too expensive,it is well worth it. The tandooris they serve are awesome. According to me , one should try their baked fish once atleast. It is speechless . But, my favourite will always be their Chicken bharta. If you are looking for a rest. to host a special occasion, you may definitely give amber a try.

Amber @ esplanade area is one of the famous evening joining specially for babu of sarkari office...though compare to Street food of that area the food is expensive. But I must say that shelling a bit will worth it.
Ambiance and Tat is good.They even serve liquor ..Tandoori chicken and kabab are amazing.... its saucy and juicy ....birayani they serve is bit different from what you generally get @ Calcutta .Instead of mutton prices they service the biriyani rice with small meat balls...personally It is one of my favourite joints since my childhood.

Nice old styled restaurant. 

We ordered tandoori chicken, Ghost reshmi kabab, Mutton sagwala, chiken varta and nargisi keema. 

The tandoori chicken was great. It was soft and well cooked. Mutton sagwala with garlic naan was very good. 

I would not recommend the reshmi kabab, chicken varta and nargisi keema. The reshmi kabab was a bit sour and the nargisi keema was full of matar with no taste of mutton. 

The breads here were good. The naan was fluffy and really heavy.

AMBER. Well the name says it all.
Amber never fails to satisfy my taste buds. :)

On 4th October 2014 (Saturday), we all (8 adults+1 child) headed to Amber for our lunch at around 3pm.
The ambience is good and comforting with humble and helpfull staff. I just found the light to be too dim.
The place is quite big and has two levels.
We were seated on the second floor. The place was almost full and we were glad enough to find a table for 9.

Without any further hesitation we started ordering for our lunch.
Things ordered :-
1) Fish Fries (5 plates) (Rs.300/plate) : Amber is a place where you cannot just avoid having fish fries. As the pieces are quite big, we asked them to make 2 pieces in each plate I.e. 1 fry is divided into two portions like a single piece. The fish fries were accompanied by fried potato wedges and tartar sauce but no boiled vegetables (they usually give boiled vegetables when the fish fries are parcelled for a takeaway). Anyway, the fish fries were a true delight to our taste buds. Thin crumb coat with a thick layer of fresh bhetki (fish) inside. One going to Amber and not ordering for a fish fry, is a shame.

2) Keema Naan (4 no.s) : The keema naans were amazing and each piece was divided into further 3 pieces. They were heavy and tasty with keema on the outer portion. It tasted almost like keema pizza.

3) Chicken Butter Masala (1 plate) : A single plate consists of 8 kebabs dipped in a succulent rich tomato gravy.

4) Mutton Rogan Josh. (2 plates) : Each plate had 3 pieces. The pieces were soft and the gravy was rich, smooth and tasty as well.

5) Mutton Biryani (1 plate) : We all were full and had not a single millimetre of space left inside our stomach when suddenly my grandfather had a wish of having mutton biryani. So we ordered one. Mutton biryani consisted of 2 pieces of soft mutton, sadly with no potato :(. The biryani tasted okay. Nothing extraordinary. The quantity was not much as well.

The total bill came upto Rs. 7000 bucks (inclusive of tax and vat).

Over all, the experience at Amber was as usual overwhelming and amazing.

Totally recommended. :D
Don't miss out on the Fish Fry.

Happy eating.:D

we ordered baked fish, roast chicken and biryani..kindof a weird combination I know...but the biryani was supposed to be had last. The baked fish was nice..it stops at being just nice. nothing overwhelming. 3/5 for that considering the price point.
The roast chicken was kindof weird..the chicken had a texture like it had been boiled and not roasted. There was also this sweet-ish gravy the two pieces of chicken were completely soaked in.Whatever it was, It definitely wasn't roast chicken. It tasted OK though. A very generous 1.5/5 there considering the price point.
The biryani was the worst. Wouldn't want to describe it. 1/5 for that considering the price point.

The ambience was OK. 2.5/5 for that considering the price point.

The service was pathetic. Let's just say that we had to wait for our bill for close to 45 minutes. 0/5 for that and everything else service related considering the price point.

Amber is one of the oldest restaurant in the city and has since been serving good quality, tasty and mouth watering north indian food to Calcuttans. As a kid i remember visiting Amber at least twice a month with my parents. This used to be our favourite restaurant those days and we used to celebrate any special occasion here with friends and family. The baked fish served here is finger licking good and perhaps the best in the city till date. I love their veg au gratin too. the cheesy dish is a speciality of this restaurant. The chicken tandoori kababs, rashmi kababs and the hariali kababs... the very mention of these is making me hungry now. The peas polao is another must try dish at AMber irrespective of you being a veggy or non vegetarian. The quite ambiance those days used to be a relief from the hustle bustle of the restaurants at park street. The waiters have been there for ages now and are very polite and cordial. The ambiance, service, nostalgia of this place makes me visit it again and again. A must try place if you are a lover of good food.

One of the finest north Indian food that I have ever had in my life! This place is really old, and my dad used to go there since he was younger than I am now. The waiters could give you the feeling of non-importance, but its best to either ignore that or tip them heavily. The speciality here is the masala kulcha, which believe me is an inch thick and cooked all the way to the crust! Gravies and kebabs are all the best! I would deeply recommend to all who are visiting Kolkata to try this place!

We ordered many things, starting from kebabs, fried rice, kulcha, mutton roghanjos etc. All the food items were damn good. The service was awesome. Very good place for a office party as this place was quite specious.

Went to Amber with great expectations of having the kind of food for which it is famous, and was much disappointed at its descent from legendary to ordinary. ¬†Aside from the flavour of the Mutton Moti Biriyani which was just as good as of yore, everything else was average. ¬†The mutton in the biriyani was a little tough, the fish tikka kebab smelled a little and the chicken reshmi kebab was of the standard of any biriyani-place anywhere. ¬†Sad to see another legend go down the mediocrity road.

Amber is nothing but absolutely pure bliss. The ambience and the atmosphere is so good that you can't stop loving this place. The food quality is very good and it serves a variety of cuisines be it Chinese or royal moghlai. The services are a pleasure and a 'treat' at Amber is well justified.

Legendary and Amber are simply two synonymous terms.
I mean how can I forget about Amber...even after writing and reviewing the best of restaurants in Kolkata...Oh God!!!
Amber is situated in the midst of a heavily crowded Esplanade of Kolkata.But the delicacies it serves is mouth watering and comes at a very reasonable price.
Not to forget the interior decoration of this place.In the evening the lighted pavilion looks like the interior of a well furnished Castle with that typical Maharaja Maharani style.
Coming to the food I always opt for the Mutton kebabs with a glass of Mocktail which soothes anybody's taste buds.In the main course one must try out the Mutton Biryani.It is not only ideal in taste,but the preparation is unique-when it comes with the large chunks of Mutton jinxed with Mutton Balls and Biryani rice.
If you wish to go for something in the gravy side,go for the Chicken preparations which have their origin in North India.
End your dining by treating yourself to some Tuti-fruti ice-cream here.
Overall Amber is one big restaurant serving so many dishes at the same time.It happens to be one of the best family restaurants in town,and the bar is equally good. What I still like about this place is that the management is pretty good and they have maintained their food quality for long,even amidst stiff market competition.

I have always loved Amber for its fish delicacies. This time I took my wife with me. We started with Chicken sweet corn soup. The soup was average. But the Fish Malai Kebab was next in our menu and it was wonderful. We tasted chicken e la Kiev next. It was good too.Amber has maintained its standard as far as ambience is concerned. Over all it was a nice experience.

Amber is one of the classy resturant that is located at the heart of kolkata near esplanade in waterloo street. Serving the city with its tasty dishes, this resturant have became a well known food joint. Coming to its food , i can just say that its simply mind blowing ... Two dishes that i order everytime i visit this place are baked fish and keema kulcha and till date i havent found any resturant who prepares these items better than amber. Only thing that i feel this resturant needs to improve is the ambience. Apart from that on a over all basis this resturant provides a really classy as well as tasty food experience

Amber, is synonymous with legendary Indian cuisine. As far as I can remember, I used to visit this place as a child with my father. I am a grown up man today and I have the fondest of memories. I plan not a write a "review" like review. This place cannot be reviewed when it comes to authentic Indian cuisine. I remember that my father would pass on that extra piece of Tandoori Chicken. Not much has changed. The same courteous waiters, the same restaurant managers and to top it all the same ambience with people flooding this place on weekends. I tend to be a bit nostalgic while reviewing this place but the food served is upto the mark. The kababs are succulent, the augratin is mouthwatering. The menu is not proliferated with unnecessary additions. This place is a must visit for all food lovers. It is sweetly price so as not to burn a hole in your pocket. A must visit.

One of the best legendary restaurants located in Central Kolkata. Amber stands in the same location for ages. Reaching Amber is not that complicated however the one way roads of Kolkata creates problems for you if you don't know the place.

Amber serves some of the best North Indian food available in Kolkata. Food includes usual stuff like Chicken Butter Masala, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Do Piaza, Paneer items and some really good kebabs. Biryanis are nice and you should always order some. Indian breads include Naan which are great and very soft. You would also want to try their Prawn Cocktail.

Ambiance is really nice and restaurant is decorated overall. Furniture and utensils give premium feel. Pricing is surely not budget friendly but you can expect this kind of pricing from a legendary restaurant. Service is really prompt and food is served within 15-20 minutes of order. They also have a takeaway counter which is quite crowded at all times.

Good old Amber still going strong. Favorite eating place during the 60,s 70's and 80's for Tandoori food. It outdid Kwalities at its own game and served real value.Excellent selection,flavour and helpings.The chicken,prawns and fish were always the best. Went there during a recent visit to Cal after nearly 3 years and was a bit saddened. Quality has dropped somewhat.especially in the portions and prices are UPPPPPP! Service is a bit sluggish--probably the old bearers have all retired !!
Nonethe less you get a satisfying Business meal.The place is chock a block and had to wait 40 minutes for a table. Also become excessively noisy and needs a bit of refurnishing and decor change.
Still old Calcutta wallas will flock here so do try it when there. The Kulfi surprisingly  tastes good still !!!

Amber is a very old restaurant and like many more I was introduced to its culinary delights by my father. It is located in the heart of the city, Esplanade. This is one of those restaurants which adds to the heritage value of Calcutta. Specializing in Indian and continental cuisines it offers you with a large variety of choices. I eat around my city and have this habit of identifying different takes on our known cuisines. There is something worth mentioning, that churns out from the Amber kitchen. Chicken tandoori is such a common and lovable dish, but this over here comes with a different signature. Unlike the very common red colored variant, here it comes with a whitish yellow tint, and a hint of ghee. A completely different take on the conventional tandoori masala this is a must have over here. 
The ambience is average, service is good. The restaurant has a bar license as well. Overall a good restaurant and a part of old Kolkata history.

I have been visiting Amber since my childhood and I have to admit that its one of the best in the business. The food is great and the so is the ambiance. The waiters are also very good and very helpful in case you need some ideas about what to order.
The kebabs are excellent and so is everything!! The sitting arrangement is awesome. 
If you ask me about the price of the food, i have to admit that it does leave a hole in the wallet but considering the great quality, the exceptional ambiance and the quality of service, its a great bargain.

Amber serves the best brain curry and brain masala outside my home. Period. I totally love the way the brain curry is prepared here with the minced mutton and a boiled egg. The service is just about average here. The managers can occasionally be a bit high handed but the staff are mostly quite courteous. The food though is consistently good.
I have tried almost all the kebabs here. Be it fish or chicken or mutton the kebabs are always succulent and full of flavour. Usually I go for the brain curry (the gravy is richer) with tandoori rotis. The combinations is like ecstasy. I also like the Kabuli Naan and Kabuli Kulcha served here very much. I have tried the continental preparations as well but don't fancy them much. But that's just me. Many of my co-diners have more than appreciated their continental. Also I have heard a great deal about their famous Mutton Boti Biryani. My younger brother loves it. I am not a big biryani fellow so I don't order it but I have tasted it and I really could not find good enough adjectives to describe it. For desserts I almost always pick the tutti fruti or the kulfi and also enjoy the occasional coffee with cream.
This is one of the more older restaurants in town and they serve fantastic food so if you haven't been here yet please visit once. Once will be enough to make you keep returning.

Did I ever say that chicken tandoori is my favorite and my love for the charred legs began with Amber. I was only in class one when my parents first took me to this gigantic place (I was small, so everything around me seemed huge). The tandoori chicken that I had that day still lingers in my mouth. I was so taken that on every occasion  I used to insist my parents to take me there. But then my sister always got the preference in choosing a restaurant (She has always been the pampered one ).

I finally got my due after the Madhyamik Exam. Since I fared pretty well, my long waited wish finally came true. I was in Amber again. After that so many years have passed  but my love for Amber remains the same. 

And I am a lucky man that my wife shares the same sentiments. She is the one who re introduced me to Amber. Now if not all some celebrations are reserved for Amber like the one of yesterday. 

We went to Amber to celebrate my wife's promotion and as usual were greeted by the courteous stuff. We had (no not chicken tandoori this time) mutton bara kebab, chicken peshwari tikka. And I confess that no place makes them better.Though the size of bara kabab is not 'bara' anymore but the taste knocks you out. Next we switched to some continental flavors and I must say they were equally good. Shashlik grilled chicken on a bed of rice with ber-be-que sauce and and  all time favourite chicken tettrazine , both were delicious.

After a hearty meal, we came back satisfied and happy. I am glad that Amber, synonymous with my childhood nostalgia still retains the same flavors and feel good feeling!! Looking forward to visit again and this time also might have to give tandoori chicken a miss because I really want to try out the entire menu..

Worst Resturant ever visited. Visiting amber form my childhood and it was one of my favorite Resturant. Today had dinner out there, starter was ok. But when ordered for the main course, waiter told me they ran out of rice, so cannot serve any rice related item. Can you imagine a popular Resturant like this saying so. Really ridiculous. Also the behavior of the manager or other staff were like, whatever they have in the kitchen, I need to order within that or don't have food out here. Surprisingly they are not sorry about their behavior or situation. While paying the bill, informed the manager that this is my last visit of my life with family in this lousy Resturant and promise that won't visit again.

The Seek Kabab was outstanding, although pricey but for a good kabab, I can surrender almost anything. Other things were as good as it can get. No special mention or recommendation for it‚Äôs ambiance as I found no decoration to get myself into the mood of being in a good place. The staff are good and attend you whenever you need them. That‚Äôs all from me. Intend to come again to obtain a better perspective.

A bitter experience in my favorite restaurant Amber. I was thinking whether I should write it or not, but I couldn't stop my self. After a long time went to Amber (not staying in Kolkata now) on 5th March2014 with my family. As soon we entered in 1st floor we found 3-4 waiters surrounding us and shouting "aiyee sahab, aiyee sahab......" raise their hands to different tables. I found some other customers are laughing at our situation. May be they have also got the same hot reception. I'm surprised, is this the same Amber or a road side food corner  those who always searching for their customers in the same way? 
Food was excellent, we enjoyed, but the worst situation arrived at the end. After payment I found 3 waiters are standing in front of our table, and they were not happy with the tip. One of them directly approached, "sahab hum log teen admi hay." I think Amber is running with over staff now a days. 3 waiters are taking care of one table? Unbelievable!!

It might not wear a jazzy look, but Amber has remained one of the best restaurants in Calcutta. Be it their scrumptious Tandoori chicken (buttery, smoky, melt-in-the-mouth) or their mouth-watering fish liver gin, it remains an icon for many of us. And, those adjectives came out because I can literally taste the food I have had there. We got hooked as kids after hearing parents rave about it and it has never disappointed. May be innovations as in Taj's restaurants are missing, but the old-school dishes like fish liver gin are to die for. 

Definitely worth many visits. And it surprises me that the neteratti seems to have missed out on this given its low rating! It certainly deserves more adulation.

I was, am and will be partial towards Amber for reasons galore. Amber basically runs over generations in families and my father goes overboard and cancels every plan possible to have the tandoori chicken here. After about a year I visited Amber last evening all over again. My friends and me were epic hungry. One of them had just come down Saturday morning itself from Hyderabad and craved GOOD biryani. We were at Sufisutra, so the first place that clicked in mind was Amber.
The apt description for four of us would be super high and tripping, craving good food, could do with a roast cow and comfortably numb. We went around at 10 pm, so getting a place was not an issue. While a few of us sat down, some ran for the washroom and the others craved the menu card. I did not bother to open the menu. I absolutely know what I like here and what I wanted to have at that point of time. The others quite trusting my opinion let me take charge of the order.

Our first order, tandoori chicken. Till the time the chicken arrived, I guess we had already gulped down half of the condiments on the table. I love the tandoori chicken here for there is no use of red colour, and it is an authentic roast with the perfect balance of spices. A good amount of lemon squeeze over it  with the pickled onion by the side and the dhania-curd chutney ensures the five senses are satisfied well. There were, I believe (can't completely remember), some fights over the chicken on the slow eater's plate. 
Maincourse - tandoori roti, chicken tikka masala, mutton moti biryani.
Chicken tikka masala - The craving for a chicken tikka masala ends here for me. The way the tikka melts in the mouth is no less than epic. Also, the curry has a signature amber flavour to it which seals the deal for me. everytime. Hot tandoori roti with succulent chicken pieces in a beautiful curry can not ever go wrong, and especially at Amber. My friends were exuberant and thanking me with every gulp, to say the least. With a proud smile on my face, I missed coming to Amber with my father for quite sometime in that particular moment. (Back home, I gushed yet again about the food so much that my father already made plans for the next visit :p)
Mutton moti biryani - This though still remains one of the best briyanis of Kolkata, last evening I found it a tad disappointing. While my friends could not discriminate or compare much, I could because of my innumerable earlier visits. The motis which used to be present in a profuse amount before has become a few in number. :( But given the price, which has not really gone up from the previous visits, I guess there had to be a curtailing factor on the dish. Still I would have been happier paying a little more and reveling the gushing motis in my mouth. The mutton was undoubtedly succulent soft and the taste of the biryani, perfect. This is not the usual yellow biryani but has a slight brownish touch and pepper flavour to it, and I love that. 
Last, but not the least, I could not have left the place without having the tooti frooti. I remember having been to Amber when I was tiny for a family dinner comprising around 30 people. They had decorated the tooti frooti glasses with toothpick umbrellas beautifully. I had collected all the thirty umbrellas, taken them back home, cleaned and played with it for a long time. While last night there was no umbrella for the decoration, the taste of the tooti frooti with opulent amount of fruits brought back thousand memories and I felt loved (remember, I was high!). The size has become smaller, the prices have gone up but the taste has been the same the way it used to be. I hate tooti frooti elsewhere, so they must have been doing some magic from time immemorial with the ones they make here.

I was happy last night, really happy. Grow in leaps and bounds, Amber. May I visit you with my great grandchildren!

Really delicious food. Naans are different in a good way from other eateries in Kolkata. It was our first time there, so we did not have any nostalgia associated with the place unlike regulars and old timers.
One if the problems I would like to mention here is, the food they serve is sometimes different than what is ordered and then the restaurant manager does nothing about it. Will go there again, but would be careful about what we order

Amber is synonymous with family dinners/lunch since time immemorial. Each achievement or birthday or anniversary in the family has been celebrated here.  We have now moved on to different cuisine and restaurant but this is the place where we have all the memories stashed away.
The moment you enter the first floor (first floor being more of a family space) there is a warmth  and smell unique to this place that engulfs you. This smell prepares you for the culinary treat awaiting you. Over the period of time I have had almost everything from the menu but my all time favourites are Paneer Tikka, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Tandoori Chicken in starters. Chicken Reshmi Butter masala with Kabuli Naan is simply out of this world. No one can make these 2 items like they make it here, this can be the dish that can bring me back from dead! Peas Pulao and Chicken Bharta are in a league of their own by the way. Tootie Frootie ice-cream served here has made my childhood a very happy one indeed and the growing up years were made special by the Pineapple Blossom :).
And just to add a very important point - My Dad thinks no restaurant can serve a better NaanRoti than Amber, till now he is right. This is his favourite place over the years and I still find it difficult to take him to another restaurant serving North Indian Fare.

Wonderful ambience and wonderful food. The chicken was especially soft. However the management of 2 floors and seating needs much to be desired.

A very authentic multi cuisine restaurant, will look like a small one from the entrance, but it is quite big and a very cosy ambience from inside. A little expensive though but definitely value for money. The boti kebabs are mouth watering, chicken Reshmi butter masala too is worth mentioning..you variants of bread-naans, kulchas are a good fillers. I also like their fish fingers and the famous amber special pickle which will already be served at all tables..

Introduced to this restro by my dad, this place is one of the first places where i started my culinary journey.

once you enter the place coming out of the lift, there is a homely appeal to it. over the years, i have tried out a major part of their menu and never has this place let me down.

The cream of asparagus soup is one thing we always order. the prawn n fish starters are delicious. do give the orly a try. my personal favourite is the chicken malai kebab.

about the main course, the naans are one of the best i have had in this city. pair it with soft creamy veg koftas or palak paneer and keema mattar or murgh bharta and you will understand what makes finger licking great. finish off the meal with a tutti fruti .

the pricing seems to be on the higher side but considering the overall experience they provide, its well justified

Amber has been a favourite since my childhood days. My first introduction was by my uncle who was instrumental in developing my culinary traits and introduced me to many restaurants and eateries in the city. 

I have heard the the great Amitabh Bachchan used to have his meals here when he started his working career in the city and particularly loved the the rotis.

Amber serves a wide range of North Indian and Continental dishes and the fish and prawns are particularly good and recommended. Amber's Biriyani is not talked about much but in my opinion, remains the best Mutton Biriyani in town. The naans and rotis are just about prefect. The ambiance is warm and friendly and the place is generally crowded in lunch and evening hours. A good place for a indulgent dinner treating self or friends and family.

Food is very inconsistent these days. Used to be very delicious,  too bad they stopped making the awesome Fish Liver Gin. 

On a good day you may love the food to death and sometimes you might not like it at all.  The place is a classic.

Amber is a place that three generations of my family has frequented ..... I have had some wonderful meals here with my grandparents and parents and even now I love the food which says something about the place  ! Yes the prices have gone up and portions are smaller but the food still has the delightful taste of old that I grew up eating and that makes me feel really good. This place is huge has multi-level dining but its always crowded so go a bit early to ensure you get a table.
Now for the food .... gorge on Golden Fried Prawn,FIsh Orly,Chilly Chicken,Chicken Gold Coin,don't forget to order the Cherry Cheese Pineapple .... loved it as a kid and my grandpa always ordered it for me so whenever I go I order it and remember him  :-) . Among the Kebabs take your pick of Tandoori Chicken , Chicken Reshmi Kebab ,Gosht Seekh Kebab , Tandoori Prawn and Fish Tikka all of which are excellent. In the gravies and curries the ChickenBharta or Reshmi Butter Masala are excellent choices. Don't miss out on the Paneer Butter Masala and the Channa Masala which are drool worthy. Order naan and roti to go with it and if your so inclined check out the Mutton Moti Biryani which has little meat kofta's in it and is quite good. If you prefer continental try the Chicken Cutlet or Baked Fish both of which are very good. Finish up with the Tutti Frutti or the Kulfi and stagger home in bliss !

----- 11 Oct, 2012 -----

An oldie but a goldie .... for starters choose between the Fish Finger / Golden Fried Prawns / Chicken Reshmi Kabab / Chicken Cutlet .... all sinfully yummy .... mains are a no brainer .... Paneer Butter Masala / Channa Masala / Chicken Bharta with the super soft Butter naan or Tandoori roti and finish your meal with a Tutti-Frutti !

Okay fine. Nostalgia. That is why I come back to Amber and order the same thing over and over again. It is quite tasty, mind you. The order is - Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Chilly. And they are good every time I have had them. Also the Cream of Asparagus soup.

Update: Recently, I came here ordered my favorites and noted one thing and I hated that - the service, which has gone down considerably. I feel that Amber should step up and do something about their food and service to make it a better space and actually bring back its old charm.

This restaurant is a part of my growing up. And it still is. It will be always be (I really hope)

Ever since childhood, I've been visiting Amber for dinner with my family. This restaurant taught Kolkata what fine dining really is.
The ambience is soothing and nice. The muted lights have an amazing effect on your mood and the extremely courteous and well behaved staff. 
Amber has never , never disappointed people. At least not me.
The dishes I love are the fish liver gin which is just out of this world, (not to forget their lip smacking tartare sauce, I've searched the entire city but guys, they make the BEST tartare sauce in town) the fish fingers, the paneer pulao, biryani, the kadai chicken and the kebabs.
Btw, my love for fish n chips and the beautiful tartare sauce started from Amber.
Okay, too many names I know, but you can't just have enough of it. Amber tosses up amazing food. Period.
I would be waiting when the freshly steamed plates would arrive. When I was a kid, I would even touch and feel their warmth which left me spellbound.

Another dish which I absolutely forgot to mention is, the jumbo prawns. God, they are crazily expensive BUT they are worth it. They are worth every buck that you pay.

To conclude, Amber - from the lift man to the staff to the food is a COMPLETE treat.
If you're a calcuttan, Amber should definitely be on your wishlist. You just cannot miss this one.

Prices are steep, yes but the service makes up for the amount they charge.
Amber has NEVER left me disappointed.

Happy eating guys.
Cheers! :)

Both were just the best. 
baked fish the best one. I really loved it. I had seen reviews here so had decided to order this to items. 
but must say the quantity are less. 
I was alone so thought will order a soup and baked fish,  which I thought would be enough for me, but the quantity was not enough.  It was a piece of boneless vetki fish baked in oven and served. so ordered grilled chicken. 
as said by some foodies from captain to waiter to a man in bathroom to guards all expect tips.

We got horrible service on Sunday 22nd October over Dinner. The USP of this place for vegetarians is its Chana, Paneer and Masala Kulcha.
At 8.30 in the evening, they ran out of Curd to make mixed vegetable raita.
At 9.15 pm when a second repeat dish of Chana and Paneer Butter Masala was being ordered - it was informed to us that they had run out of both.
When confronted , the Manager Mr. Dutta was rude and refused to do anything.
Imagine this on a sunday.

30th April, 2015Review update: Visited the joint with my foodie expedition friend after a long hiatus. Noticed a few changes to the d√©cor, seating arrangement for the better.Service quality have improved though tend to be confused and chaotic at times. Prices have been jacked up too.¬†Ordered the Fish Orly-Rs 345¬†and Mutton Peshawari Barra-Rs 300/-¬†for starters along with Caprioska-vodka based cocktail. The fish Orly was outstanding-fresh beckti batter fried, crispy and sumptuous. It was served with potato chips. Went well with the drinks. The Mutton Barra was a bony kebab. It was perhaps ribs(?) of mutton shimmered in an oven with rich spices. This dish could have been better. The meat on the pieces of mutton was too little and was chewy. Flavoursome dish with much room for improvement. The Caprioska at Rs 185/- was well made and had the right punch in it.In the main course we ordered the quintessential favourites- butter naan-Rs 90/-,chicken reshmi butter masala-Rs 310/-¬†and the baked fish-Rs 350/-.All three items were top-notch and just perfect. In fact it is because of this consistency over all these years-23 to be precise in my case that makes me an Amber regular. Thank You for making dining out such a pleasure.This is my second review on this site for this restaurant.Not without any reason.Amber gave me my first exposure/experience of fine dining some 20 years ago when i shifted to Kolkata and was a teenager.All major occasions in our family was celebrated at Amber compulsorily.In those days Amber along with a couple of joints in Park Street ruled Kolkata in the segment of fine dining.Now with the advent of mall culture and appearance of a  lot of new joints have diminished this joint's popularity to a certain extent but it has its own share of loyal patrons - me included.
Food: Amber serves North Indian and a few Continental dishes.I would recommend to go for North Indian as this segment is the winner hands down.Some items of the Continental section are outstanding too -Baked Fish in Hot sauce(Rs 300/-),Fried fish and chips are the items that i would suggest.In the North Indian , i can go on and on.Almost all the items listed in the menu are yum.My favourites are Chicken tandoori(Rs 165/- for half plate)- one of the best in town,Fish Malai kebab( Rs 310/-)- their specialty , Mutton surkh korma(Rs 225/-)-boneless cubes of mutton in a dark brown rich gravy,chicken reshmi butter masala(Rs 275/-)-cubes of chicken kebab cooked in a thick gravy-all time favourite since ages.For the vegetarians items like dal makhani,pindi chole,paneer butter masala,veg navratan korma  are recommended. Among the bread/roti items my choice would be - butter naan,masala kulcha- thick fluffy bread with a stuffing of potato masala inside,kabuli naan-naan laden with plenty of dry fruits.Their mutton keema pulao is also excellent-contains finely chopped pieces of meat mixed in the rice.Try it.You will not be disappointed.
This joint has a selective collection of cocktails which are pretty decent and priced right.We tried the blue lagoon-vodka based (Rs 210/-) and a large peg of Smirnoff costs Rs 175/-.Pocket friendly indeed!!
Ambiance: This joint is huge, spread across four floors.Ground floor is meant only for stags and is a watering hole.Seating arrangement and decor is spartan.Atmosphere is pretty noisy especially in the evenings when it is packed to capacity.The family section is on the first and second floor.Here the seating is pretty cosy and comfortable.The third floor serves as a dining area for celebrities and special guests and also doubles as a waiting area.Please keep in mind they they do not accept reservations, thus plan to go early during weekends.Waiters are very polite and courteous.They do recommend dishes for the confused lot.:)
Now on to the negatives-Not many, i must admit.Right from the doorman at the lobby , lift man and the man at the wash room who hands over hand towels and a comb to people who visit to answer nature's call expect a tip.Yes, you read it right.They even have staff to man the wash rooms .:) Some of the items seem to be over priced in proportion to the quantity of each helping.In fact over the years i have noticed that the quantity of the dishes has been reduced considerably though the saving grace is that the quality has been constant and not down hill like in most joints.
Cheers!!!

One of the few evergreen joints in Kolkata that has maintained their food quality at least for the past 20 years as far as i am concerned.Recently visited the place along with a friend.The kebabs, baked fish and nan/kulcha tasted the same as before.Excellent!!!
The staff was polite and courteous.Meal for 2 with drinks should lighten your purse by 2k.

Amber is one of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata. Two brothers once decided to become restauranteers in two different ways and gave us the two masterpieces. One is amber and the other zaranj.

Amber is located just beside paradise cinema hall near esplanade. Its a huge restaurant with good seating capacity but that does not guarantee you an easy seat unless you got a booking. The decor is nice and seats are comfortable. The staff is warm and service is fast. The prices are in the league of bar-b-q, peter cat.

Amber has been on top of my dining delights since childhood. A movie at paradise or hind or a metro followed by dinner at amber and then ice cream at india's hobby centre used to be the most cherished sundays. 

The food is good and the presentation is not so updated by today's standards but taste of food makes it up for all. Paneer Butter Masala is just awesome and one of the best for me in the city. I cant remember of even a single visit to the place without having ordered it. Dal is nice. Paneer pulao is very ok and better be avoided. Rotis are nice. Starters are good. Mexican offerings are just about ok.

Pros:
1) Good food at descent prices
2) Nice and comfortable place
3) Paneer Butter masala is a must have

Cons:
1) Presentation is not updated as per current standards
2) Mexican preparations are mediocre

Amber is one of the oldest restaurants in the city known for its Indian cuisine. This is probably my Dad's favourite restaurant. I remember going to this place with my parents when going out for dinner at a restaurant was quite an event. I still have very faint memory of trying out Tutty Fruity Ice cream for the first time, when I was like 7 or 8 years old. And I miss those days when a large tutty fruity was enough for two people :) 

Anyway lets get straight to the point. 
Ambiance : Situated on Waterloo Street near Paradise Cinema hall just off Bentick Street, the restaurant is spread over three floors. The restaurant is itself a landmark, so finding the place should not be a problem. The Ground Floor is meant for the stags serving most of the regular and premium brands of alcohol. The 1st and 2nd floors are family dining areas. The ground floor ambiance is very basic and fit for stags for a quick lunch or a couple of drinks post work hours. The 1st and 2nd floor is much better in terms of ambiance. The sofas are quite comfortable and the layout of the tables do not feel cramped. 

The food : Amber was once very very famous for its Indian food when there was a handful of restaurants in the city. The serving size has reduced, the prices have shot up but fortunately the taste is good enough if not the same as before. The Tandoori Chicken is a must try here. Very succulent, soft and juicy are perfect to describe the Tandoori Chicken here. It has never failed to impress. The Chicken Cutlet is another specialty. It is light, crisp and has a taste very different from other restaurants in the city. For main course you can try out the Butter Naan, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Chicken Bharta or the Dal Makhani. These are like staple dishes to try at Amber. I had once tried Chicken Tetrazinni. It was just okay, nothing to write about. I feel Indian is the safest bet out here. Never tried Chinese, so cannot comment. 
I used to love the tutty fruity here, but sadly it is not the same and charges a bomb for it. 
Alcohol prices are quite steep (more than Park street standards), so I stick to one beer or a couple of pegs at the most.

Service: This is where the rating gets hit ... real bad. Not that the waiters are not courteous, but every one expects to be tipped. There is a guy waiting inside the wash room to help you with the hand towel and expects a tip. Dont know about others but I find it a bit annoying. This is a normal stand alone restaurant and not a 5 star. Otherwise the serving time is okay and gets delayed during peak lunch/dinner team. 

Final Verdict: Even though the prices have increased and the service has gone down to an extent, however I will be back to the restaurant for its amazing Tandoori Chicken, the crispy Chicken Cutlet and the delectable Indian main course items. Parking is a bit of a problem during peak hours as well. Nonetheless it is a great place for a family dinner or a quick bite after work for office goers. 
An average meal for two would cost Rs1000 including taxes. 
Nostalgia if nothing else will bring me back here :)

Sitting with friends & gulping  a  few glasses of chilled Beer ,  biting upon soft &  juicy  Chicken  Tandoori  , on a hot & humid Saturday afternoon , followed by  Chicken Bharta ,  Dal Makhni , Veg  Do Piaza  & Kabuli Nan for lunch & that too at the Amber ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. is indeed an awesome experience bound to leave you highly satisfied!
This favorite restaurant of mine brings back childhood memories & I remember the liftman (Perhaps Khan uncle , then a middle-aged person who  knew my father well as he used to go for business lunch with his clients)holding on to the lift to accommodate me & my sister  , while the rest would have climb up the stairs! I would feel very elated at this gesture of his! Of course it was a liitle embarrassing for me  when I grew-up as he would never fail to recognize me  and still extend the same courtesy!
Usually it is difficult to find a place without prior reservation , more so during the peak hours, & having had the experience of waiting for long , we always ensured that our reservations  had been made,  as very often we had to end up at the Sagar for our lunch!
A good lunch without alcoholic drinks for a small family of 4  will cost  anything between 1500/-to 1800/-without taxes!
The ambience is nice , service is good & food is very inviting!

Old nostalgic memories are here in my childhood, and amazingly, while other old restaurants are either closed, or closing or deteriorating a lot, they still preserve their quality. Very tasty food, Tandoori chicken and pineapple blossom are the best in the city, continentals (Indian style continental in fact) are also very good. Service is good, warm staff, good ambience and beautiful decor. A good place around old great eastern hotel.

Amber. nostalgia. smell of hot towels. taste of vinigar soaked onions. cling clang of forks spoons nd knives is just what makes a lunch or dinner comfortable,dreamy,delicious nd sumptuous. taste ranges from continental with fish liver gin to desi maharajah style with keema naan. to top it off one has to dip the long spoon into a lobg glass of tuttie frootie. it has left me wanting for more and return everytime..

Went there after a long tiring day with my brother on our way to home. As we entered the restaurant I realize it's quite sophisticated and well decorated. We ordered basic main course items as we were so hungry and didn't wanna experiment with unknown dishes. The food quality was excellent and tastes finger licking good. As for the price goes it's not that cheap but they have justified what they are offering.

One fun fact about this place is, whenever you enter their rest room a person always stand there to hand over comb and towel which is quite funny and I could not stop laughing after my brother went there and explained me the scenario.

Great chilli prawns, tandoori chicken which makes you lick your fingers and mindblowing butter chicken. I still crave for Amber food even when now when am far away from Calcutta.

Hello people. Eekshit here. I'm a very Big Foodie. I visited today The Restaurant  Amber. This is my first Review so i pretty don't know what to write. But still Just for the start. The food was no doubt mouth watering . The interiors were average. The ambiance was not up to the mark. The worst part was that when we ordered sweet corn soup they bought the soup without corn. This was very Disappointing. The presentation of the food was not that good. Last but not the least you should at definitely try it once.

A very balanced review! Food is brilliant and is worth every penny! However the location & ambience is not up to the mark. At the same time service is impeccable. I was impressed by their hospitality & their prompt serving nature. I feel, delivery or take-away is more convenient!

Now this place is really nostalgic for me as this is the first multi cuisine restaurant that i visited when i was a kid with my parents. I like the ambience a lot, the waiters and the mangers offers a great hospitality.
Coming to food, the first thing i prefer everyone to try is the FRIED FISH N CHIP WITH TARTARE SAUCE...its yummy and delicious. In main course i prefer Indian here like chicken reshmi butter masala or mutton rogan josh with butter nan or kabuli nan and if you are a dessert person you will be a little disppointed since i think amber  needs to fill gaps in this section, though you can try tutti frutti or the chocolate sundae.

You'll be Licking Your Fingers for ETERNITY !

LOCATION : Get off at the Chandni chowk Metro Station and take a right turn till you hit the place,on the left of the street( for people coming from North Kolkata).

The Place has a been a hit since the time my mother got married and now i know why. For people who eat "Chicken Fried Rice" every now and then and thought it couldn't get any better, you'll be bound to think again. It was that good believe me !. The Nan may have been a tad on the higher side (costly) but with the "Chicken Butter Masala" it felt heavenly. You'll feel the urge to enjoy every bite like it's your last. Even their "Strawberry shake" was one of the best I've had in recent years. Although after ordering, I was disappointed with the waiting time.

AMBIANCE : It's Old World Classy. Make sure to sit on the sofas on the right side of the First Floor. The low seating arrangement feels nice. The waiter was old but very polite and courteous. His recommendations really hit the spot.

FINAL CONCLUSION : The only place which can go head-to-head with Arsalan. Although to be fair Arsalan is relatively cheaper. But the Ambiance and the food will certainly make you visit the place often. Be it "Mughlai" or "Chinese" these people know their stuff thoroughly.
Cost for 2 : 1000/- . The best Esplanade has to offer.

This popular restaurant peaked in the mid-80s, when every Calcuttan would swear by their Tandoori Chicken and Kali Dal. But much time has gone and much water has flown, Amber still remains the family and office goers restaurant in a busy downtown lane, spread over three floors.Amber is a big three floored restaurant and it seems it is a one of the favorite family spot as every time i go i locate few families. Since they don't accept reservations, getting in early is recommended. However, the food is average and the service most ordinary. A regular meal here would comprise kebabs, naan, Dal, Chana Masala and Liver Curry. However, the highlight of a meal would be the Brain Curry, the Fried Fish and the Tutti Frutti.

MEMORIES ARE MADE AT AMBER

Whenever any of our relatives come to Calcutta and crave for authentic North Indian dishes we always head for Amber. This has become a kind of pilgrimage for our family. Every time that we choose to go there we have not been left disappointed. We have practically tasted each and every item on the menu. It does not matter to us that there is nothing left to be had from here. We have definitely developed a strong bond with this place and the staff knows that too especially the senior ones. 

There is no denying the fact that their Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala is one of the best in Kolkata. There is just the right amount of butter and mix of spices. It is simply a crime if you do not try out their Mutton Surkh Korma and the Rogan josh. The last item can be compared to the Rogan gosh I had at Sourav's before its untimely closure. For those who have had experience of having badly charred Chicken Tandoori you are not likely to experience that in Amber. You can expect soft and juicy meat pieces from their Tandoori section. To go with these meat dishes order Palak Paneer, Kashmiri Aloo Dum or Dal Makhani.  Have them with any variety of Nan on offer at the restaurant. 

Their other notable items are Cream of Asparagus Soup, Golden Fried Prawns and Fried Fish 'n' Chips with Tartare sauce.  Even their Chicken Princess and Chicken Au Gratin have a fan following in my family. Unlike other restaurants specializing in North Indian food you don't have to fork out a lot of money here. It is reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of food available here. The dining experience wouldn't be complete without the efficient and prompt service of the staff. They are always nearby and are ever eager to help you.

I used to visit this restaurant during childhood with my parents. Once considered to be the best north indian restaurant. Mutton moti biryani is their special dish. Pineapple blossom is also wonderful. Now it is beyond my reach to visit this restaurant as their prices are sky high and their quality of food has gone down. Ambience is really amazing.

Amber is one of those places in town which has been around for years and has been serving quality food for decades. It is dependable, not very expensive and serves fantastic helpings of superbly cooked food - making it an easy choice for many diners.

The ambience is good, with the exception of a common bar that some times gets a little dicey. The staff are courteous and well-informed, and their suggestions usually are spot-on.

Start off your meal with the golden fried prawns, chicken seekh kebab or the reshmi kebab. They are soft, delicious and leave your tastebuds yearning for more. You have a wide range of choices for the main course. The biriyani is slightly on the spicier side, but served with meatballs which makes it a special attraction. The chicken bharta and the mutton qorma are sinful delights, which taste best with the buttery warmth of a naan or the thin texture of a roomali roti.

Some of the items are overprices, but if you stick to the basics and don't go for the exotic dishes, it will not pinch your pocket. Swallow down your meal with a Chocolate Nut Sundae or a Tutti Frutti and you will leave the place fully satisfied.

Verdict: Located centrally at Esplanade, with a price tag of around Rs. 1000 per couple ($ 20 around) and has a reputation for serving good quality food for a long time. No-brainer!

This is the one i love to visit simply because they offer such nice indian yummy treat. Its always that family chooses it for dinning out. The aura is very nice and very lil noisy, which i just love. The food is very delicious and tastes very fresh. Even the rich indian dishes dosent go heavy on ur belly. Allthough the menu is limited but tastefull. Starting from chicken kebabs, awesome matar pulao, masala kulcha, green peas muchroom all were yummy. Even the continental thats the chicken soup, chicken roast,chocolate mousse are equally delightfull. The prices are a bit high but with regards of the place its just fine.

I still can remember the day when i first came to amber with one of my close friends. I still can smell the intoxicating odour of the place. It is one of those classy restaurants where you can feel special by the warm behavior of the staffs.
The ambiance is all good over here, it is an exception to the noisy atmosphere of common bars. And here You will see it maintains a standard which is absent most others restros.
Well if i have to rate this place, i will go through these sections:

Ambiance: 4
Food: 3.5
Service: 4
Cost: 3
Quality: 3.5

I gave 3 to cost because a few items are over priced here in my concern though over all it is a very good place to hang on. If you plan to mug here, you can try chicken tandoori, chicken seekh kabab, tandoori kulcha, mutton dopiyaza. Mutton surkh korma is a personal suggestion from me, it is mouth watering and very delicious. 
I have never tasted the sea foods over here, so i will come to grab those next time :-)

Going to Amber is like going on a Nostalgia trip... so many memories are attached to this place.

This restaurant used to on the food itinerary of anyone visiting Kolkata but sadly over the years it seems to be slipping from it's place. The 'waiting for table' crowds are no longer visible at the entrance. 

Even the food is no longer what it used to be. The kebabs are not so juicy and the mutton pieces in curry not so soft any more. Amber used to have a Machi Masala Kebab (Which later Zaranj also started)... it was a disaster I had it last time. Though their Pindi Chana has remained same over the years. Only Kwality (at Park Street) can match their Chana.

Amber was my parents' favourite restaurant when i was 9 -10 years old kid. we used to visit amber for dinner on every sundays and i remember gulping down atleast two glasses of apple juice then..the funniest thing was when my dad used to pour a sip of his drink into my glass under the table, and mum never knew about it..
I am planning to take my special friend to amber for lunch and hope the food and ambience is same as ever

Ambar is a very imprtant chapter in my foodie book. my first memory of this place is 25 yrs ago... and it was where i had my first tandoori chicken. 

Amber is not only a restaurant its a part of many ppls lives. the decor is not much to talk abt... in fact i used to like their earlier decor much more... 

the USP of this place is Consistancy .... 

their kebabs are mind blowing... in indian i simply adore.. paneer butter masala,, pindi chana, masala kulcha, navratan korma, chicken bharta , reshmi kebab, fish masala. 

the russian salad, chicken princess, vegetable au gratin and fish n chips r yummy too 

the food is fantastic.. and it tastes the same over so many years

I am sorry to say that the quality has definitely deteriorated over the last few years. I still remember the Biryani I had over here almost 12 years back. And that makes things difficult for me to give it 5 out of 5. But even if it has lost its superiority, it still offers the taste of India in a gracious manner.

This is by far the best north indian restaurant of kolkata, very old restaurant having modern amenities with old charm.. Ambience is excellent, waiters are extremely polite, well behaved and well informed also, they seems working there for long time as they know about every details about the restaurant.. now coming to food-we ordered pesawari fish tikka-excellent vetki kabab, chicken reshmi butter masala, extremely tasty dish, chicken pieces were soo soft that they seems melting in the mouth, mutton surkh korma-very tender juicy mutton chunks in a spicy gravy, and masala kulcha, this item we generally order in every north indian restaurant and here the kulcha we got was the best we have ever had..service was fast and after lunch cleaning of table and bill came fast..ambience is excellent , dimly lit, soft music playing.. this is moderately priced excellent restaurant worth vising again and again.....

It is a multi cuisine restaurant offers a wide range in chicken, fish, mutton and sea food recipes. I am frequent over there from past 5 years. They have maintained their quality for more than 3 decades with reasonable rates. Food (Muglai/ Indian/ Chinese) is simply amazing and has distinct taste.

This is really a big food joint to satisfy customer from different class.
Ground floor welcomes only gents crowds.
First floor is for Family Dines (open till 3:00 PM).
Second floor is a Family Restro-Bar (From 3:00 PM onwards).
Third Floor is for Executive (I haven't tried yet).

Don't miss their exclusive (today's special) Kabab whenever you will be landed over there. Their lip smacking Kababs are Fish Masala Kabab, Mutton Barra Kabab, Mutton Seek Kabab, Chicken Badami Kabab,  Chicken Reshmi Kabab and Chicken Tandoori. I used to order Golden Fried Prawn and Chilly Chicken (semi gravy) always as starter. These two are really very unique in preparation and taste and I can bet that you won't get anywhere rather than Amber.

Main course menu is not so elaborate. You may go for Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Mutton Surkh Korma and Mutton Rogan Josh. In veg; Panir Butter Masala, Dal Makhani, Chana Masala are the taste of Amber.  There is only one kind of Biryani that you find there, Mutton Moti Biryani. What I love the most about this biryani is that you get something in every bite (only comparable with Zaranj's Hyderabadi Gosht Biryani) and possibly the best Biryani in Kolkata according to my taste and perception.

But the service has deteriorated with times, the crew old and always hankers for tips for any service they provide. There is a bit price hike during last couple of years. However the food is still carrying the same taste as before.

Prompt service, good food if not great. We went in a group of 5 friends on a crowded Friday night - We ordered the Chicken Malai Tikka - soft and moist, Fish Peshawari Tikka- flaky and nicely done, Butter Naans (delicious, crunchy), Chicken Bharta - again, very well done - right amount of cream- not cloying not very rich yet delicious. We ended it with a glass of Fresh Lime Sodas each. Overall quite a good experience. My only nitpicking would be that the portions aren't much for the price - not very student/ youth friendly pricing. Courteous staff, old world charm about the place.

An evergreen restaurant, in Kolkata. Have been going there for ages. The decor on the ground floor & 1st floor has remained the same for the last 15-20 years. 
Before the newbies cropped all over Kolkata, this restaurant, along with Kwality's & bar-b-q were the places to be at. 
The Chilli Paneer is my all-time favorite here. Cooked in non-Chinese flavors, it tastes yummy! even the Paneer Tikka is amazingly soft in the middle, yet has the right-light-crisp on the outside. 
Paneer Butter Masala, Pindi Chana, Dal Makhani are some other classics on the menu. My non-veg friends say that the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala & Chicken Bharta are delicious. 
Old-world decor & equally old-school servers (especially on the ground & 1st floor restaurants) gives you a sense of nostalgia. 
All-in-all, a great restaurant. Almost a heritage of sorts. Must visit for people who haven't visited already .

Ambience: Every city has its landmarks (5-Star hotels excluded) for Tandoori food. Delhi has Moti Mahal, Mumbai has Copper Chimney, Bangalore has Tandoor and Chennai has Kabul. When it comes to Kolkata, these laurels undoubtedly rest on the able shoulders of Amber and its sibling across Bentinck Street - Sagar.

Amber is a restaurant complex comprising 3 floors - Bar on ground floor, Restaurant on 1st floor for families (along with a mezzanine for private parties) - stags not allowed and Restaurant on 2nd floor - a smoke hazy male dominion and the 3rd floor used for VVIP Guests and has also been used as a waiting lounge at times. Sagar is a smaller version with a Bar on the ground and a family room on the 1st floor. Both restaurants are replenished from a base kitchen situated opposite Amber, next to their takeaway outlet.
