This place was on my list for a long time so finally went there on my birthday :). Its very easy to locate, just opposite to acropolis mall. I really liked the decor. Fast service and friendly staff. Food was real good.. :)
We ordered non-veg assorted plater, Mexican sizzler, monte carlo and we even tried hookah there. Overall a very nice experience.

Pied Piper Cafe... opposite acropolis mall rajdanga main road , a roof top Cafe quite warm and spacious with comfortable seating, great music and ambience and moderately good food. We tried the cheese fondue which was yum but the stuffed mushrooms were ok since the hard crust on top was thick and hard but the mushrooms were juicy...overall a 3/5 for food rest 3.5 - 4/5 for the cafe ambience.

Went there on 7.12.17 at noon...the cafe was empty,we were there for 3 hours...and the cafe was empty for the whole 3 hours.
Location-it is situated right opposite to acropolis mall it is situated on the 3rd floor above the cheeni kum restaurant.
Ambience-The ambience is good with music and the cafe is very nicely decorated with carrom board and other games.
Food-We were 5,we ordered-
Cheese fondue-(5/5)trust me,this was heavenly...to die for!
This comes with small bread pieces and a bowl of delicious cheese...there was an ample amount of warm cheese...and we loved it! Highly recommended!!
Assorted Platter-(4/5) We ordered 2 of them!
This comes with 4 different types of starters...2 being chicken one being fish and the other being prawn! This comes with 3 dips which were tasty!
All were too tasty and worth the money spent!
Recommended!
Mozerella Sticks-(4.5/5) This was again awesome!
This comes with 5 mozerella sticks with a inner filling of mozerella with spices! This comes with fries and a dip! Recommended!
Exotic chicken burger-(3.5/5) tasted like a normal chicken burger.. Nothing special in it.It was ok and it came with fries!
Chicken Lasagne-(4/5) this lasagne took a while to be served but was awesome! Came with a piece of bread on top of it and we loved it!
Recommended!
Chicken Barbeque pizza-(2.5/5) I didn't like the pizza that much...as it had a thin crust and there was nothing special in it.it had chicken pieces and veggies as toppings but the pizza was a bit chewy and hard!
Not recommended.
Pan Thai Noodles-(3.5/5) the pan Thai Noodles was good in taste and was topped with peanuts..I liked it...but the noodles was oily!
Blue lagoon mocktail-(4/5)Tasted like any other blue lagoon mocktail and was good in taste!
Virgin mojito-(4/5)was good in taste and was quite refreshing! the quantity could be increased though!!
Blueberry springwater hookah with ice base-(4/5) the shisha was good and had dense smoke!
Recommended!
Service-the service was ok and upto the mark!
I had a booking of the corner table for the birthday party..but when we reached there they completely denied us about any bookings!
Yet they gave us the seat!
Overall a good experience and not too heavy on the pocket! Liked the cafe and will be visiting again soon!
Bill was 3016/- which was pocket friendly!

It is right beside acropolis mall and is really a great cafe. The ambience inside is really nice. We didn't try hooka but I must say that their food is really nice.

We ordered non-veg assorted platter which is perfect for 2 people. It contained 2 pieces of prawn and 6 pieces of different types of fried chicken. The dips are awesome. Really recommended.
Chicken and veg lasagne was also the perfect combo of saucy, cheesy kind of pasta with garlic bread.
It would be nice if they added more chicken pieces in the lasagne.

Location : Just opposite to Acropolis Mall.

Ambience : Hangout joints with hookah. Initially the place gave me good vibes but then when I looked at the decor, it was quite random. It's almost like someone went to gariahat and bought few decors and put them into random places. They do have indoor games like caroom and chess though.

Food and drinks : We ordered the assorted Platter with two virgin blue lagoon and one strawberry cooler.
The drinks were okish but the food let me down. It had four items,
 one fish fry 
One prawn
One chicken Satay
One chicken wings.

While the prawn was the winner of the d
Plate, chicken wings let down in terms of taste or flavours.
While paying the bill, the waiter did ask about the feedback. I explained the chicken wings lacked flavours. It was quite dull. 
Instead of taking a positive critism sportingly he talked me over than I don't know how it should taste because it's Mexican chicken wings. It's supposed to be that way. When I counter him with few facts, he diverted the topic saying the chef made it that way 😜

Pocket Pinch : we paid 1050rs which I think was not worth it!

Been to this place about thrice by now...Its located just opposite to the 2nd entrance/exit gate of Acropolis Mall...One of those small cafe cum hookah parlour type places...The decor is nice and even though the area is not large...seating arrangemnets has been done cleverly👍👍

Coming to food ---

Jalapenos - Cheese Poppers --- This one was tastyyy...The mayo sauce which came on the side was not that tasty...But the cheese balls were good enough..

Harissa Chicken Skewers --- Yeah i felt the quantity was a bit less for the price...But taste was goodenough to make up for it...

Chicken Lasagna --- This was the first time i had lasagna actually...so didn't have anything in mind to compare this with...but i really liked this dish and certainly want to try this out more...so i guess they made this one also quite well...👍👍👍


Pepper Chicken --- Well...did not like this one that much...kinda had a sour pinch to the taste...So would not recommend this one...


Monte Carlo --- This was also okayish...nothing special...yeah it can be a filling dessert after a meal...


Pasta(The Mixed Sauce one) --- This one was good again...The garlic bread was on point...very nicely made and the pasta was also good...So can recommend this to the veg people...👍

Black Currant Ice Tea --- This one was a disappointment...At first my friend who had ordered it found it to be kinda hot at the top which was really strange...After a bit of stirring it was gone..but the glass was filled with ice a bit too much and the taste was also not good...👎👎👎

Hookah --- The quality of hookah is very good here...no complaints here at all...U want strong and they will make it by mixing flavours and it turns out to be really good...So definitely a good place to try out hookah 😎😎😎

Food:I usually came up here to heal my sweet tooth hurts..had the blue lagoon which was extra sweet and the Monte carlo..which was sweeter than expected but had good layers of brownies,ice creams and nuts.gonna drop in for food someday

This is a cute little hookah bar and restaurant above Chini Kum opp Acropolis mall.The joint is pretty small but space management is nice with cosy lighting and catchy posters..We tried their assorted platter which was quite ok and nicely presented ..the only negative point is since the space is quite less ..it can sometime get a little suffocating with the smoke from the hookah..

I come in Kolkata in every 3-4 months and the first thing i search is good food and place to hang out. Pied piper made me happy. A small one though but a very well managed place correctly decorated in every corner. Was happy with the staff they were good. Music was good and the way food was served was awesome loved it. Food tasted lovely.
I would rate this 3.5 because i wanted more non veg items in the menu and also a small place to dance.

Today I tried out Pied Piper..About the ambience, it was attractive and happening. We ordered Char Grilled Chicken, Risotto with chicken and mushroom and non-veg Mexican sizzler. Service was prompt and staff was welcoming. Though the Risotto was not up to the mark , but the other two dishes were really good. Portions were enough. I would like to visit again. Overall a nice place to hangout with friends...

It is just opposite to the Acropolis mall. It's in the top floor of the building. I liked the flavour of the hookah, but food quantity was not ok. We orderd pizza, chicken wings and nachos. The base of the pizza wasn't good. The topping was still ok compared to the base. The ambience was nice. They decorated with bottles, but it was looking nice.

I had gone to this place twice and it is a cool hangout place for teens or friends who want to catch up over hookah .

The place is somewhat pretty small but nicely arranged .I would have loved it to be more spacious.
The music collection is good but it gets really loud at times and since the seats are closely arranged it doesn't feel great .

I had Quesadilla with added chicken today and it tasted amazing !It is a must try here .
Quality and Price of the place is very decent .
Service is good .

You may visit this place but it's not ideal for big groups.
The hookah is good btw and If you want that you must give it a try !

I always thought that I need to visit this place, moreover due to the reason of it being very near to my residence. And I finally got the chance to visit it, thanks to the most precious person in my life. 

So, experience was over all cool. Very creatively decorated interiors and great service. 

Amongst what we ordered viz. Italian smooch, Chocolate shake and assorted platter; it was the assorted platter which stole all the show!!! It actually was a recommendation of one of the restaurants people and was a good bet I must say. This platter actually consisted of 4 different starters in one plate. It consisted of Harissa Chicken Skewers, Mexican style Chicken wings, grilled fish and grilled prawn served with 3 types of Dips. It tasted just awesome and as my friend quoted enough for two people.

The place also serves hookah.

Just loved the location of this place. It's located just opposite to Acropolis Mall. The hookah bar is located in the third floor of a restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty cool but the service is horribly slow. The quality of the food is good but quantity is not upto the  mark. Not pocket friendly for students. Also when you are in this particular place don't ever order a pizza. We had ordered for a Mexican pizza and it sucked. They took more than a hour to serve us. Secondly it was topped with Rajma (kidney beans) Pasta was comparatively better. Have not come across too many hookah parlours in Kasba. So hookah lovers can surely give this place a try

Visited this place today, in the Sunday evening. Situated just opposite of Acropolis mall, in the 3rd floor. Mainly a hookah joint, however it serves lip smacking continental delicacies. Food was awesome. Worth mentioning was the behaviour and service. Extremely helpful staffs. Would surely recommend. A good place to hangout with friends. Would visit soon.

Very poor service. Worst hookah ever. Quantity of food served was very low and price was high. And above all they served the wrong food and even added it to our bill. Highly disappointing.

Located opposite side of acropolis mall .A small place . The staff's behaviour was bad. We were asked to leave because a group of people was there then another staff stopped us and gave a table.  Food was just okey .The staff's couldn't control those group they were just dominating the place. Suddenly current goes off due to short circuit and they didn't have a uninterrupted power service . Bad experience .

It would be a loss for anyone who spend time over there. Hookah offers are not good enough.

This place is located just opposite to Acropolis Mall,on the top floor of the building.The area is not big but they have decorated it so nicely and space management is on point.They serve hookah and the food is also very nice but the quantity of the drinks were less according to the price.But again the service was good so were the people.
We ordered: Italian Smooch (3/5)
Chocolate Snake(4/5)
Assorted Platter(5/5)
Italian Smooch was okayish in taste the glass was mostly filled with ice and was quite a disappointment.
Chocolate Snake was nice,it was innovative and was moderately sweet and I liked it. but again the quantity could have been a bit more in the glass
ASSORTED PLATTER was not at all a disappointment the guy who was serving us suggested it and was really good and worth the money we actually got to taste 4 different starters in one plate,it consisted of
HARISSA CHICKEN SKEWERS,MEXICAN STYLE CHICKEN WINGS, GRILLED FISH and GRLLED PRAWN served with 3 types of dips! And is enough for 2 people. The Grilled fish was my favorite among all,good quality fish and mustard sauce were the hero of the dish and appt for a fish lover like me.

We ordered Alfredo & Pesto Alla Basil Pasta. If don't have a very big appetite, 1 is enough for two. Creamy chicken spaghetti was oh so awesome. First time ever, I liked pasta. For desert we took Monte Carlo. A small glass, tightly filled with chocolate, chocolate chips, sponge cake, cream, it was heavenly. The only mild disappointment was about raspberry mojito which tasted more like lemon soda. 

Ambience is nice. The place is small but decoration is pleasant to eyes. Just we don't want that TV to crack our ears. Somehow they were not turning off the tv. 

Overall, quick service, decent staff, way to go. We'll definitely go next time to try different cuisines.

Went there with my gf to enjoy some much needed hookah but was left wanting for more.  We reached arnd 5 and inside the cafe and it was too bright in there.  Sunlight poured in through the windows. A hookah lounge needs to be dimly lit. Coming to the hookah, it was not good at all.  We were advised to take double flavours and ice base.  Both the advices were in poor taste. Plus the charcoal they gave was consumed very fast.  My advice would be to fo to places like china whites and avoid this. China whites is cheaper and better.

Pied Pipers Cafe is a Cafe cum Hookah bar joint ( only hookah bar in Kasba area ) is within the Cheenikum Kam restaurant , located at the rooftop of it.

Location - Just opposite to Acropolis mall, Kasba.

Ambience - The ambience is peppy, well lit, nice interior decor, and thus a perfect hookah bar, spacing for about 30-35 people is a good place to hangout with friends.

Staffs & Service - Staffs were well behaved and service was prompt.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting session and had the following -

SOUPS -

1) Cream of Brocolli - Cream of broccoli soup is a soup prepared with broccoli , stock  and milk or cream as primary ingredients. It was creamy, healthy and yummy. It was served with Garlic bread.

2)Leeks Almond soup - Very creamy & almondy and healthy.

SALAD -

1) Russian Salad - it is usually made with diced boiled potatoes, carrots, brined dill pickles green peas,  eggs, celeriac, onions, diced boiled chicken, tart apples, with salt, pepper, and mustard added to enhance flavor, dressed with mayonnaise was healthy and appetising.

STARTERS-

1) Harissa Chicken Kebab - It was perfectly grilled, soft, succulent and flavourful.

2)Mexican Pawbhaji - an indowestern dish , with fusion spices was incredibly tasty. It was served with cheese, oregano & chili flakes.

3) Veg Bowl - It consisted of a) French Fries in a small bucket and was very presentable .
b)normal potato fries served with creamy coriander dip.

DESSERTS-

1)Valentine special waffle dessert

2)Monte Carlo

3) Pannacotta( Strawberry and Gondhoraj )

Review - Monte Carlo was disappointing as it was too overwhelming. Pannacotta was nice and the best was the special waffle dessert, it was very enjoyable.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable along with sufficient quantity. So don't waste time and come with your friends and loved ones in this place and cherish.

Thanks to the management for their warm reception and hospitality.

A small cafe, mostly got famous after the Acropolis mall came up next to it. They are popular among the college students for the reasonably priced shishas. They are running some decent combo offers and that's the reason I ended up being here. The food and drink is good while the shisha is a hit or miss! The service is decent and this place could be worth a try if you're broke but in a mood to chill with your pals.

Cheers!

The place is a so-so!! Staff was very helpful and the Hookah was normal.The food here was not at all good.I had been there with a couple of my friends .We had ordered some Mexican pizza which was more a biscuit than a pizza. Can't say much about other food.Otherwise the place was okay.Only thanks to the staff who were friendly.

Went there on a Friday evening, a meet up of some old college friends. Finding the place was initially a problem, as surprisingly Vodafone Network just shut down around the place, thus no maps. I wish they had a display on the footpath, like those cool looking videsi diners we see in pictures. Would make the entrance easier to find.

As regards the actual place.. the food is good, and not too expensive. We took, among other stuff, the non veg platter, and it was better than expected. Good taste *and* good quantity.. that is definitely rare. Other orders included some lasagna and some rice with cheese n cream stuff which i forgot the name (😑). For five of us, the bill was around 1600 including the hookah, which is quite a bargain. Overall would recommend this as a place for a quick and inexpensive hangout.

Since the place is small, it would have been better if they used the lights more creatively, to visually separate each table from the other.. kinda like how (for lack of better examples) peter cat does it. That would make the place more photogenic, and if people can take better photos at your place, you're gonna get more footfall.

Small place located opposite Acropolis, we visited it at the early evening hours. So we just ordered a non veg platter. The platter had a combination of chicken wings, prawn skewers, fish and other chicken items. Loved their accompaniments of Russian salad prepared two ways. The coffee was tasty but oddly had a cherry to go with it. 
As for the place, it's nice and comfy but being a hookah place and that too an air conditioned restaurant, the smoke kinda gets irritating after awhile. And if you wish to spend quality time with friends, you have board games to have some more fun.

It's located opposite to acropolis mall. Perfect place for shisha lovers. Seating arrangement is not so huge. Decor is kind of different. Lights are fitted in heiniken bottles. They recycled lot of stuffs like cold drink cans,beer bottles and decorate the outlet with these stuffs. We ordered margheritta pizza which was tasteless. Then we ordered choco lava cake, hot chocolate and pepper chicken. Desserts tasted so yummy.

Very disappointing. The food took years to be served and was very ordinary. The waiters were very courteous but not enough reason to go back when the food is below par. We ordered Shirley Temple and the non veg kabab platter. And a word about the steep uphill ramp leading to the washroom - it's surely is a scary health hazard. Had heard good things about this place but the experience wasn't good.

I am writing this review after my second visit to this outlet.. And believe me it was no different than my first visit. First of all the ambience is worth admiring at the day time and even at the night. They have used very simple materials and rather waste materials who would have been in trash, to give their outlet a wonderful appeal.
The staff members are courteous and yes the never forget to wear their smile..
Let's come to the food part.. Yes I tried the stuffed mushrooms that came with a side of French Fries and Monte Carlo.. Both of them were perfectly balanced in their taste with subtle flavour and I really liked it..👍👍
The Shisha is also very good and the Shisha decor inside the outlet is even beautiful. Though they do not have their fruit chillums, yet the other ones are nice.
They have their offer registered in little app and they are amazing deals. 
So go ahead!! 

Happy Eating!!

I went to this place last evening with two of my friends. It is situated right opposite of the Acropolis Mall. Loved the decoration of this newly opened place. We ordered mocktails, spaghetti in mixed sauce (veg) and non-veg platter which contained 5 types of non-veg dishes along with French fries. All of those were tasty, specially the spaghetti. It was creamy. My friends also ordered Shisha and they were happy with the flavour and everything.

Loved the entire arrangement of this place, which is very easy to locate right opposite to acropolis mall. After you enter this place you have a lively feel about it, the decor is something well planned with recycled products. Seats are comfortable, they have individual chargers on each table.
We had ordered for hookah, virgin mojito and stuffed mushrooms. Food was very good, properly stuffed with cheese, although we had a longer waiting time for food but it was worth it. Service is a bit slow, but our server was suggestive and very polite. They have board games and all, so a perfect place to hang out with a lovely ambiance!

This cafe is located in the top floor of Cheeni kum restaurant, just opposite of Acropolis Mall, Kasba. Ambiance is really nice with eye catching interior decoration and max to max 25-30 seating arrangements. Smoking area is available and the lighting effect is very catchy. The place is perfect to hang out with friends and loved ones. Staffs were really humble and helpful. I and my fellow foodie friends were invited there for a tasting event. When we reached there the place was fully packed with young people. The atmosphere was charming and everyone seemed enjoying. 

Coming to the food, we had tasted different types of delicious soups, healthy salads, some mouth-watering starters and of course creamy-yummy desserts.

Soups:
Cream of broccoli – A soup prepared with fresh green broccoli, stock and milk or cream as main ingredients. The soup was quite thick, and served with garlic bread. Very healthy and delicious

Leeks almond soup – A mixture of egg yolk and cold milk added with leek / onion / potato mixture & almond until turned creamy layer. Served with crushed almond, the taste was quite good and the soup is very healthy.

Salad:
Russian salad – very famous salad also known by Olivier salad in Russia. Varieties of chopped steamed vegetables like carrot, tomatoes, onion, potatoes, green peas, lettuce leaves along with chopped chicken strips. All of these mixed very well with mayonnaise. And served with sprinkled pepper powder, salt & mustard powder. Decorated every well with 1/4 of egg portion and lettuce leaves. The taste was simply superb as well as the decoration quite eye catching. 

Starter/Snacks:
Harissa chicken kebab – Chicken breast pieces marinated and grilled. Later on it was served put it into wooden sticks with pico de gallo along with mayonnaise mixed salad. Chicken pieces are perfectly grilled, very soft and juicy. A mouth-watering preparation.

Mexican Paobhaji – Boiled cauliflower, green peas, potatoes cooked with butter mixture sauteed with tomatoes. Later on cooked with chili powder, salt & masala. Pour water just enough to bring to a consistency. It was good in taste served with normal pao (bread) which was filled with butter and chili flakes.

Veg bowl – They served us two types of potato fried veg dishes. First one is the French fries which was served inside of a small bucket with beautifully decorated. Next one is the normal potato fries served with creamy coriander dip.

Desserts:
For Valentine’s Day they also had arrangements for delicious desserts. We tried

Valentine Special Waffle Desserts, Monte Carlo (a must try) and Pannacotta (Strawberry and Gandhoraj). Each desserts were absolutely delicious. 

The place is awesome. We really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and warm hospitality of the owner. The prices are also very reasonable.
Well I will definitely recommend this place everyone and especially to the teenagers and college goers.
Thanks

This place is right next to acropolis mall. The ambience is good. Beer bottles are used as light bulb holders and that looks splendid. The chicken lasagna and aglio olio are so mouthwatering. But this place has one fault,its too stuffy. You can have the hookah smell for 10 or 15mins but after that it becomes very suffocating.

I loved the decoration of this place. They recycled the beer bottles to make the bulb holders. The cold drink  cans to make a flower pot 😄😂😂😂😂.
The staffs were really good at their service....😍😘.
Now lets come to the food.... 
We ordered margarita which was not at all up to the mark, cold coffee with ice cream ( though i couldnt find any ice cream in that )😂😂😂😂... and pepper chicken which was really a waste of money.

And then there comes the hookah...n tht is the only thing i enjoyed.😁😁😁😁😁😁...!!!!!!

Met some old school buddies for coffee and chit-chatting. Ambience and decor is very good with cosy seating arrangements. The cold coffee and the pepper chicken was average. However I liked the way the menu and bill was presented. Looking forward to another visit.

Awesome food. Simply awesome. Taste was too good. But the place was too small. I ordered chicken sphagetti pasta in red sauce and chicken sandwich which was yum. Special shisha which was specially prepared by them was average. Coleslaw full of mayonnaise  and fries were given with sandwich. Overall it was very good. 👍

This place is right next to acropolis mall. The ambience is good. Beer bottles are used as light bulb holders and that looks splendid. The chicken lasagna and aglio olio are so mouthwatering. But this place has one fault,its too stuffy. You can have the hookah smell for 10 or 15mins but after that it becomes very suffocating.

Location : rajdanga,Kasba. Rooftop of Cheeni cum bar and restaurant!

Ambience and Decor : I personally like the decor. They have recylced a lot of stuff. SO, you'll get to see lights bulbs fitted inside Heiniken bottles, Budweiser lamps, Rockford glasses, etc! I love the ambience, the place has a soothing vibe going on. 

This is basically a hookah cafe with a lot of games for you to play. I've gone there twice and have tasted 2 food items :

*Chicken Margharita pizza : The pizza had thin crust with ample amount of chicken pieces and decent amount of cheese. I liked it!

*Cheese Fondue : This was absolutely amazing! I liked it so much that I ended up ordering another portion of this. The cheese dip was warm and amazing! The bread chunks were nice and crispy!

Can't comment about the hookah because I dont drag hookah.

Service : Staff is very courteous!

P.S. - They charge 20.5% tax (which includes Vat,service charges and other govt taxes!)

Very beautiful place just above the famous Chenni kum restaurant... rather it's another initiative by them... deco was awesome... service was very good... staffs are very courteous... we tried their...

◆ 3 pan hookah~ good one...

◆ Green apple mojito~ Not at all good...

◆ Tri coloured drink~ Presentation wise it was beautiful... but tasted good, not as much expected...

◆ Stuffed mushrooms~ very good...

◆ Spaghetti aglio olio~ Also tasted well...

So overall it was a very good place for hangouts with friends... very nice ambience... but they definitely need something to do with the food... pocket pinch was ok...

Great Place for refreshment. Good place to have some fun time with friends. today I with my friends visited this cafe after shopping at Acropolis mall. First half an hour we played carrom for refreshment. We ordered three Strawberry cooler. The taste was awe sum. Then we had a Bar  Be Que Chicken pizza. its has enough quantity of chicken and bell peppers. They had a prepared it very well. Just within 15 minutes they served the pizza. Then we had a Hookah. Enjoyed the evening very well with my friends. Its on the roof top and place was really good. We had already planned to visit again next week. Hope we will get this quality serving again as we finds them more cooperative and well managed then others. Really we enjoyed good quality foods and beverages.

Yesterday i had visited piedpiper cafe in kasba opp acropolis with my family. I like the place very much. Its inner decoration was good enough and very coperative staffs. My child enjoyed a lot as they have sufficient inhouse games too. He enjoyed very much. The food and its quality was very good. We hv ordered non veg mexican sizzler and classic napoletana. Both the preparation was very good. Specially the sizzler. The chickens were well grilled and speghetti pasta was good enough. The napoletana pizza had contained enough olives, brocoli, and cherry tomato. The taste was good. We will surely plan again to visit this in this month only with our friends.

Today was my first experience at this cafe and I feel that it does not even deserve any rating at all. Very slow service, until u ask them whether the order is ready or not. You don't get what u order. We ordered a chocolate shake which was too sweet and we had it replaced. Mind it. It was not a new one but they added water to make it less sweet. Disgusting! We ordered a classic napoletana pizza which was supposed to contain onion, broccoli and olives but it only had cheery tomatoes. They did not again replace it but fried the broccoli and placed it on that tiny pizza. And the last one, the lasagna was the worst one I've ever had in my life. I would recommend that you guys please hire a chef who can cook.

Ambience is good - colorful glass bottles, osters, potted plants having a separate stacks of hookahs on the wall which is very eye catchy. Ordered orange mojito as the cooler and mixican food - chicken harissa as an appetizer which was too stiif and hard to chew. Staffs are friendly. Rates are okish.

This was a girls evening out as one of our colleagues was leaving. We found this place on Zomato and decided to try it out. We were hoping for a separate room for hookah, however, it wasn't so. But it wasn't a problem. Well we ordered our main dishes of stuffed grilled fish and grilled chicken. While we waited, we ordered some nachos. When the nachos arrived, we were pleasantly surprised - the quantity was a lot! By the time our main dishes arrived, we were half full already! Well, we loved what we ordered! The stuffed fish was quite a nice surprise! I decided to come back again! I went back in 3 days time with my husband. This time we had one of their pizzas. They are all thin crust. We also had the stir fried veggies and a Shirley Temple. We will try the hookah next time. This is a quaint little place, however here are some suggestions:

1) The puoffes are a little uncomfortable, as there is no backrest. 
2) There is no relation between the theme "Pied Piper's Cafe" and the decor.  I was expecting some relation.
The interesting part of this place is the games available, including carrom, ludo, brainvita and some others. My husband and  I had a competition with brainvita!

This place is at rooftop, opposite Acropolis mall. The view is decent; there are far better rooftop places in the city. The interiors are well decorated with plenty of board games on offer. The beer lamps surely light up the mood! I would recommend visiting in the evening to enjoy the lighting. The food was good. We ordered Mexican style chicken wings, lasagna, cheese fondue and stir fried vegetables. We also ordered Chocolate Snake, Italian Smotch, Green Apple Virgin Mojito. I would say the drinks were disappointing. I hope they improve on that front. Overall, a good experience. Thank you!

It was with my colleagues and a friend.
We had a chicken margherita and a hookah with mixed bubble gum and midnight kiss flavour.

Starting from the beginning....

The entrance was catchy but the lift had a bad smell inside.

The interior was awesome with a number of indoor games scattered around the sitting place.

The drinking water was inside a coloured bottle which looked awesome.

And then there was a portrait with a baba ji ka thullu written on it...

So we played a game of snakes and ladders with the hookah and the pizza for accompaniments...

Quality of food was nice and the hookah flavour was also good but the hookah pipe was a little loose prooving the fact that it is not at all checked regularly...

The ambience was awesome with romantic numbers playing one after another making one dwell between the past and future...with beer bootles and cans of different beverages used as lanters and ceiling danglers...

At the end it was quite a nice place to visit again

It gives me great pleasure to find such interesting restaurants evolving in Kolkata.Pied Piper's is a cozy little cafe situated across the Acropolis mall. The board games, the beer lamps, tiny little showpieces, the block furniture make the place more rejuvenating and lively. Food is quite decent, but they could provide more options. Stuffed grilled fish is a must try at this place.

We ordered creamy cheese pasta,  garlic bread with cheese and mexican style chicken wings.  The taste of the food is very good and price is comparatively lower than others. Staff behaviour is also very good. Will visit again in this puja with my freinds surely.

Ever heard of the Pied Piper of Hamlin? The gang of mice of the city rushed hearing his flute’s tune. Likewise, the wonderful delicacies offered by Pied Piper Cafe, drew all the foodies towards it. Pied Piper is a rooftop cafe which serves delicious Mexican and Italian delicacies. It is the  only place serving hookah in Kasba locality so it attracts mostly youth crowds.
            

Location : Located just opposite to the Acropolis Mall at Rajdanga Main Road, Kasba.

Decor and Ambience : The place is basically a rooftop cafe. It is a 40 seater cafe aesthetically decorated. The colourful glasses, the colourful glass bottles, the sarcastically philosophical posters, the potted plants , all stands out against the black backdrop. Carefully tinted and gleaming all the way, the cafe is all up for setting your mood. The colour story emancipate the warmth and grandeur of the place. The ambience is much likely that of a peppy cafe with a lot of trance and RnB tracks being played. Completely sets in the best of your mood.

Food : This place is famous for the mexican delicacies that they serve. The following were served to us-

Beverages:

1. Peach iced tea - A perfectly made iced tea is surely to set your day cool. Try in their peach iced tea and you are bound to fall in love.
                                          ...

Pied Pipers Cafe is located to the rooftop of Hotel Narayani Enclave opposite to Acropolis Mall in Kasba.

There was no plan of visiting there but suddenly we visited at 7:30 pm.
There was no other people so we comfortably took a seat and ordered Tri Colored Drink and Chocolate snake.
Tri Colored drink has three color of our flag. Orange on top, white on middle and green at the bottom. Taste was good.
Chocolate Snake is one of the chocolate shake on there menu. It was a worthy try.

We ordered Chicken Salad in Caesar Dressing. It was awesome. The taste was too much perfect.
Secondly we tried chicken Fajitas.. it was very well prepared and good.

This is the worst place i have gone to in all my life...not only is the ambience cheap and loud with the TV blaring at full volume which does not let u talk properly(they do not lower the volume even after you request them to!)the rotten cherry on the rotten cake was that we found white miniscule worms wriggling on the pizza...they first tried to argue that those were thyme leaves but when the insects started moving before their very eyes they had to gulp down their own words. The worst bit is they charged us fully for the dish!! So this is a clear warning to all foodies...do NOT visit this joint for food. It is a nightmare!!

Food tasting event at Pied Piper café -

Have you come across a cool Hookah café at Kasba that serves awesome food? And yes, the café is being termed cool because truly the ambiance is somewhat best in class. If the answer is no, then it’s time to visit the newly opened Pied Piper Café beside Acropolis mall and above the Cheeni Kum restaurant. This is a 40-seater uber cool café with board games and ethnic designed mirrors all around. It serves some of the best Italian and Mexican dishes and some amazing mocktails that will surely bring you back for more. 

This place is basically a roof-top joint that has typical comfy low stool seating arrangements with printed covers and signature hanging light bulbs in horizontally cut Heineken bottles. This café is mostly decorated with all recycled items which have been put together with utmost care to look so good, chic and urbane. The place gets direct and reflected sunlight during the day which is sometimes preferred by many (actually I simply love it). The place is basically L-shaped and the further point of the L there is one private dining area for large groups where we were seated, you may get this area if you have prior reservation and you are visiting in a large group of 7 or 8 maybe. The place has got big glass windows that allow the natural light to come in and several quirky quotes all over the place. I hate comparing, but this is one café after Crossroad Café that I loved from the core of my heart. Because it has got everything perfectly in place. I even loved the paan flavored Hookah which I generally avoid. Now let us briefly check out the mocktails and the food items that we had tried during this Food tasting session (where I was invited along with other Panchphoron admin members) at this place.

MOCKTAILS

a) Peach ice tea – I was literally amazed to taste such a flavorful Peach Ice Tea! The proportion of the ingredients and sweetness was just perfect. A dash of lemon made things even more interesting and gave that perfect tang to the Peachy sweetness. The stuff was overall very refreshing and of course served super-chilled to get full marks from my side. Must try!  

b) Sex on the beach – This was the second mocktail which was nice but honestly it was somewhat eclipsed by the awesomeness of the Peach Ice Tea. It was served in a tall glass with two distinct layers, the reddish orange hue at the base and transparent fizz on the top! The drink had orange juice, double soda and grenadine syrup mixed in it, it of course tasted sweet and with the fizz of the soda it was pretty refreshing as well.

FOOD

a) Veg lasagna – As we know, lasagna is a flat shaped pasta and here these lasagna sheets were simply amazing, they were very well baked and the layers were alternated with cheese, oregano, tomato, mushrooms, bell peppers, onion, garlic and sauces. The end result was having the perfect flavor with a subtle tang and was somewhat melting in the mouth. Must try!  

b) Chicken fajitas and Mexican rice – This overall dish had a dark orange hue and was politically supporting the ruling party at centre :) It was garnished with cilantro leaves on the Mexican rice which is basically a fluffy rice dish. Here the red short-grain rice is prepared with aromatic chicken broth, tomato sauce, cumin and a bit of chopped onions. Overall the rice tasted nice and went well with the fajitas. Fajita is a Mexican preparation that belongs to the Tex-mex cuisine for which we so often hit Chilies Restaurant! The chicken was very well cooked along with bell peppers and onions, corn, tomato, cheese, cream, and salsa. Overall the ingredients tasted great together and the chicken tasted quite fresh!  

c) Pepper corn chicken – Oh I loved these bouncy chicken cubes! They were stir fried with some typical pepper sauce but the real magic was surely there in the marination which made the meat so soft and bouncy. The pepper sauce gives the essence of freshly ground pepper which is pretty pleasant and very flavorful. It had red and green diced bell peppers in it along with chopped cilantro and dry herbs. The perfect combo of pepper sauce and herbs yet gain proves to be outstanding. Must try!  

d) Spaghetti aglio e olio – This dish was simply terrific and I am not exaggerating a bit. It is a traditional Italian pasta dish, originated in Napoli. The name of this dish actually means ‘spaghetti with garlic and oil’. And the dish here at Pied Piper was prepared in an orthodox fashion that impressed me to a great extent. It had the essence or sautéed pressed garlic and with some roughly cut dried red chili flakes. The oil that was extracted from the red chili and garlic mixed with the existing olive oil gave the perfect flavored oil for the spaghetti to get tossed. The final outcome was insanely good. I will surely be back to Pied Piper for this Spaghetti aglio e olio. It was served with grated parmesan cheese by the side, which is again bang on target since according to the traditional recipes of this dish the cheese should not be added to this spaghetti dish, it should be served separately. Full marks from my side. A Must try dish!     

So, in the end I found all these dishes were flawless and they couldn’t have been any better. I will surely recommend this place to my friends and family. Just one thing – here the service is also great to be very specific, which is very rare in most of the places around the city. They are super courteous, polite and helpful. I would only like the servers to be a bit for informed about the dishes. 

If you are around Ruby or Kasba area with your gang, then this is your place to be without any second thoughts. The place is young, quirky yet classy, lively and elegant. I am sure you will be loving it. If you are visiting this place please tag ‘foodie dada’ in your posts (in respective social media platforms), I would surely like to know your personal feedback on this place. If you like the post. please share it with your friends and give it a thumbs up. Till then, happy eating and happy blogging!

Cheers!

Pied Piper Cafe is an extension of Cheeni Kum restaurant & bar. A relatively new kid on the block this is actually the re-purposed roof terrace of the building which houses the lounge & restaurant in the ground floor. Contrary to some of the reviews this isn’t a roof-top cafe, though situated on the roof, whole of it is enclosed & no open air section is there. Recently our group was invited over for a meet over food & drinks here.

Its not a rooftop cafe first of all. Ordered cold coffee and lemon ice tea. The coffee was not cold and the ice tea didn't have any flavour of tea in it. Though after complaining they changed it. The service was good. An average place...
