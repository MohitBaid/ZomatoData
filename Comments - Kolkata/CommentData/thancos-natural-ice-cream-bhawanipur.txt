Do you love Ice Cream?then nothing is better than having Natural Ice Creams...and this place is one of the Ice Cream Parlors that serves natural ice cream in the city.
Though I'm very biased about Mumbai Naturals, Thanco's has changed my views a bit.
One evening me along with my foodie mates went to taste ice-creams and shakes from this place.
We had -
Mango Milk Shake : the mango ice cream that was used was made of pure alphonso mango.
Strawberry Milk Shake : It was a bit different in taste from the other strawberry milkshake that I had previously, as pure strawberries were used here.
Oreo Milk Shake : we all love Oreo biscuit..And to have it with chocolate milk shake is called pure sin.

Now I'm heading towards ice-creams that we had -
Tender Coconut : it was nice. But  some how to me, the tender coconut ice cream means getting coconut pieces in every gulp. But sorry to say, it was missing here.
Nolen Gur : Bangali and Nolen Gur means it's winter. So ice cream made with Nolen Gur was like heaven on the cup.
Guava : All we have raw guava but this was first time i had guava flavored ice cream with a bit salty taste
Gajjar ka Halwa : okay..this played as show stopper to me..I was feeling like having gajjar ka halwa in form of ice cream..it was so perfect.
GAADBAAD : it was their signature dish..this name means you can customise your own sundae with two scoops of your choice ice cream and one scoop of owner's choice ice cream.

Okay, now just check out the picture...and then do drop in and have ice cream..

Thank you team Thanco's for inviting Team Panch Phoron.

The ice creams are really good here. Just pure taste. But please do not order online from zomato. I had done so. By the time I got delivery, it was no longer ice cream, but melted cream.

Located in the bylanes of bhawanipore, near gaja park, this place was my target for quite a few months. Serving natural ice cream with flavours like Custard apple, jackfruit etc is still quite uncommon on the city. However, I was pretty disappointed upon my visit to the place. We visited during a summer evening and found the place deserted. After standing for 2-3 minutes, a guy came up and took our orders. Sitting arrangements are not present per se. Only two tools like those in MiO amore outlets are present. The staffs didn't have any clue about the flavours and their prices. The worst part was when we found out that they didn't even know how to use a debit card for payment. The amount of ice cream given for the price is also pretty small. And besides, the flavours also didn't turn to be half as good as we expected.

I suffer from a sensitive teeth condition,but that has never deterred me from having ice-cream.
Places like Thanco's convinces me all the time that my world will be incomplete without Ice-creams.
It would be on my top 5 list of Ice-creams at any point of time.
Don't miss out any flavour not even a single one.

Gastronomically satisfying is what I would say here. Interesting flavours of ice creams with decent pricing. Must try the chocolate flavours, they will make you super duper happy. Locating the place would be a bit tough so do make sure you have your google maps there to help you. The natural flavours like mango, coconut are good however the bubble gum one was a bit disappointing. But if you love ice creams then definitely you should try this one.

I visited this place yesterday after office with one of my friend.it was a recommendation by one of my office colleague and i must say it was worth visit this place.i had two flavors one was guava and one was tender coconut and i must say it was just amazing. Nvr thought that it could be this better the flavors of the ice creams were so good and so smooth that those were melting in mouth like magic. Luv to know that Kolkata is having such a nice ice cream shop like this..will visit this place again.

Small cool ice cream parlour.. located near Ganja park and just opposite of Gamers Paradise at Bhawanipur...great ambiance..the staff were very courteous and helpful..Had lots of variety in flavours...we ordered Oreo Brown (1 scoop) and Real Vanilla (1 scoop) sundae (₹ 190)and Alfanso mango milkshake (₹ 170)...both were tasted​ heavenly .. prices are pocket friendly (The prices are subject to change due to macro economic factors such as inflation, etc.)...They also provided some interesting selfie stickers to click pics...nice place to hangout with friends..

P.S. They​ accept only cash or Paytm..

Short and straight: Got more variety and is more reasonably priced than Pabrai's or Icy Fusion.
The natural ice creams soar. And they also provide smoothies and shakes.
This place is situated at the heart of Bhawanipur. Must Visit ✔
Watch out for- Belgian Chocolate Shake. 😍
Note: Ask them for the surprise scoop. (The taste will send chill down your throat for sure. )

Thanco's Natural Ice Cream - First outlet in the City of Joy.
=====
Location & Intro: 

It is located in 18 A, Ram Mohan Dutta Road. To be more precise, near Gamer's Paradise. 

Thanco's Natural Ice Cream has opened its first outlet in the city of Joy. The concept is selling natural ice creams. Pabrais has been the pioneer in the city of joy already. I was there in my other house when i decided to give it a visit with my small sisters. It is not a very big place but surely has made accommodations for their customers. 
=====
What i tried here: 

○ Guava Ice Cream - I tried the Guava Ice Cream which was nicely curated by the owner herself. It was great to taste. However, to my opinion, the chocolate stick should have not been added here and more of masala should have been added.  

○ Alphonso Milk Shake - The Milk Shake was great!! I am ardent lover of Alphonso. So, this is surely going to bring me back. Though, they don't use pure mango but natural ice cream for this which tastes similar.

I had been hearing a lot about their Belgian Chocolate. If you are a chocolate lover, i would surely recommend this as i saw repeat customers coming just for the Belgian Chocolate one. My small sisters took their ice cream.
=====
Meal for two: 300-500 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)
=====
Pros: 

○ Fresh Natural Ice Cream.
○ Have Variety of Shakes as well.
○ Decent seating arrangement and ambiance. 
○ Reasonably priced.
=====
Summary:

Presentation 3.8/5
Quality 4/5
Quantity 4/5
Taste 4/5
Hospitality 3.9/5
Ambiance 3.8/5
VFM 3.8/5
=====
Conclusion: They have amazing flavours like green chilli, anjeer almond, gulab jamun, choco gulkand and more. I might revisit here again. It was a good experience. 
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.
