It is a small kiosk beside Tea Junction in City centre, SaltLake. If you are a gola lover then this is the place to be. You can try the Kala Khatta gola but Pocket pinch is on the higher side.

Whenever I think about this place my childhood memories of having Gola comes in mind. Ola Gola was not there when I was in school. Back then people  used to buy it from Street vendors.
Definitely more hygienic, more presentable, more attractive than the previous version of selling golas. Worth the money. 
They have various kind of flavors, among the all kala khatta is my favorite. 
In this scorching summer Ola Gola can be a savior.

Ola gola has done the job of adding a modern tinge to  our good old favourite golas...there are numerous flavours - single as well as combos and most of them taste really good...i have tried 3 or 4 varieties and all of them were indeed friendly to the taste buds...it is kiosk located at the city centre 1 and they have a little app deal too, worth rs 60 for one gola, which is indeed pocket friendly....gola lovers should definitely try this out...

I would recommend :- Candygloss , 3 berries , choco vanity

Service is quick.

Tried Cola gola & Three  Berries which were quite refreshing and nice.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

The ice is crushed in the best way possible and the choice of syrup are amazing. 
One more thing liked is the taste which wont disappoint.  
Seatings are not there.  
Pocket pinch is little high.

There is something about gola that makes me happy. I am drawn to its simplicity. I am actually puzzled by the endless supply of constantly growing flavour options. Gola satisfy my soul. ‚ù§Ô∏è Brings my taste buds back to life. üòù Be it summers or winter for me gola never goes out of fashion. And this shop/stall located in city center 1 perfectly gives justice to the definition of gola.
You get all flavours from kala khata to kacchi kairi. Size is perfect and it taste so yum that one would wait till it melts completely. However I feel 70 bucks for one gola is overpriced. But a must try as the only rare shop which sells gola in winters too. üòä

The ice the main item in a gola makes all the difference here. The ice is crushed in best way, never saw ice being so soft. Choices of syrup's is also good, just I found syrup to be extra in my serving. Some seating arrangements was missed.

I just love their golas. In school days I was restricted from drinking golas. But this outlet saved the boy from distress. I had their mango gola and couldn't stop myself from having another one. They are clean, hygienic and are generous at pouring the syrup on the ice. Next time I will try all other flavors.

A small kiosk just before the tea junction . One pays 100rupees for baraf ka gola . The 90s kids know that  baraf ka golas or chuskis came for very cheap cost otherwise . The one which your mother will ask not to take because of its bad hygiene  . This place serves the same gola in a much hygienic way. But the taste doesn't match up . And 100rupees for ice. Are you kidding me ? I get the same in 20 rupees at the back of vip market , kakurgachi.

A small kiosk in city centres which serve baraf ka gola. All the kids of 90s would swear by it. They have a huge collection of flavours, ones which are not available generally are kept here. I genrally pick their pre combo flavours. They take time to serve the gola as they are generally crowded that's the only turnoff. The chocolate with coconut gola and triple berry is yummy.

A small counter at the City Center Salt Lake, just opposite to Wow Momos counter. A well lit counter, with Ola Gola beautifully written in colours. A colorful stall and it gives a happy feeling whenever I visit this Gola outlet. Golas has always been my favourite. This Evening I was out with a college friend of mine. After having some chocolates, we both wanted to have golas, and it being summers, golas are a real icy treat! I ordered a Gola with Rose Syrup (rose flavored) and my friend ordered a Kala Khatta. The Kala Khatta Gola was served with masala, and the Rose Gola, I preferred to be served without the masala that they add. The person who serves is a real happy person and very interactive with customers. Both the Golas had their individual flavours. Relished having the golas! And yes, I love the way and the flower shaped containers the golas are served in! Will soon be back to Ola Gola next time I visit City Centre. üòä

Move over khala khatta guys, Ola Gola is the place to choose a variety of kickass flavours and beat the increasing city heat. I have visited this place quite often and have tried a number of golas, such as chocolate, red rose and khus, etc. and despite having a sensitive stomach, I have never fallen sick. So those of you who love golas but are too afraid of street food, I can at least assure you that my experience has been devoid of any unfortunate stomach incidents. The prices here have risen steadily (it was only Rs. 40 for a snow gola a few years ago), but the quality remains intact. I would recommend you to try the combination of red rose + khus. It is the very best!

I LOVE golas! I have loved them ever since I had them for the first time in Ahmedabad! But the gola craving of mine rarely got satisfied in Kolkata, because there aren't many gola carts you see every day. Once I remember I had gola from a cart in front of Garia metro station and it was HORRIBLE, to say the least.¬†

Anyway, so obviously I had my eye on Ola Gola since quite some time! Today, finally I had the chance to taste their creation!¬†

At first, I was about to order a normal gola on a stick, the kind which is known as the conventional gola. However, just before ordering I saw a kid getting a cup full of huge icy goodness filled with syrup! When I asked, they said it's their snow cone version! So, obviously, I went for it!¬†

There were four of us, we ordered three snow cones - an orange one, a cola and a mixture of Kala Khatta and Khus. Each and every one of them was delicious! The quantity is quite a lot as well, I had to struggle to finish it! The fun part is, after a while, the ice starts to melt and you get sort of a slush, it tastes great! So gola and slush at the same price! :P¬†

The price was Rs. 70 each. I heard the normal price was Rs. 60, I don't know the reason for the increased price - whether it was tax, or because today was a special occasion (Bengali New Years) or whether simply because they have revised their price structure! Still, Rs. 70 per gola is a tad overpriced, I think. I understand it's within CC1, still.¬†

Overall, a long overdue wish fulfilled! I am happy! :)

My little sister enjoyed the gola there. The quantity was good as she took around 20 mins to slurpp it ip. Price was 60 Rs but considering its inside CC1 its understandable. I couldn't understand the flower shaped container. After all the ice is done, how do you empty the liquid. I asked for a straw but the guy did not have it, so took one from tea junction. Nice shop.

Though I was not a big fan of Gola before, this little place at ground floor of CC1 was an awesome surprise to my Gola experience. We ordered one Yellow Fantasy (lime and margarita combo) and one Kala khatta with orange combo. We liked the Kala khatta better, can't say the other one was bad though. It had this subtle sweet and sour flavour which we really liked until we tried the Kala-khatta.¬†

Nice experience, would love to try other flavours as well.

I love golas and if it is being served hygienically in a place like City Centre 1, I love it even more. I have tried their strawberry and the legendary "Kala-Khatta" flavours and they were both yummy! Even my mom loves this place! It made me happy to observe that the men at the counter always wore plastic gloves while preparing and serving Golas- something that I haven't seen in many reputed eateries like Gelato, South City. 

If i could recommend one thing to the owners, I'd suggest that they change the shape of the container in which they serve the golas. The flowery plastic design makes it difficult to drink the gola liquid once the ice has melted and the liquid has its own characteristic taste which should not be wasted.

If you compare the price with the road-side gola stall, it is definitely bit over-priced. But when you're at a mall, you should act like that atmosphere. I prefer snow gola over stick gola. & I like all the flavor... :)

From a long while I was thinking of tasting a gola from this stall, and recently it happened. This stall is located at the ground floor of salt lake city center, just beside Tea junction. They exclusively sell golas in various attractive colours and flavours. And you have option to test their golas, either with a stick (like stick ice-creams) or with a spoon (crushed ices with flavours, masala and syrups are given in a plastic bowl). ¬†I ate their fruit punch gola. but though in the menu card fruit punch is very colourful but mine came in a single colour. they spread some masala over it. It tasted nice. But I love gola so, I'll certainly like to try their other flavours. but frankly speaking I didn't like fruit-punch flavour. I want to try their cola flavour next and that also in a spoon and bowl manner.

As the tag line suggests : SLURPPPPPPP!! Whoa! What a refreshing change in this heat! Ola Gola makes me nostalgic! The super tasty sugary liquid upon a chunk of ice is such a treat! 
Ola Gola offers a wide range of flavours starting from blueberry to orange!  But being he traditional and conventional one I went for the Kala Khatta Flavour! This was the first time I tried their golas and I am supremely impressed with them! Made under hygienic conditions this place is here to stay! Would like them to open some more outlets! Wonderful!

I am in complete love with this place. All my usual visits to city centre needs initial cool down with their superb ice gola. I do like their snow more than the stick gola. My favourite flavours include mostly the tangy options likes, lime, blueberry, mango, pink lemonade, raspberry etc.Favourite combos are : Tiranga, Purple tongue and the best one Mango masti <3I feel Ola gola is the perfect summer destination !

Been here couple of times. Did not like the golas to be honest.
I would still prefer the gola walas at the road side places. Atleast they are worth it.

Location: Ground Floor, City Centre 1; Near The Tea Junction.

Three buddies who had been planning to meet since a long time, finally met today. After luncheon, they sat at the Kund stairs of City Centre enjoying the weather and the company.
Their tummies called for snacks and as an answer to which they walked amidst the blocks searching for snack-type options. After the light snack, the friends visited the two pre-decided kiosks for desserts!
And here they were at Ola Gola, a small kiosk which serves the traditional crushed-ice sticks (as all say: Gola/Chuski) with different flavors (the offer range is big including the current trendy ones such as bubblegum, blue raspberry, pina colada, mango, strawberry, berry blast, litchi, coconut, blueberry etc.), much more than the traditional ones (read: flavors like rose, khus, tiranga, kachhi kairi, kala khatta etc.) thanks to the growing popularity and the love for food people have, and, that too in a hygienic manner.
The friends ordered for the following:

- Blue Raspberry
With the right amount of raspberry syrup drizzled on top of the gola and a generous sprinkle of masala, this gola tasted good. Slightly sweet with a chatpata aftertaste of masala.
If you love raspberry, you should try it.

- Kala Khatta
Nostalgia made the friends order this.
Kala Khatta syrup with masala on the gola, tasted average. Something was missing! That was a dash of lemon juice (the counter lacked the same; lime syrup doesn't help either). Had it been there, the gola would have tasted just the same as the ones we get at the roadside push-carts.

‚Ä¢ Sad to hear that they do not have lemon juice. Wish lemon juice was available as a few flavors require a dash of it so as to become enjoyable.
‚Ä¢ The ice didn't seem to be unhealthy or hazardous to human health.
‚Ä¢ The presentation in an improvised glass was impressive.

The person at the counter was polite and served them promptly.
Prices, considering the quality, were slightly inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall a decent experience.
- If you do not love it in the stick form, you can opt for their cup option (snow gola) too.
- Could have been much better.

After the golas, the friends headed towards their last stop of the day where they could enjoy something chocolatey. :)

Back in the school days, our summer vacations were incomplete without local ice cream carts and baraf ka golas! Who can forget those yummy golas that we used to buy secretly despite of frequent warnings from our parents about cold and diarrhoea? Those golden days are now past but you can take a trip down memory lane if you visit Ola Gola in Salt Lake City Centre. Nostalgia surrounds this place even though it was not directly related to our childhood.

The people behind the small counter were friendly and courteous. One of them even clicked our group photos with golas in hand and he was sensible enough to request us for a second shot as he thought the first one got blurry. We are all humans and these small things matter.

There‚Äôs not much to write about crushed ice balls soaked in various flavours. Be it the traditional kachi kairi or our all time favourite mango, orange, pineapple and rainbow delight‚Ä¶ you would want to taste them all. They primarily offer snow golas and stick golas at reasonable prices. Go ahead and try it, you won't regret the visit.

I absolutely love the stick gola n d snow golas here. Reminds me of my chuski days in school. But this is ofcourse much more hygienic n tastier. The wide variety of the available flavours. Killer. I have had it innumerable times. N I love the berry blast. It strawberry, blueberry n blue raspberry. .I simply think this is the best combination.  U have the candy gum, rainbow, pina rita n tiranga. U r bound to love each n every flavour.

One of the more popular kiosks in city center on located bang opposite the Wills lifestyle store . Basically they deal in two types of ice desserts the very Indian CHUSKI or BARAF KA GOLA and the international shaved ice . Not much to write but they have many more flavors than your average baraf ka gola and the wonder  is slightly more hygienic.... 

the gola is delicious especially the Kala khatta and the blue one ( forgetting the name ) the black current is nice too 

lovely thing to have especially because they are using good quality syrups that wont harm children

On our way back today from lunch at City Centre, we came across this tiny kiosk beside Tea Junction called Snow Gola. Inquisitiveness attacked and we made our penguin steps towards it. :D
The menu is elaborate here given the fact that it just serves snow gola. There are two kinds available, on a stick and in a bowl. I always like my golas on stick and ordered for a kala khatta flavour randomly. I was absolutely impressed with the super hygienic glove exchanges without a doubt, on first making the gola and then while adding the syrup. Priced at 50 rupees per gola, it tasted really refreshing and nice. We almost had a tug of war in deciding who gets to have the gola first and especially drink the molten syrupy left over. Finally we shared. -_-
Last but not the least, I am definitely going to have a snow gola every time I visit City Centre from now on. Will definitely slowly and steadily try out all the flavours on board.
