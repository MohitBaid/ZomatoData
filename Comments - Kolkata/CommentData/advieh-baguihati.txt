Being biased by many positive reviews of this resturant I decided to try their food. I ordered "Chicken Hot-n-Sour Soup", "Fungi Fritti", "Vegetable Pulao" and "Kashmiri Gosht Rogan Josh" via swiggy. The disapoinment started from the very begining of the order. It took about 90 minutes to be delivered, I live only 2 km away from the restaurant. After recieving the foods, I discovered that instead of fungi fritti, which supposed to be a preparation of fried mushroom, they sent me some chopped fruit and two scoops of ice-cream. I dont know what was that and why they were sent to me. However, after complaining to swiggy, they refunded the money of that item. Rest of the items tasted very average to me considering the higher side of the price of this resturant. I have tasted much better quality of hot-n-sour soup at the nearly half price. Rogan josh was full of oil. The pulao was full of veggies and paneer, however, I expected better taste from it. Overall it was a very average experience, the price of the food was not justified here in my opinion.

Advieh is located at VIP road beside Big bazar. I'd been visited with my friends this Durga Puja (Panchami Night). First of all ambiance of this restaurant is very attractive and well decorated. They have lots of seating arrangement. At first we ordered 1. Orange Mojito, taste was good. 2. Signature as hard drinks. Then we ordered stater like 1. Murgh Anjare 2. Shredded Chicken. Both was very tasty and delicious. Atlast we ordered Main Course like 1. Murgh Tikka Tawa Masala 2. Chicken Butter Masala 3. Butter Naan 4. Masala Kulcha. Murgh tikka tawa masala was very delicious & other were very average taste. Price is reasonable and staff are well behaved

P.S:- Food service was very poor & too much late. Please improve your service quality

We went to this restaurant on the day of Bishwakarma Puja. The tables were all booked and we had to wait around 30 mins to find us a table. We ordered White Sauce Pasta which was really nice, Crispy Chicken with honey, Prawn cocktail, schzewan fish and noodles. The Prawn cocktail seemed pretty stale, the crispy chicken was okay okay type- have had tastier preparation of the same dish in other restaurants. The white sauce pasta was quite good, better than Afraa's or Chili's. An effort was made by the staff to compensate for the waiting time of 30 mins by offering a free fresh lime, but still the overall experience wasn't upto the mark.

The view from the restaurant is great- the hot and sour soup was really good. The morning buffet has something for everyone. The bar menu was limited but, it needs to stock up variety and build up an ambience to get tippers in the mood. Celesta has to be one of the best stopovers near the airport especially for those in transit and short stays.

My friend purchased a coupon for Lunch from the Little App and we visited here on a Sunday afternoon.. The place is near Raghunathpur's Big Bazar.. we didn't had any difficulty in finding the Hotel !
We reached about 12.30PM here.. We were served with unlimited Mocktails..  we took 1 sweet corn soup and 1 sweet  & sour soup AND Baby Corn as starters and the quantity was real good..
Coming to the main course we had manchurian and noodles and that too was more than sufficient for us !
Hot Gulab Jamun was served as the dessert !
Overall the food was not that much wow but yes, it was good in taste ! Quantity was more than enough !
The lady staff here was very friendly and she regularly asked me after serving that how was the food with a smile on her face ! I liked that !!
Nice ambience :)

@zomato you have written here that the restaurant Advieh has a full bar availability and you have also provided the bar menu. Unfortunately, there is currently no bar availability in there. Even, when I told them so, they said that they had already informed you about it, but you did not change it yet. So, there's a fault from your side. Please rectify this asap so that others don't face the same problem.
For this reason, we had to leave and head for another restaurant.

There's no option to give a 0 else would have given that. Bad and slow service. Quantity of food less than average. There was an offer of 2:1 on 100 pipers going on when we visited on 22nd April 2017. Bcos of bad service we decide to leave after drinks and a small portion of food. As we were in a hurry it completely skipped my eyes which later on I saw that they charged us even for the complimentary drink. We took twice the 2:1 offer on 100 pipers. So 4 out 6 30mls would be charged whereas they charged all 6. Bills attached. After quite some follow ups with Mr. Biswanath Kundu, still we were unable to get a refund neither got a credit note which could have been reimbursed later. Very unprofessional. Will not recommend anyone. Disappointed.

Randomly we have selected this restaurant to give it a try and believe me it turned out to be a very nice one. We have booked one chinese and one indian combo from Nearbuy. The ambience was really nice and modern. The staff were very attentive and courteous. Combos were great with two welcome drinks, one starter each, two main course with rice/naan for indian combo and fried rice/noodles for chinese one, ice cream or Gulabjamoon for dessert. The food was very tasty and more than one average person could eat and that too at a minimal price. This place is definitely recommended.

Lip smacking food...each item was delicious.started with chicken tikka kabab which was very soft and tasty.then came chicken bharta along with chicken butter masala and dal makhni.tasted great with soft naan and veg pulao.the aroma of fine grained pulao blew my mind.and yes the kiwi punch was a real punch but a sweet one.just one thing was that we had to wait long after ordering food ,may be for the huge rush that day but the food was steaming hot and lovely.

I had been out of Kolkata for a few years and this hotel looks like a classy addition to VIP Street. It was quite late for lunch but we managed to be just in time for lunch. Took some starters, fried rice, prawns and smoothie. Overall decent, ambience much better than some others in the localitysd

Editing the rating thanks to the stupidity of the staff during the second visit. Firstly, we were left to freeze despite requesting several times to increase the temperature, secondly starter was offered in the end. Most importantly, there was an offer where one mocktail was supposed to be offered complimentary if photos of the food was posted on zomato, however that offer was not provided.

This review is based on their buffet breakfast at advieh. The spread is decent , if not lavish from healthy options of cut fruits , sprouts, milk and cornflakes , flavoured curd . English breakfast menu includes french toast , boiled eggs or omlette , chicken salami , bread butter and jam , potato lyonnaise , baked beans , corn and spinach on toast . Indian menu comprising chola batura , panner paratha and gajar ka halwa. South indian cuisine could have been done better , the sambar was very sour , the uttapam and poha weren't as impressive as the others. Beverages included tea , coffee , mixed fruit juice and strawberry milk shake.The food was all very freshly prepared and the buffet was refilled continuously , the staff was attentive and very cooperative. The best part was the ambience, elegantly decorated fine dining restaurant with white floral and wooden interiors , eye catching ceiling work ,light musical instrumentals played in background , and nice collection of cutleries , i would definitely prefer a further visit on a dinner to enjoy the ambience of this place , which is the best in baguiati region.

One of the best restaurants in the location..
Beautiful interior, lovely ambiance spl mention for the instrumentals they played...
Visited on the occasion of Valentine's day with my Valentine and another couple,we had a coupon from nearby.
We had a table booked Ms Vaishakhi from guest relations courteously guided us ... A nice lady with lovely smile ... You are sure to feel comfortable.
Lovely buffet spread..with live pasta counter... All tastes were lovely..
Let downs according to the buffet spread.. 
Only two non-veg starter.
Very few non-veg item all together.
Cocktails were served too too slow.. and once also told that They were out of stock by one of the waiters but the same was served by the other ... That really was not expected..

It was last week only when we were running out of time for a dinner and thought to visit this place as I have never been before. We went around 9.45 pm and found that hardly 3 tables are occupied. When we entered, the waiter asks us about coupon details and I gently replied NO and if possible I can buy now. Then answer came as SORRY. Fine I know the reason. Without thinking twice I asked a beer and grilled prawn in starter. Though you can find many listed in beer list but you will get only the available one due to out of stocks. In the main course we opted mutton dum ghost with chapati(plain). Though chapati is not listed in the menu the waiter told he can arrange that for us. Well ...I asked about the price cz the naan's starts from RS 50 onwards so ..Then he went to the reception and came to us and told that it will be RS 20 per PC. Fine you can pay 20 bucks for a  plain roti ...With this ambience.  The starter was excellent with 7peices of prawns enough for two. The main course which we opted a vegetarian dish I.e dingri hara Chara piyaza basically mushroom with peas and onions..was tasteless. The mutton curry seems like the gravy is mixed after the mutton is boiled cz the raw smell of mutton was intact. Well we are that as they were perfectly boiled. When the bill comes it was 1500 including tax. While checking I came to know that the price  for chapati is Rs 35 per piece.OMG ..Are you kidding me. When I questioned about this three waiter's came with three different price as it is not mentioned in the menu. Finally some one told that in system it is printed as 35 so ...Huh..We paid the bill and come out .

Hi friends , this is my first review about an other state restaurant & their food. Im reviewin this restaurant based on my experience & my perspect.

I stayed in a nearby hotel kings crown. I came here one fine chill evening bywalk & i saw this restaurant by accident. I searched zomato about this restaurant & the ratings are too good . So , i decided to give it a try. As i reached  the reception they've directed me to the first floor. Once i reached the restaurant , i saw fine dressed barrers welcome me with a beautiful smile in their face. They directed me to the table & gave the restaurant & bar menu. Actually no one was there except me . 

I've first ordered a Beer for some energy as i was starving from the morning. Limited choice of Beers are only available. After a pint beer , i felt very comfortable & ordered a jumbo/king grill prawns as the starter. 
Jumbo / King grilled prawns :  they're perfectly jellied , firm yet soft , tender , briny king prawns. Totally 6 to 7 pieces in the plate with perfect texture. 

For Main food im a little confused to choose bread or rice. After Einie minnie i chose biryani for main food. It took 20mins to reach my table. 
Chicken biryani : rose water aroma from biryani induced my appetite even more. Biryani is not too spicy & its palatable. Total of 4 skinless tender chicken pieces are in the biryani which is dry & not marinated ( a little disappointment). Quantity & quality is fine. 

Overall i felt very comfortable dining in Advieh . Though its a little bit costly , worth the money you pay for their service & food. 

Bottomline : Restaurant is only for those who likes to spend money for Luxury & taste.

Got to know about the place online and thought of giving it a try. Located it with help of Maps , situated just before Bazaar Kolkata on VIP Road. Nicely lit and decorated Hotel cum Restaurant. Parking available at Hotel Gate. You get a excellent view of VIP Road from the restaurant.

We tried North Indian and Chinese.

Bharwan Aloo, Mushroom Masala and Paneer Labadar , Dal Makhani with Naan.

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Veg Hakka Noodles with Manchurian.

Taste wise dishes were fine.

Hospitality & Service was at its best.

Our hostess Vaishali( If I remember the name well) knew her job well .

All courses were served on time. Plates replaced without having asked for.

She continuously took feedback about food. When I mentioned that Dal Makhani should be Creamy, sweet and Spicy, she surprisingly brought a Fresh serving of Dal Makhani and insisted that we taste it and it was as I mentioned.

If you are looking for a fine dining experience at VIP road, visit this place.

By far the most classy, enchanting and glamorous place in Baguihati/VIP Road area. Not many people know about this restaurant since its location is not well known. It's located in VIP Road, the one that leads you to the Airport and it's just beside Big bazaar.
Ambience, lighting and decoration is simply stunning. It's huge and one won't face shortage of seating. Staffs treat you as guest and are very cooperating. Food is marvellous, touches your soul and satisfies your taste buds. My personal favourite is Dal Makhani. One can expect a subtle blend of perfect Indian flavours.
I have been here many times with my family and whenever guests come to our place we bring them to Celesta since they and we feel PRIDE to be here and compare to other grand restaurants, it's not at all high priced.

Hi friends , this is my first review about an other state restaurant & their food. Im reviewin this restaurant based on my experience & my perspect.

I stayed in a nearby hotel kings crown. I came here one fine chill evening bywalk & i saw this restaurant by accident. I searched zomato about this restaurant & the ratings are too good . So , i decided to give it a try. As i reached  the reception they've directed me to the first floor. Once i reached the restaurant , i saw fine dressed barrers welcome me with a beautiful smile in their face. They directed me to the table & gave the restaurant & bar menu. Actually no one was there except me . 

I've first ordered a Beer for some energy as i was starving from the morning. Limited choice of Beers are only available. After a pint beer , i felt very comfortable & ordered a jumbo/king grill prawns as the starter. 
Jumbo / King grilled prawns :  they're perfectly jellied , firm yet soft , tender , briny king prawns. Totally 6 to 7 pieces in the plate with perfect texture. 

For Main food im a little confused to choose bread or rice. After Einie minnie i chose biryani for main food. It took 20mins to reach my table. 
Chicken biryani : rose water aroma from biryani induced my appetite even more. Biryani is not too spicy & its palatable. Total of 4 skinless tender chicken pieces are in the biryani which is dry & not marinated ( a little disappointment). Quantity & quality is fine. 

Overall i felt very comfortable dining in Advieh . Though its a little bit costly , worth the money you pay for their service & food.

After having a pathetic experience @ desi kitchen we hopped in to Celesta. We had a good experience the attendant was very courteous and supportive. We ordered chicken corn soup which was a bit too sweet. followed by murgh malai kebab which was soft and sucullenr enough. For main course we had dal mizaaj which was not up to the mark.jeera rice was fine and dum ki gosht was the best main course, sucullenr mutton pieces simmered in rich curd and almond gravy.overall good experience..

Street Food Fiesta at Advieh, Hotel Celesta..!

If Calcutta and its people are synonymous with something, it is their love for Street Food and the passion and enthusiasm for Durga Puja. Well, we certainly had the latter not so while back, so why not enjoy a bit of the former to balance the scales up? Advieh, the premier restaurant located inside the magnificent and gorgeous looking Hotel Celesta is proudly celebrating the Street Food Festival upto the end of this month, to bring to their patrons a wide array of known and popular dishes, only to be prepared in a much healthy and served in a hygienic way.
                                                                ...

Celebrate Kolkata Street Food with Advieh, Celesta..!

Kolkata. The name itself beams culture of a different kind, which this city so proudly enthralls. It has an irresistible magic no other Indian city can compete with and when it comes to food, the magic only amplifies to another level! From snacks to sweet dishes, the list of delicacies is never-ending and they have never failed to impress anyone.

Serenaded by the constant stream of honking, foot traffic, and hawkers, there‚Äôs nothing better than biting into a tasty snack and washing it down with a clay cup of chai.

A drive into the air of nostalgia when your father would bring in

phulkopir singara while returning home from office or you could barely afford a casual dining restro with the negligible pocket money during the college days ‚Äì and a plate of chilli chicken and chowmein was the grandiosely relished during the lunch hours.
                                                                ...

Street food is soul food all year round. From tangy chutneys to spicy chilli chciken, street food comes in all shapes and sizes. If you are also a binge eater, drop by at Advieh, hotel Celesta, to be a part of their kolkata based Street Food Festival.¬†Located at baguihati, beside big bazaar, Advieh is a spacious restaurant with soothing interiors. The staff is courteous and the service is good.¬†
On their menu:
Papdi chaat- this is not your everyday papdi chaat that you find around the corners of streets, but an excellent one.¬†Ghugni- served with bhaja masala, tamarind chutney, lemon quarters and chopped green chilies, this particular will surely make you want more.
Mochar chop- an all time favourite bengali street food, the mochar chop stuffing was delicious. It is a must try and not to forget, do dip your chop in the kasundi.
Chicken noodles and chilli chicken- ¬†this has become more of a bengali combo than chinese. The noodles were good, the chicken was spicy and tangy.¬†
Luchi and kosha mangsho- this particular combo absolutely stole the show for me. The luchis were fluffy and the mutton was tender and cooked in a rich curry, that is why the name "kosha mangsho".
I'm sure no one would like to miss this gastronomic spread at Advieh. One must try and attend the street food festival which is from 20th to 31st October.

Still in the hangover of lipsmacking street while pandal hopping during Durga Puja? Drop by this gorgeous place at Baguihati where a Food Festival is being held which is dedicated to Kolkata style street food.
Things on offer are

Mocktail
Virgin Mojito-Very refreshing

Starters

‚Ä¢Papdi Chat-Very good.
‚Ä¢Ghugni-One of my favorite thing.It came with the necessary condiments too like bhaja masala,lemon quarters and chopped chillies.
‚Ä¢Mochar chop-It was amazing.The filling was adequate and tasteful.Went perfectly with kasundi
‚Ä¢Chicken noodles and Chilli chicken-The favourite roadside Chinese combo dish for Bengalis.They gave it a sophisticated touch by making the noodles and chicken of better quality and less oily.
‚Ä¢Luchi Mangsho-Which Bengali doesn't like this combination? The luchi was perfect and the mutton was cooked in a spicy gravy which I liked.

The festival is from 20th-31st of October.Head straight to Advieh-Hotel Celesta for this delicious Street Food spread.

Had checked it out carefully on zomato before stepping in, and yet all expectations were crossed. The food though affordable was sumptuous. The service was top class. And the most important piece, the ambience, it took our breathe away. If you are looking for a romantic place that doesn't put pressure on your wallet, this is it.

I'd booked a Nearbuy voucher for my birthday dinner with my family, so it came pretty cheap :) The restaurant is on the first floor of the hotel. The receptionist was a little surly in giving us directions. However, the restaurant itself is beautiful. The decor is lovely with lights that are neither too harsh nor too dark. The bar looks quite sophisticated.
The food was very good. Since I had a voucher for a 4-course Chinese meal, the menu was fixed, which included 1 mocktail, 1 soup, 1 starter , 1 main course with side dish and desert. Since we had 2 vouchers, we could choose 2 starters and 2 main course. The quantity might prove to be a little on the lesser side for those with a big appetite, but the taste was good! For desert, we were given the option of ice-cream or gulab jamun. The staff was quite polite and friendly. All in all a good experience. Pics on my Instagram account - @shradhanjalirai

Advieh is one of those places I will always remember for its classy decor, the royal ambience and the lip smacking dishes. Located quite a far distance from my place, I had to travel a long journey to reach my destination. But its worth the time and effort I had to put in. As you enter the place everything seems to look beautiful. The place has a royal touch in its decor. The white chandeliers, the beautiful drapes hanging from the ceiling, the beautiful bar section, everything complementing each other in the most perfect way. The service has been top notch to be precise. The staffs are attentive and have good knowledge about their work.
I went to this place in their Mango Festival and the experience was really one of its kind. The different varieties of dishes which I tasted made me fall for this place. The uniqueness of all the dishes is something which is commendable.
It all started with a "Kafir Lime Colada". It was just a perfect drink to quench your thirst after you come after a long journey. The drink was refreshing.
The "Mushroom Cappuccino" was the next item which was served and it was just too good to define. I loved the rich creamy mushroom flavour and the balance of the elements. A perfect soup for a mushroom lover. The "Mango Lettuce Salad with Ranch Dressing" was a eye pleasing item which was served. Beautiful bright colours with fresh ingredients. The "Aam Wali Mahi Tikki" and "Mango Spring Roll" was one of the unique items which I tried. I never thought that the flavour of mangoes would go so well with chicken. The balance of flavours in both the items where bang on making it one of the best of the afternoon. The "Pan Seared Fish with citrus Emulsion" and "Pullet Ala Pizzaiola" came next. Both the dishes had a really good presentation. One of the rare occasions when I didn't like the dish was the fish. It had a smell which I didn't like. The chicken was really good, well marinated and juicy.
To end the food affair we had "Mango Crepe Suzette¬†" which was just a perfect finish to the lovely meal. The balance of sweetness was near to perfect. It tasted amazing.

One of those places where I would love to go as I was impressed with all the departments. From ambience to food and the service, everything is worth the visit.
A 4/5 for this place.

Travelling several kilometers to a cityside fringe, specially on a scorching summer afternoon may not be a very pleasant experience to all. But if there is something awaiting for you, totally worth all your efforts, why not giving a second thought or rather look forward to it??!!
Such kind of a bliss happens to be in "Advieh" at Hotel Celesta, located right at Baguihati, beside Big Bazaar.

The moment you step inside, with the divine ambience and vibes of chilled fresh air welcoming you, instantly it absorbs all your stress and agony, and once you walk through the spiral staircase that leads to the dining/eating place, the pristine white chandeliers, the beautiful drapes hanging from the ceiling altogether creates an environment of palacial grandeur that not only makes you feel high in life, but also detach your body and soul from the daily chores to lose yourself in the world of a royal fantasy.

Till now, you must be wondering of how can be a place so beautiful and romantic at such a location like Baguihati, specially when the bustling VIP road is running bang adjacent to it. If such is the case, what can be adviced is to walk in and experience it live. And exactly that's the way, is decorated the dining area itself so as to exude a romantic charm which allows you to dig in to some mouth watering delicacies, with a hospitality alongside that resembles nothing less than a royal treatment that starts from a warm welcome, a chilled & fragranced wetroll to fresh you up, and obviously the right assistance to make you comfortable consistently till your entire stay.

And if you have a Mango Festival lined up, running in the restaurant, then the divine serenity reach its apex with this heavenly concoction. To start off with, nothing can be more refreshing that a welcome drink where a glass of "Kafir Lime Colada" can be a perfect choice anytime. And to gear up the appetite, a beautifully presented delicious "Mushroom Cappuccino" is surely one of a kind.
And how about some tasty tingling notes of freshly prepared "Mango Lettuce Salad with Ranch Dressing"?? Its Mango time, my dear readers!! And this is just the beginning which is followed by some delectably delightful bites of "Aam Wali Mahi Tikka", "Mango Spring Roll", "Pan Seared Fish with Citrous Emulsion" and "Poulet Ala Pizzailola" served along with 4 equally delicious mango dips, that can anyday ignite the passion of the Mango Festival that let your heart(and taste buds too) dance in Rhythm Divine. And why not ending a meal, or rather a celebration, sweet ended??!! Specially when there is some "Mango Crepe Suzette" waiting for you!!!
However, you are free to chose anything from the menu, the 'must have's as stated above cannot be missed anyway.

Fantasizing already??!! Now experience it live!!
Walk in at Advieh, and celebrate your passion for food, with a royal grandeur. And the best time to be here is during the Mango Festival, named "Mango Mausam".
Cheers!!

Thanks to

Then came the desserts, the Mango Crepe Suzette. The thin crepes had a sticky mango filling, were drizzled with mango sauce, and were served with a scoop of good, old vanilla ice-cream. It satisfied my sweet tooth without putting me on a sugar coma, and made for a dessert of my dreams.

The ambience and decor of this place is quite mesmerising I must say. I had not expected such a beautiful display of flowers. Moreover, the roof was quite innovative and it kept capturing my attemtion. Coming to the food, it was NICE. We had order a kabul tikka that was quite soft, had this grilled taste, in itself, and when served into the chutney melted into my mouth. For the main course we had we had paneer tikka lababdar along with masala kulcha, the teekha was totally balanced between the two. The butter naan and the sorted vegetables was equally tasty. But i was quite dissappointed with the white sauce penne pasta that we had ordered. It was plain and the taste of boiled veggies ruined my taste buds.
But overall it was a good experience with the staff so polite and service such commendable quality.
They took a bit more time to serve even when the restaurant seemed empty.
Anyways, I could consider visiting the palce again.:)

However, you are free to chose anything from the menu, the 'must have's as stated above cannot be missed anyway.

Fantasizing already??!! Now experience it live!!
Walk in at Advieh, and celebrate your passion for food, with a royal grandeur. And the best time to be here is during the Mango Festival, named "Mango Mausam".
Cheers!!

Thanks to

Wasnt aware that a lovely place like this existed 5 mins from baguihati.  Beautiful interiors,extremely courteous staff and very tasty and reasonable food. We always opt for park street or tengra for outings but advieh is definitely worth a try. Ill surely visit again ü§ò

Then came the desserts, the Mango Crepe Suzette. The thin crepes had a sticky mango filling, were drizzled with mango sauce, and were served with a scoop of good, old vanilla ice-cream. It satisfied my sweet tooth without putting me on a sugar coma, and made for a dessert of my dreams.
                                                                ...

The ambience and decor of this place is quite mesmerising I must say. I had not expected such a beautiful display of flowers. Moreover, the roof was quite innovative and it kept capturing my attemtion. Coming to the food, it was NICE. We had order a kabul tikka that was quite soft, had this grilled taste, in itself, and when served into the chutney melted into my mouth. For the main course we had we had paneer tikka lababdar along with masala kulcha, the teekha was totally balanced between the two. The butter naan and the sorted vegetables was equally tasty. But i was quite dissappointed with the white sauce penne pasta that we had ordered. It was plain and the taste of boiled veggies ruined my taste buds.
But overall it was a good experience with the staff so polite and service such commendable quality.
They took a bit more time to serve even when the restaurant seemed empty.
Anyways, I could consider visiting the palce again.:)

The name of this restaurant really fascinated me when I first heard of it. The word ‚ÄúAdvieh‚Äù means a mixture of spice, generally referring to Persian dishes. But don‚Äôt take that to be the case here, as it‚Äôs only in the name. The restaurant specialises in Continental, Chinese and North Indian cuisine, nowhere close to Persian.

After some online research, I found this place to be spectacularly well designed and a perfect model for a family dine-in. And within no time, I was at Hotel Celesta to check out this restaurant and its new found fame. It is located near Big Bazaar on Kazi Nazrul Islam main road just as you get down from VIP Road Flyover leading towards Kaikali.

At present there is some construction work going on right in front of the hotel which, in addition to the rains, has turned the fa√ßade and parking area into a muddy marsh. It does hamper the beauty of this place but is unavoidable. As the name of the hotel suggests, the interiors have been done according to white and serene theme, thus maintaining a celestial feel. The restaurant is on the 1st floor. A swirling staircase leads upwards and on the way you‚Äôll notice an impressive chandelier-style cloth threads hung from the ceiling. It looked so mesmerising; heavenly beauty. The d√©cor is also soothing. Large floral vases are set behind comfortable sofas giving a natural look. A bar is also attached with the dining area.

‚òÖ¬†¬†¬† Mango Crepe : This dessert was listed on their special menu for the ongoing Mango Festival here. These French crepes have a filling of mango extracts. A sweet mango sauce is poured all over which gives a tantalizing taste. However, my experience with this was a bit disappointing. One of the two portions wasn‚Äôt cooked properly as it was pretty raw. Plus there was a cherry topping instead of cubes of mango, which is not a part of the original recipe. So basically I paid for an inferior item.

The food is right up there with the greats when it comes to both quality and quantity. The ambience is gentle as well.
Just a bit disappointed with the dessert which leads to a 0.5 deduction. Otherwise a place which people should definitely try out.

One of the best experiences I had in recent times.

There are those times when you love what you are served at a restaurant and go back home, rubbing your belly delightfully and then there are those times you keep thinking about the food you had almost a week ago and cannot wait to go back for more. It is the latter kind of experience I had with Advieh. I visited the restaurant over their Mango Festival last week and have been luring for more, ever since.

Location & Interiors:

Hotel Celesta stands proud and beautiful, right on VIP road. While the road outside might be in a bit of a mess (thanks to all the Government‚Äôs construction work) the moment you step into the hotel, beautiful Ivory interiors greet you with such boom of class and style. The winding, wooden staircase on the right leading to the restaurant on the first floor is just a pleasure to look at. If you are with your gang, the staircase makes for the best place for selfies and groupfies.

The ceiling is adorned so cleverly with threaded chandeliers, with small spots of yellow lights peeping ever so slightly from here and there. The moment we stepped into the restaurant I and my fellow foodies were provided with cold napkins to soothe our skin that just escaped the blistering sun outside. A huge tick then and there.

The food:

You have to understand that I am writing this review with a wide grin on my face. The food is class apart and will urge you to go back for more with every single bite. The food tasting began with a Kafir Lime Colada and moved onto a wide range of very fine tasting food.

The Kafir lime colada-

The kafir lime and lime leaf fragrance infused beverage is such a refreshment after you step into this beautifully decorated restaurant from the scorching heat outside. The drink tastes fresh and is all about the lime and lemony flavour. Topped with a creamy lemon froth, this is the best drink to cleanse your palate and ready it for the upcoming meal.

Mushroom Cappuccino-

The Mushroom Cappuchino was served in cute, white cups and saucers. The soup was nice and smooth, rich in flavours, all this and yet not at all heavy on the tongue.

Mango Lettuce Salad with Ranch Dressing-

I am not much of a salad person. I would rather dedicate my appetite to real food (please do not judge me :P). But this Mango lettuce salad with ranch dressing was downright impressive. The chunks of mango in the salad were so ripe and sweet and the perfect complement to the freshly made ranch dressing. The fact that that the ranch is not store bought, made so much difference. I also went in for a second helping.

Aam Wali Mahi Tikka-

For starters we were served with a beautiful Aam Wali Mahi Tikka and a Mango Spring roll. The Fish tikka is a beautiful kebab marinated in complimentary and balanced spices and brushed with sweet mango pulp, once out of the tandoor. To be frank I was quite sceptical about the pairing of savory with ripe mangoes, but, who knew it would turn out so...so well.

Mango Spring Roll-

The mango spring roll was a combination of a few finely julienned root vegetables and raw mangoes, which were slightly sweated out on the frying pan before being stuffed and rolled in fine spring roll sheets and deep fried till crisp and golden brown. These teamed best with the various condiments and dips served on the table.

Pan seared fish with citrus emulsion-

Advieh stands true to delivering a fine dining experience with every bit of this dish and the other main that follows. The beautifully filleted fish is lightly pan seared with butter, some salt and pepper and was served with a base of mashed potatoes, veggies on the side and topped with a surprisingly good citrus emulsion. The fish according to me could use just another pinch of salt, but tasted great nonetheless.

Pullet ala Pizzaiola-

The chiken was again very impressive. It too came with sides, similar to that of the fish.

Mango Crepe Suzette-

The mango crepe suzette drew the dreamiest ending to a fine meal. Right from the crepe to the mango sauce, everything was rightly balanced, without giving into too much sweetness. The cubed mangoes on top were such a nice textural contrast to the rest of the dish, firm and sweet. The ice cream on the side was an added bonus.

I am utterly pleased with the food and the service and am looking forward to drop by again, soon.

On a sultry Sunday afternoon, I travelled 18 kilometers to reach Celesta hotel. Although Uber made sure my journey wasn‚Äôt a very tedious one, I don‚Äôt think anyone would complain about travelling, when the end destination is a Mango Festival!. I was greeted at the gate of Celesta by Mr Kuntal Bhattacharjee. Although the road outside the gate is currently on Work in Progress, the interiors is marvellous. From the cozy sofas, to the huge classy vase, to the gigantic stairway, everything spelled Glamourous.

Advieh was on my wish list for a long time! Was quite glad when our group of foodies and bloggers decided to meet up for lunch here. Right on VIP Road, easy to locate, the hotel stands tall. The only disadvantage is probably the heavy construction happening in front of the hotel thanks to the Government. They have however tried their best to ensure customers have no trouble parking or walking up to the hotel door. Doors open and brilliant decor, pristine white chandeliers, drapes, sofas greet you! My day's made already!!

A pretty, swirling staircase leads up to the restaurant. The restaurant is quite big! The sofas and the floral decoration mix perfectly. The chandeliers are done in sync to continue the subtle ambiance! I felt at home absolutely! To top it, the staff greeted us with smiles, offering us cold towels to quickly clean our hands before jumping onto the food!
The menu folded like a manuscript greeted us at the table. The menu was for an ongoing Mango Festival. The menu was in yellow! Crisp, to the point, precise menu. You know what to expect.

Moving onto the menu!

**Kafir Lime Colada**

The drink defines and re-defines itself. The freshness, the flavor, the froth, the mix, all in one- a great drink!!

**Mushroom Cappuccino**

Served like a cappuccino, in a coffee mug style soup bowl. The taste is something never tasted before! A bowl was not enough and will never be...:D

**Mango Lettuce Salad with Ranch Dressing**

An apt salad for a hot, humid day. The combination of sweet mango and lettuce with a lingering spicy after taste is an achievement not many restaurants can boast of!! And Advieh does that, admiringly!!

**Aam Wali Mahi Tikka

Always preferred meat over fish, until today. Need I say more? The fish was so, so soft. Impeccably cooked to perfection, the marination was cooked perfectly, and the combination of fish and mango. Finger lickingly good. I had to take a second helping, it seemed better and better with every bite.

**Mango Spring Roll**

A vegetarian spring roll but the mix of mango, with veggies with a perfect, thin coating was amazing!

**Pan Seared Fish with Citrus Emulsion**

The fish was coated with a tangy sauce. Mangoliciously yum!

**Poulet Ala Pizzaiola**

A chicken dish cooked in French style. Really good and filling.

**Dessert**

Mango Crepe Suzette: A mango crepe filled with a mango jam accompanied with a bowl of vanilla ice cream.

I honestly had only good things to write about, there was nothing negative about this place. And this view it seems was voiced by the rest of the diners who had dropped by on a Sunday! Keep serving such good food Advieh...all the best!

According to me these place deserves more appreciation then what it got till date...

These beautiful restaurant is situated in the 1st floor of Hotel Celesta, just beside KFC, Baguhati... The interior was just awesome... very beautifully decorated... the "jhar bati" just above the spiral stair was fully made of threads and also the ceiling is made of the same... the ambience was very cool and classy... 

All the staffs are very well trained an very courteous... each and every person are serving with a smile... they are so attentive that if they see a little uneasiness in you, immediately they starts to take care of that...

Coming to the food I went there to attain their ongoing Mango Festival named as...       "Mango Mausom"

So I started with...

#Mocktail#
‚ô° Kafir lime colada¬ª¬ª¬ª very refreshing... need to be served bit more chilled...

#Soup#
‚ô° Mushroom cappuccino¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent...

#Salad#
‚ô° Mango lettuce salad with ranch dressing¬ª¬ª¬ª Insane... the perfect combination of sweet and spiciness... a must try...

#Starter#
‚ô° Aam wali mahi tikka¬ª¬ª¬ª Just wow... the smell of mango gone perfect with the bhetki... and the fish was so fresh...

‚ô° Mango spring roll¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome... also a must try...

All these starters were served with 4 excellent Mango salsas...

#Main course#
‚òÖ Pan seared fish with citrus emulsion¬ª¬ª¬ª Good...
‚òÖ Pullet ala pizzaiola¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... it resembles pretty much like grilled chicken steak...

#Dessert#
‚ô° Mango crepe suzette¬ª¬ª¬ª Very good...

I should like to thank Mr. Ranjit Shaw, The Chief Chef for presenting such delicacies... and wish the whole "Advieh Team" a great success for the future...

I tried this restaurant as I was near big Bazar vip area.I had gone with limited expectations but I was pleasantly surprised by the nice decor of the restaurant. We had gone just for a casual dinner on a weekday, there was absolutely no rush, so we got all the attention from the staff. We had a Chinese meal. The manchow soup served was good. Chilly fish served was just about okay. We had garlic chicken and chilli garlic fried rice in main course, they were also okay, nothing very great but likeable. Overall with the ambience and staff, it was an enjoyable experience for me.

After seeing the reviews and rating of Advieh, it was a tough decision to take my friends there but definitely it turned out to be a great decision. Everything was perfect. Ambience, Food, Service. The ambience is very nice and it certainly looks a lot costlier than it actually is. The food is awesome. We had spring roll with spicy honey dip, Chili Garlic Noodles, Paneer Makhani, Nan, Pudina Paratha and none of them disappointed us. The service was very fast. Overall it was a very nice experience. I don't understand why people keep giving negative reviews about this place. It deserves a much better rating.

Is this Professionalism? Horrible experience...
We went around 9.15 pm to have our dinner . However, we were unable to have the prior reservation because the given number mentioned in the Nearbuy as the same number was switched off after trying for several times. 

So we tried to be as walk in guest and presented our Nearbuy voucher and ordered from the menu. The server took all the details and we categorically mentioned not to add any coriander in any of the menu items because to medical reason. After waiting for more than long 50 mins, chasing the server for en-number of times for our food, we finally got our main course and that to with coriander in all menu items of Dal and Curry. 

We had draw the attention to the senior in the restaurant, no one available and no regret from there end, as if we went on some free meal and begging for our food. The restaurant had a few other families and no attention to given to our preferences.  We just had to left without having our food.

Been to Advieh several times it exceeded my expectation every time. Located off VIP road.
The food is just a "wonder", especially the paila baishak buffet of Advieh was a remarkable event, with a large and authentic menu consisting of 'fish paturi' and 'mutton dackbanglow'.... A major down side is the service with need to be much prompt and crisp.
The overall experience is good but i expected the service to be bit promt

A new restaurant in the neighborhood is always an excuse for an outing.. But what happens when you find the entire experience horrible?
Anyway a good grand reception with courteous staff was a nice beginning. We ordered for continental with baked chicken foreisteir, spaghetti Alfredo, penne Alfredo n chicken clear soup for the child.
Serving time was more than half n hour, with a sparsely filled restaurant its kinda unacceptable..
Quantity was not justified to the cost..  A plate of spaghetti n a plate of penne was not sufficient for Two adults n a 4 year old kid. 
The chicken was overcooked n the mushroom sauce extremely sour. Worst it was not boneless. The mashed potato was good by the way.
The soup was ok.
Overall a grand looking restaurant with bad food.
Can't say bout the Indian cuisine though. It might be good.

Advieh is the restaurant @ Celesta hotels, situated near Baguihati Big bazaar. The restaurant is well decorated and maintained and has it's own bar also.
¬†A decent variety of items are available. Staff was¬†courteous, specially, the lady staff who attended us!.¬†However, service was somewhat slow - which did not matter much to us.¬†
We ordered tamatar dhania shorba which was very nice. For starters, we had Crispy babycorn as well as Panner Tikka with mint chutney - which were also good.

Their pudina parantha is just out of the world - crisp and thin! Dal makhani would have been nice - had high garlic content not ruined it. Paneer lababdar was nice but 
I believe it could have been much better. Peas pulao - again - was so tasty that I ate a substantial portion of it raw - without any daal or curry! For desserts, I had a rossogulla with chocolate¬†ice cream which was a nice combination!¬†

The restaurant is very tidy - not a single sign of dirt. Kudos to the management for well maintenance! Ambience of the place is nice with some soft English numbers playing in the background.¬†
Prices are not high! Overall, a nice experience and one can definitely try out this place!

Why the heck have these people opened a restaurant? A well decorated place filled up with dumbest people who don't even bother a bit about customers. Starters were undercooked. Raw smell of spices were coming out. God knows where they found their mocktails. I found it deadly to have a sip. Talking about main course, their buffet has only one chicken item, one fish item, veg fried rice and they call it non veg Indian buffet. Breads and chicken were definitely a day or two old. Bad behavior, worst food ever had. Don't ever bother visiting the place, it sucks. J

Seeing at the review I was bit worried about the food and service. But after having the food here I was very glad. Ambiance is very nice, food is very good. We had veg manchow soup which was very nice, fish finger was very nice as told by wife as I am a vegetarian. Fish was very fresh. Chicken fried and chilly chicken was also very nice. I am shocked to see such a poor review by other ppl.

When I entered the restaurant. .it some how gave me a good feeling ..an expectation that it will be good . But.. my expectations were shattered one by one. I attended a kitty party here. N so starting with tomato soup which was worst. The waiter forgot to give bread crumbs with it. I had to ask for it. The soup was so thick as have a tomato plup with spices. . Worst soup ever had. The food was again not upto the mark. We ordered for paneer tikka lababdaar. .which was too rich and oily . Then came dal makhani... which wasn't like authentic dal makhani .. it was spicy and no taste at all. Dal makhani is meant to be king of dals and here it wasn't like that at all. Followed with it was masala kulcha too oily ..ya at last taste was okay and veg fired rice which was still okay. The service was very poor ..extremely slow. Staff seems to be too confused. Not trained properly as in how to handle a big group and serve.
Extremely sorry everyone couldn't take photos of items due to some reasons.
I would think twice before visiting this place again. Other than interiors nothing was good.

One of the new additions to the long list of restaurants in VIP Road. I visited there on Mothers Day and was surprised that they had some special offers for the day. Soup was not up to the mark. The manager was quick to acknowledge that as well. Service was good and the staff courteous. This might just want me to visit this place again. P.S. They were still waiting for the license to serve alcohol. Not sure if that has changed now :)

there are many who might not be knowing about this place, and its hidden potential of what it can offer you.! this place is really close to my residence. went out with my close friend.  at first we were a little skeptical about the choice because we did not really hear much about this restaurant from anyone. let me tell you,  that the ambience is really soothing,and the interiors are chic and well designed.  we ordered Chinese, and it was good. the price is quite moderate and one can shell out some extra cash considering that this restaurant is newly created and is way better than so many at the same location. the staff was really cordial,  and my friend and I really had a nice time. Advieh is a place where you can spend some quality time with your friends and family and enjoy the best that this place has to offer. A must try for foodies who love to venture out to new outlets!!

Visited Advieh for dinner a few days back, because we wanted to try out some place new but close to us. The location is optimal, bang on VIP road, close to the airport, and hard to miss. Trust me, the decor and the ambience ALONE is enough for you to be absolutely mesmerized by this place. It is done up beautifully and the lighting complements the interiors. Kudos to the interior designer: they obviously know what they are doing.
Service is a bit slow, but courteous behaviour (almost) makes up for it. Alcohol is not served (or was not being served that day), so we ordered virgin Pina Coladas and Chicken Spring Rolls for starters. The Spring Rolls were delightful, crispy and fresh, and the Pina Colada ridiculously good. I could NOT have enough.
For the main course, my friend ordered the Chicken Lasagna. I chose butter naan and Chicken butter masala.¬† Both were good, but I've had better. The lasagna was good, lavishly spread with cheese, but since I only tasted it I cannot know how it fares as a full dish. My friend had difficulty finishing it.
Prices are on the higher side, though I cannot complain since I didn't pay. Overall, good experience. Advieh is one of those places just waiting to be discovered. Service needs to be faster though.

My experience at this place was simplistically great. To start with, the interiors will give you a calm feeling. Moving on, the behavior of the staff is friendly and they please you. Coming to the main point, which is food, order any dish here and you will get a unique flavor. I ordered 3 dishes here, the names of which were common, however the taste was simply delicious and stand-alone. Just one thing I didn't like here is the space of the table, its really small, the plates and dishes fight among themselves on the table as though they are competing against each other as to who will stay on the table, and who will get kicked out back to the kitchen ( :P). Well, overall, if you want to get a sophisticated feel, along with differently prepared ( in a positive way, though) you should try this place once.

Its one of the most over hyped place ive ever visited.. Afta reading the reviews in zomato.. Dnt know how people go there often.. The only thing i liked about the resturant is the behavior of the staff and the decor.. Its quite comfy inside.. But be careful the looks can decieve you.. The food is just too bad.. Nothing was fresh.. Except the pakaged water, the complimentary papad and the soft drink that was served to us by the resturant..  We had a chiken sizzler.. The chiken was smelly as if it was used after many days.. And it didnt even taste like a sizzler.. Then we had some fried chilli babycorn.. Dont remember the name correctly it was average.. Then we ordered Fung chicken as it was recommended by the waiter... We wanted it to be spicy.. So the guy told us that he would ask the chef to make it spicier.. As the preparation includes honey.. He told that he would ask the chef not to use honey as we wanted it to be spicy.. After waiting for about 35 mins(after being there for more than 1 and a half hour.. All we had was 2 dishes which werent tasty at all.. ) when we wre served fung chicken we couldnt even take more than 1bite.. And that was it.. I asked the waiter to parcel the chilli garlic noodles dat we ordered.. Though after reachng home when i tasted it .. it was yuukk.. Any local fast food joint i think would make better noodles than them.. It was simply waste of time and money.. Good decor are no good if the food isnt good at all.. They should improve the quality of service all the staff seemed very laid back.. And they take more than needed time for preparing 1 dish at a time.. Simply dissapointed.. Went there to celebrate friendship day and for getting a huge break in my career.. Had to return home without any kind of celebration.. Wont visit the place ever again...

I had visited here for 2 times..  When you will enter in Celesta, the welcomeing. Style will impress you.. The glass stairs between ground floor & 1 st floor Will give u another charm.. We know, only good food cannot make a restaurant AWESOME.. The interior design , behavior of the staff,  atmosphere of the restaurant, musics & room temperature are also plays a important role,,  AND those were perfect for the two time visit.. The white themes & interior design is very charming.. Room temperature was perfect.. The view from the 1 st floor glass wall was good.. Now if u ask for the FOOD.. It was just AWESOME.. The serving time, taste,quality, quantity. Was perfect.. I can bet u u will enjoy.. The foods are really mouth watering.. We had ordered FISH KABAB, LASAGNIA, NONVEG PASTA and a tasty honey desserts(forgot the actual name)... All foods are very tasty,. I can still feel the taste of the butter & cheese of pasta..  
Positive point: interior white theme, staff behavior, food
Negative point: not able to find ;-)

When I visited the place it was afternoon and I think it was open. I was with one of my friend and the moment we entered, I was amazed to see the way it looked. The white ambiance was just too good and still now as per decor I will rate he place as 'First'. Hop it will maintain the same throughout.

And now come to food we ordered Veg and they delivered the food in time and the quantity and quality was good. I don't remember the name but most probably 'Cheese Malai Kofta' was still in my mouth. The staffing as well as the gravy was a perfect combination and they complement each other real good.

Whenever I will back to Kolkata and have a option to go for food outside I will definitely go and try.

Also the greeting and the behaviour of the persons were at their best. Only thing I will wait for to see is that they continue the same without compomising anything.

Today I visited Celesta.
Celesta amazed me by its first look.Awsome dacor,beautiful ceiling,and I must say Its look very beautiful from outside as well.
Now let me tell you about the food...
Food is also good not great.
We had Tandoori Fish as starter,they surverd 6 pieces,It was huge as starter and then had pasta with creme sauce and the pasta was under cooked but tasted good.After having these two dishes we had to pack our third order that was chicken lasagna.The waiter offered us to taste the dish before packing, that was a nice gesture.
After ordering the food we had to wait for a long time.The music they were playing it was not going with the place.They shuld try some soft English romantic song.

As the price was resonable and the food was also good so I will come back  here for sure.....
