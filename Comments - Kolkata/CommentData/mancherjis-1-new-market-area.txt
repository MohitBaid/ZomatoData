A very small and basic eatery at Kyd Street, Mancherji's is perhaps the only restaurant in Kolkata that serves Parsi food. I came to know about this place through a blog and decided to.visit it. First impression wise, not too charming. Again, please note, on the rife this is predominantly, a hotel that mostly serves lunch to the nearby office goers. The Parsi menu is really limited and furthermore the items are not always available. The staffs are courteous no doubt, but hygiene wise Mancherji's needs a lot of improvement. The space is small, and the seating arrangement is at a mess. Foodwise, the taste is okay, but whatever we ordered were microwaved. Chicken Dhansak was nice.

The only place in Kolkata to serve Parsi food which felt like warm home-cooked meal. Location is on Kyd street, opposite national food laboratory, looks like a walk-in eatery, no fancy decor or ambience, just basic chair table and food. The owner was around when we entered the restaurant which has kept bengali food on its menu to cater to customers of this area, but on enquiring about parsi food, eggs akuri with chapati and chicken dhansak with brown rice was readily available. Food came in within 7-8mins while we chatted in bengali with the owner. As theres not much demand for parsi food and it requires different set of ingredients most of the Parsi delicacies are on a made to order basis like patra-ni-macchi, custard, chicken farcha etc. Anyway the food that arrived was almost dinner though we ordered at 7pm. Eggs akuri was yum combination of egg, tomato and onion and magic spices served with 2 chapatis. Mentioned magic spices as i just couldnt guess the spices used. While chicken dhansak was not a rich oily gravy served in most restaurants, but a very nice taste of finely ground spices, almost made me homesick. Must say both items were comfort food for soul and tummy :) Will drop by again and people should visit and try their cuisine. The service as well as interaction with owner was great.

This is a small pice hote,l serving regular Bengali cuisine, opposite the MLA hostel. Basic seating. The only reason for rating it so high is that they are currently the only restaurant in the city who serves Parsi food. The Parsi menu is short and over that not all items are available every day. But if you are in luck you will love the Dhanshak, Farcha or Lagan Nu Custard. Parsi food means eggs in everything and if you love eggs, do visit this place.

Mancherji is not a popular name in the city as because it's ab offbeat place where they serve you Bengali usual dishes and the main attraction is their persian food.

**Location**
On the bylane of Kyd Street. Just opposite to the MLA hostel. Kyf Street is the lane just beside the Indian museum.

**Experience**

Parsi food is their main delicacy cuisine in the offerings. Among that I recommend to try their 

Chicken dhanshak
Chicken Farcha

Also can try the Persian custard as well.

Also usual Bengali thalis are available here which is very generic and in snacks rolls are available.

It is not a fancy fine diner very basic and ordinary place to be very specific. Service is decent and likable. It should be marked as one of the offbeat places and hidden gems in the city.

Really disappointed that zomato covers such shabby places as well.. We were searching for authentic Bengali cuisine when read about it on zomato. Pathetic place even the food was bad. Zomato should not have such places on their portal

Various food blogs which boasted of this place for being probably the only restaurant in Kolkata which serves great parsi food I must say we were utterly disappointed when we finally checked out what the buzz was all about.This small,shabby outlet is located in Kyd street near the Indian Museum opposite to the MLA hostel.It also serves the usual bengali dishes because the parsi dishes failed to live upto their expectations.

The parsi menu consists of:

1.  Chicken farcha(fried chicken-Rs 50 per plate)

2. Egg Akuri (scrambled egg) with tawa roti-Rs 30

3. Chicken Dhansak with brown rice and kuchumber( a salad)-Rs 100

4. Saali murg-Rs 60

5. Lagan Nu custard- (if u didn't get this sweet dish then your journey to Mancherji's is totally wasted!!! because this is the only dish that will probably give you some consolation.)-Rs 50

When we first came across this menu we were all very excited however they soon died down when we finally had them.Unfortunately we didn't get to taste the 'saali murg' and the 'egg akuri' since we arrived there late in the evening and by that time these items were finished.
Chicken Dhansak is chicken cooked in a thick gravy which consists of various kinds of dals.It tasted very mild and ordinary.The only thing which did gave our taste buds something to enjoy was this beautiful custard.
Don't expect anything like some great fine dining experience.We went there because we were curious about parsi cuisine thats all! Oh another important information is that it is closed on Sundays.

Possibly the only restaurant in Calcutta that serves parsi food, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. Located in Kyd Street, it is what can be best described as a shack. However the food served (chicken dhanshak and farcha, along with some Laguna custard) is as authentic as it gets. Nothing extraordinary but certainly authentic. The meat was well cooked and served in good portions, and since I walked with no expectations, this was good enough to satisfy me. A word of caution - the custard has to be preordered and they'll deliver it the next day. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.

Of all the Indian cuisines, parsi cuisine is one of the most underrated one. Probably, this is due to the fact that the parsi population in India is slowly diminishing. However, there is a joint in Kyd street where we could find some authentic parsi dish. Its named after the owner ‘Mancherji’s”. The place is owned by a parsi gentleman and his family. But, the problem is, due to market demand, they’ve started making bengali regular dishes and makes parsi items only on request. So, we met there, made some prior appointments and started our journey into parsi cuisine. 

How to go and when to go: 

The formal address for this joint is 14, kyd street, near MLA hostel. If you start from the chowringhee towards kyd street, on your right will be the MLA hostel. Near to its gate no 2, there is an SBI ATM. Just opposite to that, lies Mancherji’s- a small shack. Its extremely easy to locate, provided you know what you’re looking for. 

Inside: 

Statutory warning: do not expect any of the fine dining experience here. You’ll see some plastic chairs and tables thrown around and the daily menu written on the white-board on the wall. You may start cursing me, because probably, all you can find is some bengali item’s names but behold- move a little down and you’ll find the items. You’re now allowed to rub your eyes again seeing the price. Yes, they’re that cheap, but not quality/ quantity-wise. Go ahead, gorge on them, eat your heart out- its difficult to cross 400/- per head for even a heavy-eater like me. 

The food: 

We asked the owners for their suggestion and we were offered a typical 6 course parsi meal.

The fist item was chicken farcha. Its basically a parsi version of KFC styled batter-fried chicken. One portion consists of one big piece (what else can you expect in 50/- ???) only its more on the softer side than the crunchier version. Wholesome, very very less spicy and was really a good start. 

The next item was Egg akuri with tawa roti. This egg akuri is the parsi version of scrambled egg. Only its more full-bodied with onion, tomato, coriander leaves and some indian spices. We had it with tawa roti, but I personally felt it would go better with some pav / buns. This item can be tried during the lunch time and will be a good choice.  

Kuchumber is a sharp, small diced parsi salad with cucumber, onion, tomato and green chilly and was promptly served next. Along with it we got brown rice. It was rice tossed with caramel water, bereshtah (sliced, deep brown fried onion) and garam masala (particularly cinnamon) and thus got its typical color. This brown rice is the standard accompaniment with the normal parsi dishes, as we were told.  

Next we got the main course of the day- chicken dhansak. This is a unique meat dish from the parsi kitchen. This is dal diced meat with 4 varieties of dal (arhar dal, chana dal, red musoor dal and brown musoor dal). Its typically flavored with with dhansak masala comprising of 15 masalas (kept secret) with ginger, garlic, coriander and mint leaves and green chilly. This is a heavy thick-gravy dish. Its normally cooked with mutton, but here, in mancherji’s they normally prepare it on every Saturday with chicken due to low-market-demand. Its very mild tasted, yet keeps its distinct flavor intact. Here, they give a full bowl of gravy and one good-sized meat piece. And, brown rice comes complementary with it- a complete meal.  

The second main course that we got was Sali Murg. Its normally a chicken dry curry cooked with apricot and covered with fried potato straws. In mancherji’s however, all we got was chicken kassa covered with potato straw and lacked the taste of apricot, which normally makes it distinct. The taste is still good.  

Its dessert time finally, and we got the dish of the day- Lagan Nu Custard. This is the normal egg custard with lots of dry fruits and nuts. Tastes heavenly and was the perfect ending of a good meal. Sadly, they don’t make this dish on a regular basis and prepares them on bulk order (min 10 no). This dish is a must-have in this place and not-to-be-missed.  

Final take: 

This joint prepares some good food but is poorly managed. They’ve succumbed to the market demand and started preparing bengali food than sticking to their original dishes. However, if one wants some parsi food in Kolkata, this is probably the only option. They can prepare other parsi delicacies also on request and confirmation and does outdoor-catering also. They can be reached on 9830254120. 

Cheers and bon apetite !!!
