Have been a regular to this joint for our weekly family dinner for last 10 years. Simple place, decent interiors, friendly owner and staff. Coming to the food, it is one of the authentic Cantonese style restaurants, where the owner's wife is in charge of the  kitchen. You need to know what u r ordering for.. our favourites are , kungpao pork- this is the star attraction, chilly shrimp, Singapore prawns, Cantonese rice ( one of the few restaurants in salt lake who serve this properly) . Wonder why the rating given to this place is so low, considering u don't get a place to sit in the family section on weekends after 8:30pm

An underrated escape for a peaceful evening. The laid back neighborhood is a big plus. Though it serves Chinese cuisine, but it's far away from being a specialty Chinese restaurant. The service is good, the environment is good (1st floor), the alcohol price is reasonable and the open smoking zone in the balcony with a view is by far the best that I've experienced.

First off all I m writing for this restaurant bcoz its safe for girls to hang out in the bar!  Family restaurant on the ground floor!  And bar is upstairs!  It's close to gc  Block Island Salt Lake!  I hve  Been visiting this place for almost 7 years!  If u wanted place to hv drinks at reasonable price and hv good food at the same time come to this place :)
As I always visit the bar I m gonna tell u the things that go well with drinks :)
1 : chicken spring roll 
2 : chicken pakora 
3 : drumstick 
5 : golden coin chicken 
By the way they serve heavy portions!  The price is a little higher according to drinks price but it's worth it!  
Basically it's place u can chill with yur friends nd hv fun at the same time :)

I have kinda discovered this place some 9 years back, with the help of a dear friend. Since then, I have fallen in love with it. Two floors. No fancy staff, just good food, cheaper alcohol and non-noisy ambience- good for thinkers and privateers. Over the years I have befriended waiters and some loner aging poets who were unsung and religiously made their poetic marks  on toiletries - paper napkins on a side table. As I hear, this is a genuine artifact imported from from China Town. Never regretted having been here. Better to be here with like-minded friends, likely not with family - else grumbles over comparisons would responsibly frustrate the mood! Just an advice from experience! üòÄ

This place has the look and feel of a China Town bar and restaurant. The alcohol served is a bit cheaper compared to other places in Salt lake. The food served is Chinese and there's nothing great worth mentioning. Its a place for people who love to drink and munch something at the same time. The service is kind of average. The chilly chicken is a signature item here and can be tried more than once. The pricing is reason the only thing that can help you in visiting this place.

Poor quality in almost everything. 
Dishes do not comply with the names. They tend to copy the names of popular dishes, and cook them up in their own style which is silly of course. 
The staff is good but the lady (who's probably the owner) is terribly adamant and arrogant.

This is situated somewhere in FD block,Salt Lake. D√©cor and ambience is ordinary. Looks like a house converted into a restaurant. Service is swift. We had Mixed Chowmein with Gravy. Since we took gravy noodles,we opted for the side dishes to be dry. Those dishes were Singaporean Chicken and Kung Pao Fish.
The chowmein was good. I liked the chicken and the fish was alright. Overall, decent food at pocket friendly prices.

Not too a popular joint in saltlake , we kind of discovered it on our own while driving through the lanes of sector three. The plus point is the cheap pricing of alcohol and relatively standard food at low rates. There was just one staff to attend all the tables but we got our orders without delay. The CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP was perfect , our pegs of bacardi white rum and cranberry breezer was complimented well by a plate of PRAWN CHIPS . CHICKEN NOODLES and KUNG PAO CHICKEN was okay , noodles being oily and had similarity with the one in street snacking counters. The gravy of the chicken dish was no where close to what it should be. But compiling everything with the bill , i would say its quite a nice place for budget boozing over food.

The second visit we had mixed french mushroom soup, chicken drumsticks, chicken noodles , chicken fried rice , singapore chicken , everything was average .

The place is situated in FB block in sector 3 saltlake. Still run by a chinese family , you can expect authentic chinese cuisine in Saltlake. Also Authentic Chinese on a budget. 

The staff is Indian , but the owners are a Chinese family who live upstairs.
The food is really good. Its not the Indianised Chinese but the chinese u expect to get at Tiretti Bazar or better still at China Town in Tangra. 

I was there with a friend and I had ordered the Suckling Pig, The Kung Pao Chicken and the Mixed Cantonese Noodles.

The food was awesome. The ambience was equally wonderful and friendly. The decor and interiors were good and spacious.

This was my second visit to this place. The forst time was in 2014. Will be visiting this place again sooner than later this time .

With a very homely environment and atmosphere Golden city comes up with serving chinese cuisines to their customers.

##Location:
At FB block very near to the Market area.

##Experience:
With a sloppy service and continuously downgraded food quality and taste this place is losing its old standard nowadays. Recently the customer base has also decreased as they are lagging in maintaining the taste specially the quality of raw materials have also become ordinary. Previously they used to be really good and have visited them quite a few times as well.I strongly recommend the management to look into this issues and buckle up.

Had a terrible experience many years back, when this restaurant had came up, and never really bothered to visit this place again. Located at FB Block, while you were going from FD Market towards GC Community Center, the food here was pathetic and the service was horrible. Since the midnight I had dropped in here, I had to suffer from food poisoning. The ambiance was not at all up to the mark and was more like Shaw's with a slightly modified surrounding. Even today, places like Silver Sands does much better.

Bought takeout of noodles and American chopsuey from here and after having them discarded the thought of actually eating out here inside the restaurant. It may look attractive from the inside or outside, but food is not so attractive to eat. Not a good option for Chinese food.

Visited this hotel as a part of an automotive group get together. Since ours was a big group, they had allocated one person to look after us, so cant really comment about the service speed on normal occassions.¬†
The food we were served was pretty good, contrary to the reviews on zomato. We tried chicken lollipop, chicken pakora, paneer pakora in starters. all the 3 were good. In the mains we had veg fried rice with chicken veg curry and a veg curry.¬†
The best item was the "Chicken in vegetables" curry. Ihope that was the name. We asked the staff about its name, but got further confused when he said that.
Other than the food, there is nothing much to look to in this place. The ambience/decor is depressing and has the look of a run down place. It could do with a bit of a facelift. The booze is pretty cheap thou!
Overall, an average experience

Prior to visiting this place I had a firm notion that any restaurant/bar in salt lake area cannot be "bad". I was wrong.....It was a sudden plan with my ofc colleagues and we dropped in over there. From the outside, the place look stunning with chinese dragon design in the gate and in the header where the name is writte. Audi, mercedes and many more high class cars are coming and dropping in for takeaway of food and bottles fron the off shop beside. Initially I had thought it to be nice but the moment I enetered the first floor, it was completely an 180¬∞ opposite story altogether...
Cons:
1. Pathetic service
2. Very poor interior decoration
3. Washroom and the bar itself is not cleaned and maintained properly
4. Tables and chairs are not that comfortable
5. In the off-shop adjacent, if you are buying drinks and paying with card, u have to bear a 2% extra charge if the amount is less than 1000 bucks. What kinda shitty logic is that?

Pros: or in other way the reason for putting a minimal of 2.5 rating for this place-
1. Food was nice, special mention chicken lollipop
2. Smoking zone is just in the balcony with a top view of the road sitting on thrown away soft drink crates made of plastics ‚ò∫‚ò∫
3. Rate is nominal than other places in salt lake

I have been goin there since childhood and i must say that the quality has gone down through the years. The ground floor is basically the family section and it is well done up while the first floor serves as the bar. The bar is a drab place and a bit dirty but this is the reason why this place is so famous(The alcohol rates are pretty cheap).  Its a good place to hang out with friends over a drink but not to take your family to. The food quality is not that good either.

I have been goin there since childhood and i must say that the quality has gone down through the years. The ground floor is basically the family section and it is well done up while the first floor serves as the bar. The bar is a drab place and a bit dirty but this is the reason why this place is so famous(The alcohol rates are pretty cheap).  Its a good place to hang out with friends over a drink but not to take your family to. The food quality is not that good either.

Golden City is a Chinese restaurant at Saltlake FD block. The restaurant has two divisions- a family restaurant on ground floor and a section at first floor which is more suitable for friends and is mainly the bar. The ambiance of the family restaurant on the ground floor looks good but the first floor arrangements are not so pleasant. On the first floor they have a smoking zone with a veranda h which is really cool.

The food is good and the prices are affordable. The chicken pakoda was the star of the day as it was perfectly cooked and very crunchy.

They also have an off shop outside the restaurant.

We were looking for a decent Chinese restaurant serving alcohol near FD Block in Salt lake when we came across this place and decided to give it a try.

This place is divided into two sections.The ground floor is mainly the family restaurant section and the first floor is mainly the bar.The decor is nice and simple.The seating arrangements could have been a bit more comfortable.The interiors are spacious and the tables are nicely spread apart from eachother.I liked the adjacent verandah on the first floor which they use as the smoking room.

The food is decent but nothing exceptional.The mixed chowmein was okayish.The chicken pakora was a bit too spicy for my liking.The bar is not that well stocked but the prices are reasonable.The prices of the drinks are lower than at other places.The prices of the food though is more or less at par with other chinese restaurants.

Overall I found this place to be just about okay.If you are looking for a moderately priced Chinese restaurant serving alcohol in and around the area then this might be worth a try.Otherwise there are other better options available.

Golden City used to be one of the very few restaurants in Salt Lake which served Chinese. I discovered the restaurant with some of my friends way back in 2000-2001. Ever since I have frequented this place several times including take always. 

Food wise, I found them quite authentic. My favourite here are the Lung Fung soup along with Fried Prawn Balls. I must mention here that the Fried Prawn balls no longer appear as big they used to be years back (whilst price going up). Gravy or Hakka noodles etc. are quite good here though the one that marvels me even today is their American Chopsuey. So far it's been one of the best American Chopsueys I've had in the town. 

Service has gone down over the years after they started to concentrate on their first-floor bar. As you guessed it, the restaurant turns to a cheap bar after 6 pm each evening, so less focus on the food. 

Still, a good place to have your Chinese if you're around FD/GC block in Salt Lake.

i have been visiting this restaurant since 2005 and have been there at least 50-60 times with my friends. basically they have 2 area - ground floor for family dining, 1st floor for having 'adda' with booze. never been to downstairs though :)

coming to ambiance, 1st floor is a big hall room with numerous tables, each is a seat for 4. tables are very close to each other, so no privacy at all. a very small tv is there which is almost impossible to view if you don't sit in front of it.

waiters are prompt to take order but they delay a lot to serve. they have a smoking room adjacent, which is a plus though.

bar menu is not elaborate. they carry mostly cheap brands. price is decent, in fact lower than other restaurants in vicinity.

coming to food, since it's a chinese restaurants, you'll see various chinese items, but trust me, almost all the items taste similar. singapore chicken, kung pao chicken, chilly chicken, thai chicken, ginger chicken, garlic chicken - everything is same preparation with different name. taste has deteriorated in past few years and food quality is very low now a days.

i no longer visit this restaurant/bar anymore due to low quality food and too much delay by the waiters. hence, no longer recommended to my friends.

Not on all Fridays you want to go out to fancy restaurants or pubs... There are days when you would love to grab a couple of drinks with a small company in a quieter place... Golden City is your best bet if you are in Salt Lake City... They are not at all fancy on foods... But I loved their prawn wafers. They serve those in decent quantity...and it goes wonderfully well with a bottle of beer.  Certainly not a place to go alone... With a crowd you might just give this place a fair 3...

Golden City is a small chinese bar and restaurant located at one of the quieter areas of Salt Lake.
It mainly serves for Home delivery for most of the blocks in salt lake.
The frequent people who visit are college groups or some office goers who want to sit and drink and have a good time.
A BP large peg at Rs.160 is quite decent. 650ml beers are also cheaper compared to a similar outlets at salt lake.
The ambience is not something outstanding and service could be irregular.
Chinese dishes are good. Starters like manchurian/garlic chicken has good no. of pieces.
The pricing of food is decent and economical.

Had been there a couple of times. The service is DAMN slow.
The bar has minimal furniture but strong AC with a special mention of the separate smoking room. We ordered for our drink along with ordered Kung Pao Chkn n Prawn Wafers.
The drink was served immediately. After 25-30mins, when our 1st drink was over and we called for repeat Prawn Wafer was served. Never knew serving Prawn Wafers took 1/2 an hour time. Kung Pao Chkn followed. Kung Pao Chkn was rock hard pcs of chkn fried in ample oil.
Prawn Wafer is a ready to eat commodity and hence cant be rated here. Kung Pao Chkn would score 2.5/5. Service people are pure slog and dont even respond when called. However they are super sensitive towards the tips you left. If they are not happy with what you left they are vocal to haggle for it. I have deducted 1 marks for it. However my visit to this bar was with some of my dearest n nearest people and I had enjoyed a lot at that bar inspite of super laggard service. Hence my score goes to 2.5 - 1 + 0.5 (for company). Net score 2/5

Suddenly had the urge of having lunch at this place. Parked my car, Came in and came out of the restaurant just now. No power, no power back up. No fans, no lights. Don't believe a restaurant can be managed at the heart of Salt Lake city without back up. Specially in this competitive market. ... NOTHING was working. Had to come out. Recommendation: What can I say... at your own risk.

Lets start off by saying that Golden City is a place where the cheap food and booze might look inviting but the cheapness of everything else is enough to drive you out.

It is just a large room filled with chairs, tables, and noisy (often drunk) people. Strictly not a family restaurant.
The waiters add to your fury. After a horrible service, one of them promptly came up and literally ordered us to give tips.

After everything else, their ray of hope is the mediocre and inexpensive food.
Suggestion : Opt for takeaway or home delivery.

I would highly NOT recommend this bar. First of all service is disastrous. We had to wait almost 15minutes to get even the menu.  Food quality is below par level with other restaurants in the same category. Food is almost tasteless. I would never make a return trip to this place ever again.

We have visited this outlet on a couple of occasions, the last being quite a few months ago. A large room, some filled with people here to drink is what welcomes you. The furniture is basic, the walls look bare and no where close to classy. The air-conditioning works :) All a little shabby, the decor, the atmosphere.

Food quality is strictly lower-middle level. Sometimes the oil would smell, such as in chopsuey. taste too was middling. Nothing extraordinary or anything worth mentioning. Just convenient when you do not wish to spend much money. Quantities were fair.

The food used to be relatively inexpensive. My neighbours say of late the price increase is substantial and the food quality too has fallen... become more Bengali-Chinese.

Try at your own risk!

one of the worst places in this part of the city, pretend to be a so called chinese or whatever restaurant. They should rename it to cheap bar & snacks joint and should place a signboard showing no 'FAMILY'. Service, food, bizzare mannered waiters and owners, horrible inside environment which will make you feel drained, non functional ac's and so on. Avoid it totally. Do not let them spoil your mood.

I've been here a couple of times...both times with my family. Not an easy place to reach without your own means of transport. 

I was put off by the ambience, a lot of heavy drinkers..and I've got some unwelcome stares...which is pretty off putting. Booze is cheap and the variety is nice, Do NOT expect good quality cocktails or mock-tails here(if at all).

the food can be rated as average INDIAN Chinese. Not the authentic stuff at chinoserie, MC or even HAKA (Salt lake). Sometimes I like my Indian Chinese as some sort of soul food...the oiliness and grease makes up for bad days. Might be weird, but on such days I've turned to this small little place.  On the days when dressing up and going to the nearest trendy place seems a torture and yet you want to throw on a pair of jeans, and go out for a bite in the cool nights‚Ä¶on those evenings, I would suggest this place‚Ä¶especially if you are near about salt lake.

The decor is ABYSMAL. Really. The insides look like somebody's house  with some tables and chairs thrown in. it looks like the furniture can be moved around to facilitate cleaning or if the police comes calling!! I know it sounds melodramatic, but the insides of this place always makes me feel like I am sitting in some shoddy mafia den :P not a good place to go with anyone, leave alone family. 

Coming back to food, as I mentioned it‚Äôs the Indian Chinese place so the usual golden fried prawns, chicken drumsticks, chilli chicken (dry or gravy), hakka noodles and chicken fried rice are tasty, crisp and filling. The portions are good and the quality of proteins did not give me anything to complain about. I wish the rice they used to make the fried rice was a little better quality. The soup we had, chicken sweet corn ,was also okay. I have never suffered a bout of tummy ache after eating at this place, so I guess the kitchen is not as shoddy as the front of this place. *fingers crossed*

Prices are ok.. About 1300 for 4 people..including starters, a beer, cold drinks, and taxes.. I would say on the cheaper side.

I'm rating it an average because it satisfies my Indian Chinese cravings but the atmosphere of the place pushes me to desperation. I would suggest takeaway if you want to eat stuff from this place, if at all.

Golden City is one of the places I know in Salt Lake Sector III area near to my workplace that serve alcohol. The drinks they serve are decent enough to sit and enjoy with friends. Prices are okay as well. And the place is quite leisurely and calm, being quite away from the hustle bustle, and I like it for that.It is just beside the FD local market near FD park and Bidhannagar Municipality office. But personally I believe that this joint can do much better if they improve on the food quality because I felt they are bit low on that. Also, the place can do with some changes since the interior does not really match that of a bar-cum-restaurant because when I had been there previously, it wore a look of a conventional house in Salt Lake area. So I guess, with little bit of improvement on the ambiance and the quality of the main food dishes, this outlet can score much high in the minds of the target customers.

Located in heart of Salt Lake, difficult though to locate for people not living in Salt Lake. It has two floors. The ground floor is more of a formal setup while the 1st floor is for stags/groups (male). The 1st floor is not upto the mark, too dim and loud crowd. The ground floor is far better and you can atmosphere is totally different. 
Regarding service its pretty good. Alchohol is cheap, food is quite good, given the price. Quantity and Quality is excellent.
They have option for take away as well.

I give this a 3.5 only because it is very convinient to order from a place within walking distance from my home. That does not mean I would advise you to go and eat there because the place is more of a bar than a restaurant. Earlier only one floor was a bar but now due to the rush both the floors have been converted to a bar. The food is alright. I happen to love their noodles (again chicken hakka) and I like their garlic chicken. Chilli chicken is just okay while sweet and sour chicken is something I do not like in general and not necessarily int his place. I suggest you stay away from the Dragon Chicken because it is not good to taste.

So ambience-wise it is pathetic but taste-wise it is alright. Price-wise it is good but for me location is of prime importance.

Drinks are almost everything available and the cost is very pleasant. Just for easy hangout type place and bit homely type. For the ocst and starter my rating is 3.5.

One of the place i hate going to . The ambiance is weird and it looks like a house from inside and that to a very disorganized one , The lighting is not adequate. Its located right next to the local market in FD block and the only reason they do business is because its one of the places that serves decent alcohol. 

Kolkata has a tendency to frequent restaurants and that's probably the only reason they are in business. Nut they just make below average food. The chili chicken is horrible and I detest green peas in my soup . They make bu far the worst tom yum and chili chicken I have ever eaten. 

The service is awfully slow and they don't really have any sense of customer service .

this is a place where both, group visiting to spend their evening with drinks n good snacks to ppl going for mainly food, come.
Pros :
1. Snacks taste good
2. Price is moderate (compared to the fact that its inside Saltlake)
3. Drinks are available n not much over-priced
4. Spacious

Cons :
1. Service is slow
2. Location is very very Odd (hard to reach if U r not having ur own vehicle n not aware of the exact location!!!)
3. Ambience is more of a Bar than family restaurant.

Can visit if U r at that part of saltlake n going wth your frnds.

I have been ordering food from this place almost from its inception. Its right beside my house. So lets get into a bit of history to see how this place turned out the way it is.

Golden City (popularly known as 'Sonar Sohor') started of as purely a family restaurant without a bar license. The food was pretty good and almost reminded you of the Chinese food from China Town. But the restaurant per say was nothing great. I mean it was just a bunch of tables and chairs with waiters who were least interested in serving you. So going there to eat practically made no sense but since the food was good ordering in made a lot of sense. Few years later, GC acquired a bar license and opened up a cheap bar on the first floor. This part of the business was a roaring success. So much so that GC now retails booze from a small shop in its garage. As things panned out, the bar became the predominant feature of the place and its a place where you should go only with you friends. No family please. However if you are in close vicinity to this place, then you should get the food delivered home. The food is really decent, a bit on the expensive side, but worth it none the less. Unfortunately they decided to discontinue the crab dishes which were brilliant. More or less they make all the items on the menu quite nice. So order food from Sonar Sohor to get a flavor of China Town in Salt Lake

This has been a regular pujo-time hangout for my friends and me. The fact that it's a bar-cum-restaurant with really cheap prices makes it a thumbs-up for guy gangs who just want to have a fun lunch with drinks for everyone to add to the cheer. The Chinese food here is pretty decent too, with good amounts for the price of each dish. While I wouldn't say this is the best family dinner destination, this is a very comfortable visit for friends.....n no, this is not a rundown, shabby place either. So there.

Why there is  no review here? OMG!!!! This is the place everyone visits, none cares to write a review? Its more Bar than Rest. but i would beg to differ that it provides good food too. U may not be happy with location, ambience etc.  But when food served its all fine to have. Anyway pricing is perfect. Its almost always crowded, i do not know whr the people come from. Mostly office people, while going back home , get their food from here or prefer to have one/two peg being here. My most nearby bar cum rest. :)
