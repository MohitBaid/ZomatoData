Went there last evening with family. Enjoyed the ambience and the hospitality. Excellent kebabs, bhetki tandoori and prawn!!! Good appetizers and main course. Desserts have a scope of improvement.

Never understood why people would hype about this place. 

Because they only aced the decor, their food and service was pretty poor. 

And the food was overpriced too. And the cutlery were shaped like that of a branch but it was difficult using.

Today had buffet @machaan.it is a theme restaurant..Very nice ambience..stuffs were vry friendly and co-operative.In buffet we had starters like chicken wrapper,mutton kabab, prawn, fish ,chkn kabab etc..All of the starters specially the prawn was awesome. Next in main course they have chicken biriyani that was very average in taste, crab , fish,chicken etc..In deserts gulab jamun,cake,firni,fruits etc..Bt no variations in ice cream..There was only vanilla ice cream..Nothing to add with it. Overall experience was quite good. Quality and taste of starter items are really good..Bt they should add variations and increase taste quality in deserts and main course.

Machaan is a renowned cousin brand of Mainland China & Oh Calcutta!, And they do justify the brand value. We visited the place for lunch on a Sunday. Though the buffet was available, but we choose to had ala carte.

It is a jungle themed restaurant. lots of tree, animals and theme music made the place amazing.
Seating was nice and comfortable, on a Sunday afternoon, we got seats easily without prior reservation.

We had tandoori platter, contains 3ps of each (Chicken, Fish, Mutton Sheekh Kebab & Prawn).
They prepared the kebab soft, juicy, tasty and flavourful.

Then the next was Chicken Biriyani. One pot is more than sufficient for two person. First they served one cold pot of Biriyani, after the complain they immediately changed the plate and gave us a fresh plate. But this time the pieces were not good. They were hard, less meaty, tasteless. But the rice was good and tasty. They served north indian style biriyani, not the kolkata style with aloo, but we liked the taste.

They served us two glasses of cold drinks as complimentary, as a token of apologies.

We had a mixed reviews about this place.

Again another excellent restaurant, much avoided by most of the food bloggers. Machaan, situated at the top floor of Mani Square Mall, possesses the superb excellency to claim the top 5 position among Kolkata's north indian food joints. The ambience, the hospitality, and the taste of every menu is just superb here. If you ever come here, please don't forget to taste the chef's special dish for that day.

Hosted a birthday party for my 5 yr son yesterday. The decoration arrangement made by Machaan was good and aligned with their jungle theme. Food was delicious right from starters to deserts. The cover of buffet is vast which I feel not possible for single person to consume but nevertheless it was treat for everyone's tongue. Staff was very courteous and supportive especially Mr. Debasish. 

Overall a superb experience of the Jungle along with sumptuous buffet.

If you are thinking of indulging yourself into a north Indian cuisine which won't pinch your pocket a lot, then this place is probably your weekend go-to restaurant.This jungle themed restaurant is pretty interesting and serves decent food items. I liked their starters and main course.Even though the service was tad slow, the staff members were very courteous.Overall a nice experience. Nothing much hyped about.

They have finally started a full fledged buffet and I am glad to tell that it's not very expensive! Infact it's around Rs.600 including tax.
This jungle/ tribal themed restaurant served very regular food, i.e, kebabs for starters and biriyani and roti and other chicken/fish/mutton/prawn dishes for main course! If a comparison is drawn then I would say the ambiance is better than the food.
Food was not bad but I would say it could improve a lot. But I will add that they do serve alot in the given price.

Yesterday we had been to this place for lunch. They have both buffet and ala carte options in the lunch.We opted for the BUFFET.

As soon as we entered there , we discovered ourselves in the midst of a DENSE FOREST with an ELEPHANT standing on our right. We carefully dodged him and entered further deep into the JUNGLE. It was surrounded by trees. Birds chirping sound could be heard from those tree tops. Suddenly we discovered a TREE HOUSE. What an idea !! Without any delay we chose to have our seat in the TREE HOUSE. Truly wonderful ambience. A wonderful experience for us as well. They probably have the best ambience in town.

Coming to the food, the buffet menu consists of-

1. ONION SALAD
2. PAPAD.
3. CHICKEN KEBAB.
4. MUTTON KEBAB.
5. CHICKEN SOUP.
6. TANDOORI ROTI.
7. NAN.
8. MASALA KULCHA.
9. DHANIA CHICKEN.
10. MIX VEGETABLE.
11. PEAS PULAO.
12. DAL.
13. GULAB JAMUN.
14. ICE CREAM.

Other than these we had ordered Two FRESH LIME SODA for which we had to pay separately.
Of these we mainly liked the starter items and the deserts. We were almost full after having the starters only. In the main course, I would only mention the DHANIA CHICKEN. The rest were pretty average. 0.5 points deducted for this average main course.

Lastly I would like to mention about our attendant, Mr. Hussain, a smart charming guy, who made the experience far better for us. Keep it up man !!

A must awaited visit..this is a nice and cozy family place.The decor and the ambience was super.It was a sunday night but we dnt have to wait for more than five minute and there was no table booking system.

We ordered tandoori kabab platter in consists four type of kabab each of three pieces and the fish kabab was totally mouth melting.

Positive point
1.Always go for masala kulcha.
2.Mutton roganjosh(motton was slightly stiff)
3.chicken dhaniya.

Negative point.
1.The beverage will pinch your pocket a lot.
2.And the rice section is not up to the mark it is very poor..
We tested chicken biriyani it's too much aromatic...
3.The service is very slow.

In over all experience 7/10

Visited this place few days back. It's quite enormous and well decorated. The jungle like theme is  preetified  by the tree house like seating arrangements and the shadowish environment. The staffs are gentle and efficient, their service was prompt. We had Raan- E- maachan, plain naan, chilli onion kulcha,multani paratha and beer(they ran out of Budweiser, so we had Kingfisher ultra). We asked the person who waited our table to suggest some non-veg item to have with breads, and we got Raan- E- maachan which was delicious. It was more than enough for two and price was reasonable too. The breads were tender and kulcha was quite good. They served roasted papad and masala onion with beer and we loved that. They provided sauces and pickles  The sweet one(pickle) was too good. Would love to visit again!

Perhaps my least favourite restaurant in the city. We were a people of four, order mutton raan kabab and chicken dhuandar kabab along with a pitcher of orange juice. The mutton raan tasted burnt, the chicken dhuandar fell short by miles upto to its name and was average. Pitcher had barely enough juice of four of us. Lighting was too dim and when asked the waiters for some better arrangement they appeared helpless as that was the theem of the restaurant. We were so dissapointed with this restaurant that we decided to call it a day there and asked for the bill. It costed around 1600 for those 3 paltry portions. So no need to mention that the price is on the way higher side for the quality of food that they were serving then. The staffs over there well well behaved and couteous but that wasnt enough to convince us to stay there any longer.
I doubt if I would ever visit this place again.

Went there to have food ... but was dissapointed with the lack of varieties of continental dishes. All you get is rotis and complementary dishes. In short, indian dishes. The food was good but the atmosphere is too dark for my taste. Yes they are trying to make up a forest like ambience but it was really dark .You cant take a decent selfie without flash. and the place was super quiet. We went at 10pm and the place was empty as hell. Gave the rating based on the food which was average. The staff was super friendly.

Visited this place with my colleagues. The interior resembles a jungle place which i found very cool. Dim lights wooden chairs and even their cutleries were so designed to add on to an adventurous feel to their visitors. Coming to the food quality and variety they do not serve huge variety and the food quality is not bad. Indian Cuisine throughout the menu. But yes freshly made server right from the oven along with the look and feel of the restaurant its a good place to visit with family and friends. Kids will love this place considering their interiors.

Today we visited Machaan and had a lovely experience here.
The interior is really beautiful with trees,dim lights and sounds of tribal music and birds is mesmerising.
Coming to the food,we had a set meal each which consists of-
•Starters-Dhania Murgh shorba,Tandoori Murg,Mutton seekh and papad rolls and onion salad in starter section.I totally loved the kebabs especially the mutton seekh.I had it a several times here.The soup though was nkt upto the mark.

•Maincourse-It had two options of rice.I took a peas pulao and

Went for a group get to gether in mani square objective was to sit and talk in a lounge like place with decent music. Mani Square Mall was a bad idea in the first place. Hopipola is a good place to party but the music was too loud for us so we finalised upon Machaan. Seating was not too comfortable but the staff was helpful.
Then we ordered drinks which was a bit pinch on pocket. Then the starters and a little main course finished with deserts.
Non Veg Platter was a good investment. The Mutton seekh kebab, fish fry & chicken Reshmi kebab was tasty. The tiger prawn in the platter seemed to be out of place. Also it lacked flavour. It didn’t delight me at all even though I love prawns.
We were served with complimentary papads which was good. Then there was tandoori broccoli and mushroom, both of which were creamy cheese based but the were tasty indeed.
We all loved the starters. Most of it.
We didn’t have much appetite of main course so we ordered a veg pulao, a machaan special dal and a Mutton rogan josh. All of them were tasty indeed.
The desert comprised of Malpua which tasted like a flat Gulab jamun. But then it was as tasty as gulab jamun.

The cons are:
The started menu was really limited.
They didn’t have peanut Masala or French fries to accompany with the drinks.
The lighting was definitely an issue. It wasn’t sufficient enough.
Pinch on pocket. 

The ambience was as desired.
We also ordered Masala Dids which was really thirst quenching type.
The chutney and papaya murabba were accompanied with the food which were continuously refilled. So that was a commendable job from the staff.
Never the less there was no delight factor and hence the deductions.

Signing Off.

This falls under the theme restaurant and it has a jungle theme like all the other machaan outlets but this one according is comparatively the biggest. The staff are friendly and takes care of your needs properly and the food tastes good but the reason for me to curb down the rating is the price which according to me is really high in comparison to the portions given...otherwise you can have a enjoyable relaxing dinner/lunch. :)

Although near my house,  I never quite managed to visit Machaan earlier.  Somehow or the other, the visit was waived off. It was only last Saturday that I managed to visit.  And let me honest and say,  I was truly transported to another dimension.  One of the best themed restaurants in Kolkata as they go hy,  this place is.  I left myself in an exotic jungle.  The music,  the decor,  the set up etc etc.  Mind-blowing!! 
Now coming to the food- it was delicious. From mocktails,  to the kebab patter, roti katori,  mutton handi rogan josh,  kaalimirch chicken- everything tasted delectable. The mutton was tender and succulent and distinctly flavored.  Loved the food. Planning to visit again soon to try out more of their dishes.

Which is nice to see. And if I come to the food part, “delicious,mouth watering,awesome,superb”. Foods were great. From the starter to cocktails. And I would like to specially mention the biryani. Must try for biryani lovers. I will visit this place again. From my side I am giving the 5 star.

It was navami during durga puja, we went for family lunch. As we know it would have been a huge rush, so 1 hour before we booked a table over phone. When we were standing in front of machaan, there was huge queue and we were on time. Generally we asked the manager, that we have already booked a table over phone, then we found our name at the last of the page and also there was a huge gap before our name. Then we had to wait for 45 mins to get a table for 5. We went for ala carte because there were a huge rush near buffet counter. We ordered for: 
1) prawn tandoori, 
2) murg malai kebab,
3) neebu dhania ki machli 
and in main course: 
4) plain naan, 
5) pulao (kadhai subz), 
6) dhania murg and 
7) murg tikka lababdar. 
The starters were very well cooked and tasted great but the pulao was tasteless and the ingredients were much more than the rice. While we had dhania murg, we saw 4 pieces of chicken but the service boy told every dishes contain 5 pieces. As we told the matter, so nice of them, they took the dish and given a extra piece of chicken. The decor was very good but due to puja days we could hardly get a good ambiance and services were a little bit slow. 
Someday will think to visit in normal days for lunch/dinner.

Had immense expectation of this place.  The fact that it's a specialty group somehow just increases it!  
Food is decent.  Could be so much better. Very restricted menu.  And quite expensive.  
The food was not the happy part at all.  

Though I enjoyed the sides and pickles.  Their house made mango pickle was delicious.  
Staff service was great too.  And the decor was very perfectly fitting to the theme and ambience. Even the music in the background and cutlery were in perfect harmony.  

I just wish the food is improved a bit more.  
:) cheers u guys!

We visited last night with my old friends from mumbai and our families but worst experience ever. Poor service and behavior, expensive a la carte menus but quality and taste is not expected as per high price.limited menu.Did not get any non-veg-soup. Which was available is very bad.My friend told that they visited mumbai malad machaan which is very good but this is in mani sqare is worst.Not recommended at all.

The wild ambience is really amazing, all the wooden decorations, low light actually give a perfect forest vibe. We tried their puja special buffet.  As per the price the varieties were less specially starter and dessert. Fish items were tasteless. Rest of the items tasted good. I loved their prawn kebab, chicken kebab, biriyani and suji halwa.

Went for lunch as flame n grills had 2 to 3 hrs waiting and we didn't hav other options for kebabs etc 
960 rs buffets same as flame n grills as they themselves suggested us to try Machan as price n menu r same 
Service was good 
Food 960 rs I would hav eaten at BBQ nation  or with a little more at Marriott Atleast they were worth it even after spending so much the half of the starters were cold on asking they said it do get cold in ac if kept open PS either make grills on table else make an alternative to serve hot food to match flame n grills Or other restaurants.
To b honest after dissapointed starters half of my wish to eat had gone so just had Briyani n a mutton dish from main course and little desert 
Total waste of money 
Even the food court will b a better option and worth for ur hard earn money

I visited this restaurant during the durga puja and had the non veg buffet. The menu was excellent and it was around 960 bucks per head. The starters were yummy which consisted of amritsari fish,chicken tandoori, ghost sheek kebab,paneer masala,prawn tandoori. The main course had chicken biriyani, mutton rogan josh,chicken masala,egg curry, prawn, fish and each of them were just excellent to taste. The dessert had mousse,chocolate ice cream, rasmalai, gulab jamun and pastries. It-would have been great had they included more variety in flavors of ice cream. Never the less the experience was great and so was the sumptuous lunch on nabami.

The ambience of this place is mind-blowing. It's like you are seated amidst a dark jungle. The sounds of animals in the background make it more realistic. Coming to the food, we ordered lehsuni jhinga, mutton biriyani, dhuandhar laal murgh tikka, dhania murgh, garlic naan, apple jelabi with rabri, chenar malpua and two mocktails. The lehsuni jhinga tastes out of this world and if u visit here, please do not miss it. If it's not mentioned in the menu ask the waiters and they will arrange. Biriyani was light and flavourful. Though not the classical Kolkata biriyani we are used to, but it has its own unique flavour. Dhuadhar laal Murgh tikka was a tasty dish with ample gravy . Dhania murgh was also good.Apple jelabi with rabri is a very unique dish with an amazing blend of taste. But you have to wait for like 30 minutes after ordering this dish. Also, this is not always available . Chenar malpua was also quite good. Both the mocktails were perfect. Frozen tamarind is my personal favourite. The price is on the higher side.
Overall, the ambience, lehsuni jhinga and apple jelabi makes me want to visit this restaurant again and again. ☺

As hoppi was full we came here for dinner. They have an 960 a.i buffet during puja. I love the ambience of this place. We had chickn tikka reshmi tandri ,fish kababs,muttn seekh etc etc. The menu was good.the mutton was soft, biriani was nice, dessert moong ka halwa was too good,rasmalai and some. Had a nice time and was glad to see the quality was as par during pujo also. 
One thing is that as flame and grill and machan are both speciality restos places,they have identical menus on buffets. They should do something different.it will be better I think.

We have been there on a festive Sunday. The service was prompt, the decor is great, the hospitality was warm. The food we ordered mostly on the waiter's recommendation and which all turned out to be excellent. We ordered Kakodi kebab (which I checked myself just after a single glance in the menu as it's a melt in the mouth mutton) and fish Tikka (waiter's recommendation and made of pure bhetki; they even serve the head of the fish for decorating or for proof of bhetki or whatever but it was perfectly cooked and fresh)
For main course we ordered Mutton Patiyali (another waiter's recommendation which is slow cooked mutton raan 😋) and garlic naan which was again superb and of the best quality.

Food was good and staffs prompt and courteous.. Cheese paratha is the item which i would recommend all to have. Rest the mocktails , chicken items veg pulao were just lip smacking. Price was a bit on the premium side and I didnt quite feel value for money for the food we ordered. Though the food undoubtedly tasty but pricing was high, I have eaten better without my pockets pinched. P.S _ one chicken dish didnt have enough pieces to serve 3 members and pieces were very tiny with a huge amount of gravy.

Ignoring the serving time, the overall experience is good. Mind boggling woodland ambience surrounded with dim lighting places Machan on the top while leaving other theme restaurants of Kolkata way behind. In house speciality including Dum Biriyani & Grilled Bhetki add gems to the crown. While the food is undoubtedly tasty and a big collection of Mocks & Cocks will definitely rock a couples table.

This placed just missed a 5 star rating by 0.5 because of one of its recommended desert, i.e., the apple jalebi. I was asked to try it and honestly, I really regretted the trial.
Otherwise, it was a great experience. Our family had a seating on the first floor, near the jungle area. Found the staff to be extremely courteous.
The food too was awesome (but don't try the apple jalebi). Chicken pieces in all dishes were soft and juicy. The kebabs too were giving 'melt in the mouth' experience. All thumbs up for this place.

 Good work in giving the jungle theme. They have a very nice machan like structure inside the restaurant which adds to the experience. Food is good and nicely plated. The service person were very welcoming and we'll trained. I would suggest a visit as the restaurant gives a much better experience then what you expect from a stand alone restaurant.

Situated on the top floor of the Mani Square mall just beside the by pass region of kankurgachi, machan is a well known place to be in thjs region. Based on a jungle, the restaurant really holds up it's theme and the atmosphere changes as soon as you enter the place. The lights are nice along with the sounds in the background. Once you look over the menu, the kebabs are a must try along with the fish. The fish especially is a fabulous dish. The pulao is a good side to go well with the fish. The only disappointment i had is with the paneer which was not upto the mark. But overall with the hospitality of the people around and their service i give machaan a healthy 4 star and it definitely deserves a visit for all those people coming here to taste indian food in a proper place.

Located on the topmost floor of Mani Square mall, this jungle themed restaurant is a go to for me for really good Indian food, and a breath taking decor. Infact, the only decent restaurant in Mani Square will be this place.

I've ben visiting this place for the last 4 to 5 years. Being a jungle themed restaurant, the decor has been worked on highly, the entire place being given a tropical feel with dim lighting, and huge animal statues. Everything from the dress of the waiters to their cutlery and even washrooms, have this jungle feel. This is a real delight for kids and they are sure to love it.

The waiters are courteous, and their suggestions are really good. The restaurant is built in 2 levels, the upper level having a tree house feel to it.

Coming to the food, the complementary pre appetizers they provide are surprisingly mouthwatering.
For the appetizers, we usually order Sheekh kebab or Kakori kebab. The former is cooked well, has a firm texture and great taste. The latter is just drool worthy, the minced meat melts as soon as it enters the mouth, the texture is soft and fantastic, so much so, the waiters struggle to serve it without breaking it up. This one's a must try.

For mains, we always go for the dum biriyani which gives many places a run for it's money. It's Awadhi style, served in a traditional handi, and the flavours hit all the right spots, and the aroma is charming. For sides, we take either of these 3, the murgh tikka lababdar, the dhania murgh or the mutton rogan josh. All 3 are pretty good, the dhania murgh being my favourite. All the 3 have thick spicy gravies that compliment both rice as well as breads pefectly.

I must add that the portions are very good, each dish being enough for 2 to 3 people depending on the appetite.

The only downside I'd say is the very high price tag of all their dishes, which is probably why this place missed the 4.5 mark for me. While this place is a top priority for me when it comes to good Indian food, the price factor almost always pulls it down from the top 4 or 5.

Visited this place for an office team outing... A buffet had been booked a day in advance and we reached there for lunch... I just fell in love with the decor...
This is basically a theme restaurant and they have perfectly justified it... You would actually get the feeling of Dining in an artificial jungle... The decor is just awesome... What I loved even more is that the people at service are also wearing animal printed clothes... The cutlery is customised in a way that they look like they r branches... The tribal music... The animal structures around... I can just go on talking about this place...
Food is really really good...Though I can just talk about the buffet menu for now...
.
Ambience: awesome

Food: really good

Service: satisfied completely

Suggestions: please do something about the weight of the spoons and forks... They are just too heavy...

Ambience top marks with a little downer on food.
Located in the range of popular, well known resto bars on the top floor of mani square has been known for its jungle themed ambience. Well true to its theme the jungle is done to the t, what with life size models of animals, and the centre like a tree house or machaan and the waiters having uniforms of animal print and the cutlery shaped like trees.
Hospitality gets a kudos too, staff is well versed with menu with prompt suggestions, service is quick, well manered and personal. The animal sounds in the background adds to the jungle feeling and the kids have a gala experience.
Had kakori kabab, and a fish tikka along with a bumble bee and caprioska in beverage. Both the starters were overpriced in terms of quantity and the kakori kabab was under seasoned. The beverages though were well made and priced standary. The array of complimentary condiments failed to impress although one particular glazed papaya chutney was great. 
Recommend a visit for the decor, hospitability and ambience, food can be improved.

Landed here only because of the long queues in the other restraunts.
Ambience was good.Feels good to come to a jungle outright.
They make it up to the feel by adding a similar background music.
The food was so-so.Featured in North Indian restaurants for a casual done the food could be better.When you talk about North Indian food I guess the breads should be perfect.And thats were they missed out.The starters were good.
The service was really nice.Sweet and hospital staff.

Machaan was a pleasant surprise on Poila Boisakh. We were late and almost all restaurants were full. I could manage to book a table at Machaan at the last minute and we were not really expecting much. However, I loved the jungle setting and the dimly lit dining area reminded me of "Royal Bengal Rohoshyo" by Satyajit Ray, where one of the characters used to sit on a machaan and wait to hunt tigers. The restaurant truly lived up to its name and I was rather pleased to be at a theme based restaurant after ages!

We opted for the buffet. The starters were all delectable, especially the mutton kebab. But I was intrigued by the main course savouries and just loaded my plate with naan, daal makhni, biriyani, fish curry, prawns and chicken. I loved the palak chicken. Green and chicken usually dont work well for me together but Machaan's palak chicken was so good that I took a second helping. I loved the prawns too..soft and succulent.
The dessert section had gulab jamuns and jalebis. I devoured on them. I loved the jalebis; not too sweet, not too bland. There were fruits and ice creams too but I was too full to try those. Maybe some other time😊
All in all, Machaan was a good experience and I highly recommend it.

This is how restaurant food should be. Something that is unique to restaurants, difficult to replicate at home. Firstly we got our special mocktails with a beautiful gondhoraj and watermelon flavour coming through. It was not overtly sweet, just the way I like it. Then came the kakori kababs served over mini parathas. Omg! I closed my eyes in pleasure. You really don't need to chew it, and the balance of flavour between the mutton and ghee is beautiful. You can taste both, they don't overpower each other. Then we had the tandoori bhekti. I noticed they grill it with the skin on which makes the fish more juicy ,moist and extremely buttery. Next came the Amritsari kulcha, mutton Rogan Josh and butter naan. Each of these dishes might sound normal but were extraordinary tastewise. Lastly to top of it all off we had nolen Gur icecream drizzled with Gur and chopped crunchy nuts. No matter how full you are, I'm sure you will find room for this! I had a foodgasm here!

A decent restaurant with an excellent ambience. I must say the ambience is one of its kind. Gives you a feel of a day in the woods. The food is nice. 

Being a vegetarian the best dishes included Kadai Paneer, paneer Rawalpindi , subz dum hundi. We ordered a Roti ki tokri which I think is a gud buy..The complimentary papad really made us happy. Just one complain, Aloo dum..it was pathetic..this was a spoiler else the place is a must visit atleast once with family..

I was here couple of days back for a team buffet lunch and the experience was horrible. There were 5 non-veg starters(2 fish, 1 prawn, 1 chicken and 1 mutton) and 3 for veg(baby-corn, mushroom and paneer). Out of these only the fish starter which was served at the beginning was tasty while the others were awful. The main course was even worse than this, 4 gravy items(chicken curry, mutton curry, navaratna, dal makhani) were there and none could be consumed. The biryani looked like rice soaked in ghee. Even the roadside biryani's tastes better than this. I will recommend not to try buffet out here. Also deserts were there but it would be good to pause here... The theme of this place is very  good and the staffs were very cordial.

Went in for a buffet lunch! One of my best experience... The interior is amazing... The food is delicious... Indian food with all the variations... The staffs were very helpful as they served the dishes and we did not have to leave our seats to get the food... Holding the spoon n fork seems uneasy but it does go with the theme....

A different experience all together. Jungle themed restaurant it is. Starting from the chirping of birds to trumpeting of elephants everything was so real. We were lucky enough to get the treetop. 

Coming to food quality the starters were great. In main course we took one polau dish two chicken biriyani and two kinds of side dishes. Absolutely no issues with the sides n polau but the biriyani had a very strong smell of rose water for which we couldn't finish it as the strong smell killed our appetit.
Behavior of every worker is very hospitable.

One suggestion please do provide a knife.

The first thing i should mention about this restaurant is its forest-like decor. Its awesome. The sounds of chirping birds , trumpet of elephants and many other animals made the ambience more beautiful.I went there for dinner with my parents on their anniversary a few months back.We ordered a gravy Chicken Item and a gravy Mutton Item ( sorry, can't remember the particular names) to have with Tandoori Roti. The items were good, but the size of those chicken and mutton pieces was not at all satisfactory. Staffs were good and friendly The best part was, they surprised us with an anniversary cake, that made my mom-dad so happy. Overall, nice experience!

Went there with my family, situated in Mani square. It is a jungle themed restro which is great. They provided us a table on treetop. My mother just loved this restro.
We ordered konkani prawn, rann a machaan, grilled bekti and brownie with ice cream.
All the items were awesome and bekti was beyond imagination. 😍 
Staff are good and friendly. service is also good but they levy 10% extra service charge which I didn't like about machaan. Otherwise nice experience and will visit again.

Well its like a picnic amidst forest. The ambiance is unique. A jungle like atmosphere..with trees, birds and animal models surrounding you. Service is prompt and food is quite good. The price is on the higher side and again this belongs to that kind of restaurants where 10% service charge is mandatory along with 14.5% VAT and 6% service tax, hence totalling to around 30% of total bill. Drinks is also expensive. A red wine bottle (not imported one) is charged 3 times the MRP tagged on bottle. For food, I might visit again. Not pocket friendly, but if you want to feel the jungle picnic experience, you may give it a try. Overall a 3.5/5.

Firstly I want to tell about the interior and ambience..From the sound of the birds chirping to the trumpeting of elephants..It will make you feel like you're in a forest..We had our seat on the tree top .. 
Secondly the staffs were friendly, courteous and well behaved .. 
But the main thing FOOD ,was average here..We opted for non-veg buffet , starters were good, but the rest from soup , peas polao, jeera rice and daal were average, chicken dish was good though , the number of items were very less ! (I love sweets so took gulab jamun and icecrm from the dessert 3times) 
Pocket pinch is average .. Two non-veg buffet costed 1100 including tax .

Good food in a nice ambience! Themed like a jungle this restaurant offers a huge variety of dishes. We ordered matar makai kebab, paneer kurchan and kofte. All the dishes were decent in taste and nice. But service here is very slow. Takes a lot of time to prepare, not just the food but drinks as well. The papad served is complimentary, which is picked up from a table and placed on someone else's table and thats what is weird and unhygenic! Got to know this after i had done eating. This was really creepy! Please avoid the papad thing..

Last month we had a visit to Machaan, mani sq. We were awestucked by the decor. Jungle themed, dim lighting, tree top tables, bird's chant everything was there. We had a chance to have a table at the tree topw we had beer and ordered for a kebab platter. It was good, consisting of multiple variety of kebabs. Then we ordered for roti ki tokri, which had plenty of naans and tandoori cut into pieces, one chicken item and their 'recommended' mutton dish. The mutton dish was just disaster. It was too much salty. we reported the same to the waiter. As soon as we reported some higher management came running, apologized and wanted to change the dish. But as we didn't want to change they gave us complementary ice cream and gulab jamun for all of us. we took only one, but their courtesy was awesome. Truly they deserve to be a multi speciality restaurant. Rest of the food were good. Truly a good experience.

With competitors all around on the 4th floor of Mani Sq mall, this place gives a good fight. A great ambiance with trees and nature theme inside to imitate a small cave. Not a lot of options for food but its worth the money for its specialties like the Dhuandhaar sizzling Chicken starter. The service is warm and friendly and overall it turns out to be a perfect place to chat and enjoy the silence. Happy eating!!

The interior is exciting with a tree house concept but its too dark to see anything. People sitting uptair will rarely be able to see food. Okay! Now for the food, i guess its overhyped bcz the good is not upto the mark (am not saying food is bad). Compared to the money and the reputation it has, food is not that good. We ordered for mutton ghosht curry n it was a definite let down. It was too salty to eat. The plain tandoori roti was also not good. Tandoori roti has some softness, wen i ate i felt like i was eating smething that is not chewable.  
The only reason of giving 2.5 is their hospitality, wen we said the food eas not good they compensated us with drink which was good. Infact the manager saod us to wait so that he can compensate but we were so heart broken that we said its ok n left. Later they even called and asked us to visit once again which never happened bcz 1st impression was really bad. 
Also their price was too much for that quality of food. 
For me a big let down.
No snap of food bcz of their poor lighting.

Machaan located in 4th floor of Mani square. For the starters we ordered  murg malai kebab & dania lal murg tikka, both were equally tasty. For the main course we ordered murg kalimirch and butter nan. Murg Kalimirch was a disappointment , not at all spicy , instead it was having a bit of sweetness, not what was said. I think they gave us murg lababdar in place of murg Kalimirch. The service is very very slow . U will have to wait for near about 20-25 min just for the starter. As for the decoration and theme , it was very good ... But the slow Service takes everything down along with it. And the price is on the expensive side . Will like to give 3/5.

The only jungle-themed restaurant in the city.. A venture of the Speciality Group and indeed one of the most uniquely conceptualized food joint.. Located in the 4th floor of Mani Square, this place will transport you to some wild dense jungle where you will savor delectable North Indian spreads like a Princely ruler out on hunting in the wild and taking a break from the game.. The ambience is definitely the highlight of this place and kudos to the management for such precise detailing in the décor.. Right from the entrance wild animals will greet you amidst the dimly lit interiors, tall dark trees and birds chirping around.. We were given a seat up in the second level, where you will feel more like seating in a tree house or a macha, like a hunter overlooking the wild beasts.. The furnitures are also built accordingly with the theme having a rustic, primitive appearance, with bamboo railings around.. Like any other Speciality Group establishment, service is flawless at this place too, you will be literally pampered while having a fine dining experience.. They served us complementary Papads and variety of Chutneys which elevate the flavors of dishes.. Coming to the food, this place serves only authentic North Indian and Mughlai dishes, cooked with higher expertise.. We ordered a few of their house specialties:
Raan e Machaan: Roasted Mutton leg, where a portion of the leg is served on a sizzler plate.. Absolutely drool-worthy and lip-smacking.. Loved the smokiness of the dish to go with the juicy, tender mutton pieces.. Also extra brownie points for the amazing presentation..  The portion was enough for 3-4 people.. Passionately Recommended..
Fish Kali Mirch Tikka: Fish marinated with black pepper and charred on tandoor.. Adequate heat and packed with flavors to give the perfect kick to your taste buds.. We ordered Basa instead of Bhekti and they were kind enough to customize the same..
Butter Naan: Quite flakey and crunchy, tasted lighter and different than the one served in most of the places..
Cheese Kulcha: Another nicely cooked bread, cheesy and creamy.. Greased generously with butter..
Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Boneless Chicken Tikka Kebabs simmered in a rich tomato, onion gravy.. The gravy was creamy and slightly sweet and packed with rich flavors..
Safari Special Cocktail: A special in-house drink made with Gin, Vodka, White Rum, Dark Rum, Whiskey, Brandy and Cranberry Juice all perfectly blended in a long tall glass.. Given the wide assortment of drinks that goes into the glass, no doubt it’s an interesting and tasteful affair..
Mojito: On our special request, their bartender punches Jaljeera Virgin Mojito with Absolut Vodka.. Nicely mixed and adequate punch..
Overall, it was a nice experience over some popular dishes prepared with utmost expertise.. However, I felt they may have purposefully overdone the décor a bit such that the attention diverts from the food itself.. The prices are definitely higher for the portions and given the rates of the adjacent joints, which may be the reason for the place being mostly vacant.. Our total cheque was Rs.2647/- (all incl.) for 2 people.. So, do visit this place once for the awestruck theme if not for the food..

Went for dinner with some guests from out of town on a week night. Place was moderately full. Fantastic food and great service. The kebabs beat most places in town, including some popular restaurants in 5 star hotels. We just wanted to focus on kababs. Started with the Kandhari Seekh Kabab which was seekhs of lamb mince cooked in a spicy marinade. Juicy and succulent. Followed that with Raan-e-Machaan which was a complete portion of the lamb shank with buttery soft meat. After that we tried the Kakori Kabab which was soft and juicy because it was cooked with a lot of ghee. Rounded off with Dhuandar Murgh Tikka -  a smoked chicken kabab cooked in charcoal smoke and served smoky and hot. The accompanying Butter Naan was also just right. All in all, great food and great service by Debashish, our maitre d'. Would definitely recommend for lip smacking kababs.

Food quality is decent and could become much more better off looked at it. Prices are a bit too high compared to the quality. Although they offered a complimentary drink to make up for their service. :)

The setting is dark but dimly lit enough to see who you are with and what you are eating or drinking. The backdrop is a treetop perch in a forest with eerie sounds. Perfect for the cuisine it serves. Chill out with a beer or spectacular cocktails, order for a Raan  (lamb foreleg), dal makhani and garlic naan and let your hair down. Pure bliss! Quick and personalised service is the bonus along with papad and chutneys! Cost for a couple approx Rs 1,500.

After much searching to find a restaurant serving from an a la carte menu on a Saturday evening we settled for Machaan, but it ended up being a not so enjoyable experience. It was disappointing with that coming from the Speciality Restaurants stable.

With the decor done in the form of a jungle, Machaan does very well in the ambiance segment. With artificial trees and animal effigies placed among them, the place does resemble a jungle. The seating is in the form of chairs and tables cut out from logs of wood, the cutlery is in the form of twigs. And with sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves, the ambiance is complete. What doesn't work in all this is the lighting. The lighting is pretty low, which maybe is necessary for the ambiance, but to me it doesn't help. The cutlery too, though innovative, is difficult to handle.

Coming to the food, we tried a bhetki appetizer which was not listed in the menu. It was a tandoor preparation and cooked well, with succulent fillets of fish, but the inner reaches of the fish lacked taste. Next it was murg kalimirch with garlic naan. The chicken was an ordinary chicken gravy preparation served with a lot of gravy which eventually got wasted. But the part that was most disappointing was the dessert menu and the uncertainty and misinformation surrounding it. We wanted to order the green apple jalebi with rabdi. First we were told that it was unavailable, but after much prodding we were told it would take 30 minutes for it to be served with a lot of time already passing in the meanwhile. We eventually ended up with sweet lime soda. But the condiments served along with the food needs a special mention. A sweet mango pickle served along with papad was pretty good. The papad was repeated too.

With the prices being on the higher side (I received a corporate discount too), the service is pretty slack. The menu had to be asked for several times and the courses were served with a lot of time in between despite there not being very high occupancy. The stewards aren't much active.

With the food being a regular one and the service being poor, the decor alone is not compelling enough for a second visit. There is a lot of work which needs to be done. A strong recommendation may bring me here again.

Happy eating!!!

Machaan is a place to cherish the ambience of a jungle in a hustling mall.The restaurant should receive a 5 rating just for its amibience.However,the food is more or less good and never matches the quality of the surroundings.The price is a bit on the higher side but you could always give it a try for north indian delicacies and excellent ambience.

Its a jungle themed restaurant, dim lighted ambience and background junglee  🎶 .. Pretty cool place to hang out and food is really great.. Ordered bumblebee and virgin mojito with malai broccoli and chicken wings sizzler as starters. Malai broccoli..just melted in the mouth. Bumblebee could have been lil more in amount as per the price. It just vanished in two sips!  Well, for main course, had masala khulcha n cheese stuffed khulcha which were just yummmm!..along with exotic vegetable stir fry and khadhai panner, both equally good in taste. Servicing and staff behavior-impressive. Will I recommend this place to my friends n family??.. A big yesss! 😊

Visited yesterday for a quiet and cosy Christmas lunch date :)  Was a bit skeptical because my previous experience was not that good but boy oh! boy ..i fell in love with the food !! I donot distinctly remember when the first bite gave me a pure and blissful foodgasm!! Coming to the food the adrak ke murgh was just lipsmackingly delicious and so was the piping hot basmati rice which had a slight flavour of saffron .each and every item we took were just out of the world delicious .And also surprisingly on a busy weekend the staffs catered to every customer with warmth and so were the dishes they prepared (filled with warmth) .Will love to visit this place definitely ,again .Thank you Machaan for making our Christmas lunch this awesome !

Machaan is attractive mainly because of its immaculate ambience and setting of a rustic jungle. I think, trying out quality food should be a secondary option for the food lovers here. Let it be very honest about that at the outset. I had paid buffet dinner to try out their quality of food. And honestly, I liked their desserts more than their main course which comprised of a huge array of cuisine right from biriyani, mutton, chicken, mixed veg, kulcha and what not. :) Mutton, they prepare very well and so is fish. But I liked their spread and choice of desserts. The small pastries of about 3 varieties were really awesome to try out. I believe, one can pay a visit just to try out their desserts only.

This outlet of Machaan created a lot of hype when it was opened as it was one of the first themed restaurants in Kolkata. This place was long known for the jungle themed outlook and I, being a kid was pretty amazed by the décor. I have come here twice. The food is Indian. The cooking is fantastic. Love the food here and the ambience. Recommended. Happy Dining! :)

U get a lot of items as complimentories here. 3 types of pickles and papad too. The desserts to try here are chena malpua and gulab jamuns.The staff members are also very friendly and kind.

The ambience is the part that attracted me towards it.My friends were saying they feel like on top of a tree.
food -nice
prices-okay.
staff-polite enough atleast for when i went.
ambience- i already told you.

overall its a different themed restaurant, there is a treehouse environment. It is a family restaurant . check thier opening intervals and dont be late, i missed my entry on my 1st attempt :( ... though would suggest everyone to visit once atleast.
I had reviewed it with 5 stars but that time i did not pay the bill . I went to JW Marriott and a lot of restaurant like that , but here the bill struck me . They charged me a whopping service charge on the total amount which made the bill go from just 1300/- to 1470/-( values are approximate ) then they charged service tax and vat on the remaining amount . This procedure made me pay almost 35% apart from the food ( i went here in month of april, 17) the total amount was now around 2000/-. I was not going to write it as I thought every other good restaurant does that , but no i was wrong , not every posh restaurant does this . This thing i felt was wrong so i wrote ! I know a lot of you wouldnt mind paying this But a certain amount added to my bill in the list of dishes and paying service tax and vat on that amount is not that common and not what i believe was right . Just a piece of information. Apart from this it was indeed a good restaurant .

Machaan is one of my favorite place. The ambiance is damn good. I felt like having food sitting deep inside an African Jungle. Even the cutlery was of Jungle Style.

Now if I talk about the food, it was really very good both in quality and quantity. Longtime ago I had Jungli Masalo ki Raan which I wish to have again but they probably do not serve it anymore. I had biryani which was simply awesome.

Awesome ambience, delicious food, superb service, this was an out of the world experience! We ordered Kasha Mangsho and Malai Kofta with Naan, and the food was perfect! The Kasha Mangsho was a sinful creation, 4 pieces of super succulent mutton but with bones adding more flavor, dripping in fat and juices, as sinfully Bengali in creation as it can be! The Malai Kofta was more conventional, 8 meticulously prepared Kofta made with Khoya and dry fruits, in a cashew gravy. The Naan was delightfully fluffy and a pleasant surprise. All in all a delightful experience! Definitely worth a comeback!

The olive chilli naan was simply amazing which went very well with Pindi Chole. The runn of Machaan is another amazing dish. What I also liked about this place is it's hospitality and the way they have treated the guests! Good job team Machaan 👌

Machaan- after entering the first thing that came to my mind was they lived up to their name pretty well. The staffs are very courteous and helped a lot for ordering our food. Their nonveg kebab platter is a must try one. The chicken one was the best of the lot. In main course we took kadhai subz pulao and kadhai murgh. The quantity of pulao was quite generous and it served three of us. In dessert nolen gurer ice cream was the winner for me though we liked firni too. I would like to visit the place with the children of the house as the ambience is very eye-catching for them.

STOPPING BY THE WOODS ...

As a themed restaurant, the decor is forested and tribal, aboriginal and primitive. Central to the restaurant, there actually is an erected tree-house where we climb up to and are mounted to eat... This forms the core of the place - the TSP... Well... I have been there with friends, with family. The food is, however average while we are busy admiring the dark, adventurous, thrilling, and predatory surroundings with canopy and foliage fit for food hunting.

This is one of the few themed restaurants that Kolkata has to offer. Loved the dimly lighting along with the jungle decor. The greens of the climbers go well with the wooden furnishings,even the washrooms stay true to the theme. We had Heineken beers,and Tandoori Kebab Platter. The kebabs were delicious. I would recommend this platter since it consists of a few speciality kebabs. The staffs were courteous enough to make you feel comfortable. Lovely restaurant for having a good time.

Location-Mani square mall,Kolkata.

This restaurant is beautifully themed like a forest. AS you enter you will find different animals statue making differnent sounds.The whole place is mostly covered with dark except the tables which have little lighting.This place only served north indian cuisines and has a good seating capicity.

Service-The service at this place was quite good and reliable.The staff was also very cooperative and had been trained very well with the dishes.

Ambiance-The ambiance and the interiors are the points where this place takes an advantage.The ambiance is very calm and soothing and the place has been decorated very well.

Food-The food at this place is quite good.We do visit their shibpur outlet regularly and the place has been still consistent with the food.We had-
1:Tamatar dhania shorbha
2:Vegetable kebab platter
3:Dal chaunka
4:Malai palak

Among them their Vegetable kebab platter is a must try.

Food-4/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

Forest has always intrigued me, since my Jim Corbett reads. No, I guess before that. Long before.
'Machan', I was a bit enthralled by the name. Bookmarked it, finally visited. Though I have heard mixed reviews about this place, but you never know unless you try. So asked my dad, let's do it.
The most eye-catching feature with no doubt is the decor. The interior designing near perfectly simulates an eatery inside a jungle with all the creatures, trees and a machan at the centre. Up until now, as far the name goes, it's justified.
Coming to food thereby, started with mocktails.
Jal Jeera Mojito, a sour sweet essence of lemon, mint and other spices. Different from what I've been having till now.
Basil and Pineapple swirls, a fresh breeze outta sea.
Now as for solids, ordered Polao, Pudina Paratha, Multani Paratha. Each of them remained true to taste.
Polao was fragrant and light.
These two Parathas were yummy and crisp to be true, emanating characterised flavours.
Sides were Murgh Tikka Lababdar, ahh yes it was Shandaar! Precisely barbequed pieces in a rich savoury gravy.
Mutton Kasha was succulent and truly delectable, with a bit of gravy shortage. Or may be it's me, cause it was calling for more. They need to add more dishes to the Non-Veg Sides.
Lastly to sum it up as an essential, came desserts.
Malai Kulfi and Nolen Gurer Ice cream (not in the menu tho').
That Kulfi has to be one of the best I've had. With each bite, it sent a wave of flavours down the tract.
It's pretty apparent, where my rating is going. Ought to visit again.
Like I said, you never know unless you try. (:

Everthing was delicious but yes the stand out dish was definitely the dal machaan.

Reviewing restaurants during Durga puja is not a great idea but couldn't help it for machaan. The Puja buffet lunch was quite highly priced with Rs 961 ai. The place was jam packed and the patrons were also packed in the tables and it was difficult manoeuvre inside the restaurant. The place is quite big but there was only one area where the buffet was spread. Coming to food, I could not get proper flavour as mostly the starter trays were empty and took ages to refill. The taste of the food was mediocre and I found the veg spread was tastier. It was a bad decision. The dessert was ordinary with halwa, gulab jamun, rasogolla, ice cream and assorted pastries. And they were serving the same dessert in the next restaurant as well which is from the same group. Exclusivity?

If someone has big appetite people want some good food, ds is the place coz of the quantity it boasts.Every dish it gives is good enough for 2-3 atlst. Kadhai paneer is the best from their menu. I am perplexed just with the lighting, it can be a bliss for couples who'd want Lil intimacy with their food but I'd want to see what's going inside my mouth, what is it's presentation. Lighting is just an issue otherwise ambience is amazing. Staff very courteous, great hospitality. Food is average overall but yeah satisfied you'd walk out.

Looking for a themed restaurant in Kolkata which serves good non vegetarian food? Well, Machaan is the place to go. Easy location, good ambience and good service. 
It was quite easy to get a place as it had a good seating arrangement. We were a group of four and opted for the buffet service, hoggers that we are. The buffet cost us 961 per person (inclusive of taxes). The starters were quite good and the fish starter stole the show. The main course was quite decent too. The desserts were a little bit of a let down because there wasn't much variety. We also ordered Coronas (355 per bottle) and two Virgin Mojitos (150 each) with our food but I'd say that drinks are overpriced. The staff was very prompt with their service and were quite hospitable. If you want to enjoy a nice sumptuous meal, Machaan wouldn't let you down, though it might fall slightly heavy on your pockets.

Tawa Sabzi Nizami and Multani Paratha is what I ordered when I went here for a late lunch with a friend today. Both of them were specialities of this place and were undoubtedly a very good try.

Went to machaan after a long time with my fiancee to have a quick lunch. I went to this famous jungle themed restaurant last in 2010 in my hometown guwahati,and this was only my second visit.... we were welcomed by waiters dressed in my favourite tiger print shirts ,the interiors are mindblowing and instantly reminds you of jim corbett and kenneth anderson stories you have grown up with. But as soon as the menu came we were a tad disappointed coz it offered a v.less variety of non veg dishes ... nonetheless we started with buttermilk and tandoori paneer aloo.... both were subtle in their tastes and were presented well.. then we opted for peas pulao and chicken lababdar ,peas pulao was excellent with its aroma and taste , the absloute winner was the chicken lababdar , it was tasty and yet not rich,flavorful yet no way oily or greasy .... just awesome to say the least!! A word for the warm,professional and impeccable service of the restaurant staff,awe inspiring !! 
All in all, a great place to have a meal,just wish they increase the non.veg side dishes options :-)

Lightings a bit dim adding a more romantic feel here. Slow and low pitched sounds of animals tend to spook you if ur attention suddenly falls on them.Moving on to the food:-
KOLKATA'S BEST BIRIYANI. even raan biriyani of Oudh falls 2nd to it.Great cooking, super delicious dishes. I was smothered by the taste of the dishes here.

The place is in Mani square. It is a forest themed restaurant. Hence the place is surprisingly dark,with a tree house interiors and tribal music. Now coming to the food,we had ordered Gosht galouti for appetizers, Murgh tikka lababdar, Dhania murgh,and butter naan for main course. The appetizers were absolutely lip smacking. The kebabs melted in my mouth,and were amazing. Papads and achaar were complimentary. The lababdar was great and a must have there. It is not too spicy,but absolutely tasty and delicious. The dhania murgh was a slight disappointment. Overall,the food is good(remember that only North Indian cuisine is served here),the service is fast,and good,but since the place is so dark no one can take good pictures in there.

The jungle themed restaurant is an attraction to watch..
Machaan itself describe the platforms in the trees used in old times for hunting.
While entering the jungle sound effects and the artificial trees really gives you an exciting feeling.
Coming to the food they especially offers North Indian cuisines.
Both buffet and ala carte is available.
To be honest the food didn't pleased me as the ambiance did..
It was pretty average.. the naan was too oily and the biriyani was dry.. and the mutton gravy which they recommended was average too.
If we consider the budgeting then it's a decent pricing place.
But consider twice before actually visiting here.. ambiance and decor can't be a first priority for foodies.

Machaan has always been a favorite for kids because of its ambience. The food at lunch today was exceptionally well and Machaan will now feature high on my favorite joints. Along with the tasty mutton and chicken dishes, the fish offering was awesome. Though the special fixed thali was no longer on offer, the food offered along with the caring staff made it a memorable lunch with family.

The place is great for family outings. It is dimly lit and offers privacy. We ate atop an elevated tree like space. They have a seated buffet, meaning the staff will bring the entire course to your table one item at a time and you donot need to go and collect your food from the buffet table. 

Starters are really good. The hariyali chicken was very very yummy. They kebabs were good too. It is an indian cuisine restaurant so we had Indian main course dish. Naan and chcicken. I loved the starter menu and also the dessert. Overall the place is a really good place for a date or a family outing because of the dim lights. Quality of food is good. 

Rate: 7.5/10

Probably one of the most decorated restaurant... Awesome looks of this place from outside as well as from inside attracts people... The food available is of good quality... The shape of the spoons, forks deserve special mention... It's just an awesome place to have any kind of meal... The inner atmosphere is just noteworthy...

The one thing that will make you awestruck is the theme... seem like a you are dining in the midst of a dark,dense forest...or you are in a loghouse in a forest.

Coming to the food and service, no doubt  the taste,quality was superb.

In all a lovely experience.... Mani Square never disappoints with its collection of eateries. :)

One of the few theme restaurants in Kolkata, Machaan gives one a memorable experience. With fantastic food, an amazing ambience and a perfect location (Mani Square), it has got all the ingredients to be a hit.

I'm a regular inviter of Roti Ki Tokri, Dal Tarka, and a Tamarind Mocktail. The complementary munchies they serve are good too. Machaan is a great place with reasonable pricing.

Really good themed place. Its dim litted, with artificial leaves above, giraffe and elephants figures, a tree house mez sitting area, chairs shaped like a leaf, Cutlery shaped like twigs, also to add waiters wearing animal print clothes. Its a perfect place to take your kids to, they gonna love it. Food tastes awesome, although its slightly high priced (3.5 on scale of 5) , portions are really sumptuous. Liked the place, but only thing that was a set back was their waiters behavior. We entered at abou.t 3:30, we understand that it's there closing time at 4, we ordered everything at once, and didn't bother them more, but they will keep on pestering you, offering you to serve your food again n again, then even when you are eating they will ask if we can clean the dishes! That was bad.. otherwise its a good place.

I visited this place today for lunch.
The ambiance is impressive and thats what drew me inside and I horribly regret my decision. 
We were made to sit upstairs, we liked the little bit of privacy the place offered, only to be given the shock of our life later.
Rats, and mice.. Yes live rodents are running around all over the place.
I noted a few and panicked- the staff showed their calm as if its part of the jungle theme and paraded to my table and said- "we are sorry maam" 🙄😱
I had ordered pukhtani tandoori chicken half,
Dhania murgh and plain naan.. I hurriedly finished my meal with my feet carefully perched up because the last thing i wanted was a rat scuttling on my shoes.
Alarming and pathetic hygiene standards.
If this is the standard of seating area, i wonder what is the massacre in the kitchen!!!??!!
I was offered on the house desserts (i guess my panic and fright was evident)
I was billed 1074 for 3 items mentioned above and I hurriedly left the place.
Shall i visit again? Never.
Shall I recommend this to people? No. Not unless you are okay with rodents sharing meals with you.. Too much of theme?!?! May be. But severe breach with hygiene standards. Hated it. Unfortunately 1 is the lowest zomato allows for rating.

Visited this place thrice and this is a conglomerated review of all those 3 visits. So, coming to the theme of jungle, this place has successfully designed and implemented it. I had buffet lunch every time I came here so cannot comment on the other options available. The food is decent and the number of dishes are great too considering the price tag.

Raan e machhan is tasty but quantity is very low compared to the price.

Well, you might feel somewhat lost the moment you enter this place – owing to this place being dimly lit up. Machaan successfully cascades you into the Medieval ages of the Pharaohs and wildlife and those weak at heart might have a difficult time dining out there (just kidding !). I was warmly greeted by a staff at then entrance and escorted to a seat at their 1st floor dining area (although, the ground floor area is damn huge). Ambience of the place is great – as is the case of all the Speciality group restaurants! Machaan attempts to replicate the wildlife with some fictitious animal and jungle sets as well as the medieval ages using some pharaoh statues.

I started with their Tomato Shorba – great on serving size but pretty mediocre on taste – spice content being very high – and me developing hiccups within seconds owing to that. This was followed by the main course, since I was dining out alone, I preferred to go for their Khushka Sofiyani Basmati steamed rice as well as Makai corn. I save a lot of money on papads at Speciality group restaurants – as they serve these complimentary (joke!). The papad basket came in front of me in a while as well as the mint chutney and onion salad draped in red chilli powder. Believe me guys, when I say that I had 2-3 papads using the chutney served as it was so tasty! Food was served in some 15 minutes and was damn hot – so hot that I could feel my tongue as well as chest burning after the 1st morsel. Rice was beautiful as well as tasty – it had an inherent mild sweetness, so that one could have it raw! Was amazed to see that rice was served in a handi with a cover, which ensured it was hot/ warm till the last. Corn palak was fine, although, real taste of spinach was missing (which is understandable because we don’t have winters right now).

Quantity served was just too much, and I had a very difficult time finishing off the meal. Service is superb and they try to make you feel at home. I got regular water refills without much requests. Prices, pretty high, topped with hefty taxes (20%) as well as Machaan service charges (10%) and this might deter you from visiting this place quite often.

Really looking forward to trying out their signature Dal Machaani – the next time.

P.S:- Regret the low visibility on my pics as light availability is pretty limited.

The interiors give an unexpectedly realistic feel n do their best to transport you to a make-shift jungle..but the dim lights, all the foliage n wood around you has its own hazards, like we spotted a baby cockroach on the table, fortunately before our food arrived..we ordered bhatti da murg for starters, which took a long time to arrive, but tasted good..if one is looking for a romantic place to dine, this is it..gives a secluded, out f the city feel..we had chicken items- dhuandar and lababdar chicken, none of which was exceptional..food is quite ordinary but the interiors is something that deserves a try!!

Machan-Theme restaurant based on Machan theme. We went their with our friends. Though interiors were too dark for my taste everybody else liked it. We ordered Tomato Shorba which was good but it was the only veg soup in menu. For starters Veg platter was ordered which was great and quantity was also good. Paneer Makhanwala, Daal makhni, garlic naan and veg pulao. All the preparations were very good and quantity was adequate. We were four people and really enjoyed the dinner. Staff was courteous and very attentive.
Food - great

Not only non-veg you can get awasm veg kababs also here my favourite broccoli cheese kabab .First time they also surved us complementary snacks and nice mouthwatering desserts. But next time when we went during durga pooja time they stopped giving complementary dessert. It is definitely one of the best themed restaurant in this city.

High quality food, but expensive , was my verdict for Machaan @ Mani Square Mall. I have been to Machaan 3-4 years ago as well, and prices have increased further.

Also, the earlier attraction of seeing the motorized elephants, snakes and monkeys moving are gone as well ! These motorized animals and their shrieks used to be a big attraction for kids !

Food remains good. We ordered chicken reshmi kabab for starters, cheese garlic naan and murg tikka lababdar. Impeccably cooked food and very tasty, with classy silverware and cutlery !

3.5 on my books, purely for the price !

A perfect combination of amazing food and very interesting interiors. 
The first time I went there years ago, they were tryin to keep the jungle environment completely authentic and ended up making the place too dark. However,that has been corrected now and results? A jungle like feel while gorging on delicious food without the associated risks( Let's accept it, you don't wanna become a tiger's dinner while having dinner yourself!)
The interiors are something you HAVE TO see with your own eyes! A big elephant, 2 extremely muscular bodyguards(statue) and foliage covered walls and roof! It's beautiful! 

As for the food, Anjan Chatterjee can rarely go wrong when it comes to food! 
Last time I went there, this is what I tried out-

○Tandoori Kebab Platter: comprises of fish, chicken, mutton and prawn kebabs! The fish absolutely melts in your mouth and is delicious as are the other kebabs. If you're at machaan,this is one dish you ought to have. 

○Mutton Dum Biriyani: Biriyani is love! And this biriyani was awesome!

○Kadhai Jhinga: fancy name for prawn curry! Fancy name, sassy taste. The prawn was soft and the taste of the curry blended in perfectly with the prawn pieces.

○Murgh Tikka Lababdar: chicken cooked to perfection in a gravy so tasty that'll keep you yearning for more. 

○Chilli onion Kulcha

○Sizzling Brownie with Ice-cream: No matter how full you are, there's always that separate compartment in your stomach for your favourite dessert. While this brownie with ice-cream wasn't Peter Cat level Epic, it was pretty good. 

The only dish they could make a little better is the chicken kebab..but I guess it seemed bland only in comparison to the other kebabs!
If you're looking for a drink to complement the kebab platter, try our Hoegaarden!
In case it isn't obvious already, Highly recommended. MUST MUST MUST GO!
Bon Apetite! :D

Located on the 4th floor mani square mall. It is quiet spacious and the interiors and decor is in accordance to the jungle theme. I wont write much about the interiors because before  visiting the place today i had been through a lot of reviews where almost all the reviews has a vivid description about it. 

After looking through the menu i was in a dilemma whether or not to visit the place as the menu had only 3 non veg mains( chicken) 1 non veg mains(prawn), 1 non veg mains( mutton) 1 non veg mains(fish). Though the menu has a variety of vegetarian dishes but the lack of diversity in the non vegetarian foods was a set back. 
Finally, after a lot of confusion when i visited the place i wasnt disappointed at all.

We had ordered 2 heineiken and 1 corona which were served chilled alongwith with masala papad n masala onions.
Amongst the starters i had placed an order for the LAL MEERCH LASOONI JHINGA( barbequed garlic flavoured medium prawns which wasn't as spicy as the name suggests) which was cooked to perfection. Had a perfect garlic flavour( anything more or less could have been a disaster) , prawns were juicy and the crust was crisp. For the mains we had JEERA POLAU and KOSHA MANGSHO. The jeera polau was good and the butter added to it made it more amazing to taste. The kosha mangsho ( mutton curry) had a authentic kolkata taste and felt almost home made. 

The staffs were very helpful and courteous. Since my phone was running out of battery they even helped me to charge it enough to last till i reached home.

I had a wonderful experience and looking forward to visit again.

This is a VERY LATE REVIEW. 
I had visited this place when it had just started. One of the first themed restaurant in Kolkata.
The waiters were dressed in animal prints. I had loved the food, although I have heard that the quality has deteriorated. 
The highlight of the day was the chicken tandoori. It was not the typical orange coloured tandoori but white in colour and the best part was that they added alcohol on top of it and lit it infront of us. It was delicious.

This is a cool jungle-themed restaurant with a bar located on the 4th floor of Mani Square mall. The smiling statue of an African tribesman and a gloomy goosebump-raising cave-like entrace along with a stationary elephant greet you as soon as you enter the 'machaan.' The inside almost reminded me of the River Cave boat ride along a narrow watery canal in Nicco Park. Apart from the dim lighting, the effervescent junglelike interior decor consisted of leafy trees jutting out from nooks and corners, creepers and creepy crawly bugs and reptiles in hidden niches or on the rugged ethnic walls, jungly birds perched atop tree-like foliaceous hanging branches, tree-top wooden verandah, and some other exotic animals looking down upon the guests with curious stares and vigilant eyes as the waiters and staff rushed from table to table to render swift and prompt services.

Our vivacious host for the night was cordially inviting and courteous, warmly offering his gracious assistance should any misfortune occur, and polite enough to serve our foods for us and explain the dishes before jotting down the orders, enlightening us to the possible taste and ingredients contained in each item. Service was immaculate, and a bit too fast I guess. The captain made sure to visit us to enquire about our eating experience, to ensure our utmost comfort and check whether we had encountered any complication or discomfiture. The ominous, uncanny yet enigmatic forest sounds playing in the background along with some really fast-paced beats of tribal music sometimes interspersed with Middle Eastern Muzak made for a suitable setting for a delightful jungle gastronomic safari. The cutlery too had been arranged and placed neatly on the table matching the forested theme - the spoons and forks were shaped like branched/forked tree boughs.

We ordered the Bhatti Murgh or Griddle Cooked Chicken - juicy chunks of chicken infused with mint and green chillies and finished on a griddle - for appetizer as suggested by our host, accompanied with complimentary papad and onions, which was followed by tandoori roti and Paneer Makhanwala - charcoal-grilled cottage cheese simmered in a rich tomato gravy - in the entree. The paneer could have been spicier which would have escalated its taste to a perfect buttery tanginess and zing. Roti was soft, easily tearable. As for the appetizing skewered chicken morsels or the Bhatti Murgh, they were simply mind-blowing. Anyone would want to have a second helping of those scrummy, tangy, chickeny tidbits. The main course was concluded with lukewarm water in bowls for cleansing hands, also to be squeezed with juice from limes provided in the liquid. Fennel seeds or (sweet) saunf, tiny rock sugar candies or mishri or even toothpicks served in many restaurants after the meal were amiss. Sauces, chutneys and other condiments were kept in little pots, though, for the guests' use as they wished.

Personally I felt value for money as far as taste goes is on the poorer side, and should be enhanced a little. Quality of some food - but not all - is not quite fresh to some extent. Another aspect to be noted : the table napkins gave off a faint smell and felt slightly oily. Usually a restaurant can be judged by its cleanliness via its napkins, since the fresher and odour-free the hand towels are the more efficient is the restaurant's maintainance.

Themed around a 'machaan' this is quite an old restaurant that opened years back, serving delish North Indian cuisine. If anyone's looking for an off-beat, quaint, funky theme and well-maintained quirky buzzing ambiance speckled with the low eerie hum of forestial creatures like occasional elephant trumpets and growls of tigers amidst light hustle and bustle, then one can surely head to Machaan.

Staff n service was really fast, quick and responsive.. Cumin to food.. Lots of options for Veggies and a special menu for those who take no onion no garlic food.. Starting with the starters.. If u are in a grp then best is to go for a platter n u can have different varieties all in 1.. Pineapple n mint flavored mocktail was really fantastic.. In main course we have tried a whole lot of items from Paneer, Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta, Palak Corn n different types of bread.. All were delicious n yes a special mention d quantity served is too much which is sufficient for many so before u order any dish do keep it in mind.. Rice dishes n Deserts were also wonderful.. Not to forget the papita achar n other chutneys which they specially prepare.. In short an alltogether luvly n stomach full experience.. Rates are usual as compared with other such typical restaurants.. Definitely a must visit place n will very soon try this place again with family and friends..

I would like to suggest never to go out for dinner on sundays. On sundays whole of the city comes out for dinner and this kind of overcrowding can seriously expose all your (restaurants) weakness. Seriously I was exposed to such weakness of  a restaurant . Sometimes the crockery tells you how old is the restaurant the plates had so many scraches that they were visible to naked eye . Food was okaaaay. The service as I said is expected to get delayed on sundays.

The themed restaurant is in on the top floor of Mani Square mall in bypass..
It is a jungle theme with small LED lights which is jus enough to let u see Ur food..(may be bcz u can't see other things around u...). It even has different animal sounds playing in the background which adds to the overall ambeiance...
The spoon and forks end were designed to match the theme...
As I am a hardcore vegetarian, we ordered Panner Rawalpindi for starters which was above average in taste..Banarsi Kofta was our main course(qty is enough to serve three people)Breads were of decent size.
We were welcomed with a complimenatary salad Papad..
I was very excited to drink a pitcher of DEW but to my disappointment it was not there..
We ordered Fresh lime which wa extremely sweet and not at all prepared well..And the quantity was below the price charged..
One good thing was when I wrote the same in their review card the manager out there was courties enough to answer my view and apalogise for the same.
Another good thing was when in between the meal I tried to serve the food my self, seeing that the waiter came and served .which showed their activeness and good service..
So I give the following rating-
Food-3/5
Ambeiance-4/5
Service-4.5/5
KEEP FOLLOWING FOR MORE REVIEWS..

The only positive part experienced is "out of box" theme, Kolkata lacks such mostly.
Talking about negativity:
1. Basic reception is nearly zero as employees doesn't have any inter-communications! We booked a table of 5 & when reached the other guy had no idea.
2. The spoon although themed but was so heavy apparently disrupting in meals.
3. Food service time was longer than anticipated.
4. Food quality was overrated.

I have been particularly in awe of this forest themed restaurant. The fancy of dining in a forestland is truly served by the ambiance of Machaan completed with the background music, the lightings and the huge tree which spreads up like in forests. The food is quite delectable. Tried the fish and chicken kebabs and loved the fish particularly. Ordered naan, dal and butter chicken for the main course and the butter chicken distinctively stood out in taste. The guys serve phirni for dessert and it was pretty neat. Overall a good dining experience. Recommended!

Gives you a jungle feeling. Tried the biriyani which was above average. But the kebab preparations like tandoori chicken and malai kebab was good enough. Murgh lababdar was decent.

The place has such a magical ambience that you will eventually dissolve in it.
Theme centric restaurant built with a jungle keeping in mind.
Super interesting decoration and interesting sounds that plays all the time. Easily engulfs you in the  feel.
Moving to the essential thing about any restaurant is its food.
The food is awesome here both quality and quantity wise.
Though quite not satisfied with the quantity but still good enough.
If you love north indian food, it is a must try then.

Last afternoon we were 4 people at Machan to have our lunch.Ambience is good but as per my concern the light is very low though it suits with the theme.
Firstly there very few fish items with exorbitant price with a very flat taste eg;Vetki Tandoori & Lahsuni Jhinga.
Secondly the service was very slow.
Third the service charge are calculated twice one food another for drinks.
Chicken starter was good among those all I can say.
All beer is not available however it's there in list.
So it's not a good experience with Machan as this was my third visit and had to write this.

I visited Machan with my fiance on the day of Poila Boisakh to take our lavish lunch. Though its a day to celebrate everything in Bengali style but we decided to celebrate the special day in a Hatke mood.... so we reached at this place... 1st of all I must appreciate the interior decoration which depicts a typically jungle theme... we took buffet and seriously enjoy the kebabs and off-course non-veg items. though we are purely non vegetarian, my fiance even did not go to the veg counter. But just to taste I took some preparation in veg like yellow dal,chapati..but it is found that the quality of those items are not upto the mark.... Hence we are non-vegetarian and off-course went there to enjoy the non veg items we should not have any complaint. But for the vegetarians the taste of veg items should be improved.
I must say the staffs are really prompt and well mannered... 

Thumps up to the team of "Specialty group of Restaurants" . I cherish the food indeed.

Went twice to this place. Ambiance is out of the box, a very good theme. Well maintained interiors and well mannered staff.
Food was too good. Ordered a Veg labab platter in my first visit and a non veg kabab platter in my second. Both of them were delicious.
In main course one should surely try steamed rice and kadhai jhinga. If your choice is bread and you are with few more people, roti ki tokri would be the best choice. It's an assortment of different kind of breads including lachcha paratha, butter nun, tandoori roti...
I took Mutton rogan Josh with the bread which was awesome. Tender Mutton in rich and spicey greavy. 
They also have some dishes which comes on charcoal and it has an effect of Sizzler....looking forward to try it next time.

Overall, delicious food in unorthodox ambiance with reasonable price.

Yesterday was our The Jungle Book Day...so after the exciting movie we chose to visit another jungle...Machaan, Mani Sq. We were greated well and were informed about some fixed menu to pick from at 475/-.... I and my friend both were enthirlled with the ambience...prickles, papad, hot plates- so far so good. It started with Chicken Shorba...No taste...loadssss of oil...managed to have it after adding some lemon and peper...The chicken tadoori was just ok... sarson fish tikka was very good...good quality fish melted in mouth...though they were poorly served...the waiter put fish over the chicken...infact all the waiters were very casual...the jeera rice was complementry and that along with dal was decent...butter chicken was way too sweet so as the naan, as sweet as bun....dhaniya chicken was pretty bad...The paratha was nothing but atta roti with butter brushed on it...on desert there the gulab jamun with ice cream and firni were very ordinary...portions were too small to fulfil your apetite....worst part was all the food tasted very bland and sweet....carried away by ambience we landed in a island of highly mediocre food...

It started off with great excitement to see the interiors..awesome was the ambience..they placed papads n chutneys as we all got seated. Their fish preparations are undoubtedly good. But the chicken ...it was too sweet to be had with naan. Also we had ordered malpua..which was aweful to taste n cost was on the higher side. Hence the mood was totally down by the time we ended off our dinner.

This is one of the finest north Indian restaurant in Mani Square mall. It will give you a feel that you are inside a jungle. The Service is awesome because of the caring attitude of the staffs. The dishes are are very testy and well cooked. You can try the Multani Paratha (one of my favourite) and Bhetki Tandoori. Overall it will give you feel good factor which will make you happy.

If one fantasize of a lunch/dinner in a jungle amidst d calls of nature, Maachan @ Mani-square Mall off EM Bypass is your destination. Built in a jungle theme, this restaurant is a perfect place for a adventurous soul with a mindset of eating out in a different ambiance. The non veg dishes are priced at an average of 400/- each and the veg @ 350/- each. Quality of food deserves praise and so does the hospitality of the staff. Quantity is average. The ambiance is enjoyable all through. My first visit was my birthday hangout with family and it made a mark in my mind. An average price of 1000/- per head can be shelled out for the combination of all above.They offer buffet on weekdays and there are corporate discounts (no TCS) also..Must visit..

Located in Mani Square Mall, Kankurgachi. Gives a feel of dining in the jungle because of the theme associated with this place. The service almost provides a fine dining experience. We had their Tawa Subz Nizami, Garlic Naan and the cocktail 'Shikari Shambhu Delight'. All were good. I would like to go again wit more people to try out more of their dishes. Especially the non vegetarian dishes.

Went to Machaan for lunch yesterday. Since me and my friend were had heavy Breakfast we thought of ordering less items.  We started with papad and mix veg pickle. Then we ordered Dhuandar Lal Murgh Tikka which was served in a small tandoor. The tikka was juicy with fine hint of red chillis with 8 medium size pieces which is good for two people. After this we ordered Ajwaini Parantha and Kadai Paneer. I must say the Ajwaini Parantha with kadhai Paneer is a deadly combination. The aroma of ajwain mixed with soft paneer and thick gravy is an experience in itself. One ajwain Parantha is good for one person, it's so heavy. I food was lovely and made even more special by excellent service by Prashant and team. Will look forward to come here again. Cheers!

Well honestly , we had no real intention of visiting this place unless a friend of mine had purchased some profitable deal on groupon! 
We had only ordered Dhuandhar laal murgh Tikka and Vegetable biryani since we were hell bent on not exceeding the deal criterion (winks and laughs)
Food was genuinely good. One could call it a perfect combination of quality and quantity! A very creative decor inside followed by a mild instrumental music which perfectly suits the theme! Although we initially had certain issues with the management, the good staff totally won me over later on! 
Also, they have a complimentary pineapple chutney along with the pickles and sauces, which , being a bong, I simply loved and cherished!

It took a long time to serve the starters and then 15-20 mins for the main course to arrive. 
Starter - Dhunandhar Lal Murgh Tikka was awesome. 
Main course - I personally didn't like Kosha mangso bcoz it was not that spicy. Murgh Tikka lababdar was also tastes sweet. Butter nun was like Lachaa paratha!!!!!!!!!!!We were waiting 15mins for the bill......

We were sad when the original Sigree at Silver Spring shut down. Later on we came to know that their entire menu has been shifted to Machaan.
We love the food here - especially their Dal Machaan and the Dilli wali Tikki. These two are must haves at this place. The decor also is quite good.

Two complain would be that their cutlery - while fancy - is hard to get accustomed to and the lighting in the restaurant is very dim. You have to strain your eyes to see properly

I went to Machaan with my office Colleagues . The place is like Super Cool with good interior and service is even fast.
 What I liked was when we said them to bring the Birthday Cake , they did even played nice Songs for the Occassion. The Food was really good like we ordered:
Jal Jeera Mojito - It tasted Really good. Not Like In other restraunts where it isnt chilled enough
Frozen Tamarind- We tried it for the first time , it was really disappointing as the drink contained a large quantity of Jal Jeera which spoiled the drink
Kadhai Paneer- This was really Yumm, Mouth watering , Paneer presented in such a nice way
Dal Machaan- This was even good, and served in a nice way
Cheese & Garlic Nans- They were good and even hot when served.. nicely cooked and not over cooked
The onions and papad was the best 
overall Machaan is a nice Restraunt To Dine In for any Occassion

Well to begin with, I was super excited to visit this restaurant for quite some time, as it I had never visited a Themed restaurant before. So, I finally made it to Machaan on the 1st of Jan 2016 to celebrate the New Year. Since the seats were reserved, so we didnt have to wait in a queue to get our seats.
On entering the restaurant, I could get a feel of the Jungle, with the backdrop jungle sounds and the forest decor. There was a treehouse designed in the middle of the restaurant, and one could dine in there, at the top, to get the feel of dining in a treehouse. Even crockery were shaped to bring in the forest atmosphere. The entire concept seemed interesting to me.
Being New Year's eve, the place was crowded and all the seats occupied. The staff was courteous. I would say that the service was prompt, as the menu card was served and orders taken quickly in no time, but the delivery is a bit delayed, but I would not rate on the same, as I could see that there were quite a lot of people to be taken care of, which might have contributed to their tardiness on that day.
Delving into the food talk, for the refreshers, we ordered three Jal Jeera Mojito and a Basil and Pineapple Swirl. I liked the taste of the Basil & Pineapple Swirl, it was refreshing. But the Jal Jeera Mojito, did not meet my expectations.
For the starters, we had ordered a plate of Rann - E - Machaan and Dhuandar Lal Murgh Tikka. Being an appetizer, a portion of Rann - E - Machaan serves two people, whereas the latter served four people. Rann - E Machaan is a roasted lamb preparation, it was delightful to taste, soft to eat. It is definitely the USP of this restaurant. Dhuandar Laal Murgh Tikka, was served piping hot in skewers placed in a pot. It tasted awesome.
For the main course, we ordered 1 Masala Kulcha(each Kulcha was divided into 4 pieces), Kasha Gosht(mutton preparation in thick gravy) and Murgh Tikka Lababdar.It was the best Masala Kulcha, I have had till date. It was surprisingly soft and chewy. The Murgh Tikka Lababdar was cooked well, and blended well with the Masala Kulcha. But I was utterly disappointed with the Kasha Gosht. It tasted stale. All of us had to throw away some pieces, as it tasted too bad to be ediible.
The Dessert ordered was brownie with Ice Cream. I was shocked to find that the staff took the item name almost literally and placed a scoop of Vanilla ice cream over a piece of Brownie. It looked like I had ordered the two items separately. I did not like the presentation and taste of the dessert. It was a complete turn around from my expectations.
All in all, It was a pleasant dining experience at Machaan, except a few issues. Would like to team to go through my review and improvise on a few things. That would give me the confidence to visit this eatery again in future!!

I have known the name of Machaan at Guwahati while spending vacation there... We visited there to have good a dinner and guess what! Machaan didn't disappointed us....
Afrer having good impression I visited the Kolkata outlet of Machaan with my friends and really had the same satisfaction which I had previously...
Machaan is in fourth floor of mani square at kakurgachhi...
Now what I liked most about Machaan is the ambience , the decoration and the environment of forest... It is like after entering through the front door you will feel as if u are in jungle or something ... statues of Tigers , Elephants , crocodiles , rhinos etc , artifical trees in the middle , the small bridge at the entrance , the dim and dark environment , the wooden tables , the spoons , glasses, the artificial raining in one side and the background musics all are part of that forest ambience ... Really hats off to the decoration ... Best ambience of a restaurant seen by me till...
Now coming to the foods, More or less all the North Indian and Mughlai dishes we had there were very delicious...
Among them Kurkuri Bhindi, Lasooni Jhinga, Murgh Malai kebab are best and too spicy in starter ...
In main food we had Dum cooked Aromatic rice chicken and mutton biriyani , Roti ki Tokri( a plate of thandoori roti, laccha parata , naan 2 pieces each) , Adraaki Murgh , Murgh tikka labbabdar...
Every item was different and perfect spicy...
Biriyani tasted really good neither too oily nor too spicy ... Rooti ki tokri was a good choice and sufficient for 2 people...
Service was also good...
#A Must try for its Outstanding Ambience...

Very nice ambience. A li'l bit dark but praiseworthy. Had tanduri Kebab platter which has fish, chicken, mutton and Prawn Kebabs, 3 of each type. Kebabs were just melting in the mouth. Biriyani and Dhaniya Chicken was delicious. Only backdrop is the price. EXTREMELY overpriced and on top of that they charge 30% tax extra on your bill. This is just bullshit. Otherwise I would have given it a 4.

Machaan, a restaurant under the Speciality Restaurants group lives up to your expectations. The theme inside the restaurant is that of a jungle. The place is dimly lit and the ambience is good. 
We ordered Raan e Machaan for starter which was an entire goat leg, grilled. It will serve 3-4 persons. It tasted quite good and the meat was tender. For main course we ordered garlic naan, tandoori roti, kosha gosht and mutton biriyani. The kosha gosht is spicy and rich and tastes really good. The biriyani is expensive but it serves 2 persons and tastes very good. Pinacolada(Cocktail) and Fruit Punch(Mocktail) were very good to taste as well. 
The service here is top notch and the place is  definitely worth a visit.

Dal machaan, multani paratha were nice.. the kebab platter was a lil too much on the chillies.. the service was absolutely absolutely pathetic.. even the senior managers were busy removing the papad bowls and not bothered about asking for customers feedback.. not expected from speciality group standards. The firni was awful. The quantity was decent. The jal jeera mojito was asked to be made with less ice, and ultimately it was made very sweet. The bar man couldn’t even adjust the sweetness to the lack of ice.. pretty awful experience.. to repeat there were so many staff members around but god knows what the hell they were doing... not sure whether the restaurant should be recommended or not..

The food was nothing to complain about. But its overtly costly. Actually you end up paying for the ambience. So I won't recommend to visit the place just to try out the food, but visit if you are looking for a good theme restaurant. Another downside is a very limited menu choice.

There are not many theme restaurants or eateries in kolkata.The other two I can think of are bikers cafe and the Royal Bengal Tiger Cafe.

Hence,Machaan is very close to my heart.

I think the decor is a bit over the top but heck,it's the forest they are recreating.Also coming from the group they have I think they have tried to recreate the food habits of the Sahibs and the fresh game they cooked after shikaar in the nearby jungles.

We had the chicken tikka,the mutton sheekh kebab,the dal and rotis and kulchha.All good,all a little rough and with the accompanying chutney and a healthy appetite it was sheer eating pleasure,if I may borrow the tagline of BMW.

Keep up the good work guys

This is the only theme based restaurant near salt lake. Located in Mani square mall, this has a nice darkish jungle theme. There is no space crunch and tables are nicely widely spaced and even With few tables upstairs on a "tree top"..I prefer taking these tables. Coming to the food , I love the pakhtuni tandoori murg here in starters. Being hard core non veg , I seldom order veg dishes..so can't comment about veg dishes much. I love Amritsari kulcha / multani paratha dipped in murg tikka lababdar. I keep it light and simple here.

Wow ! Finally we made it to MACHAAN !
Its a very nice place with jungle theme. The interior is well decorated with trees,wild animals n dim lighted with music that of animals n tribal.
The place is spacious too.
And coming on food I must say its tastes awesome tasty.
We ordered chicken tandoori that was served in sword ! Then steamed basmati rice with mutton roganjosh.
At the end we had phirni(tastes so so) and sizzling brownie with ice cream. The presentation of food is very eye catching.
The staffs are well behaved and satisfied with their hospitality.
Even the crockeries are designed as per their theme.
A must visit ! Though it cost a lil extra but it worth it :)

Machaan has brought about a revolution in the way one sees a restaurant.Its themed-forest interiors and furniture has just transformed the ambience one could normally experience in a restaurant.Even the cutlery bears a resemblance to forest-like atmosphere.Even when not in the forest,it would give you the feeling of being amidst nature especially if you dine on the raised platform or "machaan".Further,the african jungle music too adds to the forest-like environment.

Coming to the food,I would say that we had ordered for a pot of Subz Dum handi,a bowl of Dal Machaan,a piece of Chilli Onion Kulcha and 3 pieces of tandoori roti.Coming to the vegetable,I would say that the taste and the quantity could not have been better.No foodie could point out a way to better its taste.The quantity is too much(Believe me).Further,the dal was luscious too.It is similar in taste to our traditional dal makhni.We were two in number so we were given 2 bowls and the quantity was so immense that both these bowls was filled in twice before it got empty.The kulcha we ordered was worth ordering but the TANDOORI ROTI NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.Do not go for it although it is cheaper by price.To our utter surprise,we were served with 2 rounds of  4 pieces cone-shaped papads on complimentary,a plate of salad in place of the regular onion salad and 2 bowls of 2 gulab jamuns with ice-cream scoups on complimentary.What more can you ask for?Our stomachs were brimming with food.

Coming to the service,I would say that the service is excellent and I mean it.The stewards and the waiters exceeded the saturation point of courteous behaviour.They were alert to serve the remaining food even after serving us primarily.The service is quick too.They were very disciplined and always smiling.They constantly asked us whether everything is right or not.They did not hesitate in addressing our queries.

My ratings are as follows:
Food-4.5/5
Ambience-5/5
Service-5/5
Value for money-5/5
Overall-19.5/20(4.9/5)

Ambience and service is excellent. Proper servitude mentality they possess so full marks to them. 

Coming to food, good in fact. I would say value for money as in you get good proportions. 
Starters are nice, so is the biriyani. 

We went on a groupon deal, there was initial tiff from management side to accept and accommodate wid the deal but later they showed courtesy and things shall be passed by my side. 

Sure recommended visit.

#Saptami .. Went for a lunch buffet!
Usually they don't have buffets except on some festival like Durga Puja!

Taste- Starters and main course was awesome! Loved the deserts too! Specially the 'Misti doi' and 'Mihi dana'..

Ambience- 'Jungle Themed' .. Tress and Tress everywhere!! Heard sounds of animals n birds! The 'dim lighting' was excellent! There was also a bridge over a small water body with crocodiles! I was in love with the superb ambience! I felt like having lunch in a forest!
Seriously :D

Service/Staff- Always ready to help! Very very polite!

Will visit it again n again :D :D

I have to admit that this was not my first choice @ Mani Square. However, I left this place with a big smile in my face. Food was good and so was the ambience. But what really stands out is the service on offer. I did not have to call the staff even once and neither were they so close to invade my privacy. Pricing is also right. Overall a good family restaurant. Not too bad if you want to hang out with Frens as well.

We have started the food with platter with chicken and prons . The prons were ok the chicken was really good . The main course was really a delight to have . It was really delicious and of good quantity  . And then the quality of service provided by the staff was really good they were very fast and the serving was also upto the point . I will give 4.0 star for good theme food and services . Have a really good time with your family.

One of the oldest restaurants inside Mani Square with an phenomenal interior decoration. A restaurant to give you feel as if you are residing inside a jungle...the light and shade effect, the chirping sounds of birds, a mild music give you a feeling of a different level. The food was nice in terms of quality and quantity but the rates are bit higher. I visited this place once only and that also around 6 years back may be. One thing, I believe they should think of is to start the buffet service because the 2 other restaurants beside Machaan, that is Haka and Flame and grill - both have buffet and eventually pull the mass and comparatively this restaurant is somehow doesn't get that show.
P.S : Visited Mani Square few days back and found that they have started buffet on non-holidays for a price of 450+tax 😀😀

Ambiance and decor wise this place is a hit with its jungle themed decor and seating. Perfect for couples on a date as they have cozy seating arrangements. But since we had a family lunch here we found the lighting a bit too dim.
Coming to its food, we had its buffet spread. The food was just above average nothing exceptional, but they had a good variety on their spread. Overall, the food was just passable.
Pricing wise it is just decent, not much of a pinch in the pocket.

I have never been to disneyland, or Suncity as a matter of fact- yeah, that place where they used conduct Miss World pageant ages ago, but I strongly believe this place would come pretty close to that. Or, it may not- who am I kidding. But, hands down, it's a fun place for eating out. Food is good, but not that innovative as they pretend to be. 

Then again, the ambience takes both the cherry and the cake. Even when I visit other places on the same floor of Mani Square, I surreptitiously take a peek.

The truly amazing thing about this place is their Jungle Themed Ambience. They have gone all the way to live up to their theme, everything about the place is in sync with its Jungle Theme, right from the cutlery used to the music. The service is also pretty good. Coming to the food, we ordered a few kebabs for starters, Butter Naan & Dhania Murgh for Main Course. The Kebabs were a bit tough & dry, and didn't have any distinct flavour as such. The Dhania Murgh was good, and was perfect to go with the naan. The food is ok, nothing out of the ordinary, but the place is worth a visit for their ambience.

Visited this place with great expectations, but as soon as I took the first bite, all those expectations were shattered. Despite being a festive day, there wasn't any unnecessary rush, even then the service was disgusting! Nobody bothered to serve anything on the table, nor were there anybody to assist at the buffet counters. Now, coming to the food. It was absolutely cold, and no flavour at all, whatsoever. The quality of the food was also below standard, with high chances of falling sick after eating it.The menu wasn't appealing either.
Verdict: under no circumstances is this place worth visiting. Your children might like the rainforest decor, but you wouldn't want them to fall ill soon after :)

I had dinner with my family at this restaurant in Jan end 2016. Last time I tried food here was few months back and honestly, it is great to see that they have only improved from there. After trying food in several restaurants across the city, my honest opinion is Machaan is THE BEST. 

First is the food. It is the star attraction and undoubtedly the best in town. The non veg kebab platter contains 3 pieces each of chicken, fish, mutton and king prawn. The fish is cooked so well that it just melts into your mouth. Prawns are jumbo size. Chicken and mutton kebabs are outstanding. I can try the platter just for the fish one – it is that good! With 12 pieces at a cost of 510 bucks, it is a good value for money.

In the main course, try the Multani Paratha. In my experience, I have never had a paratha anywhere else which is that tasty. You can just eat it – even if you don’t have any other dish with it. I tried Paneer Makhanwala – that was excellent too. 

Then the courtesy of the people. Today, there are many restaurants that offer fine dining and polite staff. But Machaan people are surely better. I give them a 5 out of 5. 

You know the ambience anyway if you have visited it before. But for  people who are planning to visit for the first time – it is a forest themed restaurant. You will be amazed to see their attention to detail. It is not just the overall look and feel of the place, but even the spoons, fork, tables, washroom, plates – everything gels so well with the theme. 

From a price and quantity perspective, I will say it is a great value for money. The quantity that they serve in each bowl in a main course is enough to serve 2 and even 3 in cases. If you already have a good starter, then the main course you can just share with your 2 other friends. You never feel that you are paying more!

All in all, Machaan, according to me, is the best restaurant in the city. If I have to take someone for a great dining experience, this is where I will take him/her to.

This review comes as part of my long pending retrospection of how Kolkata treated my taste buds. Machaan happened a couple of months back and the one aspect still fresh in mind is the authentic jungle feel. With animals, crawlers and creepers (not real ones☺️) adorning every corner of the place it's a walk in safari there.The Congo beats, birds chirping and insects creaking in the wilderness only heighten the feel.The huge snake "guarding" the bar area and the jaguar gazing down at me from a tree top nearly gave me the heebie jeebies!😰 Even the forks and spoons resemble broken twigs. In short, the restaurant deserves a perfect 10 for its alignment with the jungle theme.Now coming to the food part, it's pretty average given the huge amount of work that has gone into luring customers.Our prawns at best tasted bitter(seemingly undercooked), the veg dishes were fine but again, the biriyani ordered by one of us was pretty average. To add to this, one of their most unique offerings has a miserable flip side.Its nearly impossible to get a firm grip on the twig shaped cutlery. It kept turning inwards making it difficult to pick food off plates.The pricing was high.Five people eating just about average to little food shouldn't amount to 5K. We ended with a neutral verdict about the whole experience as the food sort of failed to live up to the sheen of the ambiance.The staff is really courteous.I feel a little more attention to bring the level of the food up to the standards of the pricing as well as the theme should make this one of the most sought after eateries in the city!

This is one of the speciality group restaurant located at the Mani square mall.. It's a theme based restaurant with a jungle theme... Ambience and decor wise superb ...one of the best for couples as well coz they have some tables up on the artificial trees like tree house.. That's awesome....

Coming on the food .. It's pretty average.. Nthg special.. I had biriyani its more of heavy in taste..  Other kebab n main course side dishes are quite good ... But the price is a little to heavy on pocket ... 

Service wise a bit slow when it comes to serve a big group... But they are co operative and polite which I liked very much.

Overall I wud say food wise nthg exceptional but ambience wise worth a visit.

One of the most interesting themed restaurants of the city.I have noticed people going all guns about its jungle based theme,artificial trees and branches..dim light ambiance..Jungle mein mangal with lazeez foods ;) But what people fail to appraise is its quality of food.I must say you get really good food here.The north indian food has its predominance here.

I liked pakhtuni murg kabab & kakori kebab in starters,main course had good variety of mughlai foods..i liked murgh kalimirch,kareli rogan josh & the dish which i liked the most was Kosha gosht

Went there for dinner yesterday. Liked the ambiance a lot. Kids will surely enjoy. But their service is pathetic. We entered at 7:45 pm and ordered for some drinks, starters and main course all together. We took maximum 15 minutes in placing the orders. They took around 30 minutes to serve 5 mocktails, one beer and 3 starters. I wanted to have my fresh lime soda sweeter so asked for some sugar syrup at least thrice to different persons till they finally got it after 20 minutes. No, the ordeal was not yet over. The main course arrived at 9:50 pm (Yes I checked the time). That too after walking to the restaurant manager and complaining about it. The biryani was half cooked. The food was not something extra ordinary. The price was exorbitantly high. But would definitely like to add that though they were late in serving, the senior staffs were courteous and apologetic. But I would not like to go back there again.

The environment here is truly authentic and the ambience will make you feel like you're actually in a jungle. But that's about it, the service takes ages, the food here is just above average and the liquor here quite expensive. FYI all the hard drinks price mentioned in the bar menu is for 30ml pegs only which is also located at the bottom of the page, in a microscopic font. For a bespectacled guy like me, making out those words in a dimly lit environment is next to impossible. The price:quality ratio isn't very good. If you're on a tight budget or would like to go out for a drink, I highly recommend that you avoid this place.

Ambience is awesome . Foods at awfull. Totally overpriced restaurant . Even street foods tastes better than machaan's over priced food. Mutton dish was pathetic. First it was tasteless , then salty ! Then I told them to pack it. Finally had it after mom gave it a good finish. I will never go there and will not recommend anyone to visit Machaan.

A total jungle type experience. From the interior decor to the chairs and tables and even the plates and spoons. Everything seems to have been grown from trees. To enrich your experience they even have the sounds :P, moving on the food is awsum... Try the lamb dishes with wine. It's a bit on d pocket heavy side so choose ur dishes carefully. :)

Went there sometime back to have lunch. Had an North Indian Buffet....Its a Jungle themed Restaurant.... Ambience is nice...service is good....but the number of items in the buffet was nice....the buffet consisted of 4 starters...a chicken kebab, mutton kebab... a potatoe salad, and crispy chilly baby corn...
The Main Course comprised of:
1. Chapati
2. Dal Makhani which was my favorite of the whole buffet... And it was the best i ever had
3. Mustard Basa Fish....average is tast and quality
4. Kardai chicken... Not upto the mark....
5. Chicken biriyani...which was served to us in little amounts
The Dessert Comprised of:
1. Vanila Ice Cream with Brownie the second item of the buffet which i liked..
2. And some tiny gulab jambun...which fell short in tast..
POINT TO BE NOTED:
     Here the buffet i had was @a bit different its not like...the awesome buffets of Barbeque Nations, Flame and Grill or Mainland Chain...where u move about and take ur favorite item...as much u like...here in MACHAN the food is served by MISER WAITERS....who..will ignore or will provide delayed response when asked for a particular item of ur choice in the buffet.... Its lacks the FREEDOM OF HUNGER we can hav in other restaurants mentioned above...

The uniqueness lies in the ambience of the place giving a totally wild life feeling sittin amid a jungle. The aritifical sounds of animals roamin makin sounds with a distant tribe beating their bongs gives another "hatke" experience. Coming to food  ,its on the better side. Nothing extravagant to be mentioned. Chicken preparations are well off specially the barebequed and grilled ones with different bases. Amongst veg do try out the mushroom based dish, the paste is quite nice and the mushrooms are large and munchy. Do try out tawa paratha and pudina paratha. Ordering 3 rotis is enough to serve 2. In short wish to have a tree house experience with less oil less masala food, try this place out.

Group of 7 on a weekday afternoon - empty restaurant but food was quite good except the lasooni jheenga (prawn) - murg tikka lababdar was just ok tomato gravy - the stand out dish was bhatti murgh 

When you go with family the only issue is the low lighting due to the forest theme!

Overall satisfied

I'd only recommend this place for the ambiance. The food is overpriced and easily forgettable. Or, I might be biased because it's hard to impress someone who stays in Delhi with "North-Indian food" until it's decidedly remarkable. Surprisingly, what liked most here were the ajwain rotis.

It's one of those restaurants where the ambiance will capture your senses to an extent that you'll feel good as long as you will sit. It's expensive as compared to the other restaurants in mani square mall and a three course dinner for two will cross well over 2.5k. Now in terms of food it's too damn good. The starters especially the barbecued bekti in ajwain seeds deserves a special mention. Being North Indian / mughlai cuisine it's not heavy and you can consume a good deal without feeling stuffed. The fish, rice, chicken and roti everything was one of its kind and it's kinda classy. The service was too good and they used the smile pretty well. I would recommend you to carry your corporate id cards to avail some discounts though ;-)

Yesterday went to try out this "Jungle" themed restuarant at Mani Sq on one of my friends birthday. The ambience was super cool and hapenning. They really tried to give a feel of Jungle and yes to much extent they succeeded quite well. Lightening is dim and perfect to match with the them. Music were light and there were some animals sound to match with the jungle theme.Hospitality is a plus point as all the staffs are friendly and well trained and the service is impressive.

Now coming to the food... I liked every bit of it. It was nicely prepared, awesome taste and also quantity was bit good. We tried crispy chili babycorn and I must say it was really crispy. Then we ordered in main course..some Paneer dish...actual name I dont remember and Dal...both were just too good especially the Machaan famous "Dal". In breads we tried Cheese kulchha, Olive Nan and Roti. All were nicely prepared. In short, we loved the fooding.

They even played birthday song while cutting cake which gave the feeling of perfect birthday celebration.

The only cons I felt was pricing was a bit high. But looking over to food and ambience it can be said to match a bit.

Have visited this place quite a lot of times and I would like to make a special mention that I'm always contented with the food they serve. The quality,quantity,taste all have been maintained. Really impressive. One of jungle themed restaurant and actually gives a feel of jungle. Good to go with family. Very spacious and attractive ambience. Waiters are informative and courteous.
For starters,the best is
Veg Tandoor platter - The palate is beautifully presented which contains Tandoor Aloo,Paneer,Broccoli, Seekh Kebab all tossed in mild spices and a bit of cheese and cream giving it perfect blend altogether.
Dal Machan - Probably one thing which I order always without a miss. Not too spicy,not too sweet; balanced perfectly making it absolute delectable.
Tawa Subz - Contained all sorts of Mix. Veggies and properly cooked and tasted really delicious and best was that the freshness and colour of the veggies was maintained.
Biryani was even moist and had all the flavours and fragrance intact
One thing which they should really consider is their cutlery which is like real heavy coz of which it becomes tough to hold while eating.
Rest,I would keep on visiting it from time to time and would update more on it.

Went there thrice if I remember correctly. First impression was intimidating- yes , I mean it. Its too dark inside and once you enter this place from outside, you ought to feel blindfolded. The made a jungle like atmosphere with a seating arrangement on top also. We took a top floor table. In between, you get to hear the trumpets of elephants and other hissing sounds of a jungle. A good place to be with your kids. I went with my husband and my teenage son. So for us, the ambience didn't appeal much. Not a good experience with food. Most importantly, you won't be able to make out what they are serving because of the darkness. Although a good place to amuse the kids.

Visited Machaan recently after 6 years. Nothing much have changed in terms of decor or menu. This time with my 5 yr old daughter to make her feel the milieu. Full marks on that to Machaan. We sat on top of a Machaan and thus had a birds eye view of the restaurant. The subdued lighting adds an aura of mysticism to the experience. Our order was all regular stuff that you get in an Indian restaurant. All tasted well, specially the Dal makhni. What needs a special mention was the 'Roti ki Tokri' which I thought was sufficient in quantity and variety. Price was quite reasonable as well. As one of the first theme restaurants in Kolkata, Machaan has done well to compete with others in the league.

Situated inside the Avani mall at Howrah, its simply one of the best themed restaurants in the city. The theme is that of a jungle filled with various wild animals and it strikes a chord as soon as you enter the place. The staff is extremely co operative and helpful.However, the main attraction is the food quality...We had biriyani with a few chicken side dishes.. All of them were absolutely delectable and delicious. It was probably one of the best North Indian cuisines i had ever had in a long time..a must visit if someone wants to try out the flavous of the North Indian cuisine!And moreover it is also quite pocket friendly.

A lunch time treat my a colleague to a gang of around 25-30 people. Disappointing experience. They kept serving papad and onions to fill us up and once they got in the snacks they gave it in installments. 

The bad things:
Very poor service quality. Poor management in different tables.
The music playing was not to everyone's taste and they were slow to respond to a request to reduce the volume. 
Limited options when it comes to snacks. Single chicken and mutton item with no variety whatsoever. 
Waiting for a second helping took a long time.
The spoons look good but have zero usability. 

The good things:
Ambience, very much like a machaan
Prompt to change plates before any course
Prompt refilling of salad plates (bad in a way)
Food quality was decent. The fish and chicken as a part of the main dish were good.

The ambience was different than other restaurants and jungle themed with artificial trees, roots, branches etc. We were visiting the restaurant for the first time. The food was decent. We ordered veg and everyone with liked it. The staffs were cooperative. All an all the experience was good. HAPPY EATING :)

The restaurant theme is a bit 'wild' & gives you a feeling of the jungle as soon as you enter. There are artificial birds and wild animals all around the restaurant to give you that forest feel. At the entrance there is this huge black tusker to welcome you into the wold world. 
The food we ordered was average in taste. I liked the ajwain paneer a lot. The bhetki fish was also good but nothing great. The nolen gurer ice cream stole the show. It was delicious.  Overall a nice place to visit with family and friends.

I had visited this place some 5 days back. We had to wait for around 20 minutes but it was worth it. Initially, when we were entering, the restaurant was filled with the smell of damp. We ignored and moved in. We had ordered roti ki tokri,banarasi malai kofta, jeera pulao and dal machaan. The moctails tasted awesome especially the cucumber and curry leaf tang.
The best thing about this place apart from its interiors is that even after being a multi cuisine restaurant, they have a special menu for jain food.
I will like to revisit this place more often. And yes, this restaurant is a must try.

This forest themed restaurant takes one deep into the jungle , with its rhythmic beats and animalistic sounds. The food here , especially the kebabs (the ghalouti kabab in particular) was out of this world! The service too was quick. We celebrated a friends birthday here and Machaan certainly made it a memorable one.

Visited this place last week with my wife. From outside it looks ordinary restaurant but once I entered ...I felt like I am in a jungle... not in a mall...  it is jungle theme interior...  very nice and innovative... service excellent... mughlai food was delicious... try kulcha, chicken tangdi, water melon mocktail it was good... 
little disappointed with TAX ... we made bill of Rs. 1150 + paid Rs. 400 taxes

This one is situated inside the Mani Sqr Mall at Kankurgachhi. The ambience and decoration is unique, its like dining inside a tree house in a jungle. The cutlery was different too. The food was gr8 and the service guys comes to your aid perfectly over what dish to choose. One spoiler alert: price is one the higher side.

Turned out for lunch here with my buddies. To start the ambience is noticeable and you get a feel of dining within nature and its parts. So ambience is a big bonus. Coming to the food- The quality of food was good and when I say good I mean it. I usually find that in Kolkata most of the times the non-veg menus are better cooked but here I found Koftas and other vegetarian dishes to be far superior in taste. So the food was tasty, each and every dish ordered. But on the contrary, I found the service lagging behind. We waited almost for 45 mins for the food to arrive so that's a big turn off. I found this to be one of the biggest reasons affecting my rating of this place.

I think with the price factor which is considerably high, the service should have been top notch. If you are taking the extra money, why do we wait for almost an hour?
I also request the management to change the cutlery i.e, spoon and forks - its a big challenge to comfortably eat with them. Too heavy and they are not meant for eating but only display.

Really really good set up. It's a themed Restuarent and to me looked more of a durga puja themed panadal..... He he... Just kiddin..... Now to the more serious part. There is this festival going on there which has started from May'15 and I ordered all appetizers from that particular menu. Kebabs, both mutton and chicken tasted OK. But I think the mutton was under cooked. Coming to the mutton biryani, from that same menu, lacked good flavor so, again it was OK. Also tried the Tawa sabzi, for me it was rather salty. So going by the ambience cost and food tastes I was not satisfied, hopefully will get better service next time I visit there.

The first impression as you walk in is undoubtedly impressive.. The entire restaurant is a duplex rain forest with tree branches and leaves hanging all around but yet amply spacious. The music complements the African Jungle theme as well.

Coming to food, I had ordered Basil and Pineapple Mocktail, Cucumber Drink, Kathaal Kebabs, Rice and Ginger Chicken.
The drinks were commendable mostly because the ingredients are interesting and tastes fresh from the garden. The food however is VERY average, not living upto the brand name of other Speciality restaurants it belongs to . It pricks all the more because of the big prices on the right.

Service needs a special mention though. The staff is courteous and polite, makes you feel welcome and confortable.

This forest themed restaurant is quite unique and fascinating. Located at Mani square mall, it serves great North Indian food. When you are entering the restaurant, two elephants greet you. There are many artificial trees and animals present. Kids will be fascinated by the decor. But one of the disadvantage of this decor is the dim light. Coming to the food, the quality and taste is wonderful. quantity is also good. Staffs are polite. Definitely recommended, as this is one of a kind restaurant in the city.

I mean I get the fact that now everyone is coming up with these new themed restaurants but seriously if I want to eat in a dark dingy jungle then I will go to a real life camp. I don't like eating at places where I can see wat I am eating !!

Stupid place! In the mad rush to be "different", this jungle themed restaurant opened a few years ago. Can't really see the point of it...if one wants a rustic experience, why goto an artificial ambience with quaint jungle noises, very low lighting, ordinary food and poor service. Simply avoid.

It has a very interesting ambience because of its jungle theme and very low light setting. What makes it more interesting is that it has 2 floors, sitting on the balcony is always the better option. The food is delicious but disappointing quantity. Service was good. Must visit for people who don't mind the occasional pinch on their wallet.

One of the theme restaurants where you can get classical North Indian as well as some authentic Kolkata / Bengali dishes. Went with my wife for a dinner on a Saturday evening and enjoyed the Chingri Malaikari & Kosha Mangsho. Average cost probably would be around Rs 1000/- per head without taxes for a starter, two main dishes. Enjoyed the food quality and the great service.

Visited this place a couple of weeks back. The place is a dimly lit and had jungle caricatures all around. The staff is very courteous and well co ordinated. Ordered a non veg kabab platter and chicken shashlik for the starters. Was blown away by their kababs quite literally . Amazing flavours , succulent and perfect texture. I will go on to say that the seekh kababs in the platter is easily the best in town the fish and the chicken tikka were not far behind in getting it spot on. We ordered a repeat of the platter . For the mains we ordered a kadhai jhinga and a chaanp ka salan ( lamb shanks cooked in a rich gravy ) . The prawns wer spicy and the tomatoes left a tangy aftertaste in the mouth . The lamb gravy was excellently prepared though the lambs themselves were a bit undercooked for my liking . Overall would like to recommend this place to anyone who loves his Indian food and specially the kebabs.

Dim-lit, jungle-theme, tree house seating and all that jazz, but my overall verdict is a 3. Here's why:
1) I ordered Lasuni Jhinga, it was just about OK - small, shriveled pieces of prawns (some had residual shells), taste-wise average like any pepper fried prawn dish. Not worth the price paid (close to 400 bucks i guess). The cheese chicken kebab was also not too bad. The palak patta chat sounded innovative (most of their dishes have innovative names), but lacked in crunchiness. Overall OK.
2) Too dim-lit and cluttered decor (I felt).
3) There is alcohol, but limited options.

Last week, I went to Machaan with family. My wife wanted to go to this particular restaurant for some time. However, this was a more of sudden decision on that day: totally unplanned. Now to the actual review -

1) Ambience - This was the best thing about this restaurant. Arguably, one of the best theme restaurants in Kolkata. With all that machaan look, it truly felt as if in wild. 

2) Food - Naah; did not live to expectation. We had chicken biryani, naan, chicken dhaniya and paneer tikka labadar, none were great. In-fact it was a let down after raising the initial expectation due to the ambience. Mostly too spicy, though eatable, for the taste bud. 

3) Service - It was good, not exceptional. The biggest let-down was when they took orders. There were no suggestions. After taking orders, It was quick, and server brought the food in no time. There was someone who even asked how we felt.

4) Cleanliness - Okay in this front, including the restroom.

In all, a very average experience.

One of the few really articulated theme restaurants in Kolkata. Gives you the feeling as well as the eeriness of dining on a jungle setup. The overall ambiance goes very well with the theme. An amazing place to dine with your girlfriend with the dim lit setup adding to the ambiance. The food is good if not exceptional, servicing is courteous and fast. A bit taxing on the wallet for sure but definitely worth a visit. Alcohol is also served and also adds to the portfolio of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend a visit if you are putting up in Kolkata and looking up for a theme restaurant.

Happy Munchin :)

Machaan is an African themed restaurant serving mughlai dishes. Located at Mani Square, its a not too budget friendly place but then again, the food quality is too good. I had burrah kabab, chicken dum biriyani and mutton rogan josh but the best was burrah kabab. Its a mutton kabab in tandoor style, a little spicy. I would recommend this to everyone who goes there. 
The ambience is good enough with animal calls playing in the background. 
But the service is not good as the waiters need to be called  atleast thrice before they would come to our service even when the restaurant is not crowded or its not peak hours!!!
But overall a good place to visit atleast once!!

The atmosphere was wonderful. The jungle theme with animal sounds is an innovative idea. About the food, the tandoori fish was good except for the fact that the skin of the bhetki was not removed before cooking. The dal machaan is one of the best dal makhani I have ever had. And I liked the murg tikka masala too. Overall it was a good experience and I am satisfied with the service.

Went to machaan quite some time back. The ambiance definitely scores high with the jungle n machaan theme. The lighting is also great for romantic night outs. Went with my friends and ordered a-la-carte. Roti ki tokri and Kareli Rogan Josh. The lamb was really good with succulent lamb pieces in rich aromatic tasty gravy. Rotis were good, since assorted I preferred lachha paratha as the naan became chewy n hard after a while. We ended it up with shakurwali phirni and it was not that great, i have better ones. All in all a good place to try out provided you don;t mind the pocket pinch, which is on the higher side.

The occasion was mom and dad's wedding anniversary and we rushed to Machaan to celebrate. Now it was our first time experience at Machaan though we've visited most of Speciality Group's restaurants.

Talking about the ambiance, the restaurant is jungle themed with all kinds of artificial trees, roots and branches used for decor. Lighting is dim and perfect for some classy dining. There are two floors inside, the ground floor is not that interesting but the first floor is similar to a tree house deck and is recommended if you manage to get table there. Soft music and animal sounds can be heard while dining and the plates and utensils are given a look-n-feel of the theme. Wood-works are at their best inside the restaurant.

For the food, Machaan mainly serves North Indian cuisine. We ordered Barrah Kebab and Bhetki Kebab for starters. The Barrah Kebab was a recent addition to the menu and we ordered it upon their recommendation. It was really delicious and one of the best I have ever had. Only concern was the quantity which could have been more. The Bhetki Kebab was very soft and even came with fish head.

The main course followed with some Mutton Biryani, Murg Kaalimirch and Gosth Kosha. Biryani came in handi and was accompanied with raita. It was not the best I have had, but definitely didn't disappoint. The mutton pieces in biryani was not that soft. Both Murg Kaalimirch and Gosth Kosha were boneless and tasted excellent. The gravies were mouthwatering. We also got ourselves some Naan and Masala Kulcha for which we can't complain.

Pricing is a bit high but it sums up when we consider the food and ambiance. Service is also decently fast however the billing is really slow. It took almost 20 minutes for the billing process to complete including processing and redeeming of card. Staffs are well experienced and polite. The manager is really nice and roams around to keep a check on quality.

So overall a nice place for a Sunday dinner and would recommend this place. Also don't forget to take a camera with you as you would definitely like to take some ambiance shots of the place.

Starting from mocktails to maim course everything ws gud, except d starter I ordered - multaani chaat. Too much sauce. Otherwise gud experience wit gud ambience n efficient staff. The music needs improvement! It's a jungle theme interior but still d jungle music n sounds of the animals throughout ur visit is quite unpleasant. Otherwise a good restaurant.

Ok it's priced on the higher side, considering the ambience and the location. Located just next to flame and grill keeps you tempted to step by. However a bite into the soft juicy chicken malai kebab and raan with rifle gravy with lovely made nuns does help it to stand out. I loved the place and the courteous staff as well

Came here to celebrate a birthday with my full family and had a wonderful time. 
Now on entering you do feel the effect of entering a jungle. It's quite cool actually though why a jungle I don't understand as you are serving moghlai and north Indian style of foods. Neways its fun. My baby sis did get a bit jumpy at first. But tat ain't all. Wait till you enter the loo. Tats when I got jumpy because of the Congo drums tat started playing all of a sudden. Do book a table before going as it does get crowded specially on weekends. 
Now the food is as food as the ambiance. Their kebaba are mouthwatering. The meat absolutely melts in your mouth. If its your first time go for the classics. Try the galouti. U won't regret. Biriyani is just lovely giving many famous biriyani joints a run for their money. 
The prices might be a bit on the high side , I found. It's somewhere in the 4 star range. 
They were lovely enough to give a cake with sparklers as I had booked saying it was a birthday dinner. All in all a fantastic evening.

Machaan was a superb experience for me in terms of food,service and ambience.
Ambience and decor:
Its a jungle themed restaurant.You are greeted with a dimly lit atmosphere with fake trees and animals around you and jungle sounds to make it look more real

Food:
The variety of North Indian delicacies and their equally amazing names amazed me.I had Dhuandhar murgh tikka kebab, butter naan and Chaamp ka salan (a mutton prep).All of them tasted delicious.The kebabs were simply out of the world and nothing like Ive tasted before.So was the salan. Superb quality and good portions, too.

Service:
Extremely courteous staff and very attentive.

Pocket pinch:
Well, the prices are bit on the higher side but the food and the experience is worrh it.

Final verdict: Machaan nails it totally !! :)

Happy Eating! ;)

Been here for the first time for a dinner party with about 15 friends. Starters served were good and with adequate amount. Mutton sheekh kabab, Chicken kabab, and in veg Multani chat were really good. Had tandoori roti, chicken, chicken biriyani. Again the main course was nice and tasty. However serving time was quite slow and at times in between we had to wait a little with empty plates. Desserts included awesome Chocolate brownies and Gulab jamun...

The food quality has improved from last yr. And improved a lot. The last time I went 1 yr nd half back,i dont remember a single dish that i totally loved. But this time it was different.We went on a set menu which had a platter of starters,2 non-veg main course along with chicken biriyani & an assortment of desertes. Totally loved the "Multani chaat" & the fish starter. The mutton kebab was also worth it. The chicken tikka kebab was not soft enough though.The main course was rather a little dissapointing. We tried the "dahi methi murgh" & the "tamatar ki machili". The chicken seemed a lil undercooked. The veg dishes, specially the "dal machaan" is worth mentioning. We had hot gulab jamuns & brownies for desert along with scoop of vanilla ice cream. The brownies were simply awesome....If not for nything else,i can simply go back for the soft,melt-in-mouth type smooth brownies!! The staff was very cordial but the service was very slow. Although we were 16 people,but thy were pre-informed,in which case we expected a faster service. Apart from tht snag,the staff waiting on us were very cordial,insisted on us to try all the dishes on the menu. An extra star for the staff!!

The food is good specially the kababs. They also have a wide range of wine to select from. 
The service is good too. Over all a nice experience.

Machaan the jungle themed Indian delicasy is a treat from speciality group. We went there with a prior booking on Durga puja Navami and though we went early ,it was full within minutes.
Located inside Mani Square mall this is a terrific location for biriyanis,kebabs,ranns and all those Indian delicasy.
We opted for rann and they just give you the mutton leg from flame to plate. It was awesome . You can opt for other kebab , main course dishes.You won't be disappointed with taste for anyone . Apical mention dhundhar paneer . They also have a nicely arranged buffet to their credit . Service was a bit slow but considering the rush on Durga puja navami , it was enough to give you a very good experience with your family and friends. And the monkey,tiger, birds staring from the jungle around add a special feeling .

Ambience: That's its USP. It has the theme of a "jungle at night" with dim lighting, huge trees, fake animals making animal noises and a beautiful tree-house with wooden chairs. It feels really awesome to eat among all of this. I give it 4.5/5.

Food: I tried the North Indian section. It was delicious but not out of the world. Though the ambience hardly lets you complain a thing about the food. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Cordial staff. Speed is a bit low in rush hours but fine in other times. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: It is costly but worth it.

Overall I give it 4/5.

I had already had the pleasure of dining at Machan at the Avani Riverside Mall & here i was again to dine with my family. We chose Machan over Flame & Grill because of the unique new concept designed in the form of jungle.

The decor is quite marvellous and lighting is also done accordingly tough some would find there to be less light but then this is the whole setting. One would simply start liking it as soon as you enter the restaurant. The staff is also good at service and overall the service is quite good.

As for the food it was super delicious as we expected. This is highly expected from the properties of the Speciality Group and they deliver it with quite perfection. Till date i have never enjoyed a sub-standard meal from the restaurants of the Speciality group. They are simply great with what they are into. They are simply amazing in this field.

The crockery was what could be wondered upon. It was unique. I liked the spoons specially. They were designed in the shape of branches. As soon as we sat we were served with complimentary papad, chutnies, onions and pickles. I simply kept on eating onions and papads. Small crisp papads would simply take u away.

We ordered machan special dal, paneer tikka lababdaar and tandoori roti. What I love the most is that they serve a single bread into four pieces. That ways one tends to eat more in small portions. Thats indeed a good thing for our appetite. The sabjis were damn tasty. We savoured both the sabjis and enjoyed thoroughly. Rotis were also well crispy n well made.

This restaurant/property is well recommended by me and thats why I give it full ratings. A must try out by all means.

Went for a Sunday dinner with family of four and was amazed by the ambience created- entered a jungle with giraffes, elephants, branches of trees hanging, also a seating upstairs to give a feel of tree-house dining, background music is birds chirping with occassional sound of animals, lighting is dim but adequate. Ordered murgh shorba which was creamy in taste with chicken chunks, next was murgh malai kebab was hot, soft and absolutely melt in mouth. The next starterd dhuadhar lal murgh tikka was spicy n tangy and very tasty, served hot from a skewer brought to table in a urn. For main course we ordered butter naan and murgh tikka lababdar gravy with latter being a creamy tomato onion gravy.In all the food was yum with brownie points for ambience, though it was sunday dinner crowd, service was hence slow but we enjoyed the experience of jungle.

Went to this place last week with my family. 1st of all the ambiance n the theme is mindblowing. The jungle theme is quiet cool. we were sitting on top of the tree house over there. The food was quiet nice. We took the  Roti ki tokri, mutton biriyani and some mutton chap item. The roti ki tokri was quiet enough to fill the stomach of two very easily. n it costs just 250 + TAX. The muton biriyani was nothing special but not worth the price.:( The mutton chap item was delicious and we have also taken a cocktail name screwdriver that was good!! 
The waiters are very polite. Overall its a good place to enjoy with your special one n family or friends :)

Been here on a Sunday afternoon with my friend. The first impression: awesome, wow! Just as I step inside. The jungle like ambience and almost everything matching with the theme. The only difference I noticed from the guwahati outlet is that they don't play any music here. Food was ok. We ordered a starter(chicken kebab flavored with Kali mirch) to go along with the beer which was absolutely fantastic. The butter Naan for the main course unlike other places  was very soft and thin. The dhania chicken was the item which we could've avoided as there was more of gravy than the chicken pieces. Worst of them all is the service. The waiters were taking so much time that we had to remind them and keep asking them about our food and even for the bill.

It was three years back I guess when this name machaan was quiet popular because it was a jungle theme restro . To be true I just wanted to enjoy the view rather than food :p . It was a complete satisfaction entering the restro. Two artificial elephants welcomed us. Fab ambience , well positioned lights , fabulous caricature of jungle, giraffe , jackal with humming sounds of birds, insects & much more to see there... Finally coming down to food, It was bit spicy, good quantity but high charges. Nalen gurer ice cream was good , well presented and garnished . must try if u want to enjoy a different atmosphere .

The only thing I would really rate Machaan on is the food. It probably serves some of the best Indian delicacies. I loved the Tandoori Bhetki and Cheese chicken tikka for starters. But I must admit the quantity is quite a lot! I also tried the dahi methi murg and dum paneer for the main course. The food will give you no scope for complaints! The ambiance is rather debatable. It will appeal to some people while others might not like the idea of animal figurines hanging around randomly. For me, I didn't mind it. I sat on the upper level, which is sort of a tree house and it gives a good enough feel. Yes, to go with this ambiance, they had to dim the light. But that becomes too dark while you're eating.  It will take you some time to adjust in the dark environment. But they have gone a long way in giving the place a forest-y look. Even the spoons are ending in twig shapes, which is kind of nice! The service is rather pleasing also.  

Whether you like the ambiance or not, you will love the food. Yes, its a little costly, but it is totally worth it! I would definitely want to go back there again! :)

Visited Machaan for a business lunch on a weekday. Not surprisingly we (four of us) were the only customers there.
On entering from the bright sunlight outside, it took a while to get adjusted to the really dark interior of Machaan.
The lay-out is quite forest like.
We were given a table on the upper level.....sort of like a tree house. Interesting ambience, but not too easy.
Getting up the staircase in the dark. A senior gentleman amongst us had a lot of difficulty.

Food: really quite good. The Daal Makhani was excellent. Cooked just as it should be, north indian style, reminiscent of the Dal Baluchi in Delhi. The Raan is their signature dish. Well cooked and tasty both rather a small portion.

Service is a bit slow, considering we werethe only ones there.
Prices: quite right.
Overall: A decent place for indian cuisine.

This place has been decorated well, makes it look like a jungle... Though the lighting at the tables can be improved. Sometimes you are not able to see your partner across the table. The pricing and food quality did not match, leave aside the slow service. We tried few starters, dinner, couple of drinks all on a-la-carte and felt spending so much money not worth it if you are looking at a good dining place. If experience in ambience is your take, then take buffet and enjoy as much as you can. Since, the lighting is too dim, you won't be able to take much pics inside the place. Not worth it if someone asks my opinion.

Went for the third time. 
Had - Veg biryani, matar paneer, makai mirch takatin (soft baby corn). Lime soda. 
Biryani was above average, the reason being it had oddly blended rose water, matar paneer was good but the quantity was overwhelming, infact it was not necessary for two people to have a whole big bowl of the veggie. Lemon salt soda was decent. 

The manager came asked for the quality of the food, when stated about the excess rose water he was quick enough to offer replacement which we didn't do though. 
This is what i liked the most, hospitality is brilliant and so is the ambience. 

Heavy on the pocket for college attenders.
For two of us and only the above stated food the bill was 1650/- 

Also, they offer a speciality cards which will retain you 10% on the net amount as points on weekdays and 5% on weekends. 

Thought - excellent place, unconditionally amazing food (especially the naan kulcha). 
Will return for sure.

This is not that kind of a place where you would rate for the ambiance. It is the decor that will keep hovering over your head. All woods around and hanging leaves with fruits of light. A smell which will surely intoxicate your senses...a typical smell found in the rain forest. The place is very spacious. The top portion is on a tree house section, where one needs to climb through the wooden stairs. The spoons are designed in a way that it looks like one of those branches. A soft sound could be heard in the background which is heard in the forest.

The food...there are varieties. I must mention their 'Multani Chaat'...which is actually tangy aloo. Kababs....yummy....so soft and delicate. A small good news for the vegeterians....you will get varied kind of veg items. What disappointed me here was the firni. I did not like it. I think they forgot to put sugar in it. :p

The food is little costly. Come on dude, you gotta pay extra if you want your meal being served in a forest. Go ahead and enjoy the meals which you might had never thought/heard of.

Its dimly lit but i guess thats the theme. I wish i had explored it earlier . We tried the Roast lamb and it was simply delicious , food is good overall , but the Malai Phirni is the best thing.

Awesome place. I do love this place. First of all the decor will give you a feeling that you are suddenly into a jungle arena from a very busy city life. The wooden floors and furniture  are quite appropriate with the ambience. The lighting is also cool. The staffs are really hospitable which shows how they stress on the quality and customer satisfaction. 

Foods are awesome. Cook is brilliant I must say. Last time, we ordered a lamb preparation RAAN-E-MACHAAN.. a mouthwatering dish it was.. too good.. Other dishes were brilliant too.. Another thing is the presentation of the food.. simply fantastic.. When I first time went there, I thought the food is little overpriced.. but after having the food I must say it is worth spending your money for quality food here. 

A must visit place for all foodies :)

Although the service could use some improvement, the food makes up for it. The ambience is straight out of the wilderness and jungles and their fauna. The brilliant decoration and the dim lighting adds further to the macabre effect. The chicken biriyani at Machaan is a must-eat. Steaming biriyani in a metal cask and the bharta too, are very pleasing to the tastebuds.

Non veg food is very bad, and desserts more more bad. Only veg food is good enough to be enjoyed, so if u need to enjoy ur food in a junglee environment and don't prefer eating veg it's manegble won't say good option but ok ok. Better go to Rajdhani if u want to enjoy veg food :p

Ive been to this place 2-3 times and the food never disappointed me....its got perfect food, ambiance and decor...

To talk about the ambiance though its a really crowded place its really calm....and the decor is awesome....Its got a Jungle(Forest) type view....Monkeys hanging, Birds sitting on branches, branches and vines here and there...And a dark atmosphere inside....It even got a tree house at the center....

Now talking about the food its tastes awesome every time....the cook is really great....I went with my family and ordered a lamb dish......'Chaamp Ka Salan" I think.....It was really mouthwatering.....And the presentation was excellent....They brought an entire leg of lamb and scraped the meat out of it.....of course the other dishes were brilliant too...

A bit expensive though......But i think its a MUST VISIT place for food lovers.....

Machaan is at the top floor of Mani square. 
I visited the place with my wife & daughter on 18th August 2014 (Sunday). Manchaan is the jungle-themed Indian cuisine restaurant & the food was really awesome too. They have the unique cutlery set which is also jungle-themed, the spoon and fork handles resemble tree branches! We ordered the Ajwain Dum Paneer, Murg Tikka Labadar, Masala Kulcha & Jeera pulao  The Murg Tikka Labadar was just awesome! Ajwain Dum Paneer was also good. The time to prepare the food was not that much, staffs were very polite and helpful. Overall a very satisfying experience.

We were half full, so we ordered only Basamati Rice and Raan with Chicken Shorba and Jaljeera. The Raan was just awesome! Shorba and Jaljeera was also good.

Have been there quite many times , but recently their quality somehow have been reduced a bit . The wild ambience what they created in the beginning is not well maintained these days . Any way very good food , acceptable service and good ambience obviously . Quite a good choice for dating or friends and family celebrations . Personally I do prefer their two sitter arrangements upstairs for a date . Every food item is well justified . Esp. Mahi sarsonwali , tandoori  chicken , kakori kebab , murgh kali mirch , champ ka salan , rogan josh and my personal favourite dakshini jhinga curry and rye tamatar ki machli  . All bread items are good . Biriyani just average . I personally recommend you to have plain basmoti rice along with dakshini jhinga curry as a main course accompanied with white wine or kareli rogan josh with kulcha breads accompanied with red wines .  Portions are huge , so single items serves for two .  I definitely recommend this place to every one . 
Last but not the least , this place is over crowded , so always have a prior booking b4 you go .
Costs approx 2500 for two .

Machaan at the top floor of Mani square is such a 'wild' surprise. I took my friend there based on the outstanding reviews posted here on zomato and we were not disappointed. Rather machaan turned out better than our expectations. It seemed like a different world in one side of the mall. The jungle theme decor is really interesting and is the sole reason why we would be going back there. Coming to the food, we had the non veg platter and mutton biryani, both of which were good enough, but could have been better. Another thing worth mentioning is the staff, really courteous they were. In all, an interesting place to take your folks or friends out for a meal. P.s. they have corporate discount so carry your id card with you. :)

Machaan happened out of the Blue...was thinking about paying a visit however could not plan it earlier....a Client Visit made it all Happen!!
Machaan-the word means a raised platform in a forest................so Im guessing that you can understand the restaurant would be a Forest Theme based one...and well...once you enter the restaurant...wallah...you can see its true to its name....the Decor was amazing with a "Machaan" made out in the centre..a forest kind of ambience and wild animals(wax ones) surrounding you while you enjoy the food....the cutlery(forks and spoons) was been custom made to go with the theme-even though it was a little heavy to operate!!
Now coming to the food part-
Initially we were served with Papad with 2 kinds of dip (in a theme based little pots)
We ordered a Non-Veg and Veg Platter, the chicken and the fish was soft and succulent, mutton sheek kabab was tee bit spicy(for people who do not prefer spicy food)...for Veggies...the potato cheese balls are a good option...
We ordered :-
Steam Rice
Dum Chicken biriyani - Well prepared, but do not expect to find an egg and potato as is common in Bengali Biriyanis.
Betki Preparation(speciality of the day) - One whole betki, deboned and cooked and grilled in a spicy curry.
Chicken side dish - soft ,boneless pieces of chicken in a tomato based curry
Matar Mushroom Curry - Cumin flavoured with a zing of pepper , tastes amazing.

So guys lets sum up the score-
Ambience-4.5/5
Staff - 3.5/5 (coz they did not tell us about corporate discounts)
Food - 4/5 (should include more varieties in Non-veg appetizers)


Overall it was a great experience...food coupled with amazing company and their amzing stories about personal experiences.

Must visit for all foodies!!

I don't like their decor that much but ya... the decor is different and impressive. They have the unique cutlery set which is also jungle-themed, the spoon and fork handles resemble tree branches! 
I tried the Kakori Kebab, Cheese Chicken Tikka, Raan-e-Machaan, Kadhai Sabz Pulao and the Murg Kalimirch!  
I loved the Kakori Kebab and the Cheese Chicken Tikka. They were soft and creamy! The Raan-e-Machaan was really amazing! ^_^

Heard from friends about Machaan restaurant at Mani Square … so go there to taste How it is like to have Food in a Jungle environment …
Just got amazed from the entry .. What An Ambience … Really when we sat on the Table we really felt that we r Middle of a Jungle Hut … Amazing 
and they also serve a whole list of Exotic Foods too …
As starter I must suggest Kandahari Seekh Kebab , Kakori Kebab and Bhatti Murgh are also good ..
For main Course I tried Dahi Meethi Murgh , Chaamp ka Salaan , Kareli Rogan Josh ...
And to end the dining they have Rabri and Kulfi …
For all these .. just one word is enough – Awesome
Oh yes they also have some cool Mocktails too ..
only one thing I didn’t like there much and that is their Biriyani ..
The staffs are very helpful and courteous …
Overall, Dining at this beautiful Restaurant is really a Memorable experience ..

I had been there for the lunch buffet which is reasonably priced, considering the sumptuous variety in the buffet menu. However, the variety of desserts could be improved. Quality food and a nice place for private dining. Worth every penny, if one is opting for the buffet.

It is one of the themed restaurants in the country, and the jungle will surely enchant you in a magical way. The space is considerably ample, and the staff are polite.

A perfect theme restraunt... if not for the food I'd love to go there for their ambience. Simply loved the rainforest theme... with two tribal statues out there to invite you and elephants, giraffes, monkeys or birds sitting beside you irrespective of where you get a table. Besides sitting on the deck of the tree house gives in a really cool feeing. To add to this they also have tribal music playing in the background. The spoons, chairs n everything. . Nothing have they missed out to add to the feel!

The food was good.. apart from biriyani I pretty much loved the mughlai food! A light meal doesn't even weigh much on your pocket!

Kudos to this place!

Machaan 
Location: Mani square mall. 

Okay, so not running through the briefs much, I would summarize it in a "to the point" form. 

Ambiance: Jungle with animals sounds as background scores. Kinda gives a feel of having your meal somewhere surrounded by wildlife. 

Food: Opted for Al a Carte. 

The dal machan: One of the unique dal makhani I have ever come across. Undoubtedly Delectable. 
Am a big fan of it. 

Paneer tikka: The Paneer was soft and tender with perfect proportions of spices and perfectly cooked (neither overcooked nor undercooked). 

The breads: There was an order of assortment I.e. different breads had been asked for. 
Feedback for all were, cooked as requested (soft). 

The food was served absolutely piping hot. 
Overall a great Fooding experience. 

Staff: Quite a laidback staff, and needs to be pinned and reminded every now and then for any certain requirement. 
Is courteous but lacks efficiency. 
Scope of improvement seen in this category. 

The pricing out here is slightly towards the expensive end. 

Otherwise, a place to visit for sure. :-)

Nice ambiance with overpriced tasty food. That's what Machaan is all about. The only jungle-themed restaurant in Kolkata, this is a nice place to take your kids to. The food is good but the value for money isn't. The quantity of items is also not much so you end up spending more. Not recommended if you are in a large group. 

Trivia: I am quite fond of their cutlery set which is also jungle-themed, the spoon and fork handles resemble tree brunches :)

Out of all Anjan Chatterjee's venture Machaan in Mani square kolkatta is only one which is poor and disappointing except its ambiance and concept. Food served is neither challenging in taste and price. Exorbitantly priced. Amritsari Kulcha is Rs. 90 is a small ball of wheat. pathetic . Not impressed. No one from the manager section even bothered to come and ask about the food or wished when we left. generally they wait for bday party bookings and all if there is such then rest of the customers are ignored as we were as on that day they had a bday party.

Machaan is a very unique restaurant with no other restaurant in kolkata like it. The ambience and decor is like that of a tropical jungle with figures of mechanical wild animals erected throughout. The decor can be a plus and a minus for the place. Although many love it, some just don't like the dark and dim atmosphere. The food in Machaan is really good. So if you don't like the ambience, go for the food! It's a part of the Speciality Group of Restaurants and it lives up to its name.

This restaurant definitely has a signature of its own. In terms of ambience it is incomparable to any other restaurants in the city. Whether you like its jungle ambience is a matter of individual taste, but like it or hate it, admit it that it's different. I never had the buffet over here, although they were giving nice offers with ICICI credit cards (pay for 5 buffets and get the 6th free). I would not repent for what I had in the a la carte.
I would like to specially mention about one dish in particular, raan e machaan. They serve you a sizzling roasted lamb leg, and mark my word, you would not feel guilty to end up killing all lambs in the world, had the cook promised you to end them up in raan e machaans. The dish cannot be described in words, it is for your glands to feel it. This one dish is enough to shoot this restaurant to a 4 star rating. Do not waste your time reading reviews, go and have it.

The entrance to the restaurant looks like a jungle hut with two "junglees" on either side welcoming you. On entering, it will take some time for your eye to get adjusted as the restaurant is dark and glimly lit (part of the forest theme). Once your eye gets accustomed, you can see an elephant , a lion on a tree, a squirrel, a large snake beside the bar counter and lots of other animals. With forest animals calling at the background it is indeed a unique experience. There is a staircase which takes you to the alternate sitting area at the upper floor (the machaan). Entire forest is decorated using wood and they have really done a great job. 

At first, I thought my 2.5 year old son might feel a bit frightened. On the contrary, he was excited. He went around the entire restaurant pulling tail of giraffe, touching the trunk of elephant and patting on lions and tortoise. I had to literally pull him back when he tried to jump into the area which had crocodiles.

Truely speaking, the food here is something whih I would not rate very highly (taking into consideration the earlier visits). Here is what we ordered:

1. Pukhtuni Shorba - Rs 120/-
2. Cheese Paneer Tikka - Rs 370/-
3. Raan E Machaan - Rs 475/-
4. Kadhai Sabz Pulao - Rs 270/-
5. Matar Mushroom Hara Pyaz - Rs 330/-
6. Dhania Murg - Rs 420/-

I did not like the taste of Shorba (could be problem of my own taste preferences) but my mother and wife said it was fine. Cheese Paneer Tikka was well done. It was soft and creamy but if you like a something which is a bit spicy and more fried, you should avoid this. For Raan E Machaan, I thought the meat should have been a bit more tender.
The main course was something which was really good. All the three items - Kadhai Sabz Pulao,Matar Mushroom Hara Pyaz and Dhania Murg were totally awesome in taste. In fact, my mother liked the Matar Mushroom so much that she parcelled one extra plate home for her. Well done on these.
The staff was courteous and service was good.

I would highly recommend going to this restaurant at least once to feel the ambiance (especially if you have children with you). The cost I would say is a bit on the higher side but it is an experience that you would remember.

To begin with, I must put in a word about the decor of Machaan. It gives you the feeling of being in some sort of tropical forest with brambles here and there. The entire get up is done in wood and since am not very fond of jungles or themes of it, the interior did not sit well with me. But they more than made up for it with the food. The biriyani was yummy and so were the preparations of chicken that we had ordered. The sheekh kebab was spicy and tasted great. As for the Raan, I went straight to heaven and back. We ordered the Malpua for dessert and it was the best possible wrap for my sumptuous dinner.

Machaan, the name gives a rustic, raw n 'jungli'feel, n the place itself , but datz in a very positive way!!!
We visited this place on a Saturday afternoon.
Ambiance/Service:-
We were welcomed warmly to have our lunch in kolkatas very own 'Jungle'.It felt really good to be in that ambiance, but the hindi instrumental was a mismatch.The waiters were dressed in animal printed shirts, but with a sophisticated smile..well mannered n co operative.
Food:-
We ordered the following:-
1)chicken tandoori:- Delicious!! ! awesome!!!
2)Jeera rice:- Made with long grained baasmati rice,ghee and salt, itz well cooked n one of the best jeera rice I hv ever had. :)
3) Butter nun:-Soft and fluffy, properly buttered n tasty.
4) Daal makhani:-Good one but the pungent smell of garlic came out, which I didn't like
5) Benarasi malai kofta:-Best of the lot ! An awesome dish, cottage cheese balls stuffed with dry fruits, cooked in rich creamy gravy!!!!
6) Jhinga malaikari:-A tasty prawn dish cooked in coconut cream gravy..my fav!!!
They served complimentary dry papad and 4 types of chutney and achhar, eventually very tasty and appetising. .. The quality n quantity is also decent, value for money! !
P.-S.:-The cutlery is very heavy and odd shaped, causes inconvenience while eating..
Overall rating:-4/5.

The ambiance is at the same time a huge plus and minus for this place.
Its very "junglee" with animal sounds and the drums but a bit dimly lit if you go away from the main entrance. We went for a late lunch and sat upstairs bang opposite to the entrace so there was enough light.
Since none of us were not that hungry, we restricted to starters. We ordered whole fish tandoori and dahi ke kabab.
The fish was delicious! White flaky fish with crisp spiced skin!! Heaven.
The dahi k kabab was a bit dissappointing in a way it was more crumbled paneer than spiced semi liquid yogurt.
Overall not bowled over but aptly satisfied.

We had visited this restaurant almost 2 years ago. After manoeuvring our way into the place (quite an achievement if you ask me), we we entered the dark cavernous interiors and were seated. It was dark enough to not see anything, and what really worried me was that with the interiors done like a forest, there could well be creepy-crawlies jumping into the food! Thankfully, that did not happen.

The food itself was better than expected. I do not recall the specifics now, but we had a chicken in butter masala with naans after a couple of starters. I vaguely recall the food being a tad spicy.Service was a bit vague in the beginning, but later that got sorted out.

In the end, we left reasonably happy. Must visit again sometime.

Gone are the days when food at home used to be the best thing. If you want a break from conventional dining, Machan will definitely please you. A brilliant ambiance in a jungle setting this restaurant has been one of the pioneers in theme restaurants in Kolkata. A great thing about Machan is that they have placed great importance to even the minute details to make the place resemble a jungle. Leave aside the wooden stairs or the tall trees, even the washroom has resemblance to a rustic setting.  
The service of this place is not at par with other speciality group restaurants which according to me is a set back. You won't find the treatment that you can get at Oh!Calcutta or Mainland China but that doesn't mean the service is bad.
The food is just kind of Okay. I didn't find anything exceptional in the food of this place. If great ambience is what is your primary concern along with good food this place will be worth a try.

Great ambiance and the food served maintained the quality which Me, my sister and specially "My would be" were looking for!! The preparation for lamb was too good [oops, can't remember the name of the recipe] 

Although the surrounding restaurants are giving a tough competition, I think the ambiance quality requires a bit makeover specially the entrance & the staircase area is a bit dark which requires some extra light waves.Jungle theme is a good thinking. Kudos to that.

Overall, we all had a good experience here. :)

A brilliant place to visit to just have a look at it. You enter through the door and you find yourself in an entirely different place. The theme is that of a jungle and they have captured it really well. The cutlery  is in the shape of twigs which at time becomes uncomfortable to handle but you forget everything when you taste the food.
I took my parents and friends for my b'day treat and we all really had a good time there.
The staff is very well behaved and cooperative and their cuisine suggestions are worth the attention.
Though it's a bit expensive but if you have to give a treat to special people, this is the place.

Been to machaan a couple of tyms!! Visited d place on a sunday fr dinnr, but ws a bit disheartened on knowing that its only a la carte for the weekends! However, it ws short lived as the dhuandhar chickn and the lamb they specially prepared teased our taste buds! Their lamb s one of the best i have had!! Also worth mentioning is the mutton biryani! One of the very rare restaurants that can give a certain park circus centred competitor run for d money!! Truly, the biryani s fantastic!! Also they make some real nice malpoa (bengali sweet dish)
However, all s nt well! The waiting tym aftr placing d ordr s a bit too much, the lighting too dim fr my liking and desserts r vry limited tho they have a nice array of scotch to choose frm!!
All in all, one of the bettr buffet (weekend a la carte) restaurants of d city!!

The first themed restaurant i have been to, Machaan is perhaps the most complete amongst all the standalone restaurants in the city. The rustic jungle decor along with ambient lighting and the superb cuisine, the mood is set for the perfect start to a weekend. While chilling in the jungle ambience one gets pampered with a variety of starters. The main course can be a touch too spicy for people with tender stomachs. Overall a superb restaurant and a must visit. Rating 4.5

A nice restaurant located on the 4th floor of Mani Square with an unique ambience. The restaurant is based on a jungle theme and it is decorated aptly. Coming to the food it is North Indian in nature. The food quality and quantity are both quite good and will leave you fully satisfied. One of its best item is the raan e Machaan which is mouth watering. The cons include poor air conditioning during the summer and the prices being a little bit on the high side.

I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the setting. The ambiance is truly unsettling. You will either find it quirky but endearing- a.k.a- love it or find it absolutely tacky and hate it. Yes the sunderban dakbango vibe can be a lot to take in - but you know that is what makes it seem more like a vacation than a dinner... So don;t go too often... or else the novelty will wear off. I live for the Dahi Methi Murg and the breathtaking  lemonade- with a cucumber water base flavored with roasted curry leaves-. So enjoy... sparingly..

Enjoyed a nice evening here.superb ambience if u are in the mood for a chilled out dining and bored with the same old formal interiors of restaurants.
Pricing is reasonable too although one bhetki item we ordered cost us a whooping 695!With 3 people drinking in a group of 5 we notched up a bill of 7117 for a three course dinner.My most fav item of the lot was Raan-e-gosht (roasted lamb leg).We even ordered it twice!The staff were extremely cordial and co-operative.Even the manager moved around the tables to see if the guests were satisfied.The only glitch being relatively less number of items on offer.

We visited this restaurant with a big family group. the main reason to choose was the ambience (as we had 3 kids in this group) and ofcourse i paid a heed to the zomato rating also. we ordered for biriyani, daal makhani, fish kebab, chicken tikka kebabs, chicken reshmi kebabs etc. the biriyani and daal makhni was very good but other items were not great. the fish kebab was a disaster. the chicken reshmi kebab was soggy. the service was also slow. given the location and ambience we had very high expectation from this place. this mall itself has many good restaurants like rajdhani or haka. so all in all little diappointing considering it's a restaurant by specialty group.

The ambience of this place is really good. The quality of food is also good. But one thing I would like to tell all the foodies that if u order RoganJosh(lamb) they will provide you with a mutton RoganJosh. They didn't even bother to mention in the menu card or inform us while we were placing the order that the RoganJosh is made with mutton though in the menu card it is mentioned that it is lamb. After tasting it I realized that it was mutton. When I asked them about this, they accepted the fact that it was mutton but could not answer why nothing is mentioned in the menu card. So for cheating a real foodie I have rated this place 1.5

when i visit mani square i do visit machan :) ohhh d ambiance is too good dr. you will feel like you are in a jungle. foods are delicious and price is cheap too.

From my point of view In Soups Ajwani Murg Shorba is good.Here you must taste Kareli Rogan Josh and Murg Tikka labadar in Main Course nonveg. I am non-vegeterian so did not taste veg items , so cant comment on those. Hospitality is also good.If you visit in winter you must taste Nolen Gurer Ice Cream in dessert.

pocket pinch for 4  without alcohol 2200.

final verdict  ..... 4 out of 5 :)  

Note : If you visit den don't forget to do a royalty card which will earn points on your bill. The card can be used in Mainland China , oh!! calcutta and sigree .

Machan, the restaurant serving authentic Mughlai food is another jewel to the SPECIALITY group’s feather. Being a member of this group, I have enjoyed sumptuous meals at mainland china, haka and the like. However, I had been sceptic towards machan. The décor (jungle themed) had seemed to be too gimmicky. However, I have changed my mind since then. The décor is a bit bordering on the tacky, but I love the experience of sitting on the machan (the first floor cut out seating area) to dine. The jungle noises in the background is pretty awesome too, especially if its not too crowded and one can actually feel the ambience of being in a jungle.

The food is mouthwatering tempting. The flavours are bold and the kebabs (both chicken and mutton) deserve a special mention for the succulence. One should definitely be partial to the array of kebabs and starters they serve here. The biryani was strictly okay, this is not the place to have biryani. But the veg pulao was just outstanding, delicately flavoured rice with an assortment of veggies. The only gripe I have with this dish is that though the fennel (saunf) they use to bring about the unique smell of this pulao, creates a real nuisance when trying to eat.

The bar makes a mean cocktail or two. Ask for the Caipiroska if you are into lime flavoured poison. The non-alcoholic drinks menu is real good too, especially the jaljeera. 

I have never tried the dessert section, so cannot comment on the same.

Pocket pinch for a group of five people was 5500 including cocktails. The major pocket pinch is in the liquor. The prices for food are at par with the other Speciality group’s offerings.

MACHAAN - A place where you get good food and get to see animals too . 
-----------------
LOCATION :
Machaan is located at 4th Floor, Mani Square Mall, E M Bypass, Kolkata.
-----------------
BRIEF :
As you enter the place , you can see its decorated like a jungle , the decors have trees , animals who makes noises once a while and the lights are not too bright keeping to the atmosphere of the jungle . The interiors are done with great details and look good . Its very attractive for the kids who go to dine there .
-----------------
FOOD 
1) Panner Rawalpindi : panner  was tender and had a good blend of spices .
2) Makai Seekh : It was really good and worth a try .
3) Pind da channa : it tasted good and is basically chana masala
4) Dal machaan : it tasted really good and if your are visiting this place , worth a try .
-----------------
SERVICE 
The service was laid back and staff had to be constantly told to serve water or give extra spoon . The food was served hot and they gave the food as we wanted to (some dish was jain )
-----------------
SUMMARY 

Food quality 4/5

If you want to feel like a child again, re-living your days of watching mowgli and reading tarzan, hear science-city-like sounds of elephants and lions or, may be, enjoy a "private" dinner with your "special" one, machaan is your best bet. But if its just about food for you, I am not so sure of the bet.

Everything on the menu here is mediocre. Starting from the kebabs to the rice dishes, side dishes to something like rabri and jalebi for dessert.  I don't understand how they manage to serve the exact standard of mediocrity in all their courses! 

Why a 3 then? Well that's because I had the most memorable evening of my life here for some reason! And they helped a lot to make that happen. An extra point for that!

I really don't know how to write review for this place. Have been there twice, and my experience has been entirely different on these two occasions. 
Lets begin with the basic things. The place is dark, jungle themed, with appropriate background musics. But this also makes the place very noisy. Its not a place if you want calm & quiet during your dinner. And be prepared to shell out a big bunch from your pocket as this is a very pricey restaurant. 
 My first brush with machan was in back 2010. It was not an experience I want to remember. Went there with my friends. Heard some great reviews about the place. We first ordered few cocktails which were served with some baked papads. The quality of the cocktail, lets say, this wasn't the worst, but I'm definitely not recommending those to anyone. Then we ordered Amritsari Kulcha & Champ Ka Salaan (a dish made of lamb chops). When they were served, they were served in the very plate which was used by us for starters. There was no change of plate & cutlery sets. The kulchas were horrible, small & undercooked. Few minutes later, we observed that what we had been served was not a lamb prep. So we called up someone and asked what that was. He replied it to be Mutton Roganjosh. As they didn't have any lamb, they just changed the item without even informing us!! And then they accused us of not inquiring whether they had any lamb with them or not. And what we have been served was 'almost' the same thing! Even the manager wanted to put the blame on us. Later on they gave a complimentary dessert which was quite good actually. But this is not the way you run a business!!
My second string with this place was not in next 3 years. Due to my horrible experience regarding this place, I avoided and advised everyone to avoid this place. Finally my gf persuaded me to give it a second shot. So last year during summer, I summed up my courage, checked my pockets and entered the jungle......again....... This time around, the experience was somewhat different. I avoided ordering the main-courses fearing another fiasco. Ordered a  chicken tengri kebab prer with Heineken. The beer was served chilled. And the food was served hot and well garnished. Staffs behavior were very courteous. It was really a nice experience
Even after all this, I must say, the prices are just too much. Food are good, but not THAT good.... you can get better food elsewhere in Kolkata at a cheaper price. Also inconsistency in service is not expected from a restaurant, which tries to stamp itself as one of the elite of the city....

In as much that this place offers for its ambience, I must admit that after having visited this place thrice, I do not find the taste exquisite or something that stays with the diner after he has left the place. The food is tasty but it doesn't gratify you. A difficult one to rate properly.

Machaan..the name itself is so inviting(well maybe not to you). When you are at machaan nothing can go wrong. Always have a beautiful experience there. Their decor is simply too good. I love the jungle theme. The best Part about this is that Even the washroom gives u a jungle like feel.  Now coming to the food. Every item is just so good. Their veg kebab platter is a must try, specially the bhhatti k aloo in it, it's awesome.  If you are a mushroom fan then u must kumbh angara too. The mains are also always well made. For breads we always go for machaan ki tokri which is quite filling for 4-5 people. Oh I forgot to mention, they also give u complementary papad n onion,  n even that too is really good. I don't know what do they do with those onions that it's so good that one can have it all by itself. Well well!! Now dessert time. I had their malpua rabri last time n it's really to die for. It's the best I have ever had. 
Now coming to the price,  I won't say it's too high because the food and the experience are totally worth the little pinch. 
Looking forward to my next visit..!!
Happy eating!!  :-)

Machaan in an entirety is a pleasure to pay a visit to. And most importantly, it is one of the better restaurants in the Mani Square mall. The quality of food for both a la carte and buffet is impressive. My first brush with Machaan happened in 2009. My friends and me visited the place on New Year's Eve for dinner. We had gotten a table for 8 after waiting for an hour and it had been past 11.30 already. Just into the starters satisfying our hungry soul, the lights went off, only the animal eyes lit and there was a countdown. 10..9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1.. people roared "Happy New Year", oh and so did the animals. :) The Machaan bug thus bit me hard making it a happy and cozy new years' dinner. 
I love their bread basket. It is huge and enough to suffice three hungry souls. I remember sharing dahi ke kebab, bhatti murg and bread basket amongst the two of us and had to pack quite a bit of the bread basket back home too. A la carte is priced quite high but given the amount and quality of food, paying every bit is worth it. Eating here within my pocket money limits did hurt but the sheer pleasure of it made all the grand eating worth it.
I have had their buffet recently twice and enjoyed it. The endless choice of kebabs and the succulence texture ensures a paisa vasool eating out. I generally end up drinking down more glasses of soft drinks to make some more way for the second and third helpings here. A wide range of kebabs, five to six salads, wide choices from Chinese and Mughlai main courses and quite a few desserts make the buffet a reasonably priced one. The starters are the hands down winners in the buffet, with the maincourse following it thereafter. The desserts need considerable revision to make them better than average though.
All in all, it is one of the best theme restaurants in town.

It has a very unique interior design that will take you to a jungle. However they need to rethink the lighting. 

The starters are really good. But when it comes to main course, food is not as good as it should be.

I must admit that I was very amused when I entered this place for the first time,many years back. I was in my early teens then and the theme of the restaurant immediately struck a chord with me. The beautifully depicted forest gives a feel of a perfect jungle safari with the monkeys hanging from the trees and the different animals making their presence felt. The hovering branches and the small little bridge to cross over adds to the decor. 
Food - I have been there four times and have been disappointed twice with the quality and service... but I must say that the other two times,I have been extremely satisfied. 
The chain under which Machaan falls cannot be questioned in terms of experience and quality. They are one of the leaders of the hospitality industry in the city.
Nice place to go with kids. They will enjoy to the fullest ! 
Keep up the good work :)

I am not a big fan of Restaurant-in-malls. I kind of abhor them. When it comes to dining out, I fancy standalone restaurants, which makes me a little old-school. I mean, I would, any day prefer dining in Park Street or Lansdowne rather than the new Flame and Grill , Kaafila etc. in various Kolkata malls. 
The reason being, that there is some old world allure in doing so. Suppose you are craving for chello kebabs. You call up Mocambo, book a table, reach the restaurant, wait outside for a certain time for tables to get empty, Order your Chello, savor it, pay up and leave. That’s my idea of a grand way to have dinner. 
While dining in a mall restaurant is much like eating from a glorified food court. You take a round of all the restaurants, glance through the cuisines, check out the decor through the ceiling high full glass walls, look out for the offers or buffet prices and settle down on the most feasible option of that day. It’s much like reaching the Box Office counter of a theater, see what’s playing and when, and then decide, rather than having a specific movie plan etched in your mind while leaving home. That is the reason I have still not visited many of the newly opened food joints in Kolkata malls.
But, my thought process took a beating when I visited Machaan at Mani Square on a Friday night. Firstly, it’s a proper restaurant, i.e. it does not have glass walls through which casual onlookers glance at you, or your food. As the name signifies – Machaan (or Macha in Bengali - is a makeshift tree-top watchtower used by hunters to wait for their prey) is truly a themed restaurant, in its proper sense and the forest theme really works well. It is dark (not as much that you bump into other people, at the same time caring about your privacy.) The forest and the fake animals are nicely replicated, which adds a sense of eeriness and fun in the air. There is a ground area and also an upper deck (the ‘Macha’), which I think, is the highlight of the restaurant.
The Staff was courteous and had a smile on their faces. The cutlery was laid properly, and even the spoons and forks were themed, i.e. the holding end had a branching out design. They could, however use much better plates, than the ordinary ones they are using. We were 2 and we ordered 2 Jaljeeras, a ‘Ajwaini Murgh Shorba’ , a ‘Raan-e-Machaan’ , a Murgh Kalimirch , and a couple of Kulchas. 
Right after placing our order, a plate full of assorted achaars and chutneys and papads arrived, which I think is very important, for diners to keep their conversation and appetite going, and not making them realize the time difference between the order and the first serving. We were just finishing nibbling the papads and all, when the shorba arrived. It was quite nice, with the ajwaini flavor working wonders with the murgh. Just five mins down, the Raan –e-Machaan arrived, and boy, was it heavenly. Neither Soft nor fibrous, yet juicy and tender, charcoaled to perfection.  Also, it was quite a wholesome portion, and we were almost already full, finishing it. I would recommend this dish when 3-4 of you go along.  
The Murgh Kalimirch was decent, and the Kulchas were excellent. They were very soft and supple and the dough remained it’s same soft self throughout the half an hour we took to complete the main course. Excellent culinary skills there. Special mention - the Palak Corn Kulcha – must try.
The Staff would clear plates, rearrange stuffs to make you comfortable, and refill water at every interval. They would also ask you how the food was and would oblige to your request of say onions, lime, chilli etc without a hint of fuss.
We washed down the sins with yet another sinful dessert – the Malai Kulfi and it was also perfect. I actually thought hard for 5 mins to find something negative about the place, and believe me, I could not.
The bill for 2 came out to be something around 1700, which I believe is decent for the ambiance and the food they serve. 

4.5/5 for me. Excellent stuff Machaan, thank you so much.

went there three months ago with my g.f. seems like entering into a jungle with sounds of chirping and hishing from all sides.waiters dressed in the outfits of leapords,deer and other animals.we ordered chicken biriyani,kadhai jhinga .unfortunately the food quality does not justify the decor.malpua with rabri as dessert is delicious though.

Machaan had been on my to go list for a while but it never worked out for some reason or the other.
But on my mother's birthday we finally landed there for dinner.
The ambience is really good giving you a complete forest feel.
The menu was the same as sigree, and it had automatically elevated our expectations from this joint.
We ordered kebab platter n baby corn for the starters. While the platter was just about  average, the curry leaves tempering in the babycorn set it aside from the other places serving similar dishes.
Switch to main course we ordered breads, two types of vegetables and a biriyani.
After that, all we did was just wait.. Because the food didn't arrive till an hour after ordering despite constant requests. As a result by the time the food arrived we were least interested as the long wait head killed the atmosphere for us. More than half of the food had to be packed.. But the hospitality (pun intended) didn't end there.
When we complained to the manager for such a behavior, he seems least interested and didn't even pay attention to anything we said!
They had prepare the bill and we could see it as we were seated right beside the computer but the waiter was busy matching accounts that despite constant requests he didn't bother until the manager scolded him (thank god!)
Coming to the food, well it wasn't bad but at the same time it was no where good.


After such a behavior, I don't think I need to even mention I'm not returning to this place ever.. and oh yes, is complaints with the cutlery. The forks and spoons were weird. Couldn't even hold them properly!
Is have thought it's just me but others at the table had a similar problem...

I went to machaan yesterday, with my sister, brother in law and their two small kids. From the scratch, parking is not an issue here, its mani square mall's parking, ample space.
It's on the top floor of the mall. As we entered, we found the ambience was good, a jungle kinda theme.
Since the restaurant was empty, we chose the corner table. The lighting was a little too dim, the music playing was some jungle related theme and it was soothing to the ears.
Coming to the food......
I had ordered dhuandhar paneer tikka for the appetisers, which I found to be good enough. So far so good
Next for the main course, I wanted to order something with vegetables and not paneer and there wasn't much variety, so I settled with tawa subz nizami and dal machaan, and the breads as everyone had wanted.
The order dint take long to arrive, and they served it. The food was nice. Not much oil that could be seen.
All was going good when a group of people who were drinking came and sat on the table next  to us. I feel the staff should have been courteous about the fact that we had two little kids in our group and the restaurant was completely empty, they could have offered them some other seat.
I was very displeased.
Every time, I wanted to order, I had to look around for the waiter and call him. I ordered the second round of breads which took a long time around 15-20 mins to come. Though I had not mentioned anything about the delay, they offered me the last set of breads complementary for the delay that they made. Nice gesture:)
A good restaurant for family, and the typical north Indian foodie.
All in all doesn't deserve more than a 3 from me.
P.S. Drinks were also available, but none of us had ordered the drinks.

Went yesterday in a group of 10 people.
Pros:-
Descent food taste.
Tables decently placed with enough gaps, spacious place.
Cons:-
1. Paneer was out of stock so no paneer item could be ordered.
2. Service too slow, poor and inefficient staff.
3. Expensive considering the quality.
4. The animals placed inside do not move. When I visited a year back the staff suggested that the problem will be rectified soon. Still the problem persists so you do not get a complete feel of the ambience.
5. Mineral water overpriced at 100 plus taxes.

The restaurant wanted to depict the feeling of jungle but the amount of light is very very less to have a proper lunch or dinner for civilized humans. The variety of lunch buffet is also very less. Still that is fine but the taste is a huge disappointment. Even though I liked the aloo chat a lot. Biriyani was a disaster. Even roadside biriyani stalls have very tastier version of this dish. 
Service is very slow and few waiters are not having much knowledge on etiquette. Deserts are so so.
On the whole the entire buffet doesn't worth INR 650 (with taxes). Flame 'n Grill on next door is much better option. No wonder Machan was the only empty restaurant in the entire mall on Friday afternoon.
Deserves only a star but one more star for the ambiance effort they tried. Little more light inside the property and taste in food can do wonders for this establishment.

Machaan is a fun place to be. The theme of jungle inside, together with sound, make this place a really hilarious place, and at times I just come here for the fun part. On one occasion, my mother actually jumped from her seat after hearing some random animal scream. Anyway, coming to the food, I have tried a few things on the menu, and while they dont make a good Biryani, they totally compensate by making an amazing paneer khurchan, lovely tandoori murg and chicken cheese tikka and dhaniya murg. I also have heard that their prawn items are very good from the people who are not allergic to prawns like me.

Machaan as the name suggests literally have a tree house inside where you can dine. I have been to Machaan in Mumbai as well as the one in Kolkata and did not find any difference in the service and the quality of food.

The restaurant at Mani Square Mall Kolkata has the theme of a jungle inside with a tree house. The food served here is of great quality and taste. The service of the staff is prompt and yes of course with a smile.

Though the prices are on the higher side however it is quite worth paying.

A Super Thumps Up for this theme restaurant.

every time i visit the place (ive only been there twice, so far), i feel as if im inside kipling's jungle book. the faux trees and the elephant by the doorway and the perched parrots, even the carved steel cutlery adds to that feel!
i have always gone there for the buffet, especially the veg kebab. something i noticed was te first time the chicken preparation in the main course lost out to the mutton delicacy and on my second visit, the reverse happened!
the array of cocktails and the innovative names (shikari shambu's drink!) had a special appeal. 
overall, the place wins over haka, situate next to it and offers good competition to flame and grill and mio amore, in my opinion.

One of the first proper theme restaurants of the city. Many theme restaurants have opened but this places takes it really seriously . This is the place  i celebrated my 26th birthday and i loved it have been here a few times and i love the food and i love the ambiance... 

Very dim lighting with faux trees and animals add to the jungle tree house, that is theme of the place. Some of the animals are robotized and they add all kinds of forest background sounds . They have a tree house in the center with a deck .its a separate level that u can climb up to and sit and eat. Just love it 

The staff here is nice and attentive and we have always been treated well

Let me tell you what i love about the pace a lot is that during one of our visits we ha all vegetarian and believe me their veg food is brilliant and i think better than non veg too.. 

Special mention to the multani chat which is a balance with hints of sweet chutney .. also loved their corn seekh kebabs 

The shorbas are brilliant ... as are the home made beverages... 

I liked the kali mirch murgh and the kosha mangsho as well , But in a place like this its not just the food, the entire experience is what builds up the meal, and the do a really good job.. The prices are slightly on the higher side but  for the experience.. it is worth it .. 

Kudos !

Location: 1. 4th Fl. Mani Square Mall off EM Bypass, a little beyond Apollo Gleneagles Hospital
                  2. Avani Riverside Mall, Howrah (near to Foreshore Rd.)

Serves: North indian / Mughlai

Pros:
1. Ambiance needs special mention with the kind of jungle like decor with special sound effects of various animals (lions / elephant / crocodile / birds)...hanging tree branches... simply superb...my son was thrilled by the sight of the crocodile opening its jaws widely and making the cracking sound !!... the light music in the background added much comfort and smoothness the ambiance. 
2. Food is very good quality, especially ala-carte menus.
3. Staff is cordial and gentle, always smiling and dressed in a special uniform !!..
4. The Biriyani is awesome with the mutton melting in your mouth and the aroma is just mind-blowing..

Cons:
1. Bit costly compared to qty of food served.
2. Roti / Naan bread needs improvement in quality and size. 70 Rs for a mid sized Naan is too much .. wont even satisfy hunger for a single person.

Cost for 2: 2000 (incl tax) and soft drinks

Must Try: Jal Jeera Mojito / Frozen Tamarind
Pakhtuni Tandoori Murgh
kakori kebab
murgh kalimirch
Mutton dum Biriyani

Machaan is a pretty hyped concept restaurant from the speciality group with a decor to create the atmosphere of a jungle. The decor succeeds pretty well at its task but ambience could further improve for some more apt music in the background with sounds of nature like leaves or birds etc. 

Machaan is located in the mani square mall on the fourth floor. The lighting is dim for obvious reasons which does not give a right impression of its capacity when you first enter but it could hold a big house. The seats are comfortable. The place has wooden stairs leading to a small seating space on the upper first floor as well which is a bit compact but gives a very good feel whereas the lower level is more spacious.

 The menu and preparations are pretty similar to sigree. But yes the whole ambience is completely different. The cutlery of machaan seems bit uncomfortable. The staff is very polite and courteous. The service is decently paced.  The prices are in the league of kaafila or yellow chilli or a tangerine or ivory. 

Coming to the food, the kebabs are good especially the seekh kebab which is one of my favorite. Main course dishes are pretty good. Dal machaan is really nice and subz handi, koftas, paneer lababdaar go pretty well with it. Rotis are very well made and are great. Subz biryani is another favorite for me at machaan which has an amazing flavour and aroma. I have always felt that it lacks a variety in desserts but the ones available are decent.

Machaan  has always given a wholesome and satisfactory dining experience but at these prices i would prefer an ivory or kaafila over it !!!!!!

Had not this place been a little too far from my home or the E.M Bypass not been so bumpy and conjested, I would have surely come here more often :( One thing that I appreciated here the most, perhaps even more than the food and decor, was the service! Our waiter was well informed about all the dishes and gave us just the right recommendations based on our choice of flavours and quantity! It's a pity I do not recall his name. I will make it a point next time. Now about the food, I had never tried shorba before I did here. It's a light chicken stalk with small chicken dumplings in it. It is nothing like a chinese soup (as our waiter had warned us!), but interestingly, when I spiced it up with some lemon juice and pepper and had it with the achaar and papaad, it tasted reaally nice and did exactly what it should have done...increased my appetite! Next we thought of having kakori kebabs, but since it was not available,we tried the raan and simply loved it. It was very tender and tasty! But it left us with hardly any space for main course! The kali mirch chicken with some taandori roti was the best way to end this lovely meal. Machaan is highly recommended!

I have visited this restaurent in Mani Sqaure Mall just once and the experience has been awesome.
I had ordered a Gosht Biriyani and a Chicken Tandoori Kabab.
Both the dishes were superb. Specially the Biriyani, which is one of the finest that I have tasted till date.
It is a jungle-themed restaurent with dimly-lit lights.
An amazing concept restaurent and tasty food, but with a high price tag.
Buffet was not available when I had visited this place, but now they have introduced Buffet, perhaps.
A good place for a food lover.
I shall certainly visit this place again.

Recently visited the riverside mall joint of this resturant..have to say i was dissapointed with the overall experience.I have been to almost all speciality group resturants.Firstly the buffet price was considerably low 333...while other joints charge 450.Yes the jungle like dining experience to justify the name machan stands well if you serve quality in food department.The starters were probably the worst i have had in any buffet.Main cource was standard but very limited and ordinary deserts.Found there choice of music very annoying ....too loud.Heard positive reviews from friends about other joints...so may b its a problem with this specific joint and not the other branches.

It has been more than 6 years since I've been to his restaurant. I never felt a particular longing to visit this, even for its unique jungle theme. May be this is due to the fact I first went there after I got my job and for me it was quite expensive then! It is still quite upmarket in terms of price (particularly for ala carte items), but thankfully this time it was a office sponsored buffet lunch! It is a served buffet, so no rushing and pushing around. Starters were decent, though not much in terms of variety. Fish and chicken starters were better than the mutton. Main course was decent, though the biryani was quite average (around 3 to 4 options were present). Dessert had malpoa with rabri, brownies and ice cream. Nothing to rave about. Ambience was good with the jungle themed decor. But cutlery, though themed were slightly difficult to manoeuvre. Staff was courteous and helpful. At the end, even with the pangs of nostalgia, I did not find anything great that might make be go back. I do agree that a buffet lunch may not have the right menu combinations to judge a restaurant; maybe I'll find out the special items and try the ala carte sometime later.

I went to Machaan for lunch this week. When we entered inside the restaurant, the feeling was just like entering a jungle camp, with chairs and tables made of uneven woods, and the dim lighting. The ambience is very good. We sat upstairs,and felt like sitting over a tree and watching jungle and wild animals from there. The background music makes you feel you are in a jungle. Next comes the food. We ordered ajwaini murgh Shorba, raan- e-machaan, lassi, fruit punch, dum cooked aromatic rice biryani (chicken), kadhai subj pulao and murgh kalimirch. Shorba was nice with flavours of ajwain. Raan-e-machaan came with sizzling sound. The pulao was the best pulao I ever had, and the biryani was nice and served with raita, the flavour is a bit different from mughlai joints in park circus area, chicken kalimirch was delicious. The quantity was very good and much for three of us. I Would like to visit machaan again.

My Rating 4.0 (Great) is mainly because of the ambiance!
The moment you step in the place,you will be 'absorbed' in the jungle ambiance of the restaurant. I must confess that the designing has been done meticulously and professionally. You will spot a small made-up bridge, lots of almost real looking animals, machaans and many more visual delights. The fork/spoon/plates are also junglee designed. 
Coming to the culinary part - Menu is ok but the names sound junglee and are quite interesting.  Interesting Mocktails should be tried. My Suggestions:
Kumbh Angara & Bhunawa Aloo may be tried for starters. 
For the main course,  Paneer Tikka Lababdaar, Kartoos Kofta and Dal Machaan (Dal makhani) alongwith Veg Biryani, Pudina Paratha and Cheese-Palak-Corn stuffed Kulcha (highly recommended).
Single orders are sufficient for 4 people. The service was courteous and quick, we had a wonderful time in the jungle!

Not so bad. In three words that is what I think of maachan. Ambience and decor wise they are one of the best in town, but, come on, we are more focussed on their food, shouldn't we? In food, maachan is, well, not that bad, as I said. Few of the selections are really good, rest are average, not something we expect from speciality group.

This is one of the off-beat restaurants of Anjan & is located on the top floor of Mani Square, adjacent to another of his famous chain ,the Hakka. Frankly speaking, I found the place a little too noisy & a bit dark , perhaps due to the jungle theme and I found It difficult to read the menu.Even though the food is not as  classy as that of  most of Anjan's oulet , how so ever it was quite acceptable.
I found the Ajwain Fish Tikka very palatable, as recommended by the steward.There is a range of choice as per the a la carte menu.As informed by the waiter, Buffet is also availabe during lunch hours & on week days.

The ambiance really impresses you but how useful is ambiance when you don't get what you basically came for. The service was horrible. The delay between items served was so much that it kills your appetite. In the vegetarian buffet main course they serve just two vegetable solely made of potatoes and a dal. You surely dont expect to eat potatoes when you go to a restaurant. Even on complaining it is as if they don't care.

Based on the theme of a jungle the interior decoration and the ambience of machaan is for me the main reason behind the popularity of the place.The moment you enter,the atmosphere inside will surely impress you.It is definitely unique and one of the best.
The quality of food is also good.But somehow I felt the ambience and atmosphere and everything compels one to over rate the quality of food.I have visited a couple of times and both times had their a la carte option.The kebabs are good and the side dishes are quite tasty.But somehow I didnt like their biryani much.The buffet I have heard is quite nice but I am yet to  try it myself.
But still I think just because of the one of a kind atmosphere it is a place worth visiting.It is absolutely perfect for a family dinner.Overall you are sure to get a good dining experience.

One of the best dining experience in Kolkata with a jungle themed interiors and supporting music as well. My favorite table here is the one on the level one above their base arrangements. It is a perfect place for a romantic dining experience and their buffet is simply, value for money in every sense. 

They serve the buffet right at their table and the quantity is more than sufficient. Starting with papad and masala onions to their masala minty buttermilk, you are going to love everything about this place. The environment is a bit too dark to be annoying for many but works fine for me. And, their quick service, no matter how many people or how many groups are dining at the restaurant, is a thumbs up.

The vegetarian items are really good and nothing to be complained about though my friends who are non-vegetarian do have some negative feedback, which I cannot elaborate as I have no understanding of it. Overall, its a perfect place for dining with family, especially when there are kids as they would love the jungle themed ambience here. And for couples, it is an exotic experience to steam up the mood combined with mouth-watering food and impeccable hospitality.

I love Machaan for it's unique ambiance. When you walk in the restaurant, you are actually walking into a jungle. The music is jungle drums & tribal music with jungle sounds, adding to the experience. The food is great in terms of taste, quality & quantity. Service is a bit slow, so have some time to unwind and enjoy when you visit this place. My favorites at this place are 'Grilled Bhetki', 'Mutton Raan', 'Choosa kalimirch'. Their wine selection is also commendable. A place worth it's salt.

I went there for a friend's birthday treat and I think the first thing that catches your admiration is the decor of this place, very well done indeed. You feel carried away to a jungle. The food is good and the service is also efficient. That day I went for vegetarian food and relished the laccha paratha, the paneer dish, the jeera rice, dal and papad. I was pleasantly happy to have opted for veg. My friends who opted for non-veg relished the kebabs, the chicken and mutton. The only thing that I did not like about this place was the spoon that they had given to eat. It is very uncomfortable to hold and eat from the spoon that they give. I hope that these guys change those spoons soon!

The first thing you notice when you enter this place is the decor. It is totally out of the world and is extracted from a jungle. There are bamboo trees and small wooden bridges, dark quirky lighting and ofcourse a bit of animals with occasional noises...it really is an experience.

About the food, well it is certainly up there with the best. The buffet is a bit short and would have preferred some more items. Nevertheless the quality and the the taste more than makes up for that. Service is fast and prompt. The buffet is moderately priced and is a very good option considering the decor and the food. Overall I would rate it 4.5, the decor being responsible for bagging it. Must visit for kids as they would just love the place. Highly Recommended !!!

Right from bright faced and well behaved staff to the feel of having food amidst eerie chirrups and junglee percussion music, this place cumulatively offers an experience you would want to look forward to. The minimal lighting not only upholds the integrity of the pseudo forest cover, but also provides ample privacy to each and every table.

Coming down to food, more specifically the buffet platter that I opted for, it can be summarized as total value for money to say the least. Amazing starters, a delightful and sumptuous main course and eventually the taste bud titillating dessert cover the areas that would even pacify a stubborn customer. For me, it was more of a joy ride for the tongue.

Improvements, quite obviously, can be deployed in a few areas. Salt content in food might be minutely above the safe zone, but it might depend on individual taste to either like it or be mildly dissatisfied by it. Cutlery imitates twigs, which does a lot of justice to the theme of the place, but sometimes might prove a bit inconvenient for people who use the conventional spoon and fork.

Apart from the above passable hiccups, I would rate it higher than its contemporaries. Overall, Machaan promises the fulfilment that you seek when you decide to eat out.

A wonderfully made-up place, the food is great and the staff are polite and well behaved. I remember having a Chicken Kebab (possible called the Chandni Tikka) which one of the best Kebabs ever. The buffet we tried was good on options and decently priced. The kids love this place for the ambience. Recommended

The first thing you would notice here is the amazonian decor. Honestly, its not an eye sore and you'd be pleasantly surprised. Ours was a large group and we ordered a lot if different items. We assumed it would take a long time for our food to arrive, but surprisingly they didnot disappoint us. Food came in quick. and it was finished even quicker. It was really well cooked with just the right amount of ingredients. We had a really enjoyable time. Definitely, a recommendation!!

We were a group of 40 people and we have gone for a lunch buffet from office. 

The quality of food is not at all worth Rs.650 per plate. The starter had only fish, chicken and mutton items. The chicken was good, fish and mutton was below average. Morever the quality of service was very poor. They didnot have adequate staff as well as arrangements to serve a group of 40. So it was a test of patience for people going over there to have lunch.

The main course had chicken biriyani, which was filled with aroma of rose water and had no taste at all. The mutton side dish was tasting like mutton stew and was a horrible combination with the biriyani. 

The dessert had malpoa with rabri. Believe me the malpoa had a pinch of rabri over it and was also of limited availability.

The food and quality of service was very,very poor and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

An awesome ambience is what strikes one at first, as soon as one enters this faux jungle like decor! Nonetheless, the food is what keeps one gushing about the restaurant.. Whenever, I think Arabic, Middle-Eastern, or for that matter, just plain and simple "kebabs", I always think Machaan. In fact, I have lost count of the number of people I have recommended the restaurant to. If you are HUNGRY and tit-bits won't keep that growling hunger at bay, Machaan's the place to go. The buffet and a-la-carte options are equally good and I could go on and on about the different dishes there.  Maybe it's a tad OTT if you wanna take your folks to that place, but a night-out with friends, ensconced in a deep and dark jungle with steaming Arabic delicacies may just turn out to be the perfect idea you ever had.

We visited Machaan @ Mani Square Mall yesterday.
The worst experience i ever had till date. We ordered Kakori Kabab, Kulcha and Some chicken preparation. They took near about 1  hour to serve the Kabab..Till then we had to keep munching  lots of papads.!! :( The Kabab was not at a all good..Then they served the Chicken preparation which was supposed to be Spicy(As per their Menu Card), served to us as a non-spicy, without salt.!! The Mocktail we ordered also not a good one.!! Overall it was a very bad experience. Only the ambiance was somewhat good.They have less people working over there, so it is taking 45 mintues minimum to serve you.. The price also too high, atleast we sud get some good food when they are charging this much!!
I would not tell you guys to visit there. It's because of Speciality group restaurants, it is having that much craze.!!

I really like the whole theme about this place. The perfect amount of lighting and the the trees and the animals surrounding you. Its a cool nice place to eat.

I love the biryani at this place since it is light and not heavy to the stomach. The drinks are good too. The prices of the dishes are reasonable. The mutton curry goes well with the biryani. The non veg platter is really good. People should try it out. the staff is very welcoming and nice, they kinda over do it a little...lol... but on the whole its a nice place to dine. 

will visit soon

Yesterday when we were shopping at Mani Square, we decided to have lunch at Machaan as we heard alot about it. The location of the restaurant is very good, but its quite a drive from the main city which many people would enjoy. If you have booked a table and arrived early, you can spend your time in the mall. The ambience of the restaurant is good. It is given a jungle type of look with artificial trees, plants and animals. The theme matches with the Rainforest Restaurant of Dubai, but Rainforest is way better than Machaan. The music played at Machaan is a bit loud and not soothing. Instead of music they could use more animal voices which would make the theme a bit more realistic. It is a bit difficult to have food with the cutlery you get there. The service was good.
Now coming to the food. The food was'nt great. If you are Machaan DO NOT try vegetarian food. The Dhuaandar kebab was good and was tender, but the chicken tikka kebab was'nt properly cooked the tandoori roti was a bit hard and the parantha could be better. You could visit the place just once for experience. Their are many more better restaurants in the city. You could try Peter Cat, Daawat-e-shiraz, Barbeque Nation and Vedas for better food experience.

The ambiance is good...u almost feel like you are having your meal in a jungle, complete with the 'tribal type' songs (jhingalala ones :D)...The interior is dark (all photogenic girls beware :P) 
The cutlery is cute, everything complements the theme.

Now for the food, we had an all vegetarian fare. The food tasted ok. Nothing special to write about. Didn't find enough of a reason to head back to this place again.

Somebody aptly said,'first impression is the last impression' and when it comes to restaurants,ambience is the first thing which hit the eyes !! and Machaan certainly fits this bill..The decor of this restro has been extracted from that of a jungle and is surely a visual treat for everyone who visits this place.The tribal music and the cheetah-printed outfit of the waiters are other exquisite aspects of this tastefully laid-out restaurant from Speciality group.Coming to the menu,Machaan specializes in North Indian cuisine and is undoubtedly a master of it.They use special spices in all their dishes and their kebabs are simply to die for,especially the jangli masale ka raan and tandoori murgh..preparations of rices and naans are equally good.Food Quality is strictly adhered to.No complaints on service from my side.It deserves a 4.Being a fine dining restaurant,prices are a bit steep.But considering the ambience and food quality,Machaan should be on must-to-visit list of every foodies of kolkata.I would rate it a 4.5 overall !!

I love viisting this restaurant because of the ambiance: they represent very faithfully a scene from a jungle, with amazing lighting and animal fixtures. On family visits,its been a pleasure to watch my younger cousins get very excited to see the elephant sway its truck! :)

Now,coming to the food,it's pretty good. what makes me even happier is that the food's consistently good always so no rude surprises there.

I love their fish and chicken starters,tikkas,which always have this delicious combination of spices. Also,I'd recommend their special raan for meat lovers.

Also,love their biriyanis and their desserts. Overall,they serve delicious north indian fare that beats cost-effective places like Arsalan with innovation and more experimental elements in their food. 

Try them out. :)

Food is sub par for the price one pays. Service is amazingly and painstakingly slow..They would just serve you a plate full of papads and expect you to keep munching on them for 30 minutes at least...We were relieved to see the starters coming after 30 minutes. Quality of food is not very good. The only upside in this all downhill journey of machaan is the Decor. Its nice and makes you feel like you are really in a jungle. I would have preferred some more lights though...I dont want to dine in a Cave with pitch black darkness. I want to know whats on my plate...Go there only once for the experience.

I visited here on my girl friend's birthday. The ambiance is tremendous and i can bet over it. The jungle and the animal!!! waooooo ( i am kidding the animals are only statue :p) and the background sound of jungle is mind blowing.


 The service is really very good, and the quality of food is lajawab. u have to try tandoori prawn to have the best taste, chicken tandoori is also awesome. As i am a fond of tandoori dishes so i went for them, and i was not disappointed at all. the only problem is they dont have enough flavours of breezer and scotch is little bit costly. But i dont wanna complain as because i was moved with machan. 
 

i ll suggest u to go for it as it is much much different from others. i go for 4 and half for machan

This place has the best ambiance and decoration in all restaurants in kolkata and i mean it. Covered in jungle and with a chomchome andhokar feeling, accompanied by animals sounds and did I mention periodic oscillations of the trunk of the elephant in the entrance! And a jungleman on rope and leopard looking down on you from a tree above!! wow

There is a elevated dining space in the middle of the room which is really a wonderful place to eat...although the places below it are not bad either.So superb in this  ambiance and atmosphere/

The food was served quite quick . As the waiter placed the food on the table, we were enthralled by the magnificent look of the food. The food really melted in my mouth (although it increased my stomach fat). The waiters were not very attentive though. 

Conclusion: You get very good food. Also the best looking restaurant. So don't hesitate and go there if you want a dinner experience at a top class restaurant.

This was a big disappointment for me and my wife (then girlfriend) when we visited this place some 4 years back. We had heard loads about this place, but somehow everyone missed to mention that the food was way below standards when compared to the extremely well done decor and the exorbitant price it was charging back then.

Firstly, the decoration and ambiance is one of the best in Kolkata, though it might be tad dark for few people. It was Valentines Day and we were offered a complimentary glass of red wine and two chocolates. That was a nice gesture on their part, but the feel good factor soon started to disappear. We ordered Pulao, Keema Nun and a mutton dish, the name of which I can't recall. The pulao was all right, but the Keema Nun was absolutely pathetic to say the least. And it was even more horrifying to see the 350-400 bucks mutton dish arrive in a pot, filled to the brim with watery gravy. Ouch !! After munching that tasteless food, we tried to compensate with an ice cream which turned out to be good.

Overall, if it was not for the amazingly done decor which we simply loved, I would have given it a 2 Star at max with the quality way below our expectations.

I visited Machan couple of times, and I am giving my rating of 2 purely based on the food quality, the food is good over there. But I am writing this review to let people know that I am very dissapointed about Machan on my last visit. Firstly they don't have a set buffet in lunch, but when I asked for it instead of saying that we don't have it the service person said we will arrange it, and then he started bluffing about the price, first he said it's Rs. 450 one person Non-veg, then he talked to his senior and price increased to Rs. 500. Then when I enquired in detail, they said they have no set lunch buffet and will arrange it from other's orders. I decided to go for a-la-carta and ordered the menu. In the mean time they served water and waste plates. With our horor, we found roaches in the plates. I have lodged an complain about it and had buffet lunch in Flame & Grill (which is just beside it) for Rs. 528 per person. The manager apologised and said they have pest control twice a week because of their jungle like ambience, but in my case it didnot helped.

My first visit to Machaan just surprised me......Its having amazing jungle ambiance and you would surely like it.......coming to food, its scrumptious and hospitality is first class too. The woody sitting arrangement was uncomfortable for me. For starters i had chandni Tikka, Angrezi Machhali and for dinner i had HInter chicken which was very tasty and Naan. Food quantitys immense. For desserts i tried Kulfi which was simply delectable.....But one who does not likes jungle atmosphere,,they would not like this place...I think the place needs a bit more light cause when time comes to order food it becomes difficult to look. Pricing is affordable and it was a nice experience to have food inside the artificial jungle...I would rate 4.0 for them..

A unique jungle themed restaurant which tries to create an impression that you are having your meal inside a jungle and it doesn't do too badly. I went there with a group of office colleagues and opted for the dinner buffet. That's when I learned that there are some conditions which they didn't reveal over the telephone. First the buffet is available only for a minimum of 4 persons (fortunately we were 8 in number). Plus the price depends on the credit card one uses. Mastercard holders will have to pay considerably more compared to those with VISA (again fortunately I had a VISA card too).

Now let's come to the food. The kebabs (fish and chicken) were some of the best that I ever had. The pieces were tasty, soft, succulent... just perfect. I was told that they were cooked in very high temperature ovens for very small durations. The rest of the dishes, although not as good as the kebabs, were quite good also. The brownies with ice cream provided a perfect finish.

The service was excellent (all dishes served on the table), ambiance quite unique. Overall a great experience. I would have given a higher rating if not for those hidden conditions.

Things must have changed since the last reviewer visited the place cause when we visited it for lunch one weekday, we found the food to be below average. Let's be charitable here! May be being off peak hours their regular chef was off duty?! I dunno what was the reason, but the food, including even the starters & the raita had an abundance of coriander seeds -- certainly too much for my liking -- & the rest of the buffet while not unpalatable was certainly far below what one would expect from a place charging 500/- + taxes per head. So verdict? I'd give it an 8 on the ambience. It could have gotten a 9 but they kept the A/C switched off. A measly 4 on the service. The waiters are not properly groomed for a restro of this stature & in trying to be overtly friendly border on the intrusiveness. I would give them a 5 for the food but then again that would be entirely because of the cook. Their portions were generous & menu decently spread out in variety. For value for money, again they would score a low 4 at best since the others on the same floor like Hakka had killer bargains to offer! We only went because of an invite we couldn't turn down & a prior booking. All in all, not an entirely good experience. I would suggest that you avoid this place like the plague during off-peak hours when they are off their best behaviour. At other times they probably can do much better as the other reviews tell.

It is not just another tree house midst the dense jungle. It is Machaan, where you get great food, with an absolutely fantastic ambience (only if you are the quaint nature lover with the benevolence for forests and the wilderness). It is guarded by a well-built, tattooed tribal (a dummy), and as you enter, an elephant would flank you to your right end. Yes, you should expect Machaan to be an ultimate replication of a forest in a typical urban mall. The lighting is dim and darkish, accentuating the whole theme, and they have forest themed music too, playing in the background. Theme based restaurants, being an upcoming fashion in Calcutta, Machaan was one of the first of its kind. Now coming to the food. Its mainly North Indian, from Mughlai, to Awadhi, to Punjabi...And its simply moth-wateringly scrumptious! There is so much to choose from! Do try their Kakori kebab if nothing else. As far as the prices are concerned, it is going to burn a hole in your pocket. You get good cocktails and mocktails too (A certain cocktail funnily named Shikari Shambhu!). If you are in the mood of a safari and good food, do take a trip to Machaan.

Food is not always about eating. its sometimes about the ambience, and my rating is totally for the theme, decor, staff service, and atmosphere. i really wish i could give this place a good rating but the food is not that great. its almost like homemade food.I am not an expert but i am pretty sure that brownies are not supposed to reek of eggs. The fruit punch was awful...and the wine collection cannot be called more than so-so. the starters were just ok. Vastly overpriced this place should be visited only if one wishes to dine under soft lights and dense foliage, with awesome hospitality....otherwise this place does not have much attraction.

Machaan a  lovely place if you go by its interiors . Just as you step inside Machaan, it looks like that you are in a dense and dark Jungle with owls hooting, birds chirping, thus the place has its own USP. If you love theme based restruants then Machaan is a must visit. But the food was not so good it was satisfactory. I went for the buffet. The rotis was a big disappointment. Even the starters were ok. I really liked the deserts Chocolate Brownie was fresh and tasty. Even the gulab jamuns were hot and fresh. The most important thing is its Staff and Service--Helpful always--Always trying to make the Guest comfortable & at ease.

A very nice place with a very different ambience. Once u enter the place u r greeted by an elephant at the gate and the mood sets in. The decor with trees and animals all around was a hit with my nephew and niece. They were busy spotting the animals and were amazed with so many animals all around. 

The service time was 15-20 mins for the order. The price is slightly on the higher  side.  The paneer tikka was not all that great. However, the black dal we ordered during the main course was amazing and is recommended.. Overall a nice experience and I would rate it 4..

Machaan.. Located in Mani Square Mall in E M Bypass..
As the name suggests, it is a Jungle themed restaurant its like you are sitting in the middle of the jungle with all wild animals around you. Really dark inside with dense foliage, but visibility is not an issue with nice spot-light arrangement. A very interesting decor, a unique one I should say, but I am sad to say, it simply ends there. Contrary to most of the general opinions, I find this place quite ordinary and expensive in comparison to the food it serves.
Two stars from me.

As soon as you step foot into this zone, you are left wonderstruck after experiencing the level of accuracy and intricate detailing of the jungle theme. It is like you are actually having your food (which is excellent) perched on the "machaan", atop a tree. The thrilling decor wins hands down as the best feature of this restaurant. Service is commendable.

Contrary to most of the general opinions, I find this place quite ordinary and highly expensive in comparison to the food it serves. I have been to this restaurant couple of times, once for a buffet and once for a-la-carte. I would conclude that neither of my experiences were even near to satisfactory. 
Firstly, I went in for the a-la-carte. The food was strictly average. The tandoori fish was the only dish that can be called really good. The experience was fairly average. 
Secondly, coming to the buffet, we were a group of 30+ and so we made previous reservations after confirming the spread. However, on the day the spread changed without prior notice and they even reduced the number of items that were agreed upon (for which they had to reduce the buffet prices eventually). Without considering that glitch, the food that they served was up to the standards of some road side stalls.. not of a fine dining restaurant. 

The ambiance is really good. The staff is very well behaved. But I wish the food was as good as the ambiance. This is strictly an average restaurant for me.

I AM AMAZED...this was my first visit and i just loved it.

ambiance & interior:  If you are looking for a theme based restaurant this is the place.The jungle theme,and wooden outlook,the birds and animals,the trees everything has created such an environment that even if the food is not good,u wont regret the pocket pinch(yes!!!).The junglee music has also helped to make the environment,but i believe the lighting could have been better..

Food: well as a starter I ordered pakhtuni murgh and a kingfisher blue (I must say the beer war cheap). The murgh was damn good, the smoky flavor and the texture was the best I have seen. As I moved towards to the main course, I ordered lamb rogun josh and roti. Now the rogun josh was like heaven in your mouth, it melted like butter. But The roti was a big disappointment. I paid Rs 50 for a roti which had no difference from any street side shop. Just a normal roti, I expected the tandori roti to be bigger and better. 
Overall the food was really good.

Staff: very well trained, helped to understand the menu and very soft spoken. The food was served quite fast.

On the whole I liked it all, food, environment, everything. Surely I would go with my family next time.

This place was an absolute let down for me. I had heard a lot about the place and decided to go with my family. First of all it was so crowded, worse that Gariahat a week before the Puja's, the serivce was extremely bad, the crowd was so bad, they were rowdy, the food wasn't so special and upto the mark, the servings which we received at the table had small portions as well. In fact, the parts of the buffet which weren't available on the buffet table where you had to ask the serves to get it for you, you pretty much had to wait for an hour to get it the first time, from the second time onwards we had to literally stake out the server to just get another helping. Machaan doesn't really make you feel like it's a part of the Speciality Groups of restaurants. This place was an absolute waste of money.

Fine dining.. expensive theme based eatery! - this perfectly describes machaan in a few words.. have been there a couple of times and would love to go again... its a perfect place to be with someone who has not tried any theme based eateries and I think its one of the only eateries to have such a brilliant jungle theme decor.. the dal served here is out of the world and  the quantity served is very generous. Its a very child friendly place with wonderful amicable waiters to help you read and serve from the menu.
i would rate this place as a 3.5!

if you are searching for a great place to go.. i mean the ambiance . the first of its kind in kolkata .. the almost no light jungle themed eatery this is the place to be.. looks similar to the cafeteria in bangkok's thai national zoo.. the food is good.. not too great to taste and the place is really cool.. i really liked the ambiance and decor of the place although did not sync in well with the food served .. quite avarage food but overall worth the try!

If you are searching for a theme restaurant, you have arrived at the right place. This restro boasts of a 'jungle' theme. This place is very dimly lit with artificial trees all around. There's a central huge banyan tree, along which a 'Machan' is built. If possible opt for the tables laid on the Machan. A staircase will lead you to the same. The mild music and the animals' call which is sure to catch you attention and as your eyes adjust to the darkness in there, yuo'll see monkeys, birds etc all around you. The food is pretty good with nice titles like hunter chicken, shikari shambhu's favourite etc. The taste I will say is not too bad either.

Went there with family (wife and son).
They took some time to serve the food. And after it came and I had indulged my tongue, made me think that they were really quick!

I had just read a couple of books on Mughal history borrowed from my son.
Babur-Nama by Beveridge (scottish church college fame) and Dilip Hiro. Illustrated history of Indian Food by Achhya (OUP). Eaton's book has nothing on the culinary aspects of mughal culture. (Also Dalrymples account of Zafar - the last Mughal).
And I must tell you - I began to believe what the books said about the life of the mughal emperors during the pre-fridge days. 
Five stars for Machaan. (Don't look at the trees that will surround you, just build up your appetite)
If anyone else promises you Mughlai cuisine - reserve your judgement till you visit Machaan. 
Value for money.
Can't believe that the same group came out with the utterly pretentious Mainland China and Flame & Grill.
I had heard that the same guy had first started with "Only Fish" in Mumbai. Never been there for their bone-less hilsa.

A very interesting decor, a unique one I should say, but I am sad to say, it simply ends there. The food & the service is quite awesome but the bill hits you hard in the end. Though the fooding experience is quite satisfactory, it is quite a pocket pinch at the end of the day.

It's like sitting inside a jungle and having a picnic. Theme is fascinating not only for Children but also for Adults. Really dark inside with dense foliage, but visibility is not an issue with nice spot-light arrangement.

I went over there to celebrate my husband's birthday (27th June, 2012). We tried Ajwaini Fish Tikka (highly recommended), Nariyal Mirch Jhinga and Bhatti Murgh as starter. For main course we had Zaffrani Gosht Biriyani and Chaamp Ka Saalan. Each and every item that we ordered had the perfect blend of spices and ingredients with their secret junglee (green) touch. Single orders are sufficient for a group of 4. Biriyani was huge in quantity; it came in Handi with 4 big Mutton pieces. However the taste was not up to the mark, it was bit salty (not our day). Onion Salad and Papar were offered complementary.

The service was courteous and quick. It was overall a good experience though price was pretty high. Good for couple but you would surely burn a big whole in your pocket in enjoying a family/ group dinner.

I was there for buffet. I really don't remember much about the Main course as I was too busy devouring the starter. The starters were out of the world. If you are a non-veggie they will provide you only non-veg starters unlike Flame & Grill. Ambiance great! Service great! Food great! But it'll not go easy on your pocket

The name Machaan(the tree top house to watch animals) perfectly suits the Ambience.....!! The ambience is like you are sitting in the middle of the jungle...with all wild animals around you.... and one more interesting thing is that..even the waiters r dressed up.... in clothes like they are trying to camouflage. even the washroom has jungle design :P
The names of the dishes are also strange.... Junglee Masala Murgh and bullet seekh kebab was excellent...!!
Pocket Pinch is slightly on the higher side...but one thing I should say that... be assured...You get..what you pay for...!! :))

Ambiance is terrific, so do the food and service! 10/10 in all! Not a pocket friendly but if you want good food then do visit once! Tried several dishes and liked "chicken chadni tikka" (liked the dressing) and it was too good, "Mutton Rann" (best in town), and "sikh bullet kebab" (best in town). In main course "murgh lababder" and specially liked cheese and masala kulcha(never tried this kinda masala kulcha before, green filling). Must visit place for a foodie person!

Food and staff good, tried ajwani murg shorba and lal murgh kebab(name is something around) to my liking. These two were really offbeat, Biriyani was so so, had better Biriyani even at common places in Kolkata. Mutton rogan josh was not something I cherished here.
May be when I have tasted all of kolkata, think of visiting back. Ambiance!!! you may like or you may hate ...ball in your court :).
