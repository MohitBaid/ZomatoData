Had biryani from this place for lunch. Ordered it for the entire team and got it delivered it in a very good packed boxes and pouches. The biryani is made in hyderabadi style. A little different from kolkata biryani with egg instead of potato with the meat. With biryani we got raita and a chicken curry gravy which were tasty as well.

I have eaten here and I feel this place serves very good food and the presentation is decent. There aren't many biryani outlets in Kolkata which prepare anything apart from the Kolkata style biryani. From that point of view, this place should count as a welcome change. The biryani is not purely Hyderabadi in nature and taste. However, the flavours are there. It should be counted as a good experimental effort. The other dishes which are offered tastes good as well. Much recommended spot if you can get along with the experiments.

Today I had chicken biryani of this outlet
..And it was just the waste of money. Kolkata people should never try this (if you do have enough bucks to waste then share it with the needy people... Not on this outlet).I had tried enormous biryanis... From all regions... But this seems to be the same one available in railway pantry car. A bad quality gravy..And red and yellow coloured rice will help you to remember the food you have eaten on trains or in dirty fast food shops in Hyderabad. I have no choice to give this restaurant a 0 that's why given the rating as 1. One thing I have noticed.. They are excellent in packaging. After all some tricks they have to adopt to make u fool right,‚ò∫Ô∏è

I just called the restaurant Briyani Box to enquire about the order status. The owner tells me he cannot be in human to his delivery guys as it is raining.. So therefore he will send it by 10:30 if it stops raining. This is kolkata and it has a past history of roads flooding when it rains. No other restaurants in the city give these excuses they all deliver on time and prepare in advance for the rainy season. The restaurant is just across the road from where I live.How long does it require from them to deliver the food. Very bad service.

We bought two chicken and one mutton biryani from the counter outside Sapoorji. 
To my surprise, one of the biryani box, labelled as 'chicken biryani' had soya, 1 paneer ka tukda, as few other vegetables alongside white biryani rice. 
I called the guy, and he said he will replace it for free. 
And then, when I tasted the biryani from the other box, I realised walking that distance from my apartment to main gate would be waste of time. 
All three biryani tasted pathetic. 
A suggestion: The business plan of Biryani Box is good and refreshing. What you need is good cooks. Because at the end of the day, what matters most is the 'TASTE'.

As a biriyani lover, we want to try this new restaurant and ordered 1 chicken and 1 mutton biriyani. Unfortunately it was sunday night and I ordered at 10.59. Chicken was not available and we tasted the mutton biriyani. I got delivery by 11.35 at my place though it was 1km beyond their last delivery location.

It's biriyani with 2 big pieces of mutton and one egg cooked in south indian style with beresta. It's sweetly packed inside a big plastic box along with raita and gravy. A bit spicy but not oily at all. Mutton was very well cooked. Quantity was more than enough for single person. 

I'll rate the biriyani 4/5 and an extra 0.5 for good packing and smart delivery.

Every week we are ordering briyani from seven 11. We got addicted to this briyani. The briyani was so tasty and spicy. It is not a regular Kolkata briyani, it has been cooked in South Indian style. Their service is so good and amazing. Mostly I prefer this briyani because of the cost and the packaging. Thank you seven 11 for the wonderful briyani boxüòã. Hope you bring orders to other places also if the quantity of the order is also less.

A wonderful spread of Biryanis from Biryani box. First of all , the overall experience while interacting with the order taking guy was overwhelming. These guys are so qualified and sober and doing such a wonderful job by offering fresh dum Biryani  with a nice taste which was beyond expectations. The price is reasonably low and best a@mong all offerings , I believe in and around. Team Biryani box is not just selling Biryanis but they are holding much bigger picture with their new start up which we all realised while interacted with the team. Well done guys and wish you all best of luck for your new venture. Keep offering us such a good food. The taste and packaging are amazing. The overall experience was really great.

Biryani Box is just a relief to all Kolkata biryani lovers , specially for the people who sincerely seek for a change of taste and some unique flavor of spices in Biryani and keeping taste buds totally away from usual kolkata style Biryanis full of aroma and boiled¬† potato and steamed & fried meat pieces. I came across Biryani box team while strolling near Unitech Gate-2 office and decided to take risk with this new Biryani brand in town. Our team ordered for biryanis and we were all like ga ga over their unique taste and flavor. The whole biryani was made with balanced blend of spices , less oil, less fragrance , yummy and tasty. Chicken piece was very tender and had no raw smell which we do encounter with most of the Biryanis' brand across kolkata. The taste is Hyderabadi way and the biryani comes with Gravy and raita both, which was really super and surprise for us. The food was packaged in a nice micro oven container which was again unusual offering¬† and overall the price was so reasonable and affordable that it seems really impossible to have such a good biryani at such a lovely price. Thanks to the team and well done for your such a splendid job. Keep it up guys , we will order soon

The portion was large and well presented with a natural flavor to arouse your taste bud, we were craving for good indian food and they didn't disappoint us.

Amazing experience with Seven11 biryanis box . Firstly , I just got attracted by their name as what I heard among my office colleagues. I thought to give it a try late night when there is really a nightmare even to think of having a genuine n fresh meal at your door step so I tried these fellows. It was really an awesome and unforgettable experience when I had one premium veg biryanis box.First of all , it looked as a Santa gift to me when I opened the box as got so many components inside at such a reasonable price. I couldn't manage to finish alone. The package is really innovative , neat and organized. Kudos these guys and above all, the taste of Biryani is entirely different among the lot and really tinkering to my taste bud. Even I couldn't resist and made a repeat order today itself.
Wish you all a very good luck and would request to spread your service  towards south Kolkata soon.

I normally not a frequent caller for home delivery but sometimes I do take risk for trying new arrivals in city. Last week I tried this new buzzing biryanis start up , seven11 in Newtown. 
I would say , this is going to disrupt the market soon as the biryanis taste is awesome. While there are many points where Biryani Box excel but the best and unique differentiation lies in their blend of spices on the rice and non-sticky , less oil food. Amazing Guys !!!
Keep rocking guys..

Lot of new biryanis offerings are seen in the city of joy these days . Really good to see young guys like Seven11 team who are quite courteous and full of enthusiasm. Met these guys at my office gate and really it was too indulging talking to them regarding biryanis that we decided to order for our team lunch. It was just a wild try as what little difficult to ......digest that such a difficult and complicated cuisine like Biryanis could be a cup of tea for these youngsters in their 30's ....but believe me we all were wrong .....we ordered mix of variants including veg Biryanis. Veg Biryani is really fabulous and amazing as got so many ingredients and vegetables cocktail inside that leaves you totally ... unsatisfied and you will crave for more. 
More over, their mutton is really much better than chicken and packaging is truly innovative and handy. The whole office was glittering with Biryani Box packets...Red n Yellow ...combination so eye catching...:)....Thumps up guys...

With the Demonetisation taking its toll on the road side stalls and the daily visitors, this service came as a pleasant relief. As i walked out of my office to check which stalls were opens to serve and whether they will take PAYTM as a mode of payment, i saw a small TATA NANO come and stand in front of me with BIRYANI BOX written all over it. The first impression i got was that they will be having ready to serve boxes of Biryani and they will sell out from the car itself. As i asked the person in the car - Will i get a Biryani? He answered with a smile that yes you will. Kindly place your order and it will be served in 35 mins. i asked for the mode of payment and he asked me which option would i try - i chose Mini Veg Biryani and he said as it is 99/- Rs only please pay cash . I paid and booked the Biryani out of simple curiosity and the stalls not being open. Was pleasantly surprised to be delivered the Biryani in 20-25 mins and the packaging was just amazing. The owner had mentioned that the quantity will be good for a BRUNCH, but i found the quantity good enough . The taste of Biryani and the Raita was good and was happy that i chose to venture out. :)  Would surely reccomend people to try if they are bored of eating the daily stuff at the roadside stalls. BTW - my office is DLF2 - Rajarhat

"Seven11" has become a new name for us to resort for good and fresh food with super customer handling experience. Though these guys are new , young and dynamic but the whole ordering , we just felt like in touch of some old colleagues or friends. We had some repeat orders from Seven11 kitchen for our office in Salt Lake and we found the consistency in taste and quality which is really rare for most of the industry veterans. 
Biryani Box is one of the exclusive products and offerings which is simply awesome. The variants address all kind of customers and pricing is so reasonable. Biryanis are really different and tempting. We are now regular customer to Seven11 and would recommend others for same. Keep the flag flying guys and best of luck for your new start up. Way to go  Seven11.

I regularly order food from Seven 11. Preparations are great, balanced spices, less oily and helping is generous. The Biriyani is regular item I feast on and just love the packing too. Delivery boys are extremely courteous and Sometimes I had wanted food to be delivered quicker (due to aged parents at home) than their normal turn around time and the team has done that always. My 83 Year old Dad is a big fan of #Seven11 Veg Biriyani.

Seven11 is like a regular food ordering place for me. If my cook has not turned up Seven11 is my saviour. The speciality about the food here is every order is freshly prepared and served. Unlike other food joints you can actually make out the difference between different dishes. The spices used are specially prepared and of rich quality. The flagship product "The Biryani Box" I guess needs jo introduction as I m sure everyone had already tasted it. The taste authentic yet traditional Bengali style is preserved. So please go ahead and order without any second thoughts.. Cheers Seven11 team, keep up the tremendous job that you guys are doing and keep feeding more souls.

We had ordered food from Seven 11 for our team lunch at office. Food quality & taste was awesome... ¬†Food Packaging was good.... And the best part was food quantity and side dishes they offer with chicken biryani, that makes a complete package.... Prompt food delivery across New Town & Rajarhat....

This is quit a late review,Sorry for dat,,, So on fun Friday in my office last week my Team ordered the Regular Biryani box from Seven 11.
The most most amazing thing of Seven 11 are their packing.Itz so so nice.
Coming down to biryani , it is surely not the typical Kolkata biryani .As it does have the amazing aroma of kolkatians are used to.It is more of like,biryani of Mumbai I have tried.But itz good.
Will surely order again.

The food was simply amazing. 
For a single person, it was a wholesome meal and it was very tasty. It was very soft and munchy and the potato price was delicious. The look of the food was also very good. The food was a tad bit spicy. Keep up the good work.

Seven11 is 'the' place to order food when you don't want to cook but still don't want to have the guilt of feeding your family outside food. Amazing 'homecooked' food, low on oil and spice, high on taste and quality. I am happy to have such a service at my doorstep! Good luck team Seven11 for great sucess in the days to come!!

The food of seven eleven is tasty,less oily , freshly cooked and close to home cooked food . I regularly order my food from here.Seven eleven snack preparations serves as perfect in between meals filler or as starters specially there chicken roll,momos,chicken lollipop,chicken sandwhich and the list keeps going on...
Seven 11 chicken biryani is one of the best biryani in kolkata.Other items which I strongly recommend is there mutton dehati its absolutely delight to have.
The best part of seven 11 team is that they customize the size of order as per your requirement which serves as a boon while planning house party
Best of luck and way to go for this eat out

One of the Best Biriyani makers in Kolkata!
One of the few places where the Chicken/Mutton pieces are properly cooked along with the long biriyani basmathi rice and the juice and ghee is allowed to spread uniformly throughout the rice.
Ordered Biriyani several times. Sometimes the delivery is slightly delayed. But worth every second and every penny you spend to get Biriyani from this place.
Once you reach, you would find they are dealing with huge number of orders, for the Biriyani. That is the popularity and brilliance of the Biriyani here.
And VFM? The Biriyani is worth lot more than what you pay!¬†
Get the Biriyani, go home, have it hot, and allow your heart to be melted by the tastiest Biriyani in town!!

Tried Chicken Biryani from Seven11. Lovely Taste and the best part is the freshness and no sign of any adulteration. I don't remember ever having Biryani without sequence of BURPS post having it from other restaurants but after having Biryani from Seven11, the post effect is quite pleasant and smooth. Nevertheless, the  Seven11 team is really charming and engaging and open for all feedback ;)  Good going team and all the best !!
