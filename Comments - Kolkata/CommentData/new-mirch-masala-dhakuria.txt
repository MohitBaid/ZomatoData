ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…When My School Was Over At Around 3:30pm I Took A Rickshaw And My Sir Paid It. I Said To The Rickshaw Driver Selimpur Road Dhakuria Bus Stop. He Dropped Me There. After That I Saw The Renovation Work Was Going On. So I Asked The Chef Is There Anything To Eat I'm Feeling Hungry. He Said What Can I Get You, So I Replied To Him 1 Plate Chicken Fried Rice He Said OK. It Cost Me Rs. 110/- It Was Little Bit Spicy That I Cried And Remembered My Grandmother Means Nani. How The Quantity And The Quality Was Awesome. And The Food Was Mouth-watering And Delicious.ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°

This place is known for its famous rolls. Often while coming back from school or tuition, my mother used to get rolls for the family. Egg roll, chicken roll, egg chicken roll - all of them are really good. Loved them a lot. Haven't tried this place in a while but have heard from my friends and foes that it is still as good as it was when I was in school. If you pass by Dhakuria, you can drop by sometime and grab one for yourself too. Happy Dining! :)

This little takeaway joint is on my way back from almost anywhere I go - right in the middle of Selimpur. On many occasions, I have opted for takeaway from this eatery, simply because of the quantity they provide. Although the quality cannot be compared with the major restaurants in the city, the food is still quite satisfactory, especially their peas polao and chicken kasha, and friend rice and chili chicken, as these are my preferred items. A decent and cheap place to take home some good food. Thank you for your service.

I remember this outlet very much as while visiting Selimpur Pally durga puja Pandel me along with my friends had Egg chicken roll and Chicken momo from here. The roll was excellent I still remember the taste and not very heavy less oily but tasted brilliant and the momo was fresh and the staffing inside was average though. Momos were quite decently big in size too.

One of the better take aways in Dhakuria, this is a place close to home and quite close to my heart. They serve food which is great value for money, the rolls are awesome....so also are the fish fries and chicken cutlets. The egg tadka is also another good preparation that they serve. Both quality and quantity of the food they serve is very good. Situated right on the main road....hygiene might be an issue.....but as far as I have seen they do strive to keep it as clean as possible. Have been ordering food from here and will certainly continue to do so.

I am surprised this place Rates so less on Zomato!
I have been ordering food from here since I was in school. The Chinese preparations and the Chicken roll and the Chicken. Momo are all excellent and my all time favorites. A genuinely good value for money takeaway that has maintained its standard over the years!

Have been to this place sometime back,, been there with my family and ordered north Indian food .WE ORDERED 2 fish fry,2 chicken roll.Regarding their Indian section the chicken rolls and the fish fry Â is just fantastic. Served fresh and hot at your doorstep at an incredibly short span of time, it's easily amongst their must try dishes in the Indian section. BUT AS FAR THE PRICES CONCERNED THE PRICE IS REASONABLE AND AFFORDABLE.As for the negative points, well I think this place is a little understaffed AND the ambience is satisfactory.And as long as food is concerned i dont have any complaints.

This is take away joint just at selimpore more. I have visited this place many times but every time ordered for chicken roll. So I won't be able to tell about the other items. 
But they make some awesome quality chicken roll. I would say every passer by should try this once.

It's a small joint in selimpore area but is somewhat of a local favourite amongst the nearby residents for a quick take away! My relatives stay nearby and many a times I have been treated with their food. 
Regarding their Indian section the chicken rolls and the chicken cutlet is just fantastic. Served fresh and hot at your doorstep at an incredibly short span of time, it's easily amongst their must try dishes in the Indian section. 
They also serve lip smacking steamed chicken momos - juicy hot and fresh they are incredibly tasty! In their Chinese section I also love their chicken Cantonese chowmein, huge in quantity and really easy on the pockets. Next time you are in this particular locality don't forget to try their food, you will love it for sure. 
As for the negative points, well I think this place is a little understaffed and many a times when we ordered food for home delivery they insisted that they are short on staff and requested us for a take away, which is simply not done when you have the "home delivery" option available. 
But as far as the prices are concerned it's really easy on the pockets. My aunt is a miser when it comes to ordering food especially for her relatives (hehe) and this joint is her favourite, be it any occasion from birthdays to get togethers food is only ordered from here! And trust me I have been invited to many birthdays and many occasions, so their food is constantly on my mind! 
And as long as it tastes good I don't have any complaints but I do have some questions regarding their level of hygiene for sure, but again as long as I am not eating inside their shop I am fine!

Latest update:
Today I ate their chicken roll again. Surprised to find they have changed the recipe! It has now become a typical chicken roll that is available at any joint like this. Chicken pieces are no more grilled as before, rather it is just tossed with onion and masala as it is done commonly. No specialty remains. Reducing the rating to 3.
____________________________________

Budget take away restaurant. The kitchen is not transparent. New in the business and is maintaining consistent standard. Quality is good and taste is as expected. Very popular and always have rush in peak hours. I am a frequent customer for their Hakka noodles and chicken momo. They serve so called Indian Chinese and north Indian dishes. But their best products are chicken roll and double chicken roll. Tender pieces of chicken marinated and grilled to make small tandoor cubes and put in soft paratha with fresh onions with lime juice and chopped green chilli. No other masala or sauce to spoil the taste. This is the best roll I have tasted in recent days and this one I am sure would come within the top three tasty and quality rolls made in the city. Hope they maintain the same standard in near and far future.

Good rolls, excellent gravy noodles, OK fried non-veg dishes. Mirch Masala is mostly on the go food joint and it suits the bill perfectly. There are no seating arrangements and the extremely crowded Selimpur Bus Stop makes this place noisy and crowded.

As takeaways go this is one of the most popular joints in this area. I have rarely seen this place in the evening without a long line of hungry customers . Their home delivery is prompt and the quantity is generous. I am quite partial to their north indian food and though I am die hard non vegetarian myself Â their paneer pakora is to die for.

Standard Chinese and Indian takeaway and fast food centre. Quality is standard and nothing to boast about. I personally feel that the food here is excessively oily. While some other it, I'd look down on that. The mixed Manchurian fried rice is good but remind them to cook in less oil. The rolls here are good and the main reason why this place is known.

Cheap and good Indian Chinese takeaways place. And has served as our source of dinner for several nights now. How I wish they made Roti's too. The biggest advantage they had was being located right under my apartment. Apart from that the food was nothing to write home about. Anyway, its unhealthy to have dinner from a roll Center on a daily basis.

This place is a must go for someone who likes fast food. Food is good. Rates are affordable. Of the things I have tasted here, Rolls, Noodles, Chicken Cutlet and Fish Fry are the best. Food quantity is more compared to other places. According to me the one must have at this place is Chicken Rolls. Chicken here have a nice juicy and slight smoky taste. Being a small place with no sitting arrangement, they have much to offer in terms of taste and food quality and quantity.

I had been there in the mid of July. Experienced fantastic quality of food and service especially, fish fry, chicken cutlet, chicken bharta, tarka and Chinese also. Being a small outlet I was surprised to get amazing quality and quantity . And last but not the least, I had my best chicken roll there.
