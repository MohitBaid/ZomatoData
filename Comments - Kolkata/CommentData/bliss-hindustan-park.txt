I love this tiny little eatery. Located next Azad Hind Dhaba, this place has around 4 tables. Momos, Chicken Chowmein, Chilli Chicken - they serve delicious street food, which might not be the healthiest, but is definitely very tasty. Priced decently, offering home delivery and take away and sit-down options with quick service, this restaurant is your go to restaurant if you want a quick Chinese snack of the quintessential Bengali-Chinese cuisine.

Looking for cheap Chinese at a pocket friendly price? Look no further. Nobody does indianised Chinese quite like them. I've tried almost everything's that's there on the menu and while there aren't any specific dishes which will exactly knock you out they maintain a rare uniformity across the entire menu. Order anything and you'd be happy with it. Recommendations would be lung fung soup, mixed schezwan rice, red pepper chicken. Also they make a mean mixed gravy noodles.

Amazing small place. Best for friends hangouts. The food is quite good. We ordered various types of noodles, hakka or gravy both are available. The Bliss special Chowmein is quite innovative. Mandarin fish is a must try for fish lovers. The services are quick.

As the name suggests this place is indeed bliss.. This place is my go to destination when I am in mood of great food.. They serve the best mixed fried rice I have ever tasted..Bliss is renowned in Kolkata for its authentic momo and Chinese cuisine.. This place gives you pleasure in taste buds without digging a whole in pocket.. Good quality and good quantity all comes within a pocket friendly price.
Must try dishes - mixed fried rice, chilli chicken, mixed chowmine and pan fried momo..

Quantity, Quality and Pricing ...these are the three things which will satisfy you. A small joint mainly a takeaway place situated behind Azad Hind Dhaba of Hindustan Park.

All items are must try... But I like their momos, Dry Chili Chicken and Meifoon. 
Great place for HUNGRY college goers who are often on a strict budget.

Another one of my favorite Chinese food joint in south kolkata. The place is really small and accommodate maximum of 10-12 people at a time.
We ordered
✴ Chicken steam momo :- momos are quiet big compare to other places. Moms stuffing and tomato dip was really tasty. The soup was really good in taste.
✴ Hot garlic chowmein :- nice flavourful and tasted was amazing. The quantity was huge. Enough for two people.
Service was quick. Place was nice and clean. It's a very pocket friendly food joint.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...!!!

This place has always been my favourite when it comes to having some delicious Chinese at the cheapest possible rate. Sharing my recent experience, I tried the Steamed Chicken Momos and Mixed Hakka Noodles. 

One plate of momos is priced at just 100 bucks, which includes six steamed momos served with tomato dip and a bowl of chicken soup. If you're looking for a good place for momos, you should never miss this. The momos are quite large in size and are stuffed generously with a juicy chicken stuffing. What won my heart was the tangy tomato dip. Trust me this is the best condiment for momos you'll ever get. The dip was made using mashed tomato, garlic and spices. It wasn't fiery hot and spicy, like the other momo dips. It was tangy and less spicy. The soup was flavourful, with minced chicken pieces and herbs. One plate of this is enough to satiate your hunger.

The Hakka Noodles tasted amazing. It was loaded with chicken, fried egg and shrimps with utmost generosity. You wouldn't need any side dish with it. The quantity is huge and good enough for two. 

The bill came to 240 bucks only. Waiting to visit this place again.

This place is something here you would like to go on days when you don't really want to spend much but still want to have good food. This non AC, small joint, which has a seating capacity of only 12 people, is located at a 5 minutes-walk along the lane opposite to Basanti Devi College. Me and my friends order the same old thing every time, and this day was no different:

1. Red Pepper Fish- undoubtedly THE BEST item from the menu! Soft fish cubes fried and sauteed in onion, garlic and capsicum. Spicy and totally amazing!
2. Sauteed Chicken Drumsticks- boneless chicken strips, deep fried and sauteed in the well-known Chinese sauce. Another spicy hit!
3: Bliss Special Fried Rice- a big serving of Chinese mix fried rice with veggies, shrimps, chicken and a fried egg on top. Enough for two people.
4: Mandarin Chicken: moderately spicy chicken side dish.

Red Pepper Fish is a Must try! Although not a place for a date, per se, this place is a good option to grab a quick meal with friends during those end-of-the-month cheap days!

Ambience- 2.5/5
Staff- 2.5/5
Food- 3.5/5
Pocket Pinch- ₹720 for 3! What more do we want!

Located in a prime location ( Just beside Azad Hind dhaba in Lake Road ), this place has been a favourite of mine for quite some years now. They serve one of the best Chinese South Calcutta has to offer and also very much pocket friendly . The only downside is the small sitting area which often leads to crowds and  a wait to get a seat . Some dishes that I would recommend are Fried Chicken momo ,Chicken and corn soup, dry chilly chickeen. Garlic chicken , their gravy noodles (any one ) , Manchurian fish , crispy chicken and so on . Those who haven't yet paid this place a visit , I urge you to do the same . You wont be disappointed .

Other than this I would recommend gravy noodles and any of the fried rice as main course. However, their Haka noodles is not upto the mark. Quantity is huge and easily suffices two person per plate. Service is very good.

A GREAT budget place for college goers..Not much of a Restaurant in the strict sense of the term,almost a takeaway,but a good eatery nonetheless,especially ideal for those little hangouts and addas over that plate of noodles or Fried Rice which are the speciality here.. The place is light on the pocket and given the low price,the food quality and quantity is surely commendable..I have often visited this place with my friends and the experience has always been good.I have tried both Hakka Chicken and Veg Chowmein with Schezwan and Garlic variations which turned out to be pretty good.However,the Gravy Chowmein that they serve here is not at all up to the mark..Other dishes like the Chicken preparations and Baby Corn preparations were definitely very good.A single plate of any dish can serve two people of medium appetite comfortably.In all,you can definitely visit it to rest those hunger pangs with very less burden on your pocket.

Bliss ---- a small eatery at Hindustan park. I'm not going to its ambiance, because that is not important here. To be particular, nothing special is there. The place is best known for food in pocket friendly price.
We ordered for Pan fried fish, Bliss special Gravy Chowmein, Chicken Fried rice and Chicken Manchurian. 
Pan fried fish was the most I liked. It was delicious and finger licking good. Those who do not like spicy dry chowmein, Gravy Chowmein is just perfect for them. Fried rice and Manchurian was OK; nothing special.
I must say the quantity was more than enough. Staffs are good and service is prompt. 
Try it, you will be satisfied.

This one features heavily on my weekend regular list. The food here is reminiscent of the classic Calcutta Chinese variety. Particularly of note are the momos, especially the Pan Fried ones, and the Crispy Chilli Chicken which is a unique blend of tangy, spicy and fried goodness. My absolute favourite is the Mixed Chinese Chop suey. The noodles are crisp while the gravy is excellently cooked - just the right amount of thickness and filled with meat. All of the dishes are served in wholesome quantities. Only regret is that they don't serve more variety of meat. Being primarily a takeaway/home delivery joint, the ambience isn't much to boast of but the very prompt delivery service coupled with reasonably priced good food makes this restaurant a personal favourite.

Since my admission into Basanti Devi College, this restaurant has become a regular part of our eating endeavours and has become our regular go-to canteen/hub. The place is non-ac, small, with three tables only, service is good but what attracts us there is their surprisingly quality promising food at such a cheap rate! Located in Gariahat, do try the gravy noodles there, it's really tasty! One plate of gravy noodles is sufficient for two! So if you take 1 plate gravy noodles and 1 side dish and share the bill with your partner/friend, you are paying 130-150rs each. Cheap and affordable eh? Its difficult to choose their sidedishes as review as all are equally tasty! Do try their panfried chicken momo! A five star in all. A must try.

What you might not like too much: the sitting space which is bare minimum, the interior, there might be hygiene concern though am pretty sure they maintain a clean kitchen.
What you'll love: the food. The price, even more. The quantity that they provide for 150 bucks can easily fill one spot stomach for dinner. I wouldn't be able to handle an entire plate of chow personally, though it's super tasty. Also, there is home delivery for short distances.
So go check out the place. It's best if you want to pack your food for home to sit and enjoy it with a good TV series. ❤️

This place is one of the best place that you can visit when you are low on budget. Very tasty food within a very affordable price.
The quantity is also good and one plate can easily be shared by two.
The momos here are finger licking.
The place is usually filled and hence one might have to wait as it is not very huge.
The ambience is not very good but when it comes to value for money this place definitely clicks.

I've been here a thousand and hundred times and always, without fail, Bliss has given me and my pocket extreme joy!

Our pre - Diwali bash was a success thanks to the food from this joint. Such amazing food at such cheap rates - really a steal.

I've visited the joint in real, and there is not much to say about its décor or interior, however one cannot call it shabby or anything. It is very clean and has spick and span tables and chairs. Non - ac though. 

On the 28th, however we decided to order food from this joint to my house. 
The food was too gooood, and too much for the 4 of us. 

We had ordered :
• Mixed fried rice - we had ordered 2 plates of this and the quantity was soo sooo much. Amazing taste with an abundance prawns, eggs and chunks of chicken.
• Mixed hakka chow - 1 plate of this was enough for 2! This tasted divine. Again and abundance of meat here. 

For sides :
• Chilli potato gravy - the quantity was overwhelming. And it tasted out of this world. 
• Chicken Manchurian - 8 big pieces of chicken in this dish. Impeccable taste. Went really well with both the rice and chow.

All I can say is, Bliss has never disappointed me, and I'm more than sure that it never will. The quality and taste of the food items is more than awesome. 

Pocket pinch - 720 only! So much food, that too at such low prices = 😍
All my love to Bliss.

I have been visiting Bliss since 2004 and the first thing that I ever tried here was Chicken Momo. From that instance I fell in love with the place as well as Momos. However, over the years the taste of the momos has altered yet it is still way better than many momo joints. I love their Chopsueys and the quantity is enough for 2 people to share. 
All variety of momos should be tried here atleast once.

This is probably the best secret winter getaway place for me and a few friends. Nothing matches the Thai soup here . It is soul food. A classic example of how the ambience doesn't even matter when the food is that good.

Recommended : One must definitely try the Thai Soup at least once in their life. Other than that, pan fried momos, Garlic noodles and most of the chicken side dishes.

Good old Indianised Chinese dishes at a very affordable price, that's what you get here. The only turn off about this place is the lack of any ambience. There is no AC and the seating arrangements are very simple with plastic chairs and tables. Still,as long as the food is good,these can be overlooked. The food is definitely good although it can be better. I had the Bliss special soup,minus the prawns. It was tasty and had enough chicken portions with the egg drizzle on top. The hot garlic chicken was piping hot and filled with flavours. The only dish I didn't like very much was the chilly garlic rice. It was too hot and spicy for my liking. When i say spicy, I mean it was loaded with chilliness :-( . My eyes filled up with tears because it was very hot. But still,I would recommend this restaurant to my friends for its pocket friendly prices and tasty chinese with good quantity.

My all time favorite Chinese joint - crave for mixed gravy chowmein. One of the best among the south kolkata eateries. In addition best place to hang out with friends, though its not very spacious.

Was told about this place over two years ago, and this became my source of comfort food. Do not go looking for a lot, and you will be rewarded with what you are served! My all-time favourite remains their pan fried chicken momos which can entice taste buds and/or induce tears. :D 
P.S. Do NOT forget that they are closed on Mondays. This could save you from expectations that go in vain on seeing the shutters drawn.

Located close to Hindustan Park near krystal chopstick, right next to the Azad Hind Dhaba on Purna Das Road.It's a very small place with three table seating with no AC, but it's food quality is very good.

We ordered : Pan fried fish,Bliss special fried rice and Manchurian chicken.
Fish was soft,juicy and tasted very fresh.
The rice was loaded with chicken,egg,prawn and veggies and served with a poached egg on the top.
Manchurian chicken was soft and well cooked.

The Quality of the food they offer is very good and the quantity is sufficient for two people.
This is a good place to have Indian-Chinese at a very reasonable price near Gariahat......

'Bliss' is located in Hindusthan Park just beside the Azad Hind Dhaba and our experience here yesterday was a horrible one to say the least. Since it was a rainy evening we wanted to try to some hot Chinese dishes. We were in Gariahat area and decided to give this place a try. We had heard rave reviews about this 'little gem'. Alas! We were disappointed. The restaurant is a small one with twelve seats and three tables.After going in, we wanted to go for some starters and then proceed to the main course. We went for the 'Chicken Drumsticks' first. We were served raw chicken and they replaced it with a fresh batch right after complaining. This batch also had raw chicken. Tastewise, it was average. I really was confused as this eatery has been regarded as a spectacular one. I am never visiting this outlet again.

Blood in my drumsticks!!! No!!!dats not what i ordered!!!the last thing i would expect is undercooked food!!!
But on the plus side.the moment i showed the mess to the staff they immediately replaced the dish with a fresh batch.and that was just fine.
Now coming to the taste.frankly speaking it was just average. I found it more like a humble chicken pakora.loads of scope for improvement.reading the reviews on zomato we did plan to order a few other dishes.but the first order itself disappointed us and we dint order anything else.

LOCATION:

Located close to Hindustan Park right next to the Azad Hind Dhaba on Purna Das Road.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

This is a humble family owned Chinese eatery which has been around forever. Interiors are absolutely NIL with plastic chairs, tables and fans. The place is non - air conditioned and yet has a good fan following in the area. Te reason is that they are managing to serve reasonable quality food at very reasonable pricing.

FOOD & WINE:

We ordered Chicken Lollipop, Vegetable Momos, Chilli Chicken and Egg Fried Rice. We stuck with simple as we did not want try complex at such a humble outlet.

The Chicken Lollipop was overcooked and tough. We did not enjoy the dish.

The Veg. Steamed Momos were delicious. The Outer layer of flour was perfectly rolled so as to be thin enough to melt in your mouth and thick enough to balance the filling inside. Even the filling was quite tasty.

The Chilli Chicken was good flavor wise but I personally had issues with the quality of chicken being used. I found the Chilli Chicken to be a little tough as well. Maybe it was just me as the people around me seemed to be doing just fine. But the gravy was tasty and had a good hit of green chillies. 

The Egg Rice was also good and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of rice being used as well as the quantity of egg which had been given in one portion off egg rice.

Service was as it should be in a humble, traditional Kolkata outlet. Fast and effective.

PRICING:

Very reasonably priced. That I think is one of the major reasons for the popularity.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Sharing the kind of popularity that they do, I think air conditioning would be the order of the day especially since the seating is quite cramped up. Even a cooler would help make diners more comfortable.

VERDICT:

If its street Chinese you seek, you're gonna have a ball !

I still remember their Noodles and Manchurian Chicken. It's truly yummilicious and have made me fall in love with the kind of food they offer. Also to mention their price is reasonable which is one of their USP as well.

This is an eatery right adjacent to Azad Hind in Gariahat. Has exactly 3 tables and 4 chairs in each table. This is not the place you want to come for an ambience. However, great food. I tried their lemon chicken and chilli chicken, which were really great. Their Schezuan chicken noodles were too spicy for me, but it is quite a hit for spicy food lovers. Their veg fried rice is ordinary and so is the chicken chilli garlic fried rice. They even have a range of combos to offer, which are very filling too. For a hearty meal within 200/-, you could try this place. Even their staff is quite cooperative.
However, most unfortunately, today I had to bite into a piece of chicken, which was not cleaned properly. And there was a visible redness inside, which almost looked like blood. Since that was the end of the meal, we did not bother telling the manager. And as they say, all's well that ends well. We left with a not-so-happy experience.
I have been here before and loved their food. So this might not be an everyday thing. But food was tastier back then. And, today's incident brought my rating down from a 4 to a 2.5.

Ambience: 1/5 This place has little or no ambience of any kind being a take away joint. I did dine in, but the restaurant  staff stared at us in such a way throughout the meal that it made it difficult to have a conversation.
Price:5/5 for food of this immense quality such low prices are amazing and the prices make this place absolutely perfect to satisfy cravings.
Food:5/5 The food here is quality and value for money. The pan fried momo is a must have. The Manchurian mixed noodles is a favourite of mine.

Tucked away into the lane opposite Basanti Devi College, this is a gem, especially for hungry students like me. It's a small place, and I mean small, with just 2-3 tables arranged for seating, so if you stumble across during rush hour, you might be in for a bit of a wait. But it's ABSOLUTELY worth it. Their food is really really good, with astounding quantity for really reasonable prices. My all time favourite is
Chicken Panfried Momo - this is probably the best I have tasted. Giant fat momos and an amazingly spice balanced sauce. 
Other stuff here is great too, including their Garlic fried rice, Chilli garlic noodles, spring chicken, dry chilli chicken, and mostly everything else on the pretty varied menu. 

One great hing here is their combo offer, which allows a single person to have a staple carb like rice or noodles along with a side for much less price than ordering two separate things, also ensuring that one is able to actually finish all the food. 

In short, one of the really good places to have Indian-Chinese at pretty low rates near Gariahat.

Just next to Azad Hind Dhaba in Hindustan Park, there is this small Chinese restaurant, Bliss. On reading the reviews, it seemed pretty decent. Wasn’t expecting much and it was a giveaway that it was one of the typical Chinese restros suited to Indian tastebuds. 

Ordered in one day, kept it pretty simple with chicken fried rice, hakka noodles and garlic chicken. And you all know how hard the wait is till your food arrives. And guess what, they delivered it within 15 minutes. Pretty amazing! Coming to the food, it’s alright, not too bad. Good quantity. Pocket friendly. And once again, full marks for the prompt delivery.

Bliss is tucked away at the end of the alley connecting Basanti Devi College to Purna Das Road. For better understanding, it is in the same alley as Crystal Chopstick, Indthalia, and Azad Hind Dhaba. This little joint has been ruling the scenes like forever. Though the seating is very limited and there is no AC to save you from the disturbing Calcutta humidity, this place still soars in popularity. 

The USP of the place is its Chinese Food that tastes a lot like, it is leaving from one of the best kitchens in Tangra. It is your go to place, when you are caving a bit of China Town food.  Some of the things you must try are- pan fried momo, red pepper fish, crispy chilli chicken, chicken gravy noodles and fried rice, chilli chicken/fish/prawn, Mandarin chicken/fish, garlic prawn, etc.

I had been to this place innumerable times. Earlier they used to serve delicious food but later the food quality began to deteriorate.
I have almost tasted evrything from der menu. I was a regular here.
 
Their chicken steam momos n da sauce are too good. Garlic fried rice, chilli garlic noodles, mixed gravy noodles, red pepper chicken, dry chilli chicken, crispy chicken and thai soup are worth giving a try. The babycorn dishes are ok types n very oily.
But afterwards my feedback changed as thrice i got served bad quality chicken dishes and bland fried rice.
Based on my earlier experience i wud have rated ds place 3.5 or 4 maybe only for their food quality, quantity and price.
Its not a place whose decor or interiors can be talked about. Pocket pinch is low.
The dishes in da photos include chicken chilli garlic noodles, chicken fried rice and mandarin chicken.

I had visited this place with my best friend and well, second best friend! My best friend is the one who suggested this place as it has good food at pocket friendly rates. And I must say, the place wasn't disappointing at all! We had ordered Chicken Drumsticks, Chicken Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken. 
All the dishes were really tasty. The indianised Chinese version at its very best. The Chicken Drumsticks were cooked to perfection and the chicken had some wonderful flavour. Really liked the dish a lot. Though I must say, if you get it packed, don't keep it for long as it becomes soggy and lacklustre. The fried rice and chicken in main course were also really tasty. In short, full value for money! 
 The place is very small but when the food is so good, nothing else matters! I will definitely recommend this place to all who happen to be around Gariahat and are looking for a filling meal at a really low price!

Located near the Hindustan Park and adjacent to Azad Hind Dhaba, it serves one of the most delicious yet inexpensive Chinese food. It's basically a take away joint because of its lack of space and the service is fast enough. One should definitely try Chicken Drumsticks and Red Pepper Chicken out here. Amount of food served is decent enough as compared to the cost and the name is thus a justification! :D

For main course,noodles are good compared to fried rice.You can accompany it with Hot Garlic Chicken or Schezwan chicken.

However,one may find it hard to locate.So its just near krystal chopstik & beside Azad Hind Dhaba..

Visited here to satisfy our hunger yesterday, I.e, saraswati puja....
Location- 5 mins of walking in the lane just opposite to basanti devi college and just beside azad hind dhaba.
Ambience- a small eatery with 3 tables. The place can accommodate Max 15 people.
Food- we ordered mixed fried rice and chilly chicken combo and egg fried rice and veg Manchurian for an eggytarian friend. The mixed fried rice and chicken both were good. Nothing exceptional. They provide 4 PCs of chicken in the combo. The veg Manchurian also tasted OK.
Prices- pocket friendly.
If I'm in that area and can't find any other  decent restro, I may give this place a try....

Situated beside Azad Hind Dhaba at purna das road. This outlet has meant for takeaway but has a seating arrangement of 15 people with simple table chair, so no ambiance. Coming to food, we ordered chicken steam and that was too good. Also we ordered two gravy chow variants like manchrian and garlic. Both had too much quantity and we found little bit extra sweetness in garlic chow and extra spice in manchrian chow.

This is surely one place each one should try especially if you are planning to hang out with your friends. This place justifies its name. Yes of course you cannot expect some posh presentation or quality at that cost, but what they serve satisfies you for sure. It was my first visit there after both of my best friends had already been there and were actually swearing each time they spoke about the place.
Once we went in we saw just 3 tables out there and somehow that seemed enough and quite good too. We ordered simple mixed noodles and along with that a plate of hot garlic chicken.
Taste was wow! and the quantity as well.
We are planning to go there soon again and till then keep eating people.

Cheers!

In short a perfectly located, pocket friendly place to Hog on to your favourite cuisine-Chinese- you don't get a posh ambience but what you get is awesome food accompanied with quick & good service.  We ordered for an egg fried rice & chilli potato gravy that it was really a 'Bliss' having a good food at such a reasonable rate.

Normally, we don't give a 5 to any restaurant cause there is always a scope for improvement. But that's not the case with Bliss. Located in a garage and running successfully for the past 6-7 years, I have been a regular visitor to this place. The Chinese food they offer is mind-bogglingly delicious. It is as good as anything out there in Kolkata. I've tried most of their dishes and I've never been disappointed apart from the fact that they increase the price of their dishes alarmingly. But that didn't deter me either. I would end this review saying, "do not judge a book by it's cover". Go & try it out.

A tiny place. Unless you are really hungry or need a quick bite, it is better to take the food home and have it there.
If you are comfortable with the European style of living, may I suggest going to the nearby Triangular Park to catch a bite of the food you buy from here.
Nothing is extraordinarily good. But for the extremely low price that you have to pay here, this is probably the best choice you have in this area.
I recommend:
# Sweet n sour chicken
# Chicken steamed momo (the fried ones are much too oily here)

When you have to live on a shoe string budget as a fresh graduate,then there's nothing you enjoy more than delicious fare at awesomely reasonable prices. Located just beside azad hind dhaba round the corner of Hindustan park this is the ultimate zone of indianised Chinese food. The medium is clean healthy and mouth watering. Service is fast. The place is a tiny 12 seater so too cramped for comfort hence the take away option works best for this eatery. Recommended.

Bliss had been on my wishlist for a long period of time. So today i finally managed to visit this place to give out a treat to my senior.
Well it can be associated as a take away joint but this place also offers dine in for very small groups with 3 closely held tables.
Now  coming to our orders,we had the following items:-

1. Chicken drumstick= 8 pieces of fried chicken in light crunchy batter served with cucumber,onion & carrot pieces with sprinkled spring onions. Good in taste without too much batter was bang on & the side salad offering freshness. Should be tried

2. Sczewan mixed friedrice=  this was ordered by my senior so cannot comment on it but the way he gobbled it down gave the idea that he really liked it.

3. Chicken chilli garlic friedrice= normal chilli garlic friedrice but i found to be less spicy compared to other places in terms of hotness but still was very nicely prepared.

4. Fish mandarin= a smart choice of side dish made our main course a success. The dish was prepared in a sweet & soury sauce with diced onion,capsicum & bell peppers which gave a tangy taste making our taste buds very happy. The fish was fresh as well with no foul odour.

Overall verdict= bliss truly offers value for money meal. Our total bill came to only 550 & all the prices in the menu are tax inclusive. The pricing,the quantity & most importantly the taste really lived up to its expectations. A big thumbs up to this place

One of the popular Chinese joints located conviniently near the Gariahat-Hindustan Park-Golpark area (beside Azad Hind). If you want value for money for a decent chinese meal, this is the place to be. I have been treating this as more of a take-away joint rather than a sit-in restaurant. 
Have tried their Mixed Fried Rice / Noodles along with Chilli / Manchurian Chicken. And it was quite good!
One piece of suggestion from my side will be, to de-vein / clean the prawns properly. Apart from that, this place is quite good and is easy on the pocket. Costs thrice the less amount compared to peers like Krystal Chopsticks, Mandarin, Tangra Kaizen of the world. Ofcourse, they operate out of a plug-n-play space (Garage) and you should not look out for a cosy ambience here!

On an earlier occasion I had had a fiery hot chicken starter here, and that was awesome.

Location: Hindustan Park, beside Azad Hind Dhaba and a couple of steps from Krystal Chopsticks.
Ambience: Basic - 3 tables and 16 chairs. I don't mind the ambience as long as no one interferes into my dates with good food.
Food: I'm quite fond of their panfried momos, gravy noodles, veg fried rice, chilli chicken, garlic chicken, chicken manchurian, chicken with babycorn, chicken with mushroom. This place has never disappointed me. The food is a complete departure from what one could expect stepping in here. Generous proportions fill the heart with joy.
Price: This is the best part. Though it does not rank high among the best joints in the city, it does give quite a competition to the nearby restaurants serving Chinese cuisine owing to their quality and quantity vs price.
Staff: Wish they were as swift as an arrow. A little bit of more concern and care for the customers don't hurt. 
Would I re-visit? Time and again!

If you are hungry and love Chinese food but don't have money to try Krystal Chopstick, Bliss is the answer for you.
I love their food. It is surprising how such a small joint could make such good food. This quality has made it withstand the competition it faces from Azad Hind Dhaba and Krystal Chopstick.
I love their Chilly Garlic noodles and pan fried momos. They are truly bliss. I also love their sweet corn soup. Good quality and nice quantity. The sitting arrangement reminds us of college days, maybe this is one of their usp too.

My relationship with Bliss started almost 10 years ago after I got married and came to this area. From then till now, their food quality has not changed one bit. Infact its getting better. Two days ago we ordered mixed fried rice and chilli chicken and it really tasted so good with all ingredients intact. Being so reasonably priced till now Bliss never failed to satisfy us. Its our family restaurant and our dear Boudi is ever smiling and hospitable. She's like our family friend. God bless her and may she continue to bring smiles to more people always....

Ah ! It was first rain after a long sweltering spell in Kolkata. Though of taking some stuff for home. The restaurant Bliss fall on way back home. The place is very small. Only three tables are there. The ambience definitely does not match with the quality of food they serve. I ordered for one mixed hakka noodles, one mixed fried rice, crispy honey fish and garlic chicken. The waiting time was around 20 minutes. The food was yummy ! And the quantity could easily feed three adults. I would suggest to try the crispy fish. It has a mild sweet taste and very crisp coupled with fried onion and chilies - a very tasty starter. The rice and noodles has ample quantity of egg, chicken and shrimp. Garlic chicken was good too but it tasted little bland. Therefore those who like spicy tangy taste could avoid this. The pocket pinch for the same was around Rs.550- which is very economical considering the quality and quantity of food. A very good takeaway joint indeed.

Want a fabulous meal at an extremely affordable price? If Yes is the answer this is the place you should immediately visit for a satisfying lunch or dinner. This eatery is small with just three tables which makes the place extremely popular popular for takeaways.. you can choose from a wide variety of Chinese options.. their speciality being Crispy Prawn balls, Crispy chicken, chilly fish, pan fried fish etc. The quantity of both noodles and rice is sufficient for 2 persons.. Momos, however can be slightly better. All in all, eating out at Bliss is quite a bliss, if you are hungry and want a satisfying meal at an affordable price.

It's been a long relationship with the place.....the quality of the food still the same.....but the quantity seems to be lessened now a days
The food is light and tasty
The behavior of the attendants is one of the biggest reason why people tend to visit again and again
Though the place is small and open ......but it does not seem to play any negative impact on the food or customers
Very much pocket friendly

If you're low on money and still wanna eat delicious Chinese food, Bliss is the right place. The best low cost Chinese dine-in joint I've come across so far. The service was on the slower side maybe because there was a rush. There are just a few tables but most people prefer to take away.  The food arrived after waiting for over half an hour. Nevertheless the food was fresh and tasted good. For days when you have more time than money, try Bliss.

I'm a besotted Bliss lover since 2009. I keep going back to this place for delicious inexpensive Chinese love. I won't call it authentic Chinese but Indianized Chinese would be the right way to put it up. The sitting arrangement is very simple and there are only 3 tables, each with 4 chairs but there is always a queue waiting and people dropping by to get food for home.I've been trying the noodles, rices and side dishes but fried momo and chilly fish are my all time favourite.I had tried the crispy chilly babycorn here but I'm not satisfied. Too saucy and stiff corns!This non ac restaurant is worth trying and can be availed anytime with minimum cash to spend. Please remember that on Mondays Bliss remains closed. Try any other day. I love Bliss and hope so would you !

this is a small eating place near krystal chopsticks.. seating space is very less and nothing great about the ambience.. but as the food is place on your table, you will start salivating! its amazing to find such mouth watering food at a decent price. gravy mixed noodles and the pan fried momos are a must try. if you out with friends, looking for a place to hog.. this is the place you should be at!

Well I went there seeing the high rating in zomato. Generally you would expect the restaurant to be above average when the rating is above 4. But it wasn't so in this case. The food was very average. I went all the down to hindustan Park which is near golpark from another part of the city but it was not worth it. 
Well I ordered steam momos mixed chowmein and chili chicken. The chilli chicken was still good but the momos and chowmein were very average. 
It's not a place where you would go for a sumptuous dinner. It's a very small place and people would generally prefer takeaways. 
The food is cheap. Well if you're an low budget and want to have some Chinese food and you're around golpark this can be the place for you.

Blissfully delighted for the second time! I had visited this restaurant, once, about a year back, nothing has changed in terms of everything. Everyday during the office hours I develop a craving for a good chinese joint. And due to its proximity from my office there was no second thought about the fact that i wanted to have noodles and it would obvioualy be from Bliss. Having been here once before I was well acquainted with the amount they serve and being a 'blessed eater' ( read hog-master) i ordered for a mixed noodles and nothing on the side. As usual they served fast.....no change in quantity.....slow and steady i finished my meal. There was ample chicken and prawn chunks in it and of course without doubt the food was tasty. The behaviour of the staff was also cordial. Only downside is the ambience.....to sit and have food at the restaurant itself is a problem. It's small and very hot, it is more like you are waiting for a momo and is being slowly steamed into one. The four fans are not enough. But for take away.....double thumbs up!

Bliss, like its name, brings supreme happiness to all its customers. That's because of the friendly staff, the quality and quantity of food and also the price. Situated in the Hindustan Park, Gariahat, near the Azad Hind Dhaba, it is a tiny outlet accommodating 12 people at a time. Mostly people prefer takeaway food. Recently I went there with a friend and had ordered a Mixed Fried Rice/ Chilly Chicken Combo, and was really stunned to feel the supreme quality and quantity of this dish at such a low price. Their Momos are to die for, given it finishes out early. Only con over here is the ambiance, the reason I deducted points in my rating. ;)
A must visit restaurant for everyone. :)

Today we discovered bliss - a hidden gem in the sea of diners that is Kolkata thanks to my partner. She had been on the lookout for a place to have indianised (better kolkatanised) Chinese when she stumbled upon this place on zomato. I was a bit skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. After a hectic day in the university plus tedious coursework we went there at 7pm. The place was very easy to find, it is located adjacent to the azad hind dhaba and just opposite to Shibani. It is a small place with only three tables so we had to wait a bit. But the food was definitely worth the wait. We ordered one plate red pepper chicken, one plate fried babycorn, one plate fried momo and one plate Bliss's special Hakka chow mein. The staff were courteous in general but the person taking orders stopped in the middle and started on the orders of the adjacent table, so I had to call him back. This had made me a bit upset. The waiting time for food was minimal. But all our complaints disappeared once food started arriving. First to arrive was red pepper chicken. The dish had eight generous pieces of chicken but tasted a bit bland though my partner liked it. I personally would have liked a spicier version. Next to arrive were the panfried momos. They are the best I have had in kolkata. Six big pieces of spicy delight which vanished within a matter of seconds from the table. The momos had sufficient chicken fillings and the gravy was spicy and tangy to the point of perfection. The babycorn was crisp and tasted fantastic but we had to pack it because of the enormous amount. The chow mein came with oodles of chicken prawn and mushroom with an omelette on top. It was well above average. I didn't find it very oily like the other reviews mentioned. The bill was Rs. 510 which justifies its position in the pocket friendly category of zomato and makes its name quite apt - a blissful gastronomic experience without burning holes in the pockets. The only con I found was that they do not accept debit / credit cards. Despite that we will return soon to check out their other preparations on the menu. 
Disclaimer : I have rated this place solely on the basis of their food and nothing else. If ambience is a necessity this is not a place for you. But if you love food its the perfect one.
P.S. - I would like to share an anecdote here. While we were eating a couple arrived with their two kids- a boy and a girl. The little boy was throwing tantrums continously and he reminded me a lot about Dudley Dursley. But thank goodness his parents were nothing like Vernon and Petunia. The father mouthed the words ," Ekbar boro ho tarpor bujhbe." And the mother pulled the boy out into the streets. I sadly thought little Dudley was in for a scolding tonight.

Bliss has been a part of my life since my teenage years, from coming to grab a bite after school to get stuff from here home delivered ,its something that's ingrained with me and my friends who stayed in the vicinity of this amazing outlet. Located right beside Azad Hind,this has a seating capacity of maximum 10-12 people at one go, but what they lack in space they make up with quality & quantity of the food. A must visit for all also its an ideal place for people looking for a good quick bite and  people looking for good places to eat with a tight budget.

Their pan fried momo is a must have,the layering of their dough is a bit thick but the stuffing is real good with the spice quotient on a tad bit higher side. Even the chicken lollypops are simply delicious yum. I used to love their mixed rice and ginger chicken but over the years the quality of the later has gone down, but coming to rice or chowmein both quality and quantity has retained its shine. Another recommendation would be their honey chicken, which even though at times a bit too sweet is simply delicious ,I can actually gorge on it all day. I wouldn't suggest one trying their chopsuey as they don not really excel on it. As per pricing and service they its extremely moderate on the pockets and the latter is very prompt with both serving at the outlet and with home deliveries.  Kudos to the team for retaining its signature niche over the years and not letting us loyalists down at all.

A small takeaway place which is good for quick bites and is easy on the pocket. Very good pan-fried chicken momos. I have tasted their chicken noodles and garlic chicken. Chicken noodles was typical and nothing to write home about. However, I really did not like the garlic chicken. I was nothing like what garlic chicken should be. I would henceforth be sticking to the snacks and starters, which have not dissapointed me so far.

The seating might not be lavish, the decor might not be outlandish, but the dishes are all that and much more.

The pan fried momos are juicy and spicy
The bliss special fried rice is a must try, comes with a wrapped egg
The thai soup has more chicken in it than in any other chicken side dish of any other restaurant
The chilly chicken is yumm too

Its a perfect example of "Chota Packet Bada Dhamaka"....Just opposite Wise Oel and beside Azad hind...what makes me more affiliated to this place is though beside these two giants this small little Food Joint is not devoid of its own group of followers. Mind you...those who think good food=grandeur...this is not your place...because frankly speaking good food has nothing tio do with grand decors it has to do solely with good food. The moms here are good in size and taste and totally pocket friendly...though i have tried all their variants of momo still my personal favourite is the fluffy chicken steamed momos which caught my fancy entirely on its simplicity and honest taste, Its combination with their mythical and fiery Momo chutney is a divine concoction all together. The mixed chowmein is perfectly cooked with good maopunt of chicken egg and veggies. I just Lovvvvvveeeeee their dry chilli chicken......in totality A Good place to have good and quick food and the service rendered by "Dada" is cherry on the cake.

Went there with a small group of friends during Durga puja 2013 on panchami for lunch. We had decided to go to some place where we will not be kept waiting for hour after hour. N this cute little restro tucked away in the lanes of hindustan park seemed to be the best possible option available to us. 

We were a group of 5. Thankfuly we did not ave to wait long to get the seats. Once we were seated  we ordered Chicken momo and chilli chicken roast. Both of them turned out to be good. Then we ordered Singapore noodles, American chopsuey,Mixed fried rice,Szechwan chicken and Garlic fish. One of my friends had opted for the combos n had taken the Prawn combo. Unbeleivably all the dishes were satisfactory if not good. N OMG the quantity of american chopsuey was enough for 2 ppl. Quality of food was also high.

We had to pay a total of 575. Can you imagine!!!! Such good foof at such low price n that too at  location like Hindustan park. Really impressive.

However there is one thing i disliked about the place.the staffs are not at all helpful and ambiance is not nice as they do not have an ac. Moreover this place is a bit crammed up. Its a very small restro. We had ordered too many items n as a result could not finish them. So asked to pack the remaning. But to my utter shock they refused n said if u want the food to be packed pack it yourself. N we also had to pay for the packets they provided us for packig the remaining food. I would have given a 4 to this resto but .5 is deducted for the packing.

This place does not have a very good or comfortable enough sitting arrangement. Its basically a very small place that has been converted to a kitchen. But, yet again, this joint is one of my absolute favorite take away joints if you are looking for a place which won't harm your pocket. The quality and quantity of the chinese is very good, the chicken hakka noodles or the mixed rice are exquisite and when paired with schezwan or chilli garlic chicken, its an absolute treat for the day. Very good chinese at a very pocket-friendly rate. Highly recommended.

This is my favourite take away joint for affordable Chinese. It's basically a garage that's been converted to an eatery. Definitely not a very classy place, but you should go there only if you want to have tasty and filling food at a really low price point. 
I have a few favorites when it comes to ordering from Bliss. The chicken hakka noodles are really good, not very oily and had enough chicken and veggies. I personally like pairing it up with chilly, manchurian or hot garlic chicken. The schwezan chichen is another option if you like your side dish hot and spicy. The shredded chicken with baby corn and mushroom is a good option when I want to have a mild side. The chicken abd mixed rice are equally good. The quantities for the main preparations are huge and two portions of rice or noodles can suffice for three adults. 
They make good momos as well. Infact, I feel their pan fried momo is one of the best in town, if not the best.

Bliss is located in Hindustan Park, just beside Azad Hind. If you haven't tried this place, please do. It is more of a small stall, than a proper restaurant, with a seating capacity for maximum 10-12 people. I mostly prefer the take away options. It is however, inexpensive and worth the price. The service is fast and prompt. The food is tasty, although nothing fancy. The joint is mostly popular for take away. If you ever visit, try their friend as well as steamed momo, which is quite decent for its price. Quantity of food is sumptuous. I have tried their gravy as well as haka noodles, and both were quite nicely done. The common chicken preparations like Chilly Chicken, Manchurian Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken taste quite good. If you are adventurous about fish, you can even try out some of their fish preparations like Galric Fish and Mandarin fish. At this price, you just cant ask for more, as Bliss delivers it just right. 

Cheers Bliss. It is a Bliss for foodies in Kolkata, like me.

One of my bestie's introduced me to this place. Honestly I don't mind the lack of space and having to wait a bit, the delicious food makes up for everything. I have been visiting this place with my bestie for the last 4 years, and not once were the staff rude to us. The service is prompt, and the orders are dully noted and the specification met with perfectly. The food is just brilliant. The noodles and the mixed fried rice are very good but the show-stealer is the 'pan fried momos', they are probably the best in town. The quantities are huge and the prices are pocket friendly! An absolute delight.

mainly a take away joint, but people like us who look for pocket friendly eating out places often come here. a very small arrangement, no decor, but the food is amazing. though we were late & momos were over, the meal we had was quite satisfying in terms of taste & quantity. we were so hungry no photos were taken. that heavenly smell of Mixed fried rice, the tongue cleaner red pepper chicken & the Shredded chicken with mushroom and baby corn was awesome. we were full. such a lovely Chinese food you can only get in Kolkata. for two of us it was a nice dinner experience. Thanks to ZOMATO and all the reviewers for mentioning it. LONG LIVE BLISS !!!! 
would look forward finding out more joints likes this.

The name of this place could not possibly have been more apt.Yes.This is pure bliss.Great quality and great quantity Chinese food at wonderful prices.
Located in Hindustan Park near the Azad Hind Dhaba this is a very small restaurant which is quite popular among the locals and one can understand why.The place has only about 3tables which can accommodate around 12 people.There is no air conditioning and nothing much in the way of ambience.
But the food is the biggest attraction of this place.The Momos are wonderful with a soft coating and a generous filling.The pan fried momos are must haves.They are sometimes a little too hot and spicy.But they do generally customise their preparations if they are notified before hand.The Chicken Drumsticks are wonderful and succulent and tasty.The size of the Drumsticks are appreciable.The fried rice and the chowmeins are also tasty and their amount is impressive and filling.
The service is swift.The staff are friendly and helpful.The prices are very reasonable.
Overall a truly blissful place for a happy pocket friendly meal.. :)

For me this place is surely a bliss. I have been visiting this place since childhood and it has become a household name for us. Whenever we plan to have a Chinese dinner at home, bliss is the name that comes to our mind. Even now I visit this place quite often particularly when I m terribly hungry and my wallet seems lonely ;)... The snacks specially the pan fried chicken is too good. I have them every single time I visit bliss. Besides, their noodles, rice n chicken side dishes are so tasty that you will definitely come back for more. Bliss is very special to me and I can't even remember the exact number of evenings I have spent over here :)

If you are a regular and know the places around Gariahat and Hindusthan Park well then Bliss is not a place you will take time to locate. This restro is located just beside the Azad Hind Dhaba branch of Gariahat/Hindusthan Park. I went with my friends after reading Zomato reviews. The orders we gave are as follows-

Chicken Pan fried Momo-  Too spicy and too tasty.

Chicken Fried Rice- Was a little less salty, and was not so good in taste.

Red pepper chicken - Was so-so didn't like the taste. 

So overall for good service and so-so food I give 3.5 overall to my experience in Bliss.

I give this a 4.0 because it is great in its price range. The food is good, esp the chilli chicken and hakka noodles, albeit quite oily. Non AC and small restaurant where usually lovers go. But good fun on a small budget. I quite enjoy their momos as well. I was introduced to the place by a friend and I have visited Bliss twice or thrice after that. I remeber trying out quite a few of their items and I was quite happy with most of them. Again, I remind you to note that I am sharing my experience with restaurants of this price range as the base line.

**Location = Just beside Azad Hind Dhaba at Hindustan Park

**Brief = A foodie friend of mine introduced me to BLISS :) I am thankful to him for this info :P
I was simply hungry and wanted to have huge amount of food at a low price :P LOL
Searched zomato and found that its at Hindustan Park and I straight away hunted down with my crime partner TB :D

**Ambience = Its not Air conditioned. It has only 3 tables to sit. Can accomodate only 12 people at a time :( These are the reasons for which I deducted .5 points :) We got ourselves seated and were instantly attended cordially. The server was a swift man who served us chilled water quickly and we felt relieved in that heat.

**Things ordered = Mixed Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken combo for myself and she ordered Chicken Chow with Chilly Chicken combo , along with Cokes for each of us.
The food arrived within 3-4 minutes. And I was awestruck with the quantity. My friend really suggested that they serve hugeee and indeed it was hugee. All the ambiance cons were submerged by such filling amount.
The taste was very nice as well. The rice had good amount of chicken,egg and prawn, also the noodles(chow) was filled with chicken pieces. The chilly chicken was decent I would say. The gravy was not that great :)

** Recommended = The combos. Also if you order separate then also great deal.

**Purse Check = Total bill Rs.356/- Marvellously cheap and huge quantity.

**Overall = If you are like me and sometimes feel like having huge quantity in cheap prices then Bliss is the solution.

Cheers Bliss :P

If there is one word that defines Bliss - it is surely 'pocket-friendly'. But that does not in any way lowers either the quantity or quality of the place! Basically it is Chinese for the masses at its best! You will be over-whelmed with the amount of the gravy noodles, or the size of their lolly-pop chicken. These days they have raised the prices slightly, but everything else is same. I will never compare this place with the restaurants at a higher price range, serving more authentic Chinese dishes because it will be unfair. Even then they have a really long list on the menu card to order from! Personally go for their Gravy Noodles and crispy honey fish combination, try their really light shredded chicken and mushroom in white sauce (my all time favorite, perfect even when you are down with flu) , pan-fried chicken and many more apart from the everyday winners! One of those places that still serve chicken bits in the chicken stock served with your momo! I am an absolute regular to this place and and can vouch for their quality!!

The last day of exams came with a lot of hankering for some Chinese food. Bliss, being affordable with a decent rating, was chosen as the venue for lunch. The place is tiny, with 3 tables being just about enough to occupy 12 people at once and a small kitchen at the back. 
Our order comprised of Bliss Special Chowmein, Red Pepper Chicken and a cold drink. Within 15 minutes, the food was placed before us already divided into two heaped up plates. The noodles came with oodles of chicken, egg, mushroom, prawn and a poached egg on top. It was a bit oily but mouth-watering nonetheless. The red pepper chicken that had 8 pieces of boneless chicken, nicely coated with a spicy mix of garlic, pepper and spring onions was delicious as well. We washed down the greasy feeling with the fizzy beverage.
This is a great place for a meal if one is not too fussy over the environment, temperature and the extra oil. 
P.S: The meifoon served over here looks DROOLWORTHY!

I don"t remember exactly for how many years I have been to this small cute food corner, but surely its been more than 15 years. Two things brought be back every time, first was the price,secondly the quality of food. 

Try their chicken Momo ( fried especially), you will instantly fall in love. The Chinese food is equally well prepared and with the price and quantity, it really makes it unique and value for money restaurant in South kolkata.

It does offer very limited space for dinning, so take away is the best option.

A small restaurant...I guess it was a garage and converted into a restaurant many many years ago. It's located on Hindustan Road near Gariahat...next to the Azad Hind Dhaba. It can accommodate 12 people and I recommend that you dine in even though the place is not air conditioned. 

Coming to the food...it swears by its name...BLISS.... indeed. A must eat item here is the Mixed Gravy Chowmein or the Chicken Gravy Chowmein for those who do not like prawns etc. The dry chilli chicken is a good accompaniment. For starters the crispy chicken (sprinkle it with some lime) and spring rolls are a must. They make awesome momos too...the pan fried momo is excellent but their chicken fried or steamed momos are right on the money.

A meal for two would you set you back by about 500 these days but you shall be stuffed. Quantity is good and the staff are extremely polite. If you stay nearby you can ask for home delivery.  I have been eating at this place for years now and I swear that the quality of food is still the same.

I grew up in Hindustan Park and I can't even date back to when I started having the Chinese food from Bliss! I continued to be a loyal customer even years later when I shifted home! They can customize according to your needs (I've had demands like no MSG, less spicy etc etc) and the food is great at reasonable price. Madam at the counter is very customer friendly and adds her personal touch at customer handling!

This is a Chinese eatery (more of a takeaway joint rather than a sit-down restaurant) that screams ‘value for money’. The food is quite good, though there isn’t too much variety. The size of portions is also a plus point. Moreover, it charges you only for the items you have ordered…no hidden costs :))

We keep on ordering home delivery from this place especially if we have a group of friends. Quantity for the price is amazing. The quality of the fish & prawns are excellent here. Try the Thai soup it has a genorous portion of fish and chicken and yummy thats a must have! Rice noodles are good but it mostly runs out. Tampura chicken; Garlic chicken , chilli chicken are good. Momos are with thick flour and I personally do not fancy that. I would rate this as a best value for quality restaurant.

Its blissful to have food at Bliss... The food is really good, the quantity is also good. The only problem is with the limited space in the restaurant. Dont be surprised if you are in the middle of a romantic dinner with your partner and into a very intense conversation, and suddenly the waiter comes and asks you to share your table with his new customers. Does have an effect on your mood and eventually on the food you have.
Great for take aways.
Cost for 2 in my case- 500 (no alcohol).

Tryout chilly chicken and gravy chow. If u have a cut in budget and dont bother to have homestyle Chinese then this is ur stop.

I have been a ballygunge boy. And for a foodie, who has probably tried all the places in and around south kolkata atleast if not all over kolkata. This is a place you ought to visit if: you are hungry; you are up for a snack; just want to have a laid back evening; if you are not in a mood to spend a lot of money and most importantly if you want some good good food. Just down the road you will have Krystal Chopstik, on the end of the other road you have grub club, just next to it you have the new azad hind dhaba, but believe me they dont serve food as good as folks at Bliss do. 
Yes they are not the best when it comes to presentations, fancy tables and chairs, air conditioned eating places... but who cares? They have pan fried momos to die for. Literally to die for!!!
I eat a lot! a lot!! one plate of bliss special gravy chow serves all my hunger, and my girlfriends' three times over :P
I am not a big fan of the chopsuey they serve though. The non veg snacks are awesome. I always try a new snack/starter every time and am amazed everytime.
I do not know why it has less than 5 stars. Keeping the gimmicks of a fancy eatery aside, bliss is spot on for good Chinese food any day every day!

Never mind because you now have bliss right beside azad hind dhaba hindustan park. Small space, not air conditioned but serves the dishes which are awesome. Drums of Heaven, American Chopsuey, Mixed Chowmein, Pan Fried Momos, Chinese and many others are there on menu. Lip smacking dishes compel me to go there again and again.

When you're in a foul or low on cash or both, nothing works better than some good old Indianised Chinese. And Bliss knows that and works it to its advantage. The food is effective and very very yummy, though a tad oily. You could always tell them to make it less spicy and/or oily as per your taste. The chilli fish and Manchurian prawn are superb. Give it a try.

Bliss - A place where you really get Bliss!! 
====================================
Intro:

On recommendation of one of the Top Connoisseur R, I went on to try this place Bliss. First of all, i had been having a lot of problems locating where is Hindustan park. However, as i was roaming around near Mrs. Magpie, I discovered bliss. It is a small eatery though a very clean one just beside Azad Hind Dhaba, Golpark. This place could give me a Nostalgic feeling of Better version of 'Tutu's Hut'. However, i visited this place twice today: Once in afternoon and once at around 9 pm. This place is a small place but have good chinese stuffs to serve. 
====================================
Ordered:

Chicken Momo(Twice) - The six pieces of Momo were served with the Momo chilli sauce. It was good enough. They even served me with chicken clear soup first time for free but next time, they didn't. The soup was also good with little boneless pieces of chicken inside. First place to see which did not do 'Kanjusi' of chicken in soup. 

Chicken Lollypop - The chicken lollypop i had thought that they would provide me with usual chicken bone lollypop. However, they provided me with somewhat boneless chicken strippers or you can say looked same like Chicken Crispers of Chillis. They were served to me with large Onion and Cucumber pieces. It was well good but oily. 
====================================
Summary:

Food presentation 3.5/5
Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4/5
Taste 4.5/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
Value for money 4/5
Ambience 3.5/5
====================================
What i noticed:- 
1) Neat place. 
2) Three to Four tables to accommodate. 
3) Prompt service. 
4) Affordable and Reasonably priced. 
5) Hygiene - Well...Okay. 
6) The flour of the momo could have been much more thinner.
7) The menu was designed like a fast food menu. Well, could work here. :) 
====================================
Meal for two - 300 Bucks Max.
====================================
Conclusion: 

A good place to visit with friends. However, Takeaway is preferred. Attached the momo pic below. surely have a look. A small neat place having reasonable prices where good food being served in 10 mins = Bliss.

Well the first place i feel like reviewing on zomato would definitely be bliss!! Situated jn a lane(just opposite to spencers rashbehari) this chinese eatery looks like it has been transformed to a eating hub from a garage. Nevertheless, the place is usually jampacked most of the times as once u come and savour their chinese delicacies you would want to visit here again and again!!!

Now coming to the point: the food.. Well it can give any restaurant stiff competition in terms of food quality. I have been there innumerable number of times so its really tough to choose which dish stands out!! Don't miss the fried chicken, red pepper chicken for starters....they give 8 pieces and they come for 110 each( though the price hike is pretty frequent) so its definitely worth the price! For main course the rice...noodles( i prefer the gravy one) are superb and come in large quantity with generous portions of chicken, egg and prawn. For the side dish i love sweet and sour chicken, chicken in hot garlic sauce. Plus the soups are wow!! A meal for two comes at around 300 for a starter, a rice/noodle and a side dish.

Give it atleast one visit! Bliss is: blissful :-D

My friends and I were looking for a Chinese corner to saturate our teeth in ‘Chini’ flavors but also in pocket friendly budget. So we landed ourselves at the doorsteps of ‘Bliss’. 

It’s very small place for sitting arrangements. They only have three tables which allow more or less 20 people to dine jointly. The ambiance does not reflect Chinese dining; it is only food which pleases my savor teeth. On my first visit I had tasted their Hong Kong rice and Singapore chicken. They both are flavorful, not very pleasing but nice. And I am kind of gone there few times now. In their snacks platter I have tried momos (both streamed and fried). The dumplings and the ‘Chatni’ is very savory but the soup they serve with stream ones are not that pleasing, they serve a clear soup with no chicken or veggies in it, is very drab. Recently I took an attempt on their noodles, and I found Hot garlic noodles very much pleasing on my taste buds.  I have not tried their whole bunch in noodles. But I recommend this one to have a go. 

Usually there is one man who serves and takes your order, but he is very pleasing and helpful too. But sometimes they take a lot of time for serving, I suffered the situation more than couple of times, and sometimes they were not hot too. But apart from the fact it is good to go I say.

Not really a fan of Chinese food but this is the only place from where i like to have chinese from. one plate is enough for 2 people. infact it will be quite filling for two people and its extremely pocket friendly. Very frequent visit of this small place, and i have tried almost everything on the menu...all i have to say for BLISS is- Yummy!!!!!!!!!!

It was a "Bliss"ful experience we had at Bliss yesterday. I believe "Lady Luck" was smiling at us and showering her blessings on us as we had unexpectedly found a vacant table. We couldn't hide our glee when we realized that we would not have to wait for a table.

Our order consisted of 2 plates of Steamed Chicken Momo, 1 Chicken Drums of Heaven, 1 Chicken Asparagus Soup, 1 Chicken Manchow Soup, 1 Mixed Fried Rice and 1 Chilli Chicken.

The Momo's were delicious and pretty big in size and the best part is they fill it up with Chicken and not Cabbage and Onion as is done by so many other restaurants. The accompanying sauce was also deliciously tasty.

The most interesting thing about the Chicken Drums of Heaven was that we got a plate of boneless chicken strips deep fried. We were a bit confused in the beginning thinking we've been given someone else's order, but then realized that was not the case; and definitely we were not complaining as it tasted Wonderful!

The Soups had just the right quantity of seasoning and were delicious.

Finally came the Mixed Fried Rice - everything was almost perfect except that I like my prawns in the rice to be a bit more crisply fried. That's just how I personally prefer the prawn; it doesn't mean that the prawn was raw or under-cooked.

Overall, a very satisfying (read, exceeding expectations) experience.

As the name suggests the food will make you react the same way. i have been eating here for more than 10 years and the food has never changed on any day or time. the quality is very good and being a small place i was concerned about the kitchen which turned out to be extremely clean. 

the soups they give are just too good and we have it on a frequent pace. i have taken 0.5 down cause there is no AC which makes it very tough to sit there.

I order from there every time whenever i went to my aunt's place where my aunt orders chicken pakora for the snacks which tastes quite good. In fact most of the food on its menu is very difficult to find in any Chinese restaurants and from the look of the place you would not believe that they can serve so good variety and quality food.Their restaurant is very small with 4 or 5 tables which is a shame as it is always overcrowded .The service time of the restaurant is fairly good and their quantity of the food is too much that you would not believe it has such low price . I thought that lemon chicken,chicken with baby corn and many more should be tried more often. My only suggestion would be to increase their dining area.

Food of this small little restaurant is absolutely divine, truly blissful, though it is mainly a take away joint having only three tables which remain full almost every time so take away or home delivery is the better option.. this restaurant can easily beat any leading chinese restaurants  in kolkata in terms of quality and quantity of food they serve in such a low price, price range is surprisingly low for a restaurant in such posh area, their chicken fish prawn items contain 8 large succulent juicy pieces of meat or fish and cost of one such plate is only 120, they dont take VAT so have to pay only what is written on menu card. its not that to reduce the cost they serve stale or small quantity of food, all the items they serve are fresh and come in huge proportions so one plate can be shared by 2-3 people easily that makes it even more cost effective.. now come to my food experience,i ordered over phone and pick up the food after one hour,though they have said that they will take just 15 mins to prepare, i ordered mixed fried rice-huge in quantity, full of chicken and prawns, crispy chilly chicken- though it was not much crispy, didnot like it much, pan fried fish-this item was great, big chunks of fish, really tasty and no fishy smell, garlic prawns-big juicy prawns in garlic gravy, really good. Had a great food experience, its certainly not a place to go in groups for dine in but its the place where from scrumptious and heavenly food can be bought and enjoyed with family or friends at home..

One of the tastiest Chinese restaurant located in the Hindustan Park area. I have had my evening snacks from this place quite a few times whenever I come to Hindustan Park for some work or to visit my relatives. I even take away food for myself as they do not provide home delivery to my area.

Leaving the looks of the restaurant aside, the food is a real yum. The menu consists of large number of food items including fish, prawns and of course chicken items. Starters are very good and to name some of my favorites are Chicken Pakoda, Fried Chicken Boneless and Crispy Chilly Chicken. In the main course you will find a lot of hi-fi dishes which you wouldn't have from the restaurant at the first look. For main course, Lemon Chicken, Sliced Chicken with Babycorn and Shredded Chicken with Babycorn and Mushroom should be given a try. The quantity versus price again has a equal balance and will not pinch the pockets.

The looks of the restaurant is pretty bad to be frank, it has only few tables and is always overcrowded. No fancy decorations have been done whatsoever. The service time of the restaurant is good enough.

Well the name is pretty much conclusive of what is served. Surving beside a well established Azad Hind is a feat all in itself proving what it has to constantly deliver. 
The food is pretty good! You get great chicken fries and lollypop! It's crisp and tastes excellent. The chow-mien section is pretty good, tasted quiet a few of them and they are pretty good to taste! The chicken dishes are pretty good too. Would recommend the honey chicken if you have a sweet tooth, szechwan chicken and Mushroom chicken. Recently tasted their american chopsuey. The quantity is pretty over whelming, With very little money, you can go home mighty full. Dining in might be too much of a hassle because of space constraints and the roadside nature to the place, If possible,pack it and enjoy this in front of a television set! Overall recommended! 

Cheers!

Stowed in what probably is the garage of a house, is the kitchen of delightful and affordable Chinese. Bliss is a small place with the smell of chillies wafting through the open kitchen door into the sitting area. Fortunately, every time I have been here, my friends and I have managed to get seats.

Of the usual Chinese fare, the Starters and Chicken Side Dishes are neither terrific nor terrible but what does stand out is the Pan Fried Momo (Chicken). Costing Rs. 80 a plate, consisting of six large pieces, doused in a spicy, hot gravy (I like its consistency - not too thin nor too thick), Pan Fried Momos are awfully scrumptious. The quantity of Chow that they serve will bowl you over. Two hungry people can comfortably snack on one plate of Chow.

The last time that I was here, my hungry friend and I ordered Pan Fried Momo (Chicken), Schezwan Hakka Chow (Chicken) and Fried Sliced Chicken with Baby Corn (Dry). Service was prompt. Chicken with Baby Corn was oily, ordinary and disappointing. But the Chow did not go easy on the amount of chicken or egg or tasty noodles and the Momos were simply sumptuous. Adding up to Rs. 310, we paid and left with very full stomachs and a certain 'bliss'.

'BLISSFUL' FOOD AT AFFORDABLE PRICES!

Among the many Chinese restaurants located near Hindustan Park, Bliss ranks high on the popularity chart. It doles out authentic and tasty Chinese delicacies. The food is not only tasty but very hot and spicy as well. Since their Chinese fare is moderately priced it is very good for students with a low budget. There is nothing extraordinary with regards to the ambience and decor of the place.

They serve some of the best Chinese starters especially their chicken items like Chicken Momos (both steamed and fried), Red Pepper Chicken, Chilli Chicken, and Chicken Drumstick and so on. Their starters can be followed by their equally well made soup dishes like Chicken Coriander Soup, Chicken Hot and Sour Soup and Chicken Mushroom Soup. Mixed Fried Rice and Mixed Hakka Noodles are also brilliant in terms of quantity and flavor. Their Momos are so scrumptious and of adequate sizes that you immediately feel full having just them. For this reason most of the time, their Momos are sold out well before dinner. Their vegetarian items can be considered as any foodie's delights. They have on offer items like Hot Garlic Mushroom, Chilli Paneer, Paneer pakora and many more. Besides the usual Chilli Baby corn, they also make very tasty Red Pepper Baby corn and Hot Garlic Baby corn. Some of the fish items I like are Chilli Fish, Red Pepper Fish and Hot Garlic Fish. Their prawn dishes (be it Red Pepper Prawn or Hot Garlic Prawn or Sichuan Prawn) are also worth devouring too. 

They, however, do not offer any kind of pork or lamb dishes. the service is prompt and efficient. The staff is always helpful and courteous. Bliss is unarguably one of the best Chinese restaurants in the south Kolkata area. A must visit place for inexpensive, simple but delicious Chinese fare.

Though this is basically a restaurant set up within a garage the food is excellent. Its clean and hygienic and perfect for college going people or even for office workers looking for lunch. The quantities are enough to share between 2 people and you come back satisfied with the food and experience.

We stay nearby and get takeaway snack items occasionally. Kitchen is certainly clean by Kolkata standards. We tried Chicken Momos steamed, Hot Garlic Mushrooms, Red pepper Fish, Chillie chicken, Chillie fish etc. Those who like spicy food will like the food - Tasty Spicy and Hot. Staff are courteous and helpful. After 7.30 pm there is heavy rush and they are not able to cope with the demand for home delivery. Takeaway is the option after 7.30 pm. On the whole extremely satisfying.

Chinese eateries are springing up everywhere in Kolkata! However only a handfull offer good chinese food! High prices seem to bother some as well! Bliss is the place for you, if you have got barely 100 bucks in your pocket and you are craving some chinese! They don't offer pork or lamb. Nor is it air conditioned! But their Pan fried momos are to die for! And if you are in for a meal then they hav got starters to soup to main courses! Especially good for students with low pocket money and hungry stomachs! Its a neat place to end up for a cheap,simple yet delicious chinese lunch.
