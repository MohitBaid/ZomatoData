This is a street food joint located at a few meters away from Sapuipara more( in the direction of kalikapir).

I had egg chicken and chicken rolls from here. The rolls were okay I would say. I've certainly had better rolls than this.

Big Boss Restora is opened at Sapui Para Crossing & it's a road side take away joint .... I noticed that it always remain crowded around 6:00 to 6:30PM.... One day I tried Chicken roll.... Also they prepare Chowmin, Chilli Chicken etc.... Quality & Quantity was good but very unhygienic place.... Servings time was good.... Cost of food was inexpensive....

Nothing to say about the deco and staffs..... its a road side joint near Sapuipara crossing at Prince Anwar Shah connector.... serves street food like rolls, chowmin, chilli chicken, biriyanis etc... a huge crowd accumulates everyday... quality and quantity was pretty good.... no a hygienic place need to eat food by seating on chairs and tables put on footpath.... better to take away.... service was fast... pocket pinch was friendly....
