You can smell the freshly baked cookies on the entire floor and that is what will take your step towards this place. They let you taste the difference variety of cookies they have and then you can make your pick.

The staff is courteous and helps you to thr best. All of thr chocolate base cookies are worth buying. The rates are on a higher side but the taste is worth it.

The smell of cookies being baked is enough to attract you here for a hot fresh cookie experience.I have had several cookies from this place starting from the chocolate covered ones to the coconut macaroons, sesame,chocochips and jeera ones.Yes,they are costly but you get fresh homemade like cookies and not the packet stuff.My favourite is the hot chewy coconut macaroon with vanilla ice cream.

The muffins were way too sweet for my tastebuds to handle. The sweetness almost got me stoned. ü§§ 
The muffin was certainly not meant for me, however I would like to try their cookies üç™ sometime soon.
