This rating is not just for the food, but also for the people who work in it, their spirit, their hard work what they put into their creation. Believe me. If you're frustrated and looking for a roadside fast food centre where people don't miss behave and treat you like you a valued customer to them, you should stop by this shop. No matter how busy they are or how short resources they have, they'll never let you down. What I'm telling you is by experience only. 
Go and give it a shot.. All the best..! üëç

A tiny takeaway eatery that you can reach only after taking a walk along a beautiful lane inside Kasba, Green Salad's advertisements around Kasba had given me high hopes, but it turned out to be a regular roadside food place. The staff is well-behaved, but the service is very slow. I had placed an order and specified the time when I would pick it up (about 1.5 hrs later), and when I went to get the food, it was not ready; I waited for another half an hour for a plate of Momos. The food was all right, and the quality and quantity were fine. A little too much work for anyone who doesn't live along this road to go find it, but if you're a local, it's a fast and quick way to grab a bite on days when you don't want to cook.

I have been eating from this outlet since 2 years. Back then, I had a huge admiration towards this shop but then I joined Zomato and got addicted to writing reviews and trying out new restaurants and discovered that there is better waiting to be tasted.

Very well behaved attendants and cooks. No proper seating available as during the rainy season the seats will remain wet. The shop isn't so clean inside. This is a small shop in a locality and the prices are high indeed for its location. You won't find much of a crowd in this outlet.

Foods:
Chicken Fried Rice(5.5/10): Tastes JUST FAIR. Average in Quantity and quality. Price at Rs 110(not Value for money in terms of taste)

Chilli chicken (gravy): (5.5/10) 10 pcs but they are very small. So small that the get packed in a small tin foil pack. Its the size of "Dal Bora". Taste wise its Fair Again. Its sufficient for 2 people. 3 at most with adjustments. Not VFM.

Egg Chicken Rolls(Rs 45):(6.5/10) Its Filling and tastes AVERAGELY GOOD. Size is decent.

Egg roll(Rs.20): Tastes Good and its filling too. The price is reasonable in this case. Quality and quantity wise its good for a low budget quick filling meal. (7.5/10)

Biriyani: They cook biriyani and equivalent sides during Durga Pujas only. So, this is an old review. The price is generally Rs. 120+ . Its again, not the biriyani you expect as you dream of or seen before.

Kebabs(7/10): I am not much of a kebab lover. Chicken kebab is priced at Rs 80. It was good in taste, proper in Quantity. As I haven't tried kebabs un other restaurants except buffets, I cannot review much.

That's all with the review.DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.KEEP EATING, FOR WE FOODIES LIVE FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. GREETINGS...,
