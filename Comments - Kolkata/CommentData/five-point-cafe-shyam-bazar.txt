I online ordered burger and French fries. First the order was delivered about than 2 hours late and the food is equally disappointing. The chicken burger  had no chicken in it only buns and the French fries were also over cooked. Very disappointed with the food quality and service and the packaging of food was also very bad , food was cold too.

I’m so disappointed with the food. I’d ordered a mix sauce pasta. And it clearly said it consists of chicken and prawn and had a red dot attached to it. But I received a veg mix sauce pasta. This is no joke. Clearly wasted my money here !

We went there at a sunday afternoon. Honestly the place was not at all decent looking from outside, it's mostly like other street food stalls at shyambazar area. But when you step in.. It will welcome you with its nicely decorated, small but cozy and homely ambience. But it was quite unfortunate that they failed to maintain the grace in their limited food stock and also the taste of music. Because anyone but honey singh cannot please your ear at a pleasant sunday afternoon. They handed us the menu card which offers very limited choice. However, we had to order something out of this only. But a moment after the waiter informed that they didn't have the specific dish in collection and asked us to order something else. After that almost whatever we ordered it was not available. So we ordered whatever they can serve at that moment. Though I have to mention that the food was delicious and the amount served was also sufficient for two.
So overall the place is nice.
It's a little suggestion for the management to play some good music according the mood of the anbience and the customer ofcourse (other than honey Singh and other catchy item songs). And last but not the least.. Kindly have a good stock of food items atleast on the weekend.

The cafe doesn't know how to make a club sandwich. I ordered one and got three slices of bread doused in mayonnaise with minimal chicken pieces in one fold and chopped raw onion and capsicum on the other. But no egg or cheese that are a common feature in a club sandwich. And got a heavy stomach after eating.

Well, yesterday we have visited five point cafe opposite to bata. Small place but quiet place to relax and gossip with friends. Hookah is also available. But we ordered Dry Chili chicken and Manchow Soup-chicken.
Manchow soup- Taste was average here otherwise in general it's too good who loves spicy soups. And low in quantity for two
Dry Chili chicken - Taste was superb. Hot n spicy. It snatched my mind. 8pcs were there. I was hoping for order more but didn't. Well cooked.
I hope to visit here again because of it's quiet ambience where no place for packed up condition. Small cafe with nice ambitience

Been here with frnds for hookah.
Hookahs were made quite good.
The hookahs was moderately priced.
This outlet even serves appetizers along with hookahs and drinks.
Even  they have a nice collection of moctails and shakes.
The ambience was not so good and sitting area was also quite small.

Went there on nobomi afternoon. 
It was almost empty. 
We ordered 2mixed fried rice (they did not serve prawn in the rice), garlic chicken and chilli chicken. 
The dishes had 8pieces..
Chilli chicken was good in taste but garlic chicken was not that good and it lacked taste and flavour. 
We also had a hookah which was customised by them. It was pure love. 
They do not provide water and even that had to be bought. 
Pocket pinch for 3-
1000+
A good and cheap place for hookah lover.

Located opposite to shyambazar bata , this place is lil bit hard to find. Place is congested a bit and ambience is more or less good. Ordered coffee , veg noodles and crispy chilli babycorn. Only the babycorn was made decent . Noodles were flat on taste and there was smoky smell in it. Service is not that good .
On the other hand they also provide sisha / hookah in different flavours .,

Horrible experience!! 
Honestly speaking, first we (me and my boyfrnd) went to watch Jab Harry Met Sejal, all through the movie i felt tortured by a baseless script. As a srk fan, i felt ashamed of his choice. Next we were hungry, so thought to give this a try. This cafe is just opposite tp bata, but you would need a binocular to search. The location given was wrong on zomato map. Now about the cafe, it's beautiful, decor, ambience, romantic music.. But food was 😑😖, very upsetting. We ordered egg chicken fried rice and garlic chicken. Quantity was more than enough. Garlic chicken was bland tasteless. Fried rice was a bit okay. Overall, this is good for hookah people, but food a big NO. 😞

Located just opposite bagbazar bata its a blink & u miss sized outlet which is a cafe only in name. Id recommend this to people who are only interested in visiting 4 d sake of d hookah...in d food department they are seriously lacking....we ordered veg pasta sandwiches & chilli chiken dry out of which pasta was too bland & too dry & even difficult to finish...d sandwiches were plain with d stuffing consisting of only boiled potatoes & d chips accompanying it was stale, d Chikn even though mentioning as dry came with a pretty mediocre gravy all in all d food was lacking both 8n quantity & quantity. D section above cud b accessed through a flight of pretty steep stairs...d ambience was mediocre with loud music in d background..d manager was busy watching d television & was rude to say d least ,d staff was clueless even about billing processes & tax...d taxing is completely arbitary with no proper rates etc ..there was no ambience & due to limited space d whole room was full of smoke. Not worth revisiting.

I gave 1.5, and even that is too much for the cafe. We were tired and hungry and so we visited this place right after college and it was utter waste of time and money. We tried simple Egg Chicken Chow, Crispy Chicken and Caramel Custard and nothing was upto the mark. The food quality and quantity is not worth the money they charge. Highly disappointed.

I've tasted lot of many cafe before. But two things matter lot to me. The hygine and the staff. And both are more than wow. The staffs are very helpful even if required to deal with any issue out side the outlet. Very cooperative. These Chinese flavour are the perfect mix.and sheesha are perfectly balanced as per my taste. The meals are mouthwatering . Missing out on the pics. But would add on soon. Worth the pricing, quantity, quality and the location where the situation demands and highly recommended in North Kolkata

Didn't actually visit the place but ordered in . Have heard good reviews about this place and wanted to check it out. But for paucity of time couldn't physically be present there. 

Was in a rush so ordered the Mixed Chowmien . I am not able to comment on the decor and ambience of the place or the service . 
But the dish was good. It tasted really great and was filling. I mean the quantity was really good. So was the taste. The rating is based only on the food.

Located just opposite baghbazar Bata, this is a newly opened cafe. Its good to see cafes are coming up in north Kolkata too! 😊 Nicely decorated cafe, food is good. According to the food the prices are alright! We ordered Pepper Chicken and Chicken Lollipop. Both the dishes were good though nothing great. They have a wide menu, they serve quite a variety if dishes. The music was too loud though. They have a hookah section too!

located bang on opposite to bata @ shyambazar, this place is a heaven for hookah lovers along with awesome food & lovely ambience. its not *just a hookah joint* but a total cafe serving you the best food possible. talking about the interiors, which is an absolute stunner with cool graphics to the grooving music playing for your mood change, everything is upto the mark.. 10 on 10. the staff is extremely courteous & everything is rightly priced with not much of your pocket pinch. 1 doesnt need to think twice before entering this place because of its lovely ambience which is suitable for every age, whether you are with your officials-OR student group-or friends OR even family, that's a sure shot thing, u all are gonna enjoy your precious time here. I had a gala time personally. homely feel, quite comfortable & affordable. for me, its a must visit place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
