The food is amazing, tasty and healthy. The staff is very well behaved, and the ambience is top notch. No flaws at all, just needs more publicity.

Eat Good Food is a bit difficult to locate for the uninitiated, we didn't know the place before hand, so hovered around the area for 5-6 minutes, but in reality its tucked inside the lane opposite to the Quest Mall.
The ambience has a lukewarmness about itself and going by the prices, the food turned out to be much better than expected. We went for chicken ballentine and their sugar free choco mousse.

I loved the menu in all its healthful variety and ambience when we visited during the Christmas weekend. The food just about lived up to this initial satisfaction. I enjoyed the gazpacho, wholewheat garlic bread (dish of the day), burrito (not sure if it was microwaved but stuffing was too hot & spicy) and choco mousse (as far as desserts go, this wouldn't be my first pick). What was not fun was the service. A couple of dishes weren't available (crusted aubergine for one). The staff was in such a rush to send us packing. Last orders, service and bill were rushed, lights were turned off, water wasn't served, etc. Sadly, those are likely to be my memories.

Warm ambiance, quick service and good food. The wheat pizza was average. The espresso shots and capuccino were good. We Chocolate orange pot was quite a thing. We had date cakes, raspberry eclairs, brownie and others. It was a good time spent. I would like to come back try the menu.

Really great! Great decor plus great food. Refreshing menu. Courteous staff. All plus plus.
There arw different rooms - each with it's own charm - there's even one which you can have all to yourself if you've got a group.
Loved the green, cozy vibes!

One of my favourite healthy cafe.
This place never disappoints to serve the healthiest food in a creative way.
The immune booster was a light yet tasty drink 
For the main course ordered Roasted pepper feta stuffed chicken , the chicken was quite tender and was marinated well.
Though it‚Äôs a lil overpriced for the quantity they serve.
Overall a good experience.

I think one of the best foods with ultimate gyan on the health index of it ...
Every food item in the menu is accompanied by its calorie and ingredients .. 
even foods in each segment like soup , entree , etc .. are classified for protein / sugar intensity .. 
Staffs have been very friendly and welcoming too .. 
My favourite has been the cold soup ( cucumber and dill soup) , grilled fish and chicken ceaser salad.. 
I think a foodie with health consciousness can swear by this food joint any time of the day !!

The premise of this place is supposed to be delicious healthy food as it is opened by a famous nutritionist . However it is sad to see that they are just conning their clients into thinking they are eating healthy food while actually ¬†the food is full of fat. I ordered the stir fried tofu with rice and was shocked to see oil coating the container in which it arrived. Even more disturbing was the rice, as it was not plain steamed rice but rice cooked in garlic butter as I could make out from the residue in the container and the smell. The soba noodles were similarly covered with oil. The falafel was undercooked, and tasted completely raw, though this was probably the only item that i ordered that wasn't visibly oily. This is definitely the last time I am ordering from here, as if I am going to be eating oily food anyway, I'd rather order from a place that serves tastier food. The calorie count on the menu is achieved not by controlling unhealthy fats like oil and butter but by restricting portion size to a minuscule amount that would not even satiate a child. It is sad to see that places like this work on conning clients into thinking they are eating healthy food when they are actually eating the same unhealthy fare that is served everywhere. I am truly disappointed.

Located exactly opposite to the Quest Mall and Bata showroom. A very small place with a Big Surprise!!!!!
All those health cautious people who thought that eating in a restaurant can't be healthy at All and only junk and oily foods are available in all of the restaurants then here is something to rejoice for them.Here you can gorge on your delicious food with ease and without any guilt feeling of extra calories. Ambience and decor is also very beautiful and unique.
In the food We started off with Rice Noodles Salad which was served in a small beaker, the presentation was quite innovative, impressive and awesome in taste.Then we ordered Stir Fried ToFu with Rice  and Stir Fried Chicken with Asian Green. Both tasted awesome specially the Tofu with Rice.
Lastly, we ordered Navedan Chocolate Ganache for dessert. It was an absolute bliss for our sweet tooth. 
Overall a great experience and highly recommended place for all those who want delicious at the same time healthy food to munch on.

My pre - marriage dinner was hosted by my best buddies at this amazing culinary destination! The name itself left us with so many ¬†imaginary conclusions. So once we stepped inside, it was a celebration of just good food and nothing else. ¬†The best part of of this restaurant is that you gorge on an array of delicious food from sandwiches to mouthwatering kebabs, yet you do not commit crime of adding on calories. Amazing stuff!¬†

We had stir fried chicken which was laid on our table in a manner that resembled a sizzler. It was tummy filling too. The Sheekh Kebab with gorgeous mutton pieces was too great.¬†

The decor, the layout ¬†is so very relaxing and eye soothing. It is a must visit for calories conscious people and for all recluses out there.

Independence Day lunch, and the restaurant was literally deserted. Either Kolkatans have not taken too enthusiastically to the idea of healthy eating, or they believed Independence Day should mean freedom from eating healthy for a day!

Located very conveniently in the lane just opposite Quest Mall in Ballygunge, reaching by car from Park Circus side is actually a problem, because of the infinite NO U Turns and No Entries around this place.

Decor is beautiful - no questions asked. Looks exactly like an European boulevard cafe, with potted plants, brick walls, pastel shade furnitures et al. Menu is more elaborate than the Salt Lake Branch, but a lot of these items were not available, so that was a bit of a dampener.

Started off with the absolutely refreshing Watermelon Basil Fresca - fresh pulpy watermelon juice with Chia particles, not an ounce of artificiality about it. Chose the Rice Noodle Salad to go with it (because Chicken Wheels was not available, and Frittatas was going to take over 30mins to make) - but I've hardly had a more refreshing salad. Bell peppers, tofu, glassy noodles, seasoned with chilli flakes, vinegar and a hint of jaggery - delicious!

For the main course, I chose the Spaghetti Napolitana with Aubergine. It was made of wheat pasta, so considerably lighter on the calories, and the sauce was quite good. Hubby chose the Mutton Sheish Kabab platter, and it tasted as amazing as it looked on the plate - with Pimonto Rice, Tartar Sauce and a house salad.

We wanted to have dessert, but nothing seemed to be available. This was especially disappointing, because I was really keen to try the flavoured frozen yoghurt, the multigrain tart cookies or the honeyed yoghurt with assorted fruits, but each of them were unavailable. The only couple of items available were the ones we had already tasted in their Salt Lake branch, so even if we wanted very much to have dessert, we couldn't.

In any case, this is a recommended place for all those people who like to eat healthy as well as tasty, because even though the price is slightly on the higher side, there is absolutely no doubt about the quality!

I was so hungry ! And was in mood of continental. So i have found eat good food 's reviews so awesome. And i immediately checked in. The ambience was out of my thoughts ! 



The beautifully decorated cafe has finally won my hearts ! Specially the water container was so attractive !

The menu was confusing ! What to take and what to leave ! :/ 

Still managed ! And ordered -

1. Lamb lebanese spaghetti 
2. ..... Bla bla chicken roast ( the name is too tough to pronounce ) üòÇ 

The food was so awesome and so tasty ! Out of my expectation ! üòç 

But sadly quantity was so low ! üòû in comparable of price. 

But if you want to try the pure continental food , you must there once ! üòá

This restro was bookmarked in my A/c for many days. So finally I decided to visit this restro only to end up regretting that. -_- Most of the items were not available..which is itself a turn off. Then the chicken was undercooked. The taste of the food didn't satisfy us AT ALL.  Not one item we felt was worth it.  Never gonna visit again.

This place is somewhat different from other restaurants in terms of food quality and consciousness. Those who are health conscious, this is the place for you. The place is quiet and soothing, a calmness prevails all over it. You can have a nice and peaceful meal here. The food items were all categorised as "Sugar balance" "Calorie maintain" and so on as you can see from the Menu. We ordered brown rice, stir fried chicken and I forgot the rest of the name Lol. But you can see from the pictures that I shared that it is served with vegetables like lettuce onion bell paper etc and some good quantity of boneless chicken pieces. As dessert we ordered Nevadan Chocolate Ganache. Now this was heavenly. The total bill was 637 after applying 18% GST. You can give it a try if you are maintaining diet or love  to have a "Good Food" actually. :)

This one should be called Eat Less Food (even though they charge you exorbitantly)! I ordered their Stir Fried Tofu with Rice through Zomato home delivery the day before yesterday. What I got was a bit of a shock - about 150 gms of stir fried Tofu with about 50 gms of cooked rice! And this was 260 bucks. The menu does not explain how much food they are going to serve and if they gave this scanty amount because they think it is 'healthy', well then I must say that the stir fried Tofu was very oily. Food cannot become healthy because it is less; food becomes healthy because of its ingredients and how it is cooked! And why are you charging a bomb if the food is measly? It wasn't as if there were exotic items in the item. I am also disappointed with the fact that this one item reached me more than one hour after I had ordered it.

Just opposite to Quest mall. We ordered spaghetti lamb bolognese, it was too good. And rosted pepper feta stuffed chicken, it was average. We ordered mint mojito, but it wasn't a MINT mojito, a TULSI mojito. Very upsetting thing is that when we tried to order some more dishes they said their kitchen is closed due to heavy downpour. So no more food. Finally we go for Coco mousse cake, its so surprisingly small, hardly contains 2 tablespoons.

It has been so long since I went to a place and came back thinking that when will go back there again. I have been to fancy places and had such good food that I can just be them in an instant whenever their names pop up in a conversation. But today I had a satisfaction of having a great time and fabulous food knowing that I have a place around the corner to be proud of. The food was exceptional, the atmosphere was homely and the behaviour from the employees was cordial. I had MUSHROOM TOSSED IN HERBS, CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD and CUCUMBER AND LIME WITH SODA, and like I have mentioned before, it was mouth-watering. And the best part, it is cheap and affordable compared to the other fancy places. So my compliments to Ms. Hena Nafis for creating a beautiful place and making a beautiful menu, a place I would like to visit as frequently as possible.

This place has been in the limelight for quite a long. With such high ratings and gratifying reviews, this place proves that is has a commendable magnetism. With interiors that establish the truth, "less is more", the place looks soothing to the eyes and calmness prevails all over. Different sections named after famous herbs (viz, dill, basil, thyme), have different types of seating arrangements. The entrance and the lobby, well lit and arranged. The whole place looks like a cute herbarium. 
Talking about the food, it's menu is build with a lot of consciousness and the dishes are twisted and redone to make it healthy and benefiting. Study the menu well before ordering because the dishes are contemporary and unconventional, and wouldn't taste as usually prepared dishes do. We had

Whole wheat penne pasta with pesto sauce: The best I ever had. It proves that you don't need lots of cheese and cream and veggies to make your pasta taste amazing.

Stir-fried tofu with rice: Another great dish. The portion of brown rice had a strong flavour of black pepper, which was extremely appealing. Tofu was succulent and juicy. 

Bubblegum smoothie: moderately sweetened and amazingly flavourful.

Hazelnut vanilla Iced coffee: My first hand experience with ice coffee and it tastes amazing. Iced tea has a tough competition. 

With a time constraint I couldn't explore much and I regret that deeply. I am all praises about this place because I had an amazing dining experience. Another visit guaranteed.

The place is enchanting to say the least. The sheer decor and the unique seating places took me by surprise. The menu was also extremely interesting though it took me a long long time to decipher it properly. One thing to be kept in mind is that the quantity is quite less. The quality of the food being "healthy" made it not as appealing as i would have preferred. A good place to hangout with your special someone as well as your friends.

its healthy and tasty...the portions are little bit small...we took garlic bread which was over toasted...just kinda burnt...the cantonese noodle was really blunt in taste (you might need lots n lots of pepper)...stir fried chicken was less oily that was very nice...and the best one was the grilled chicken stuffed with feta cheese seriously the best....served with lemony cabbage leaves and baked sweet potato... totally yum üòäüòäüòä...but they took really a bit of time to serve us (approx 30 mins or more than it) and we were really hungry...I must add the decor was really nice üòÜüòÜüòÜ

The place is enchanting to say the least. The sheer decor and the unique seating places took me by surprise. The menu was also extremely interesting though it took me a long long time to decipher it properly. One thing to be kept in mind is that the quantity is quite less. The quality of the food being "healthy" made it not as appealing as i would have preferred. A good place to hangout with your special someone as well as your friends.

Located near the lame opposite quest mall this restaurant is a beauty in itself. Amazing decor amd the ambiance is amazing. Each room is given its unique name of course after a healthy leaf. 
At first i was very unsure what to expect as i am not a health freak nor was i looking at the calorie/sugar/carb counts. I only ordered based on what appealed to me
Stir fried chicken with asian greens : Winner Dish . I would order it every time i go. It was spicy and tasty and also with lot of greens all stirred in a tomato based juice. 
Sheesh kebab: a full meal with mutton kebab , rice , dip and some green. I personally did not like the rice but enjoyed the mutton. And who knew kebabs could be made healthy! 
Paper baked fish : the fish is steamed and put on top of various vegetables. I had asked the server and he told me what kind of fish and how it was cooked. However i didnt like the dish as the fish was placed on an eggplant. And i am allergic to it. The fish itself was tasty but only after garnishing it with lemon. 
Roasted pepper and feta stuffed chicken : Another winner dish. The chicken was tasty and the stuffing was delicious. It was served with sweet potato and lettuce. 

Though i was not concerned about the health part of it but it felt good after indulging on these four dishes. The price is also quite reasonable. 4 entrees costed around 1k. 
Will i visit again? Sure.

It took us a while to locate the place , a small place rather but a wonderful one .
With a fitness/ healthy theme menu keeping a count of calories, carbs and proteins for every item the place is everything for a fitness freak ( or not, like me) . With lots of fitness/healthy themed cafes coming in the city this is the best one so far. 
The interiors are quite and sufficiently decorated. The staff is very friendly and made us feel very comfortable. It's a bit too quiet a place for my preference given that the place is small. 
The food was delicious . The chicken ceaser salad was good in quantity as well as quality with considerable amount of cheese. The Asian chicken salad was average , there was a bit too much of  soya sauce . The desserts were the best part . It was delicious and it also told you the exact of carb intake. You can't help but feel a bit of a guilty pleasure .
Overall , I would recommend it .

A world without continental food is not a world for me. I don't need a fancy party to be happy. Just a good friend, good food, and good laughs. I'm happy. I'm satisfied. I'm content.The place is amazing. Ambience is 5 out of 5 with that soothing music. The servicing was just too perfect and was right on time. Roasted pepper and Feta stuffed chicken was the showstopper of the menu.we ordered Tom Kha Tai nd Herbed Garlic soup.Chinese style paneer with soba noodles,pesto rubbed spring chicken and the best one ‚òù.The price was ok. Loved this place .Wanna go there again and try their sunday breakfast menu.üòäüòä

If we go back to our junior school Science classes in the fifth or sixth standards, we will be able to recollect all those chapters we studied about balanced diet, the micro and macro nutrients required for the body, the carbohydrates, fats and proteins, the deficiency diseases, vitamins and minerals. Were those chapters just meant to be study lessons? Or were they to be implemented in our daily lives when we grew up? If we look at our day-to-day activities nowadays, amidst our busy work schedule and various other activities, we hardly take care of what we eat. We are always in a state of hurry, and in the mean time, we hardly focus on home food these days. Junk and fast food has become a part and parcel of our lives. Be it a student or a working professional, we all are dependent of fast food now. Even mothers are working these days, and so they pack readymade food for the school tiffin of their children. As such what happens is, various lifestyle problems and health issues arise; not only in children but also grown-ups.

I ordered a salad. The amount was extremely small for the price,  the dressing way so much that I couldn't even taste the flavor of lettuce or the three or four little tiny pieces of chicken it had. Dressing should be served separately, giving the option of using it or not, as well as the amount to be used. Very disappointing.

Went to Eat Good  today...and I must mention they offer good and healthy food just as they promise..
Service is nice...and ambience is just awesome...the interior is well designed thus creating beautiful vista ..
The food is healthy and tasty...less oil and herbs are used in various dishes...we tried the pasta...it was good...Nd coffee lovers must try their cold coffee, prepared in a whole new concept...
What disappointed me was the quantity of food served....for a foodie person like I am, I appeared quite less..
Otherwise it's a good experience....kind of a "must try"  for health conscious people and the ones who like continental cuisine...

I don't understand why this place has such a high rating. They rip diners off and get away ¬†with it. We ordered a chicken salad of sorts, two shakes and dessert. The salad contained only lettuces with barely any chicken pieces. Definitely not worth the price. Perhaps, eating 'healthy' is synonymous to paying for something they don't add in the dish. While ordering drinks, we specifically instructed them to NOT add ice cubes, and to make it less cold. However, they served the shake with 4 large chunks of ice and later justified it with amateurish excuses. The dessert was the smallest piece of cake one could cut. The bill was quite huge, and they offered nothing in return. It breaks my heart to see such places flourishing by conning their faithful customers on a daily basis.

This place should be called Eat Little Food , not Eat Good Food . I haven't  visited any restaurant whose servings are less than this . Its very overpriced . I was extremely disappointed with the amount of the dessert served. Have a look at the size  . ‚Çπ185 for 2 spoons of dessert exactly .üòí It's absolutely shocking. This is a place I would never like to visit again . I dont think any foodie would like to . Their servings aren't even enough for a child, let alone an adult.

Such small place, much big surprise!!

You can complain about the space here, but EGF compensates you providing probably the healthiest food in the town! 

And to go with Scrabble and Chess, a must-try place for hanging out with your friends...

So, first in our list were Atlantic Salmon with Arugula and Cheeseballs and Spring Chicken Ballantine... Succulent protein with scarce oil yet such taste
, just hammers the bloody notion of "more oil more taste"...
And the garnishing.. My, my....!!!!!

Taste buds getting stimulated, we called for another protein punch.. Roasted pepper and Feta cheese stuffed Chicken... equally sumptuous, a special mention about the potato wedge that left us bamboozled!!

Lastly, Dear Carbs, if you wanna be you, be like Blueberry Cheesecake! A superior level of Mousse... perfecto!!

lovely little place in the lane opposite to quest. actually the lane beside bata showroom . on ¬†15th of april i was roaming around the ¬†the place in search of a continental restaurant and found this cute little place. the place doesnt look big from outside but inside there are quite a number of seats. i choose to sit at a place from where i could see the live match between kkr and srh . (on that day kkr won and i saw one whole innings sitting there). coming to the service . food arrived very late but i had no problem with that as i was busy watching the game . ordered feta stuffed chicken which was served with potato wedges and a salad . i must say the food was healthy as well as tasty . also ordered chicken burgers . 1st time i saw a burger without buns absolutely unusual but they deserve an appreciation for making such a tasty burger without the buns . it had a chicken patty olives cucumber tomato and cabbage . served with a dip which was delicious .loved there creativity with food . the person who was serving us the food is really kind and generous . we could see him making ¬†soft drinks with intense care. will be going back to taste some other dishes from this place.2nd visit. tried their mushroom starter which was good then their chicken pizza which was served almost 1 hours late and were stuffed with veggis and hardly any chicken . so please dont go for it . it may dissapoint you but tasted extremely good . finally came the nevadan chocolate ganache. two small rounded chocolate chunks tasted sweet (a little less would have been perfect). nevertheless its always a good experience to dine in here and spend some time with friends

Location ‚Äì It is located just opposite Suruchi, in the lane just diagonally opposite to quest mall, which has bata showroom.

Ambience ‚Äì  The Restaurant has an eye catching decor. They have five different section and are named after spices as the Mint, Basil, Thyme, Dill and Sage. They have variable kind of seating options, from soft seats to chairs to Japanese style of seating. Overall lovely ambience.

Service ‚Äì The service was good. Serving time was excellent. 

Food & Description ‚Äì It was a casual meet with a foodie friend of mine. It was a week when I had lots of outside foods. So this time wanted to try something healthy. What better place than Eat Good Food. I have been there Saltlake branch and loved everything there. This place didn‚Äôt disappoints either. This place is bigger than saltlake outlet and also has little more options food wise.  Coming to the food:

Strawberry & Peach Iced Cold Coffee  ‚Äì The cold coffee didn‚Äôt contain milk or sugar. For sweetness honey was added. I felt peach flavour was overshadowing strawberry flavour. It also had crumbles of almond over the drink. Excellent cold coffee. Healthy and tasty.

Apple Cinnamon Shake ‚Äì Apple & Cinnamon are pair made in heaven. This combination can never go wrong. It didn‚Äôt either this time. Amazing flavour.

Herb Tossed Mushroom ‚Äì Its just heavenly for mushrooms lovers. It is mushrooms tossed with varieties of herbs. Fabulous taste. A must try. 

Pearl Barley Risotto ‚Äì Its pearl barley risotto with broccoli, asparagus & mushroom. Out of the world it is. Barley was used instead of Arborio rice for risotto. It is healthy. It is tasty. A must try.

Overall the experience was excellent. Service was good. Food was healthy as well as tasty. Being a foodie, nothing can be better than eating healthy food which is tasty too. Though less on quantity but high on quality. Highly Recommended. 

Pocket Pinch - 700 for 2 approx.

One of the hardest things to do as a foodie is to eat good food. And, the task has become even harder ever since I have started restaurant reviewing restaurants and eateries in Kolkata. I have always been on the lookout for some restaurant that specialises in healthy food. So, when I received an invitation to enjoy a Sunday morning breakfast at a restaurant established by none other than celebrity nutritionist Hena Nafis, I had to attend!

This review has been coming a long time, I visited EGF on a Thursday night and was awestruck by this place. It's a small, beautifully made restaurant and the servers are absolutely spot on, now let's get to the food bit of it, here's what my friends and I ordered, although we each ordered specific dishes for ourselves, I took a bite of everything, so well, I know how it tasted :P :The chicken wheat pizza - This pizza was absolutely delicious and we all loved it and the most important fact is that even though it was a pizza it was healthy, I mean, how rare is that?¬†

Prawn Cocktail - Cause well, who doesn't like prawns? The prawns were well cooked and succulent and the mayonnaise which went along with it was brilliant as well, great dish overall, only complaint would be that only 3 pieces come in a serving but I guess since prawns are expensive, one can't really complain

Chicken Burrito - The burrito was wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla instead of the normal tortillas and the filling was heavenly, tasted brilliant

Pesto Rubbed Spring Chicken - This dish was my favorite out of all the dishes, it tasted heavenly, the pesto was just right, the chicken was well cooked, the salad to go along with it was perfect. I definitely reccomend this dish to anyone who visits this restaurant¬†

Chocolate Mousse - This was my choice of dessert as it was sugar free and I swear I couldn't tell the difference between a regular mousse and this one.

Great experience with the food here, I really look forward to visiting this restaurant for their breakfast and hopefully I'll get to it one of these days!

The fast paced citylife, the stress of regular  & hectic work schedule, the consistent strive to sustain in the competetive ratrace of corporate culture, and all the other miscellenious reason that drives us stressed out and fatigued at the end of the day...
Amidst all these, often what we forget(or neglect, to be honest) is our 'Health'!!
And eventually we end up being dependent on fast foods, junk foods and all kind of unhealthy eating habits.

In fact, in the era of smartphones and internet, we all are pretty updated about the way, problems like obesity, cardiovascular diseases etc. are increasing day by day, all around, due to unhealthy food habits. And even after that, the dependence on the same, is something similar to harming your own self, knowingly!!

Perhaps, that's the reason, we need 'healthy eating' to be practiced in our daily life, apart from having it as a good read in print and electronic media!!
And that's the way, the brainchild of nutritionist "HENA NAFIS" was born, to cater to the need of the much required healthy eating practices... 

EAT GOOD FOOD cafe & dining, we are talking about!!

Located on Lower Range Road, Ballygunge,(presently known as Tarak Dutta Road) the beautifully decorated cafe divided into four segments can anyday be compared with the decor of an exclusive fine dine, which creates an immediate positive impact on your body and mind with its exuding charm, the moment you walk in!!
The menu consists of a wide array of healthy options to select, and each and every dish you order is 100% organic and prepared from the scratch with fresh ingredients!!
A fantastic place to kickstart a healthy lifestyle!!

Eat Good Food by Hena Nafis is indeed a sinful retreat to the city of joy. The junk foodies often ignore this place thinking that this place has all organic stuffs which wont suit their taste palate, but trust me the food served here is thousand times tastier than the daily burgers and pizza we crave for. Coming to the ambience, this place is really very cosy and if you guys are going in a group you can get hold of the private seatings there, they are really really comfortable and quirky at the same time. They are named as Sage, Dill, Thyme and Mint.
In mocktails we ordered for Goan (apple flavour), bubblegum smoothie, cinnamon blast and mint mojito.
Entree- Burrito, Pesto rubbed spring chicken, Sheesh Kabab and Caesar Salad.The pesto sauce rubbed spring chicken really melts in our mouth and everything is just amazing about it starting from the chicken to the dip and the salad, everything in the platter.The Sheesh Kabab is basically mutton seekh kabab with a twist. Really worth visit. And yes it's really insta gram worthy‚ù§

This place is a one of a kind place in Kolkata .With a shift in the pattern of life ,this place caters to the needs of all health lovers . Apart from the quality of food even the taste has not been compromised on. I'd recommend you to have the  whole wheat spaghetti pomorodo and the Chinese rice noodles in Cantonese style.
The only drawback is that the place has been made like a maze which makes you feel claustrophobic.

One thing is guaranteed: you will eat good food. This is the only place in the city that provides macros alongside each menu choice. For those counting their macros or trying to get better at living a healthy lifestyle this is the perfect place :) . Hena (the nutritionist and owner) has a passion for providing quality nutrition without forgoing the cost of the taste. My favorite dish is the creamy salmon and my favorite drink is the cinnamon burst... perfect for a summer day. Love the design , the menu and people . This is what Kolkata was missing :)

It's conveniently located diagonally Opp quest mall and near Bata. 
The decor and music is soothing. Menu reminds of school days with that clipboard. The listings are very confusing and will take time to figure out what u did order. Nevertheless,the description uber every name is a saviour. 
We ordered iced coffee in rose and raspberry (this is without milk) & ginger lemon mojito. The iced coffee was bitter but gave a kick of flavors. I enjoyed it plain, but not with the food. The mojito was refreshing. The presentation was good. 
Next, mushroom tossed in herbs. This was saute mushroom in butter with garlic and herbs. It was delicious with butter, herbs and garlic flavor soothing the taste buds. 
The chicken Ceasar salad was delectable. It had rightly cooked chicken pcs and nuts. We enjoyed this the most. 
Grilled fish in paper and veggies. This was disappointing. It was more salty to my taste and the quantity was less too. The veggies were good though. 
The bill was presented in a unique way. In the end, the total calorie count of all dishes sad mentioned too. 

All in all I liked the experience. Billing amount was 1036 with taxes. 
The meal was light and guilt free. Great concept way to go.

I have ordered from this place quite a lot of times but recently thought of visiting this place. Simple rustic interiors with lush of greens on the wall. Soft music is an add on. Will win your heart immediately. 

Coming to the food, we ate the soba noodles salad and it was amazing. Herb tossed mushrooms were excellent too. Though the portion is less but I still feel they can add a piece of toast or bread to it to make it a wholesome meal for an individual. Tried their mixed fruit mojito, it wasn't great as it tasted more of soda. Will definitely drop in again to try more items on their menu.

Located opposite to Suruchi, this is a pretty restaurant. The place has ample seating arrangements. The have a Japanese seating area and formal seating arrangements. You can dine here without worrying about the weight guilt. The restaurant is owned by Hena Nafis. The sunlight streaming through the windows add to the beauty of the place. The prices charged are worth the food served here. Definitely recommended.

Eat Good Food is certainly the pioneer of the health food cafes that are coming up in the city. It is the brainchild of the famous nutritionist, Hena¬†Nafis. Building a modern cafe themed restaurant and still holding the claim of serving healthy food wasn‚Äôt easy for Hena. She took up the challenge and today Eat Good Food is the most successful health food joint in the city, with two outlets ‚Äì one in Park Circus, close to Bata, while the other in Salt Lake, bang opposite to Bengal Tennis Association.

Tasting the special Sunday breakfast ---

Eating out is pretty common these days, our lifestyle has kinda embraced that habit. And with every passing day we are realizing there are several health issues cropping up with these habits which we know are not ‚Äòso good‚Äô but carry on to live with them until one day they strike hard. That‚Äôs the time we consult doctor or maybe get hospitalized if things are worse. And that is the time when we think about consulting a nutritionist or a dietician. Unscientific and untimely eating habits cause several health issues, also eating junks can surely add to this. The best option is not to overdo anything and to strike a balance in every field, and food is no exception. I know many people who are still looking for an eating joint that serves healthy food. There have been few new cafes in the town which serve or claim to serve healthy food, and I don‚Äôt want to go into any argument on that. Rather I would like to let you know I recently discovered another place in Kolkata that serves healthy yet tasty food. Here food is prepared keeping in mind your health conditions and what your body probably is looking for. The place is called ‚ÄòEat Good Food‚Äô (in an alley just diagonally opposite Quest Mall), yes the name is not very ornamental, but the goodness¬†quotient surely is. This place has been opened up by renowned nutritionist, Dr. Hena Nafis, who while conversing with us told how badly she wanted to help the society, the people who are afraid of eating out because they will gain weight and again become obese in that process. She always wanted to give them a place where they can come and eat their hearts out without caring much about calorie or unwanted components in the food they are consuming. Here, the menu has been crafted from a nutritionist‚Äôs perspective; it never compromises with your health and fitness quotient to make a food tastier. In fact here the initial service time is tad longer; this is because they start preparing the food everyday from scratch, there is no half done food left anywhere which will be used on the following day.
                                          ...

The place lives up to its name. Really good and healthy food.

We tried mushrooms with herbs & rice noodle salad, and both were amazing. 

The place is also very well done up.

This place is located in the lane just opposite to Quest Mall.
From the enterance itself it is eye catchy and promises to give fresh food.
Their concept is really unique and perfect for the diet consious people who can have good food but consume less calories.
We had the Pesto rubbed chicken served with salad.It tasted really good.The chicken was boiled and subtly cooked yet was very tasty.
The cream of chicken soup tasted heavenly.
Coming to their signature 4 assorted eggs,this is really a mindboggling dish.
Its simple yet eye catchy and mouth watering.
Boiled eggs are served with a topping of egg yolk,veggies in mayo and garnished with onions and cabbage chopped.
The ginger orange mojito was refreshing too.
We had a nice experience here. üòç

Another one joins the collection. This cafe is so tastefully done that the decor alone deserves a 5. The owners and servers are very courteous and jolly. The different settings of the sitting area is amazingly planned. We ordered the Mint Mojito, Ginger Mojito, Spaghetti Lamb Bolognese, and Chicken Caesar Salad. Everything tasted great. The Chocolate Nevada Ganache was heavenly. The order was quick and we had a great time.

Health cafe is the newest trend in the food fashion of the city , and the name of EGF is well established as one of the pioneers in this category. The location of the ballygunge outlet is quite easy to find - take the lane next to bata showroom diagonally opposite to quest mall.
The Restaurant is eye catching from the exterior decor itself, planted pots , decorated entrance lane with flower pots , designed signboards and chandeliors. The interiors surprised us even more , the five rooms named after the spices , THYME , MINT , SAGE , DILL and BASIL are brilliantly decorated in shades of grey and green ,variable kind of seating options , ambient lighting from beautiful hanging and wall lanterns , brick exposed walls at places and plenty of plants used for decor. The menu is printed in brown paper clipped on exam boards, the bill comes rolled in a glass jar with plant leaves , everything is thematically organised. The ambience did full justice to name and theme of this place - sober, soothing and earthly.
The servers were attentive and we went along with recommendations :
ROASTED CHICKEN SANDWICH : the first recommendation from the staff. This was basically a whole wheat Sub sandwich stuffed with roasted chicken and veggies tossed in schezwan sauce. The sandwich was bland and dry to consume. On request , a schezwan dip was given which itself lacked in taste.

SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE : loved every thing about it. Recommended.

ROASTED PEPPER AND FETA STUFFED CHICKEN : the best part were the sweet potato wedges followed by the salad with lemon dressing that came as sides. The chicken could have been more tender and juicy and topped with more sauce which formed a scanty bed.

NEVADAN CHOCOLATE GANACHE : recommended by the staff. Very Lucrative lookwise but could not score high in terms of taste.

So food gave us a mixed experience , the quantities of the maincourses may not fill one , as the portions are kept low based on calories , comparitively the pocket pinching might seem a bit on higher side.

When in today's world everyone is a health freak this place came up as a saviour. As the name suggest it serves you pretty good food with a twist of healthiness.
To control our calorie count we had:
‚Ä¢Chicken wheels: coin shaped chicken roulade cooked with no oil served with garlic sauce.
‚Ä¢Cream of chicken soup: very traditional white sauce soup, very light in taste.
‚Ä¢Stir fried chicken: diced chicken cooked in tomato gravy and with veggies.
‚Ä¢Nevadan chocolate ganache: just one word for this dessert is WOW. Highly recommended if you visit this place. 
Interior is very minimal yet stand out to be classy, and worth mentioning service is very prompt. Pocket pinch will be a bit high than what zomato addresses.
Just one let down is of the portion of food served, for me it turned out a bit less.
P.S. They provide board games to play if you are willing to.

Located in the lane after Bata, Sir Syed Amir Ali Sarani opposite Shudh.
The ambience is quite and calm which is very peaceful.
The place look small from outside but when you enter you'll find the place is really beautiful. They have five different sections and the names - Mint, Basil, Thyme, Dil, Sage. It is totally a new concept and I personally like it. We choose the Mint section. Now come to the food, we ordered four dishes- Chicken Wheels, Cream of Chicken Soup, Stir Fried Chicken with Asian Greens and Nevada Chocolate Ganache.
Chicken Wheels: They served the chicken in a wheel shape and in the centre there was red nd yellow bel paper and it comes with chatni.
Cream of Chicken Soup: filled with thick cream, chicken and vegetables.
Stir Fried Chicken with Asian Greens: Its a mixer of chicken and vegetables. The dish is very light and tasty.
Nevada Chocolate Ganache: The best of the lot is this dish. The brownie filled with cream cheese in the centre and covered with chocolate ganache. This desert is absolutely awesome.
The service was very nice.
I'd love to visit the place again.
Highly recommended.üòÄ

A small and a very sophisticated interior which gives you a very American local feeling when you enter the place. " Eat Good Food " serves continental and has a very attractive Menu and good ambience. 

We ordered 4 dishes. 
1) Mixed Fruit Mojito : This was the first time I had a mixed fruit mojito and was a pleasant surprise. Tasty , Tangy and Refreshing. Must Try. 4.5/5

2) Chicken Wheat Pizza : A thin Crust pizza with alot of toppings and good amount of Chicken on top of it. Was a little plain in taste. Might be because of less Pizza Sauce and more of Vegetables. But was adjustable with Chilli Flakes and Oregano. 3.5/5 

3) Lamb Bolonese Spaghetti : Quantity will only serve two but quite disappointing because of its price. The Meat Sauce over the Spaghetti was spicy and delicious but the Spaghetti was not smooth. 2/5 

4) Stir Fried Chicken : Perfectly cooked chunks of Chicken with Asian Vegetables and tossed in delicious Asian Style Sauce. A perfect Appetizer to start the meal. 5/5 

I wish people go to this place often. A nice pocket friendly Cafe and Dining place. A gem of a place for couples and college students.

There is nothing that I didn't like about this place. The set up, the feel, the menu, the whole concept is great! Take ur people there if they are health conscious and don't like eating out. Coz eating out here is healthier than at home! U have detox drinks, herbal teas (served with almonds, unlike cookies), Juices! And to eat many many options, bt all baked rather than fried, and multgrain breads, lots of veggies. Burger bun is replaced by a lettuce leaf around the patty! Going again! Also don't miss out on the calories count on ur bill ;)

Located opposite Quest, in Bata showroom's lane. Cozy ambience and well decorated. Coming to the food,ordered-
Whole wheat spaghetti- It was yum and light. 
Herb tossed mushroom- Nothing extraordinary. Plain taste of mushroom.
Whole wheat pizza- It was delicious although the pizza slices were too tiny.
Hot chocolate- Not too great. Tasted like bournvitta.
All the dishes had a very small potion and I did not feel full even after eating everything I had ordered.

On a casual outing, I decided upon going to this place, cutely located opposite Quest Mall.
Limited options for vegetarian foodies, little portions and more than average pricing sums up my experience.
Although the taste was pretty good (Pesto Pasta, Bruschetta, Garlic Soup) and the place seems like a kindergarten arrangement (small delicate, yet beautiful decor).

Hina Nafees is a name to reckon with in Kolkata and this place by her lives up to her standard. This is the place to be for weight watchers and people who like food in general. We were a group of 4 and hogged food and still felt so light. Eat right and everything feels fine! We started off with the thai curry soup with tofu which was incredibly delicious ,the ceaser salad made just right. The Chinese Sobu noodles were yumm and a must try. Cheese is one thing ppl rrybto avoid but the stir fry mozarella with tangy tomato sauce breaks all myths and is a must try. Best part about the menu is it entails every carb protein fat you are intaking and you can decide your food like wise , the stir fried mushrooms and pizza were passable made just right. Healthy yet good to eat.
Can go back for their soup and noodles anytime.

You gotta eat here and bask in the soothing interiors.

We had gone to the nearby mall for a movie and came out damn hungry from the theatre as it was already lunch time. I was tired of having stuffs from the food court or restaurants within the mall and hence fell back on zomato for suggestions.I was really intrigued by the menu the moment I saw it on my app and decided to hit Eat Good Food.The decor was nice with nice seating arrangements. The staff were nice but few of them lacked the ability to grasp instructions. For starters we ordered non veg Burritos. One of the staffs asked us to try Cinamon Burst & Strawberry drink as sippers. I was very keen to have a EGF burger the moment I read about it in the menu & hence ordered the same. Wheat penne pasta with pesto sauce also formed order for the day. Since going by their suggestions did not disappoint us we decided to call it a day with Nevadan Chocolate Ganache. Boy oh boy I must never had anything so tasty in my life that comes wrapped in lettuce leaves. Yes you guessed it right EGF burger stands out and is also low on carbs. The burrito was good in taste with a check on protein,carbs and fat. The pasta was decently cooked and dressed with basil but the pesto sauce made the difference. It added a nutty flavor to the dish. The ganache stole the show, it is simply awesome and simply melts in mouth. It was a nice little experience overall and I would really recommend this place if you want to have some thing different from the monotony of selected formats of cuisines. This place for me will stand the taste of time & is a concept cafe in true sense of the term as it offers new items enriched in taste besides being pocket friendly.

Eat Good Food....the name is self explanatory. It also proves the point that good and healthy food needn't be boring and bland and tasteless. It can be interesting and tasty. This place proves this point very well. The menu is presented in a very interesting manner with total calories that a particular dish contains mentioned as also protein amount,total carbs and fat etc. The portions are also structured accordingly. As group we ordered Wheat pizza, Chinese style paneer soba noodles,Pesto rubbed spring chicken, stir fried chicken with Asian greens and Nevadan chocolate ganache. All the food items were excellent and tasty. So I'm definitely going back to try other items. But the service was way too, too slow. They really need to buck up on the service front.

Eat Good Food is a new startup offering healthy food, with an extensive menu which advises you at the same time, indicating how many calories are there in each dish, what has more protein , what has more sugar, etc. I decided to order this newly opened place for health freaks. I ordered the creamy salmon, the chicken Caesar salad and the chocolate and orange pot. 
The chicken Caesar salad had multiple chunks of well cooked and seasoned chicken , lettuce and red lettuce and Parmesan shavings. The salad tasted good, although I would've liked a bit more dressing. There was hardly any. 
Coming to the entr√©e , I had the creamy salmon which was served with broccoli and rice. I must say, the salmon was cooked very well and had a nice layer of crispy skin. I absolutely loved it. The salmon wasn't over nor undercooked , so it was perfect. It is pretty difficult to get salmon right while cooking and they absolutely nailed it. With that there was boiled broccoli and rice which was buttery and garlicky. It had some herbs also in it. 
I'm not a big fan of chocolate with orange, but since it was the only chocolate dessert available, I decided to try it out. It was a light chocolate sponge cake with a chocolate and orange ganache and slices of orange served with it. The dish was okay. Again, I do not like the combination of chocolate and orange so I didn't find it that great. 
The main point of this restaurant is that it gives you delicious food without making you feel bloaty and uncomfortable later on. I actually felt light after stuffing myself with all these things and that is a good feeling. Eat good food is a good place to be at , the ambience is nice , it just needs a little more attention to food. I completely disagree on the fact that healthy food isn't tasty. Eat good food will prove you wrong. Although some things were missing from the dish , had they been added the dishes would've been better. And I'm talking from the health point of view only. 
So try it out, you'll be surprised at how wonderful , healthy food can be.

When you enter, you feel very special because the service they extend towards you is warm and friendly. Add to that the beautiful ambience. You see the menu you begin to feel excited and worried about the price. You will eventually end up thinking the food looks delicious on the menu and thus must be worth the cost. When the food arrives, the quality and taste will be perfect but the quantity will be a slap on your face. Because it's gourmet food, darling! What a joke!

‚ÄúPrices look low till the portions arrive‚ÄùQuaint is the first word you think of when you see the interior. A flat has been turned into an eatery, rooms are cosily decorated, tables and chairs are comfortable to sit at and the ambiance friendly. The refurbishing has made the different rooms secluded, so if you are with friends, you can sit in a room and be away from the crowd, if the restaurant personnel allow you to.

The food is healthy, priced on the higher side, considering the portions. The prices look reasonable on the menu card, but the portions are small to really tiny. So you end up paying much more than you thought you would if you want to fill your stomach.

The downsides were: 1. The waiters seated me in what was the garage of the house that was converted and my corner made it difficult for me to call them for any assistance. They vanished for long time periods and re-surfaced only now and then. I had to leave my seat to ask them to come to me.

2. They did not have clear ideas of what the food contained. In other words, the guidance from them about what to eat was not helpful. This could be because they are new, too.

3. The toilet was dirty. I reported, it appeared that someone ran to look.

4. The crowd was extremely loud. There were various tables with two or three diners each, all of them were talking at the top of their voices. I was difficult to have a quiet meal with such adult noise around you. I thought I might have come at an inopportune moment, but I have heard from others that they have experienced similar noise.

The food tasted great, though.

Visited this place after seeing the good rating and cost for two mentioned on zomato to  be pretty less then actual one. tried there detox tea which was fine line any other cafe nothing great about it . Apart from this there vegetable  lasagne which was a big time joke one can ever get. They could have called I capsicum lasagne instead because it had only 6 pieces of capsicum with two piece of mushroom and baked in some cheese. Usually lasagna is something which I alone cant manage to finish one and this was not sufficient for me alone and they charged me 300+ for same.

I was difficult to have a quiet meal with such adult noise around you. I thought I might have come at an inopportune moment, but I have heard from others that they have experienced similar noise.

The food tasted great, though.

Visited this place after seeing the good rating and cost for two mentioned on zomato to  be pretty less then actual one. tried there detox tea which was fine line any other cafe nothing great about it . Apart from this there vegetable  lasagne which was a big time joke one can ever get. They could have called I capsicum lasagne instead because it had only 6 pieces of capsicum with two piece of mushroom and baked in some cheese. Usually lasagna is something which I alone cant manage to finish one and this was not sufficient for me alone and they charged me 300+ for same.

Fantastic food - we had a rice noodle salad, 2 mains, and dessert (chocolate ganache) Everything was very sooo tasty! Calorie and nutritional info for every plate is a great idea. Service was friendly - we will definitely be back again many times!!!

we chose a healthy one when it comes to our 100th restaurant !
well decorated, we had frittatas that was fresh and very healthy.¬†
wonderful presentation.
when ever someone wants a mouthful along with a check on the diet, this one is always preferable.
we also had chicken soba noodles with paneer. it was also light and very tasty.
ambiance is beautifully decorated. service is good.

Aptly named. Food was good and refreshing on the palate. Cosy decor with friendly staff. Ordered lamb steak which was done well and complimented by the potato mash. Fresh herbs added a refreshing zing. Drinks were non aerated and a healthy choice.

The ambience is quaint and homely, it's got different rooms named after different popular herbs. The food menu is divided into either high protein or low calorie or low glycemic. The food is awesome tasting and light as well as healthy, the lasagna and the pearl barley risotto are heavenly. This place is Mecca for the health conscious.

Whenever these healthy/organic cafes or restaurants come into the question the first thing that comes to our mind is it must be boring and bland food. And that keeps many a foodie away from such places.

Ta! Da! That's where Eat Good Food or EGF breaks the myth. And this was long needed. "HEALTHY FOOD can be TASTY too," - that's what nutritionist Hena Nafis proven by launching this place in Kolkata.

Sophisticated decor, with a rustic feel, smartly done menu with a variety to choose from and separate sections named after herbs (again the health quotient comes into picture!) makes you feel like coming back to EGF no matter what your mood is life. 

Yes it might not be the party kinda place but for a good adda, serious meetings or for a quiet meal by yourself, EGF is a perfect choice.

I didn't eat much on my visits each time but I enjoyed the Cinnamon Burst, Stir fried Chicken with Greens, Roasted Pepper and Feta stuffed Chicken. 

Since this cafe is all about healthy food so it's not just the items that's been designed after some brainstorming sessions but also the portions have been set right.

Drop into enjoy a different kind of mood alone or with friends over some healthy, good food for a change.

PS: They are coming up with a small outlet in Salt Lake soon.

When a nutritionist serves you food...it's got to be Good!!Calcutta is known for its laid back attitude and staying for the last ten years has rubbed off on me as well. So here I am after a long time with another post and what could you expect out of a foodie like me but endless talk about food and mind you, it's not just any food but Good Food.

Nutritionist Hena Nafis' Eat Good Food doesn't disappoint a bit. But what amazed me was the place, it was done up so well that you would fall in love with the place. A friend made a sudden plan to meet (read EAT!) and  as she had a meeting at Eat Good Food, we decided to give it a try. the entrance is nicely lit up with soft lights and you might feel that it's a tiny place but is quite huge and can fit in quite a many people.
Each section is named after a herb like Thyme, Mint and Basil. They have private dining areas with an impressive Japanese seating arrangement. Located at Tarak Dutta Road this place is quite near to Quest and has quite an extensive menu that offers High Protein, Low Calorie and Low Glycaemic meals.¬†
¬†Although I was not quite hungry probably kind of ended having an early dinner. We didn't order much.We ordered Cinnamon Burst, Apple Lemon and Ginger Smoothie, Roasted Pepper and Feta Stuffed Chicken and Stir Fried Chicken. The Cinnamon Burst was simple amazing and if this is something that cuts down belly fat that I thing every nutritionist should prescribe it to their doctors. We also took a tip to prepare this amazingly refreshing drink at home. The Apple Lemon and Ginger Smoothie was grainy, sugarless and light on stomach. Either the chicken was too delicious or we super hungry, we forgot to take the pictures and just polished off the bowl of chicken. Our second dish took a little extra time for preparation but nonetheless was worth the wait. The Feta Stuffed Chicken had a balanced taste and is something you should try out at this place. 

With subtle interiors, the place has a rich feel to it, something I haven't experience in other cafes in Calcutta. I am surely visiting again and so should you.After all healthy eating should be a way of life!

We ordered some refreshing drinks to start with , some ginger orange and watermelon mojito that was quite enlivening! The hummus plate was a disappointment without the 'pita', just the dip didn't quite work for me! For the entre' we ordered pesto chicken, barley risotto, and spaghetti in freshly made tomato sauce, thus keeping it healthy and simple! The theme revolving around keeping their menu  nutritious and wholesome! Purpose served. üëç

This place had been on my wishlist since sometime. It is owned by Hena Nafiz, Nutritionist. The place is nicely decorated and is quirky. The ambiance seems nicely done. The best part about eat good food is that one can get an approximate idea of how much of calorie,protein, carbs or fat is being consumed¬†as per particular dish. This is one of the unique concept which i found in the city of joy which i was looking forward to. I am not so much particular but for body builders or people who are very health conscious, this might be a well suited option. The place¬†still seems to be under construction and the a la carte is quite beautifully decorated.

I had checked this one out on Zomato a few days ago, and on a sudden date with S , I took her to the amazing restro. The earthy decor with the brick finish walls, and the wood finish furniture everything delighted me. We chose to sit by the beautiful French Window, on the ground floor. The brown paper menu on the cardboard clip-board was a beautiful thought . I got a tour of the nearly empty restaurant, and the staffs were kind enough to light it up for me. If you ever end up there with a big group of friends or family, go to sit upstairs, it's extremely cozy!  There's also a unique 'rock er adda' type arrangement with a table in the middle, you can try that out. The decor is more than impressing, it leaves an everlasting impression!

We were in for a quick bite so we ordered ROASTED PEPPER AND FETA-STUFFED CHICKEN and a NEVADAN CHOCOLATE GANACHE.¬†

The Roasted Pepper and Feta Stuffed Chicken arrived first ( duh!) and looked appetizing. First and foremost the Sweet Potato Wedges were yum yum yum! The sweetness was countered my the bitterness of the lettuce and the tangy taste of the dressing on the salad. A very very well thought out and executed combination. Coming to the chicken breast, it had a creamy delicious cheese filling and the chicken though succulent felt a tad bit overcooked. The feta made me glad. You should always mix everything up and eat it, you'll get the perfect balance of flavours.¬†

The Nevadan Chocolate Ganache followed and was a decadent delicacy.Served as two blocks of cake, ganache and cream, what's there not to love?! The cake was moist and dense, the ganache was gooey! This is a Choco Lovers heaven!! But I'd ask them to whip the cream a little more.¬†

This restro delighted me, and will be here soon for a biiiig lunch! :P

Nice quaint place tucked in the lane opposite Quest Mall. I love how the place is done up. I've been to few places like this in Cal that are congenial for a nice quiet chat with a friend. The menu is a detailed one with every item stating the amount of proteins, carbs, fat, and calories it contains. Must be a haven for health freaks! Only my first time here and I tried the blueberry shake and quinoa salad - pretty decent. I'd like to go here again for the ambience, and to try out the other stuff on their menu!

The name speaks for itself ! Yes, Eat Good Food is actually for the ones who are conscious about eating good food. 
I found this place on the way, while searching for another. But I'm sure this place was worth being to.
The decoration of the interior gives a beautiful raw look, The lights add to the warm ambience. The design of the menu is old-school which  we hardly get to see around.. Also, the material of the menu explains each ingredient and calorie intake of the dish which is easy for layman to understand. The seating arrangement gives you enough privacy.
The staff is active, quick, welcoming and more than happy for it's customers. The choice music is calm and relaxing.
Coming to the fresh food which doesn't take long to be served, is delicious. It's tummy filling and worth the price. Every ingredient outbursts it taste. They serve both non-veg and veg. It's decent to cost around ‚Çπ600 for two.
It was a nice time at this place. Will surely recommend others to this place. :)

Well this post is coming in after a really long time cause I didn't really expect such a warm evening.
Looking for a cozy place just after work walk into this place. I loved the food I would add had to wait too much for my food but as they mentioned they cut it fresh and cook.
The concept too was very appealing keeping a count on your calorie intake and other additional nutrients.
I will surely appreciate if there is a little more on the menu and it's surely a five star on the ambience so so perfect. Each corner is designed with care... 
Please experience this place and get the feel of eating GOOD FOOD.

Its a small restaurant right in the heart of Park Circus. I like the ambience, its very english and subtle. I've visited EGF a couple of times and every time it has lived up to its expectations.¬†

The food wins on both the counts - taste and calorie counts. Now we all know how hard it is to balance the two!!¬†

My favourite is the Chicken Ceasar salad and the Chicken Piccata with house salad. The latter is worth dying for. It is always perfectly grilled with proper grill marks on the top and succulent on the inside.¬†

Again, Hena Nafis needs no introduction when it comes to handling your weight issues. All the best to team EGF. Keep feeding us healthy food!! :)

We had gone to this restaurant for the first time just by the look of it. The ambience was quite cozy and a good place to hangout. And thats it.... Other than that, there is nothing GOOD about this place. We had asked the guys over there to suggest the best dish in their menu and we were told to try EGF Platter and according to them that would be sufficient for 4 people. And we agreed to this.
Woah ! What a dish it was.. Uncooked would be appropriate I guess. One piece of fish (loaded with salt), four pieces of mutton (as good as rubber), two pieces of prawns (with a big head and tail and hardly any meat) and four pieces of chicken (not tender but better than the rest). All of us felt disgusted after tasting the BAD FOOD and spoke to the person in charge. All he said was that this is what is served on this platter and if we still had issues with the quality and quantity, I apologise... Wow ! What a great way to delight your customer.
Anyways, I have had a terrible experience at this eatery and would never ever suggest it to anyone. EAT BAD FOOD.

We already knew that the restaurant served healthy food but were apprehensive that the food might not appeal to the taste buds. However each item was delicious although the portions were quite small. I suppose that's a part of the healthy eating. We ordered Tom Kha Gai, a chicken stew and spaghetti bolognese with meat sauce. However crab cakes were not available even though it was on the menu. Good experience overall

A quaint little joint tucked away in the bylanes of central Kolkata ---- a surprise discovery by me one evening ---- and boy, was I glad !!! 

Its a  one-of-a-kind restaurant, boasting of nutritious yet delicious food (something that I didnt believe existed ! ) .... Each and every dish on the menu is calorie-tagged and classified according to food value (glycemic index, high protein etc)... Really impressive !!! 

But I fell in love with the restaurant even before setting my eyes on the menu... The twinkling lights outside... the Earthy feel to the decor...the labelled jars of condiments.... the water pitchers with citrus and leaves inside...the crockery...and best of all, the silence (its impossible to find a place nowadays that isnt playing loud music or teeming with a boisterous crowd)
There were different seating areas named after different herbs ; although small, the place gave a cozy rather than crampy feel... great for those who prefer their privacy..

Coming to food, we ordered for a Mango Protein Shake and Berry Smoothie - both were refteshingly tasty... next came up the Risotto with asparagus and mushrooms & Wheat pasta in pesto sauce...both were surpsrisingly tasty, esp the risotto...however the quantities were a bit on the smaller side.. so we ordered another Chicken Stuffed with Feta and Pepper...the chicken was soft and succulent and the jus was yum... but the best part was the sweet potato fries served alonwith....
We were full to the brim by then but I knew I couldnt leave without tasting the "healthy desserts" ... afterall, its any foodie's dream come true.. Chocolate Ganache was sinful...but I didnt much like the Vanilla Coffee Mousse...
When I stepped out, I was a happy soul !! Definitely coming back again... A great concept and keep up the hard work..

P.S. Since the location is not prime, publicity is needed to spread the word of the existence of such a foodie's haven !!!

This was indeed a pleasant surprise find. We went on recommendation of our friends & found an extremely evolved, good food in perfect taste. Portions were small, but, hey, petite portion is an essential part of gourmet cuisine all over the world. Prices were very reasonable. Decor tastefully done. Had a nice chat with Heba, the nutritionist who runs the place. 2 starters, 4 main dishes, 1 non-alcoholic drink & 3 desserts came at 2000 rupees. Kolkata has moved to another level in gastronomy. A must visit for food lovers.

Located inside the bata lane, officially knows as Tarak Dutta road, this small and beautifully done joint will impress you. Be it their innovative menu, done around the calories count, minimal decor, placements of lights, the crockeries, table wares, menu cards, the music, false windows, rugged and raw finished ceiling, everything has a touch of perfection.
We have been to many restaurants in the vicinity and eat good food was in our wish list from quite some time now and finally we made it to the place. And what a great day to hit the place on a day when it is IPL final and you can be asure to get the personlized attention and skipping the wait time for sure.
It was around 9pm when we entered the place. It was full of positive vibe and energy. There were few tables occupied engaged in lazy conversation and enjoying fine food. The menu is a bit lengthy plus they were promoting certain dishes through tent cards as well. We decided to go along with the server's recommendations and ordered, berry smoothie as drink, sheesh tauk as starter, and Atlantic salmon and grilled prawn for the entre'. We had blueberry cheese cake for the dessert.
Food will take relatively long time to arrive because everything is freshly prepared, so my personal Recommendation would be to order everything in one go and let them know the service sequences.

Team member were knowledgeable and had a in depth knowledge of dishes being served.
Overall a good experience. Highly recommended.

If you want healthy food, this is one of the places to go to. The place has a lovely feel and the staff are courteous. We had ordered the Chicken Piccata with House Salad, Spaghetti and EGF Chicken Burger, all of which were delicious and seemed healthy and low on fat. They even served us a mocktail on the house.Only issue I have with the place is that it is advertised as a casual dining experience on zomato and that is so not the case. The portions were on the lower side.

I've been looking for genuinely healthy, delicious soul food in this city for a while. This place is super warm, cosy and comfortable. Minimalistic & modern interiors, with a lot of aesthetically placed indoor plants. The menu is vast, but each dish we ordered, surpassed standards! The chef has done a great job curating the new menu. The food is delicious and fresh, and it's very reasonably priced. 
I am surely going to be seen quite often here.

Whether we are trying to lose weight or just want to eat healthy, one question we all have is ‚ÄúWhere and what to eat while eating out‚Äù? Renowned¬†nutritionist Hena Nafis finally gave us Kolkatans an answer to that question when she opened Eat Good Food, her health food caf√© located at 19A Tarak Dutta Road (near the Bata showroom opposite Quest Mall). I was invited by Hena, Atreya and Poorna at an influencer‚Äôs meet to eat the good food served at the cafe and I am now super happy to have found¬†a place where I can binge guilt free!

When I choose this place for our regular hangout one day because I wanted to try eating healthy.. I got crazy looks from my pals. Nonetheless we landed at Eat Good Food. Like the name says they seriously give you good fresh food. Though it took time for delivering the order to our tables because as they said they prepared the food with fresh ingredients and nothing was prepared from before. As for the meal we had the chocolate shake, wheat pizza, Italian salad and Caesar salad. Over all it was a good experience and will surely visit this place for more good food.

Just had a clean pure lovely dinner here tonight with the family. I waited until my second time at this restaurant to write this review so that I have sampled more than just a couple of drinks and salads. The Berry Smoothie and the Aqua Fresca(watermelon & beetroot juice) were wonderfully refreshing....no added sugar so yay for the weight-watchers! 
Couldn't resist ordering the Greek Salad which came in a transparent pot and had a deliciously tart dressing that married well with the pieces of feta. Another wow dish was the Herbed Garlic Soup with a balanced flavour of burnt garlic and oregano.....this is my new go-to comfort food in the city. 
For mains we had the Chicken Ballontine Roulade and the Pesto rubbed Spring Chicken. Both came with sides of salad and were artistically served on pieces of slate. Taste-wise I preferred the pesto to the roulade especially because there wasn't as much sauce/jus on the latter. 
I enjoyed my meal and shall be going back again soon. In the gruelling summers here this place and the food it offers provides the right notes of freshness and taste.

After bookmarking this place for ages, I finally managed to land up there this week and boy was I happy!

Location: In the lane next to the Bata showroom which is opposite Quest, bang opposite the Vegetarian food court.

Ambiance: Very cute. Small and tastefully decorated.

Food: Who said healthy food cannot be amazingly tasty? I managed to have a very filling dinner with a light dessert within 250 calories and I was bursting to the brim because I felt so full. I loved their paper baked fish. Their gazpacho was also neat and very sweetly served. I tried their fruit skewers too and ohmygod so cute! And how nice of them to think of serving almonds with the tea and coffee ‚ù§

Pocket pinch: A tad bit on the higher side, yes. Between the two of us, we ordered three entr√©e dishes, one soup, two coffees and a pot of tea along with fruit skewers for dessert. The bill came to a little over 1600. But honestly, I didn't mind paying. The quality made up for it.

22/04/16: OHMYGOD THEIR CHOCOLATE GANACHE GOSH IT CAN'T BE MISSED!

Wonderful concept! Wonderful food! Hena Nafis is redefining the term 'healthy' with her new restaurant Eat Good Food. Located in the lane opposite Quest Mall, its an unique place offering delicacies for the calorie conscious mass. Right after you enter, the staff guides you in one of the different rooms named after different herbs. The rooms are decked in earthy hues with different motivational quotes. Coming to the real deal, the food. We ordered Chicken Caesar Salad, Paper-baked Fish and Sheekh Kabab. Caesar salad came in a jar (innovative!!), but the amount of chicken was very less and the taste was not at all up to the mark. Paper Baked Fish came in a paper bag, but again it was more vegetables than fish. The Chicken Sheek Kabab was the only highlight among the food items. The staff were really courteous, but they should have a clear idea of the menu. The price will not burn a hole in your pocket, so thats a plus point. Overall it was an unique experience. They should really improve the taste without compromising the health factor.

My and Daughter and I had planned to go out for lunch today. And my daughter wanted to eat at Chili's again. But I suggested we eat at "Eat Good Food". And it turned out to be nothing less than marvellous. From the quantity to the ambience to the service. We loved it! It's a must try!

Talking of health and wellness, Hena Nafis needs no introduction, the best in town when in comes to diet and lifestyle management. She has just taken a step further and opened up a lovely joint called Eat Good Food.

The place is very easy to spot and the interiors are brilliant. With each section named after each herb, muted tones, classy minimalist decor, the place has a very positive vibe. The good we tasted was fantastic as well. The pearl Batley risotto is a must try as is the roasted garlic soup. The non veg skewers were lovely too.

This is a great endeavor and I wish it all the success. !

Eat good food is just the place you would run to if you need to eat out but not feel guilty. Hena does a fantastic job of putting together a menu which is great for your taste buds and for your waistline, a deadly combination. I tried a soup, a salad, a burger(must try) - which has lettuce instead of bread, a wafer thin pizza, a fruity chocolatey dessert. All through the meal you could sip a beaker of apple cinnamon water to feel refreshed. The cheque is presented with a jar of basil leaves to chew on and can you believe it, the calories you have just consumed!! Loved the place, loved the food, loved the fact that you can eat the normal stuff with innovative twists.

Right opposite to Quest this cafe is truly a hidden gem. Run by one of the top nutrionist of the city it offers you plenty of options of guilt free gastronomic trip. The food (starters, salads, soups, main course and dessert) is divided into three categories depending upon the calorie and protein content and you can choose one based on your preference. All the options are labelled with calorie nd protein content which is again a delight for some one watching their diet though how far is that going to be successful here is a serious doubt.

Ambience is modern and minimalist bordering on quirky. Music definitely goes with the fresh and organic vibes of the place.

Coming to food we ordered their egg and tomato soup, chicken burrito, aubergine whole wheat spaghetti and a chocolate coffee drink. The soup was awesome with perfect warmness and twisted flavours of egg white, basil and fresh tomatoes. Burrito was delicious with right qty and flavors of sauces. Spaghetti was very dry and bland. 

Service was something that was extraordinary. Tuheen, the asst manager waited on us and was helpful in food selection. He promptly replaced our spaghetti when we didn't like it which was a pleasant surprise. Thanks to him :)

We ended the session with their signature Nevadan cocoa ganache,again suggested by Tuheen which was okay but not over the top.

The cafe could have got 5/5 but for the price which we found to be on the higher side.

Whether we are trying to lose weight or just want to eat healthy, one question we all have is ‚ÄúWhere and what to eat while eating out‚Äù? Renowned nutritionist Hena Nafis finally gave us Kolkatans an answer to that question when she opened Eat Good Food, her new health food caf√© located at 19A Tarak Dutta Road (near the Bata showroom opposite Quest Mall). I was invited by Hena, Atreya and Poorna at an influencer‚Äôs meet to eat the good food served at the cafe and I was super happy to finally find a place where I can binge guilt free!

The 54-seater cafe has five rooms named after herbs ‚Äî Thyme, Basil, Mint, Dill and Sage and I loved the zen-like ambience of the place. Lots of plants, low lighting, private spaces and colorful jars filled with spices. The menu is a dieter‚Äôs delight. Each dish is fitted into three diet categories ‚Äî Low Calorie, Low Glycaemic and High Protein/Low Carb and comes with a calorie count. Hena suggests that for maximum benefit, one should stick to a particular category while ordering food and not take bits and pieces from each. Recipes have been compiled through careful research and there are no fried items and minimal sugar content.

We consumed an incredible amount of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food that day from their new menu starting from a refreshing muskmelon smoothie to soup, salads, mix grill meat platter, Chinese style paneer and soba noodles, grilled tofu, baked vegetable lasagna, pearl barley risotto with broccoli, asparagus and mushroom, grilled fish with dill cream cheese sauce, grilled lamb chops with barbeque sauce, spring chicken ballantine and a rich dark chocolate and orange pudding. We were told that our entire meal rounded off to less than 800 calories per person. Unbelievable but true as confirmed by Hena!

Impressed by the food I had that day, I went back last week with a friend and ordered a watermelon and basil juice, an excellent mutton sheesh kabab platter with pimento rice and the famous chocolate ganache which was to die for!. The bill and the calorie count of the entire meal including Shikha‚Äôs order of a blueberry smoothie and paneer soba noodles came to less than 1000 (you get the total calorie count of the meal printed on the menu). 

Hena Nafis, I'm so thankful to you for Eat Good Food. You will surely see a lot more of me there!

Well, I'm quite regular to this place, this newly open boutique health food restaurant is sure rocking in it's own-self. Recently, had the opportunity to try their new menu. A bunch of Entrees has just arrived. As I'm on a High-Protein/Low Carb Diet, I don't get the opportunity to eat freely anywhere and everywhere. This place has surely made my life as a dieter more simplified. I picked up a few new dishes from the High Protein Low/Carb diet like the Mixed Meat Platter, the quantity was definitely sufficient and quality was absolutely amazing. The mixed platter would be a plate from paradise for the Meat Lover's. All the items present were individually layered with different flavor, was just so perfectly done.¬†
All that I have had here is worthy and most importantly it's pocket friendly. The concept of health food has been simply re-defined at this place. This three months old latest addition to the city's gastronomical avenue is worth going, and trying it out. The ambiance is note-worthy, good for casual hangout with groups of friends and family.

I've been to this place more than twice cus my dietecian has opened it up. Have had a very average experience once and a horrible one once. The service is crazy slow and bad. We called for soup for which they took 45 mins and it was served to us cold. Called for a grilled stuffed chicken,the moment we cut it open it had blood cus it was not cleaned. The sugar free desserts are decent. I like the chocolaye ganache most! Great concept though... Please work on it ;)

Concept wise very novel. You don't find much of healthy eating options here in Cal. Visited this place with a lot of expectations but it wasn't all that good. I believe the generic issue with this joint is their portion size. Eating healthy doesn't necessarily mean eating less. Also, tasty food can be much more tastier and not as bland asthma serve. The management must look into this and take stock of matters before it gets too late.

Met the owner and was not surprised when she told me that she is a nutritionist and passionate about health. I spend 4 months a year here and I'm already addicted. I will probably be here every day . No joke :) . Love the cinnamon burst drink. Great for Kolkata weather :)

Went thinking will be a lovely healthy meal , sadly it was exactly the opposite . Tiny portions ( I guess that's why the calories are low!) , even that I can understand but why was everything low in salt and tasteless?! We sent back the tofu and were not even asked what was wrong ! The starter came at the end of the meal and now we are heading for a proper dinner after sitting there for 1.5 hours! Wouldn't recommend!

A place where calories are mentioned beside every food in the menu. Very innovative concept. The decor is good and old school. But too many mosquitos and no proper air conditioning. Prices are way too high with little bit of quantity. The staff is a bit nagging and hassled us with the menu. The desert was only thing I liked though I can't remember the name of the dish. All in all hoping for a better experience the next time I visit.

Located in one of the lanes opposite Quest Mall, this place has a great ambiance and the decor is appealing. I had ordered a chocolate shake , which is the healthiest shake I have ever had, when asked the waiter i came to know this restaurant doesn't use sugar at all in any of their desserts and mock tails.
There is so much variety in the menu , one would just want to go on eating , and one thing i liked the most about this place is the nutritional value of all their items are mentioned on the menu. Healthy Pizza, healthy pasta. Heard of it ? No. This place has it all.
So If you're a health buff , THIS IS YOUR PLACE TO BE !

The concept is very good but the food is not.  Had ordered coffee which was very average, crab cakes were very bad infact they were frozen. The dessert was also a let down. 
The management really needs to look into making sure there aren't mosquitos. The place was full of mosquitos, maybe coz of the plants as the restaurant is newly opened.

Well I am bit of shocked to see such bad reviews about this place , but well that shows the amateurs from the expert , eat good food is that sweet heavenly place for fitness freaks , bodybuilders , the yoga people (well you get my flow) the proportions given in this restaurant are accurate , the chefs must be pretty goddamn good nutritionists , I am so sure because I myself am a fitness freak , I love my meal proportioned , but it also being a big foodie I too feel the quantity is less , many foodies won't like it , the Greek salad , not that good , liked their smoothies , not a zucchini guy so hated it , crab cake was very good , the stuffed steak was perfect ( well atleast for me ) and the desserts are nothing short of orgasmic , I hate sweets , I don't like stacking sugar but having their chocolate desserts , well I am once again hooked , Kolkata was really lagging good eateries like these.

It's a good concept. However, atleast for vegetarians the food options are quite limited. The quantity is too tiny, though intentionally so for health reasons . 
Reasonably priced 
Didn't quite the deserts I had 
Nice ambience though, cosy place
One of the rooms can be booked exclusively 
Needs to be refined further , thought process is fresh

The restaurant is situated in a by lane in Park Circus. The decor is very minimal and appealing. 


The restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night around 9 pm. We were escorted to the room in the end (right corner). You are supposed to open your footwear and eat cross-legged here. 


The staff is courteous and the server who took our order was aware of details of the items in the menu. He even suggested a soup with black pepper to help me with my cold. 


A friend who is a regular at the restaurant has ordered the food - 
(I don't have the exact names of the dishes as there isn't a menu available online for reference)

The HERBED GARLIC SOUP was different but visually seeing 4 -5 chunks of garlic wasn‚Äôt appealing to me.

We started with a COUSCOUS SALAD. The ingredients were just right but I have eaten a better-flavored and equally healthy salad. 

Moving on to the BURRITO, I wasn't excited by the flavors in the dish. It wasn't a burrito; it was more like a roll. The dip served with it was great though. 

The PESTO PASTA tasted good. I prefer my pasta with veggies though. I did not ask for the veggies so I am not aware if that option is available. 

The BAKED TOFU came with a nutritious and yummy side of mushrooms and salad. The tofu itself was a let down.

The RICOTTA BREAD was awesome. Among my favorites for the night.

The ROASTED BELL PEPPERS with COTTAGE CHEESE is a great, flavorful and innovative dish. Another favorite dish for the night. 

The desserts were all fantastic - THE ORANGE CHOCO GANACHE, BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE (more like a mouse though), and THE FRUIT SKEWERS with BLUEBERRY YOGURT. 


The issue was (1) the loud music that wasn't suited to the ambience at all. (2) The clutter of used dishes and tissue papers on the table. I expected napkins or better quality tissue papers at least. (3) There is no way to reach the servers except for a shout out. 


The portions are small aimed at serving one person comfortably. After eating so much the calories consumed by me was near 750. The calories consumed are mentioned in the menu and the bill. 


I am intrigued to try out the other dishes in the menu and will visit the restaurant again before I finally place it in a good restaurant/ bad restaurant bucket.

Beverages and soups and desserts were fabulous...something different...unique...
All over...it was an extremely awesome experience I had...and now I'm a regular customer...!! üòÑüòÑ

Eat Good Food is run by the nutritionist Hena Nafis and true to its name the food is good. Although the place was a little cramped and service a little slow, I guess these are teething problems which will go away. The tables are too closely packed and there is no sense of privacy. One let down was the staff did not know too much about the menu and they had to go back and find out everything.¬†
We called for the organic quinoa salad and mediterranean platter as starters and for the main course the burritos and the veg pizza. For dessert, we called for the chocolate and orange pot and the blueberry cheesecake. The cheesecake was a little heavy and not very good. The portions are small and the place is slightly expensive. However, there is a lot of variety in the menu and the food is very nutritious.
