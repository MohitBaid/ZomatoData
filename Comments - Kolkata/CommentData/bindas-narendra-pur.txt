Very small place. Food quality is average. Ambience is not up to the mark. Staff is well behaved but need more professional training. Waiting time is high sometimes.

Crispy chicken is a must try .though it is quite costly but too tasty. Quantity of rice and noodles are very good. Good restaurant with a moderate ambience.

Ambience is beautiful, decorated with lights, paintings, and soft music will give u such peace. 
And, of course u can have peace  cz almost nobody go there except durga- puja season.
U are really warned not to hav an experience there as very poor quality of food they provide and takes too much for their too bad services.

Chicken fried rice and Hong Kong chicken - these are the two items which we got as takeaway. Price is moderate - as it should be for joints of this type of budget category - Food quality and quantity appreciable. Restaurant ambience is wanting - better to have the food at home. Restaurants of these category actually have a lot of local following and this one is no exception

Well decorated inside. Clean enough . Time taken for food serving is a bit more but quality and quantity is satisfactory. Would recommend it to all.

It is situated near Sonarpur Railway Station but how the location shows Narendrapur I wonder !! The food quality is satisfactory and affordable. I have ordered many a times for home delivery and they arrived at stipulated time. The interior is just alright for a quick bite.

It is located nearby to the Sonarpur railway station which is heart of this area and the great thing is that there is no other better option is available other than Bindass Restaurant. I have eaten here several times and the quality of the food is good and also the quantity of the food is good. It is bit overpriced as per the locality but still pocket friendly. If you want to go for a family restaurant in Soanrpur area then I will suggest this one is the best that is available nearby.

Since this restaurant is close to my house, its pretty convenient to me. And the food quality is not bad. I recommend masala kulcha, maharaja chicken, chicken butter masala, chicken bharta. But dont eat Chinese dishes. Though Some chinese appetizers are good, but main course is just awful and waste of money. Im giving this a 3.5 for the indian(mughlai) part of their menu. If the Chinese portion was good too, then it can easily get a 4 star rating.
