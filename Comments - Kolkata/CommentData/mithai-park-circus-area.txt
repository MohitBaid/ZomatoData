Nice collection of bengali sweets , special in sandesh item . I really liked this " Gurer chomchom " ( in pic ) . Also what I liked about Mithai _ their sweet curd is white & it's a speciality of them . But the bad thing is u can't get Rasgolla all the time in this joint .

I enjoyed their Sweets since childhood and nothing changed ..their quality is really one of the best !! Their Mishti Doi and Gurer Rasagolla is really out of this world and don't you dare to leave the "Ras" or the liquid which they submerge the Rasagollas in specially the gur one as it is really good ..Now their kaju Barfi is costly but again really awesome you can actually taste the kaju which you won't be able to taste from most of the sweet shops and there will be either maida or sugar mostly .. I love their Mishti doi like anything !! Uff a must try spot !! Really awesome !!

Not visited this place/ this city but my mom received a product of this place from one of her colleagues, and that product is
1) Sandesh cake or as Bengalis call it Sondesh. I suppose it contains added jaggery due to brown texture, else its a milk based sweet. The cake isn't too sweet enough but sweet enough as the people of Bengal are. The taste is something amazing which I won't find anywhere in Mumbai. The cake is soft and literally melts in your mouth.This place is now definitely on my wish list if I ever go to Kolkata. As for the shop, keep doing what you are best you at , lots of love from Mumbai for this Sondesh cake.

Bang opposite Quest Mall this shop was an unplanned visit as sweets are hard to resist for someone with 32 sweet teeth. Taking shelter from the unseasonal rains last Wednesday just dropped in at Mithai. The sandesh variety was superb n satisfying to the eyes n the heart as well leading up to the stomach. So couldn't try the Rossogullas as they were sold out for the day and the fresh baat had not arrived. 

First up tried the Rabri and I must say it was sweeter than Laloos wife. Just the right amount of sweetness so was a delight for the palate and also the stomach. It tasted of pure malai and cinnamon till the last spoon with a gentle drizzling of pistachios.

The Kesri pera was also just the right balance of sugar with saffron n other ingredients. Added points as it was not very sweet as usually some places make it sweet n high on essence. Here at Mithai the saffron taste was just natural and not artificial. 
Service is a little laid back as staff was passing the buck on one person to attend. But that one guy was helpful and attentive. 
Pricing is pocket friendly and worth every penny. 


Highly recommended when in Kolkata for the sweet lovers.

" A sweet a day keeps all your depression away"...Mishti doi and rosogolla are the two best invention of bengalis , followed by malai chum chum and roso malai. Not a single sweet can satisfy the famishment of sweet tooth...So no other choice than " Mithai"... Because of promising taste of sweets and variety. I never miss having the "mishti doi" and "malai chum chum" here.

Located in the park circus area , while Mithai is not as big as KC Das in brand value, it certainly has more to offer in terms of variety and rarity. 
Malai Chom Chom & Rus Kadam is a must try.

Most famous Bengali sweets restaurant in Park circus , located just opposite to Quest mall . Eating their sweets from birth- from nolengurer sondesh , to chanar milkcake to gorom rosogulla and gulab jamun. Mithai is itself a brand .My favourites include Mishti doi and the yellow square milkcake type sweets with silver paper toppings. It is indeed a paradise for Bengali sweet lovers .

If I ever have to describe kolkata to anyone.. It usually begins with the people and sweets... This one and only shop is the only one who makes the best nolengurer rasogulla....  It is amazing.. Lovely... Delicious... Mouth watering... It's the real deal ladies and gentleman...  All year round they serve you quality sweets.. Price is steep but you got to shell out a bit to  enjoy the finest... Always been a fan since I was a kid.. Will always be until I can't...

The story of Mithai is as old as the history of Kolkata.
Every Bengali household is familiar with its name.
Located in my neighborhood this shop has been satisfying my sandesh cravings since the 90s.
I pay a visit every now and then for mainly two reasons-
Mishti doi and makha sandesh.
And sometimes for the pipping hot Singaras.

Mithai was the perfect place to end my first trip to Kolkata. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting as the staff at mithai is friendly and helpful. They patiently answered all of our queries about the assortment of sweets they offer and provided feedback wherever needed. We tried quite a few of their offerings and everything was fresh and the taste was exceptional.  It is difficult to overlook good quality ingredients that mithai uses which results in such a magnificent final product no matter how inexperienced you are with bengali sweets. One final recommendation, get there early during the day as they run out of their most popular offerings by early evening.

Located just opposite to Quest Mall at Park Circus, Mithai is one of the quintessential sweet shop of Kolkata. They are famous for their Gurer Roshogolla and Rabri. Unfortunately when I went to Mithai, none of these were available because of the high demand. I took Sankha Sandesh, Jolbhora Sandesh, Gurer Moshomalai, Makha Sandesh and Singara. The sankha sandesh was 25 rupees per piece and it worth every penny. The jolbhora was 30 rupees a piece and it was just brilliant, soft and good filling of liquid inside. The makha sandesh and rosho malai was just heavenly. The singaras were great too, brilliant filling and crispy with less oil. Overall, Mithai has been a tremendous experience for me. Highly recommended!!

P.S.: If you want gurer roshogolla, you should go after 4.30pm, they are available that time.

They also had a good collection of Sandesh and sweets. I tried two of their sandes and both of them were equally good.

Among varied characteristics one finds in a Bengali, it is hardly seen that one doesn't have a liking towards sweets. However, I seem to possess this rarity not being too attached to sweets

 Despite not having a liking, there are numerous occasions where I had to have sweets as a token of respect and thus happened to taste sweets of Mithaai.

Mithaai is a traditional sweet shop which has evolved over time and is known to be an iconic sweet shop serving ranges of sweet and savouries. It is located in Beckbagan Morh just opposite to Quest Mall, had been once known as a landmark known as Mithaai Stop, but, recently losing that status to Quest Mall.

They serve a range of sweets for the likes of all age groups and is also said to excel in sugar-free sweets being the sugar-free sandesh very popular. I happened to taste many sweets from the shop among which I liked Rasogolla the most. However, the savouries they sell, namely, singhara and kachoori does not seem to justify the high price. They also is said to deliver top notch Misti Doi, ie, Sweet Curd.

This sweet shop has served since ages and people seems allude with their services.

A visit is advised!

A small yet a legendary sweet shop in bekh bagan bang opposite the newly made Quest mall is a MITHAI. A shop owned by a Bengali which has served the citizens of kolkata with sweetness and pride for over a decade now.

A non ac non fancy simple old school sweet shops which also serves as a landmark for some specially for bus and autos.Mainly known and famous for it's legendary "GUR( MALT) " sweets which includes gur sandesh, gur rasgulla, baked gur sandesh and rasgulla, seasonal orange and mango rasgulla, mishti doi, plain rasgulla, raj bhog and many many more added to my list.The price is a bit high honestly speaking but i'm pretty sure it is totally worth every penny.The shop is well known throughout the city and till date I have never seen the place empty.

On occasions and festivals the place gets immensely crowded and on weekends specially around 6 in the evening there is a huge queue for the mouth watering freshly made warm rasgullas and sandesh.

Well, you have a lot of good bengali sweet meat shops in Kolkata, to state the obvious. But very would excite any bengali, at its very mention. Singhara - must, Karapak Sandesh - must. But one combination which I could kill for, is Mihidana and Mishti Doi. Abbbbssssoluttteeely delicious! Stunning! It would titillate every taste bud beyond belief. Must Try. Must Try.

My uncle resides close to this sweet shop and whenever he comes to visit our house, he brings with him Sitabhog. Haven't tried any other sweet from that shop because I am already in love with this. Not just me, my parents as well. Looks like rice..fried in ghee but the taste is out of this world. Diabetic patients might not want to try this coz its too sweet. If I go someday myself, I would like to try the roshmalai and rasogolla which are being highly praised in the other reviews.

Mithai is well known for its sweets across the city and I had the opportunity of visiting this legendary shop this evening. We bought khasta kachoris, singara, mishti doi and rosogolla. I have not tested a better khasta kachori in all these years. Perfectly fried in ghee the kachoris are irresistible. The singarà is good too. I was craving for mishti doi for quite sometime... my wait was worth it. The mishti doi available here is outstanding in taste. Loved each and every spoon of the doi. Coming to the rosogolla... one word to describe... Yummy!!! The rosogolla will melt in your mouth and make you crave for a few more for sure. They have a wide range of sweets and sweetmeats. The sandesh looked promising...but I left those for another day. The diwali special sweets available here are priced at the range of Rs 135 to Rs 250.

Mithai. Keeping up with the name and the legacy of Bengali sweet tooth.
Sandesh, specially the winter gur-e-sandesh is absolutely crazy.
The cham cham, mishti doi, small balls of soft sandesh, roshogullas. This place occupies a corner at Park Circus and my heart too. Irreversibly one of the prominent mentors of childhood have been munching Mithai. No visit to Kolkata goes without a trip to Mithai. I vouch if you haven't been to this mishti shop your trip to Kolkata isn't complete.

Mithai - Serves what the name says. :) 
=====
Intro, Location & Conclusion: 

It is located in 48 B, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Kolkata. (Small shop Opposite Quest Mall)

I have not been personally to this place but i was here in the client office at Gurusaday Road. The staff concerned got me a packet as a take away from Mithai as it was Vishkarma Puja. The box had Samosa, Gulaab Jamun, Son Papdi, Mango Sandesh and Usual white sandesh. All of them tasted really good and amazing especially the mango sandesh. The Samosa filling could be improved though. :) I ate the mango mishti so sorry you won't find the picture here. :P 

Further, it is a traditional name in the Bengali sweets and have been operating since quite some time now. :)

Though they don't much of variety on offer when you compare it with other big names in this Industry but still some items are out of the world. Specially their misti doi is just superb probably the best and rosogulla is also extraordinary.

Mithai is in itself a landmark and needs no introduction in the Park Circus area. Situated right opposite Quest mall, the small shop has ample options for foodies with a sweet tooth. Personally I am not a mishti lover but the Rosogolla from Mithai is a must try. Other recommendations would be their mishti doi, roshomalai and mango sandesh. Expect the place to be crowded most of the times due to high demand and reasonable pricing. Its best to pick up the fresh stuff during the first half of the day as most of their best products are sold out by late evening. Interestingly they even have dedicated Parking in front of the shop in spite of being situated at one of the most congested roads

No deco, no ambience, no trained staffs nothing fancy... only awesome pure misthis (sweets)... One of the oldest and going to be legendary very soon... Tried some of their stuff like mango sandesh, butter scotch sandesh etc... and yes their rasogolla is heavenly... staffs are very well behaved... costing was quite acceptable... Don't go there in late evenings... because you will not get anything... as all there products get sold by that time...

If you want to try Kolkata mishti,  Mithai should occupy one of the top positions in your priority list. 
They are mostly sold out after 7pm.
YOU MUST TRY THEIR NOLEN GUR ER ROSOGOLLA. 
Also their sonkho sandesh and their sandekh which is a hybrid between sandesh and cake.

During my schooldays as a teenager would frequent Mithai in Park Circus for quality sweets, now easily spotted just opposite Quest Mall. 
Tastes of sweets were quite good. Loved their kaju barfi and milk cake. For some sweet changes to your palate do visit Mithai for well, mithai of course!

Mithai is definitely an exclusive and legendary sweet shop in the Park circus vicinity. 
Located just opposite to the Quest Mall this place is a pleasure world for sweet lovers.

Misti doi and their Nolen gur er rosogolla are pure bliss. Even a person like me who is not very dedicated towards sweets prefer their products and highly appreciate them for keep up the good work.

Staffs are well behave n they had given us very prompt service....There we tried Aam Sandesh, Butter Scotch Sandesh, Rosogolla, Another Sandesh(didn't remember the name)....Taste was awesome, they didn't use any artificial flavor in this sweets, so I like it....Cost was okey....

Mithai,one of the oldest sweet shops is an iconic location in the area before the Quest mall sprang up in that area.In spite of the huge crowd almost at all times if the day the sellers are actually polite and too  eager to help.
The mishti doi is their iconic one which I feel is the best in buisness in Kolkata.Other sweets are equally awesome and leaves u craving for more.

One of the few places that has been able to maintain quality over time but only by sky rocketting the prices
surprisingly the khasta kachori which is usually sold out by the evening is the best ull have in the city
nothing compares to their rasgulla as well

Mithai is pure indulgence. The gur sandesh melts in your mouth like wow! Sweets here are always so fresh and soft. The gur kachagolas here are to die for. Even the rosogullas. Gur sweets are my favorite so I've mostly tried only those. But I can bet they'll all be great. I always carry these for my friends elsewhere and they gorge on them like crazy!

Sweets it is!! Ahaaa!! A friend of mine had come from Mumbai and she wanted to carry along with her some of the best sweets of Kolkata. After hearing from some of my friends, I suggested her to visit Mithai for sweets. So one evening, when me and my friend had to go to Quest Mall for some shopping, after that, we decided to drop in here and buy sweets. The shop was really a busy one, crowded with customers, pointing out that sweets from this shop are great indeed, thats why the crowd!! 
The person who dealt with us was really helpful and cooperative. We asked him about the sweets, asked for his suggestions regarding the best sweet dishes of the confectionary, and also queried whether the sweets will be okay till the next day as she would go by flight. He answered all our questions with patience.
Coming to the sweets, we tasted each sweet before buying!
First was KachchaGolla. It was a round sweet made of the material used in sandesh, and it tasted yummy, perfect in the sweet proportions. 
Next we had Kalakand. Square sized, creamy sweet dish, which tasted great too! 
Lastly we tasted the famous Rosogolla. Hot and juicy and soft. Yummy Rosogollas!!
We ordered 20 pieces of each. Loved them!! 
Even all the sweets are moderately priced! Nice shop. Liked it. Next whenever am buying sweets, Mithai would be on my preference list.

Bengali sweets at its best. Mithai is my second favorite after Gupta Brothers. From sandesh to mal poa, from gur er sandesh to gulab jamun to rosogolla, I love their sweets. Am glad, there is a parking area for this shop. My aunt stays at Park Circus and she always pampers me with gulab jamun from Mithai every time , she visits me. Must visit for those who love Indian sweets. :)

A standalone and legendary sweet shops. People swear by Mithai, when it comes to having Mishti Doi. Located near to Quest Mall, for many years now, this was a landmark in itself before the mall sprung up in the nowhere land. Their Mishti Doi are delectable and has an intoxicating aura which keeps lingering onto your tastebuds even weeks after a sumptuous treat at their sweet heaven. Evidently, it makes you come back here again for yet another round of Mishti Doi and to give a yearning pleasure to your sweettooth.

Situated just opposite to Quest mall and now the shop renovated but I tried some of their sweet last week, trust me the quality was same which I had many years ago. Staffs were changed in those years, nowadays these staffs are way professional than others in past.

There is hardly any mithai store in Kolkata which serves better roshogollas than them. I have had roshogollar from all over Bengal, but mithai serves something different. It's a culinary delight. A dig into the warm Nolen Gurer Roshogalla at 7 in the evening is a wonder in itself. Try out their Nolen Gurer Chomchom, Mishti Doi. Absolutely delectable. I would not say they make fancy sweets. They are masters of traditional Bengali sweets and they are by far leaders.

I have heard a lot about 'Mithai' and I have always wanted to visit this shop. I first came to know of 'Mithai' when I heard about an entrepreneur venture in which sweets from 'Mithai' and other popular sweet shops of Kolkata were delivered all over in the major cities of India within a day after the placement of the order. We went here after a visit to tje 'Food Rocks Cafe'. We went in and first we ordered a 'chitrakut'. It was delicious. We loved it. Next we ordered 'chom chom' and 'kaji barfi'. Both the items were taaty. We also saw the largest 'shankha' ever in this shop. I will surely visit again.

My "poila boisakh (Bengali new year)" hangover is still continuing...so I decided to savour the famous " mishti doi" from Mithai. Sweet with a faint touch of sour and a color which is paler than usual, marks this variety stand out. Excellent taste. It also has an array of mouth-watering sweets.. rosogolla and sandesh are to die for...

Staffs are a bit rude though but their sweets compensates. Price is a bit on the higher side. Singhara is bad.

Went to this place on a visit to Kolkata. After KC Das rasogolla failed to overwhelm my Odia tastebuds this place was the recommendation my Bangla friends gave.
Situated at a corner of a junction a small joint this is. But as soon as you enter into this you get a feeling of its old roots. To me it looked like it specialises in the "Khoya" sweets verities, though I went there for Rasgulla. They had even birthdaycake type big "khoya Peda" on sale.
The Jolbharas were no less than great. Sweet to make u feel full for some minutes. Must have.
The rosgullas were good but I personally did not find it that great. Even the Gur Rasgullas failed to make me carve more for them. May be the rasgulla tatses little different in odisha, which i truely madly love. But definitely the rasgullas at KC Das were not bad at all. Above average to me. Good though not great.
The only bad about the place is the place is small and the staffs wont listen to you to the extent that I was frustrated asking for sweets again and again. Though the there are other guys who were free and could easily give me sweets iwas asking for, the told me to wait till the guy who gave me sweet would come back from inside. So that they dont loose a track of sweets served to me. 
The price were ok ok. Not much not less. Overally, you can go to the place for it being one of the oldest and for khoya pedas.

We have been eating sweets from this place for decades it seems. Their nolen gur sweets sell like anything. And the taste of the sweets are sublime.

Some definite must haves are the gur sandesh and if you are lucky, you might get their gur chom chom. If you do get the chom chom, consider yourself lucky because as soon its put on the shelf, it gets sold out.

Great nimkis and singaras, delecious mishti doi and sandesh, and yummy boondi!! Go there in the mornings or tea time to get the freshest goodies,and don't be late as the place gets cleaned out FAST!!

I was strolling down in the nearby lanes of park circus and I got to see this sweet shop called MITHAI just located on the opposite foot of Quest mall , so I decided to try one or two sweets which was one gulab jamun and chocolate sandesh ,now after getting them I tried my first bite and the chocolate sandesh just fell apart completely making me eat it in that shattered state however it was tasty but I thought it would be a little hard to resist the very first bite at least , neways now moving on to the gulab jamun it just did its magic cause it was well prepared perfectly with the right taste and aroma fitting fine making me get back my mood to visit this place again to try different other varieties of sweets .

One leap from my home and I land at the Mithai. I have been visiting this shop as long as I have lived! More than for it's sweets, the shop is important for me for being my "Nearest landmark" or meeting spot for friends. Since my chilhood, I have been an avid follower of their Mishti Doi, Mihidana, Khasta Kochuri and Kumkum which tastes best when fresh in the morning. Also, their winter-special Gurer Rosogolla and Jolbhora are a must try!

It was an accidental visit to this place. Was in quest fr some shopping as left from the mall it started drizzling, to seek some shelter went to this place.
The number of people having sweets in that shop spoke everything about the quality and its popularity.
I just wanted to experience the same so asked for gulab jamun, kaccha gola and chocolate sondesh !!!!!!!
Excellent kaccha gola..... and gulab jamun was mouth melting.
Chocolate sondesh couldn't meet up their standards.... I guess they used coco powder in there sondesh...I would suggest if they try using thick chocolate ganache then the product might texture different......

Mithai has been a favourite since childhood days. 
Located near Beckbagan junction, the shop can be approached from two directions. It has enough space to accomodate a large number of customers.
The sweets are exquisite in taste and flvours made with authentic traditional ingredients.
I love the Mishti doi and rosogollas available here.

They specialise in the Nolen gur collection of the Bengali sweets. I love their nolen gurer rossogolla, nolen gurer sandesh and they provide a big round korapaker sandesh which comes for a variety of occasions. Mithai is one of the celebrated sweetshop for Bengalis in Kolkata. It's a must visit for you. Happy Dining! :)

I have grown up eating stuff from here. The singara and the khasta kochuri is brilliant. Apart from that the rosogolla is all time favorite. In the winter the nolen gurer misti is out of the world. They have them in all sizes so you can buy the one u need.

God knows... Maybe he can't guess how many times I've had those mouth watering hot roshogollas of mithai and I just fall in love with them every time I have them! The mishti doi of mithai is just fantabulous! The chomchom the kaju barfi are also some of the favourites... But they never cease to surprise me with their variety of sweets every time I visit... And I'm just confused what to have and what not!!!!

Mithai located opposite Quest mall in Beckbagan area is a landmark in itself.It has been around for ages and it still serves quality authentic Bengali sweets.

I have tried various items from here when I pass by.Among the ones that I really liked are the good old rosogollas and the mishti doi.They do a great job with the most iconic of all the Bengali sweets.The rajbhog is also brilliant.The balusahi is another personal pick.In fact all the sweets here are pretty nice and more so the more traditional ones.The singaras are quite nice too.

The prices are reasonable.They do not make too many of the innovative fusion sweets that have come up of late.They more or less stick to the traditional stuff and do a good job at it.

This one is an excellent sweet shop located in Beckbagan. Though I have not tried much variety of sweets from here but I must tell you the Misti doi and Rosogollas ( both sponge and nalengur) are just awesome. I had ordered their Rosogollas during one of the functions of my wedding and people were craving for more it was so tasty and creamy. The prices are just right.

An excellent mishti shop right at the heart of ballygunge, mithai has always been one of the iconic shops of this genre.. Their sandesh, rosogolla and all other usual stuff are pretty good, but their doi is worth dying for.. They have aam doi in the summer, which is just exquisite, and too good to resist for anyone.. Must try for everyone..

They seal pack fresh roshogullas suitable to carry by air! Helped me ship a couple of dozens of them back home. Just for that, they're the best! Oh and also the chamchams and mishti doi. Must try! Easy to spot and find in the crowded city, bang opposite the famous quest mall, one must stop here on the way to the airport to pick up the famous goodies of Kolkata.

Best sponge roshogollas, holud shondesh, kumkum, butterscotch shondesh, shingara, khasta kochuri and podmonimkis. The mishti doi is a bit too sour for my taste. Also try the balushai and the jibe gojas. You won't manage the nolen gurer roshogollas except winters, but make sure you try them in that season to leave you all warm and fuzzy inside. I also like their norompak gurer shondhesh better than the korapak ones.. But if you're taking back packets of mithais for your home / office/ relatives in some other city, do stick to the korapak ones.

A sweet lover's paradise and simply heaven. This is a 5 minute walk from my current office and a popular haunt. They have never disappointed me in terms of taste, quality or size. I have eaten here many times and my all time favorites here are aam sandesh when mangoes are in season, mishti doi, samosa and of course the classic "rosogolla". I have gifted people sweets from here and it always leaves a mishti trail.

This place has not changed in terms of quality over the years and very few would be able to compete with their quality and hence totally worth the price.The sad part is that they do not have any branches and are located opposite Quest Mall.The soft sandesh is also deletable and it is definitely a must visit for a sweet lover and those wanting to savour the authentic Kolkata mishti.

Mithai is one of my favourite sweet shops in Kolkata.It is known for it's goodwill and is well established.The Mishti Doi here is fantastic and so are the soft and spongy rasagullas.A sold out situation is sometimes inevitable.The Cham Chams are excellent and so are kora paker sondesh.The snacks like kachori and samosa are an absolute delight and so  are the mihidana and sitabhog.All in all this is one place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth or else you are missing out.

Often referred as "city of sweets", Kolkata enjoys some of the traditional and pre-independence (even older) sweet shops. No doubt Mithai is one of those. Located in Beckbagan, the store enjoys its goodwill and is well known to people nearby.

Mithai has to offer some usual Bengali favorite sweets like sandesh, kachagolla, khirkodom, rasogolla, chandra-pully, misti doi and rabri. Misti doi is best seller and is highly recommended. The store also offers varieties of Sandesh in different shapes. Namkeens and snacks are available such as samosa, kachori, vegetable chop and more. Nimki, another bong favorite namkeen, available here.

Aesthetically the store may not be very pleasing but I don't think that it matters that much for sweet shops and that also a traditional sweet shop. Service is good, cant complain on anything. Only problem could be the little standing space the shop has to offer. On days of rush, it could be difficult to approach and look at what all sweets are available.

Mithai is one place to be ravaged for kachagolla and rosogolla, especially during winters for their nolen gur varieties. I say ravaged because their popularity ensures every mishti goes off the rack by evening 7/8. I have not come across any sweet shop in Kolkata which serves kachagolla so soft, fresh and full of chhana without mixing maida or suji. They just do not, and I can swear they do not because I have people in my family with wheat allergy who can have the kachagollas and other sweets from Mithai with their eyes closed. Their winter varieties of the same get a few levels ahead of the usual ones because of the generous amount of good nolen gur. My mom's obsession with Mithai makes her travel from Tollygunge to Beckbagan at least twice a month, and no, I am definitely not complaining. :)

Mishti-love tip: Microwave the nolen gur sweets and you shall be in heaven.

Being born in the vicinity this was my all time favorite shop as a child . Again i don't know why i haven't reviewed it so far. According to me they have on of the bast cham cham in the city. The rasgolla is quite good. as are the kacha golla sandesh and the lemon sandesh . what is worth mentioning is the Samosa. Simply love them and the vegetable chops as well . 

their location is their plus. Right on beck bagan they cater to needs of all clientele . Mithai is tradition . I have had goodies from here for years and this a comfort shop for the hungry soul . Its hard not to sop when ever I am crossing it

If you have a sweet tooth but have not sampled the delights of Mithai you are missing out ! Their Misti Doi is well known and people will come from across the city to buy it for occasions and functions. The Shankh , Lemon Sandesh and Kalakand are excellent as is the Kheerkadam which is a personal favorite. The Rosogolla and Gulab Jamuns are yummy as well. A special mention to their sweet Bundi which is delicious and has an extremely juicy flavor another personal favorite.  The Khasta Kachori and Nimki is also good. Not too fond of their Singhara though. They also make lovely gur sandesh and rosogolla's . 
Writing this review has certainly given me a sweet craving guess I will have to stop by Mithai today ;-)

i have visited the sweet shop mithai quiet a few times, well for one some of the sweet meats to taste are the nol er gur sandesh especially the one which has the jaggery inside the sweet. The khir ka dum sweet is also smashing. The cham cham are also tasty. Location wise the shop is bang on. May be some touch up could be done in the shop. Oh i love their kastha kachories which is sweetist and certainly not spicy.

Dig into the delights of sandesh and doi @ Mithai
4 out of 5

If you are a die-hard lover of sweet meats and yoghurts, explore all the sweet meat shops in the city but I bet you won't find any such shop in the city that can come close to Mithai when it comes to Misti Doi, the most unique item of this store. There are many big names in the world of sweet meat stores in Kolkata like Balaram Mullick, Ganguram, Bancharam, Gupta Brothers and more, but when it comes to Misti Doi, Mithai is always right up there at the top.  

I stay close by, and Mithai is a local sweet shop for me. Every morning, I find that the store is overcrowded with customers getting out of the shop with large packets of sweets and snacks from the store. By 12 noon, you will find that their shelves are almost empty with some less popular items still occupying a few trays. It's the same in the evening. On some days, if you go and ask for Singharas at 6PM, they will say - 'all sold out'. By 9 to 9.30 PM all the shelves are almost empty. Moreover, they never sell any leftovers; even if there are one or two items left, they offer them to the beggars at the end of the day before closing the store. 
 
Now - coming to their hot listed items. Apart from Misti Doi, another unique item sold here is their Bonde (bundi). Here, the bonde is totally different to look at. Light yellow with a crystal clear look. As I mentioned earlier, Mithai cannot be compared with any renowned sweet shops in Kolkata (neither in ambience nor in the wide variety of options they serve), but people still come from distant areas to try their sandesh's. Sankha and padma are the only two designer styles they offer in Sandesh apart from the normal square and round ones, though I am not a huge fan of these types. Though, they also offer rose, mango and elaichi flavored Sandesh's these are not the best here. In winter season, when fresh 'gur' (jaggery) comes into the market, they prepare Nolen Gurer Sandesh and Gur Rassogulla both of which are truly outstanding. 

Owing to the huge popularity of the original store at Beck Bagan, Mithai has opened a second outlet at Gariahat a few years back, maintaining the same quality in both the outlets. If you haven't been to Mithai yet, make sure that you visit the place soon because this store will never ever disappoint you (in quality or price).

Three things I generally hit Mithai for are as follows - 

1. Mishti Doi.
2. Malai Cham Cham
3. Khirkadam. 

I love the clean and creamy white doi. And the other two things taste great too but the Mishti Doi makes me happy all the time. the prices are reasonable, and I love the way they actually tell you what is the day's freshest.

Mithai... everyone speaks of it, with a great deal of fondness and respect. It is in my neighbourhood and I have been there numerous times. Some of their stuff is nice, but often not of the same class as a few of the better known sweet shops in Kolkata.

They do not have lal-doi. They only serve mishti doi, which is pretty nice most of the time, and a tad reddish too.

Their gurer rossogollas are great. At times they tend to become too sweet.

I like their gulab-jamuns. They had deteriorated some time back but now seems back to its original taste.

In season, the gurer norom pak sandeshes are nice. Nothing exceptional though. Same with hte myriad chamchams and other soft mishtis, dry or syrup based.

I like their kheerer chop. They are tasty and reasonably economical.

What has been most disappointing has been the downfall of their shingaras (samosas). Years back they were much in demand, and though they still seem to be, the taste is no longer what it used to be. Often it is over spicy.

What can also be annoying at times is the very slow service. Also, one has to shout out and keep nagging at the counter staff to be heard! Very annoying at the least.

Located at the Syed Amir Ali Avenue Intersection, you cannot miss Mithai. The only reasons I come here is for the delicious yoghurt, specifically the Mishti Doi. It is spectacular, and the demand is very high .. at times you might have to face a sold-out situation, something not common for shops like these! In the mornings, the snacks are popular and quite tasty. I have not tried out many of  their other offerings, but among the ones I did, the rosogolla is soft, spongy and lingers on your tongue. Over-all, this place falls in between the Good and the Fantastic slots.. but the brilliant doi edges it to the 4 points rating. Short-staffed at times, they have a tough time handling the rush hour crowds of the home-bound men stopping to pick up their daily dose of the doi.

Verdict: Enjoy a light, traditional kachori-jalebi breakfast and take home the doi. In minutes, you will lick it clean!

Mithai is a good sweet shop. I have their sweets very seldom. Rosogollas are good and also the pantuas. The Shak Sandesh is also a good one. It is not having a good ambience. Prices are reasonable. The other Sandesh are good too. The mishti doi is a must try. The Khirkadam is also very tasty.
I would rate 3.5 for MITHAI.
