This sweet confectionary is located near Barrackpore station. They keep a variety of sweets .

Service is fine .

Tried sondesh & gulab jamun. They were average in taste and little stale too.

Price is ok.

I was just here last Sunday. After a sumptuous biriani meal at dada boudis we opted for firni,but it was out of stock,so we came here ,had some sweets. The Bombay roll was very good.

Looking for some pocket friendly Bong sweets in Barrackpore? This is the place to be in. ☺
Be it seasonally available nole gurer shondesh or hot sponge rasgullas, people with a sweet tooth must try the aweets here.

This sweet shop is situated just opposite Sukanta Sadan of Barrackpore. A small sweet shop. Sweets looks attractive but quality is ordinary. Prices are comparably higher than quality. A big letdown for me, tried their ladoos, kajuborfi barfi which were good, but chocolate sondesh was sour and stale.
Tried their chops , cutlet too. Not good or recommended.
Staffs are polite. Surrounding  is not  hygienic, wasps, fly always float around.

Situated opposite of Sukanta sadan..
In Barracpore it is 1 of the many sweet shops named 'Ramkrishna'. It is just beside the 'Gaja goli'..
They serve both sweets and 'chop'..
I tried their sweets many times.. it's good..

This sweet shop is located in a prime place in Bkp which results in the huge sale volume. To be honest Bkp does not have decent sweet shop, the quality here is ordinary and the price is exorbitant.
Par better quality sweet at cheaper rate is found in ichapur and shyamnagar. 
So not able to rate this place more.
