Bedwin is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. 
Till date i knew it is only famous for its rolls but yesterday on Christmas i went with my family to dine there. I didnt expected so much . We ordered sarsoon da saag , paneer butter masala , rumali rooti , bedwin special mixed chowmin , mixed friedrice , garlic chicken and firni. Out of my expectation the food was extremely good and delicious and upto the mark. We ordered one plate of everything and it satisfied 4 appetites.  The quality was very good and the taste was of authentic Chinese.  It was  one of the best chinese dishes i have ever had.

Bedwin is popular among the regular shoppers at Gariahat. Always crowded; courtesy the location, this place is popular for rolls & basic Chinese dishes like Noodles, Fried rice & Chilli Chicken. Taste is below average. Quality of food is not satisfactory. The hygiene of the place might bother you too.

Excellent rolls !!! Egg chicken, egg mutton whatever the roll is.....

When moving towards Gariahat from Golpark,just before the beginning of the flyover,there is a lane to the left. Surrounded by second hand bookstores, this place will be on the left hand side.

I've been a regular customer of this place primarily for their Rolls and occasionally for Kebabs.

If one is looking forward to having Chinese food,there are better places to try out.
But a good option to satisfy those mid-shopping hunger knocks.

Located conveniently in Gariahat . Easy to locate . Their rolls and kebabs are very good . Biryani was pretty average and so were the breads . Loved the Paneer dish , though I don't remember the name . It is overpriced if compared to others located in the same area .

Visit only if you live nearby and try out their kebabs and rolls .

Bedwin is located near Goalpark, Gariahat. They mostly serve North Indian, Mughlai & Chinese dishes.The place is too tiny. We Had #Rumali Roti with #Chicken Bharta #Mixed Fried Rice #Chili Chicken .Taste and quality of the items are a bit above average. But the cleanliness and the behaviour of the staff destroys it all. One must try a take away here rather than their dine-in options.

This is a legendary roll counter in Gariahat crossing. I have a soft corner for rolls, so never tried to eat from their restaurant.
I love their egg rolls, which comes with a smashed potato stuffing. Also, my favourite tikia rolls. It's a very very small shop and almost always crowded. They make rolls in a jiffy.
They also kept a bowl of lemon and green chilli so that you can have your roll with a dash of lemon and a bite on the chilli. If you're a hygeine freak then this place is not for you.

One of the oldest North Indian food joints in Kolkata. The name is famous. Located near the Gariahat More, i just love their rolls. The fast food outlet is most famous-they have adjacent outlets for momos, rolls, South India etc. The nonvegetarian oultet offers yummy Chilli Chicken at Rs. 15 per piece and great fish fry. The South Indian outlet offers equally good South Indian dishes, Kulfi etc. Yet to try the momo, but the rolls are a saviour for people shopping at Gariahat. Thanks to their location, they are busy throughout the year. I have been a regular here since childhood and will continue to be so.

Located a couple of minutes walk through the traders Assembly saree shop, is a well known and popular food joint in Gariahat; Puja times be Bedwin nights,fully jampacked with the shop at its pick time; Rates are a fav for college people or among youngsters as they are pretty much pocket friendly !

They have two shops located side by side, one serving veg,the other one serving non veg platters; They too have the option of takeaway and dine(outside or inside sitting both),; Serving both normal food, chinese, nepalese,mughal cuisines like rolls, noodles, fried rice, chili chicken,biryani,chanp, mughlai,momo,etc; They have a sort of dessert palour too !

I, having been visiting this place since my childhood days ,with both families and friends; The quality of food is pretty top notch; The fried rice and chili chicken are pure bliss, belly filling option for a couple of bucks; Somethings which need to be improved is the hygiene part clubbed with the quantity of few overpriced food as well as the quality of those !!! Anyways the rolls too are good !!!

Keep up the good work !!!

This restaurant was the first of the Bedwins to open in Kolkata. They have been serving the people of this city for a long time now. The place is very convenient to locate with ample car parking space available (a luxury in our city these days). Well the ambience and the service is nothing great... just decent enough. Coming to the food...they serve the Bengali concoction of Chinese and Mughlai dishes.... again decent enough to leave one with a good taste in the mouth. Have tried out most of their items... From rolls to Chowmein to Biryani etc. The standard has remained more or less the same for the entire duration of their existence. Well,  in the end, I can surely say that Bedwin will be around for long.....

A real value for money restaurant. If you wish to enjoy authentic mughlai cuisine at a reasonable pricing in South Kolkata , I would recommend to visit Bedwin. The serving time is much less than other comparable restaurants and also the quality of the food is nice. You have ample option to choose from their long menu. Biriyani, Kassa, Tikka are good enough. Along with these they serve various quality of Rolls. Not so oily and big chunks of chicken are just yummy. In Chinese you have rice, chowmein, Momo etc. With availability of 12 hours service and the heritage of Brand this is still one of the best place to visit for foodies.

After that whenever in garihat there has been a great probability for lil pet puja here after tiring walks and shopping done .üòâüòâüòâ
Had their egg roll and chicken roll .
Even chicken tikia roll .
They r heavy .
This is the 2nd place so far where they put potato filling in egg roll which makes it perfect for a hungry tummy.
The service is in lighting speed here. U can expect 5 roll in 5 mins of diff filling coming out. It's a aww to see how efficiently they manage .ü§òüëçüëçüëçüëç

It located near gariahat road towards Ballygunge park circus.
I tried their chicken rolls.which is quite good.
Basically,,It's a famous roll corner.
Which I don't like that is when they make the rolls,but the paratha has been made before...they don't cook your paratha for roll in front of your presence..it's already been ready ..they just took it and put the chicken stuffs into it..
Otherwise all are good..

Not much of a fan of this place. The food is mediocre to be honest, although the place has a huge following for it's rolls. I personally only love their Egg roll though with the mashed potato stuffing it tastes really good for a potato lover like me, and it's also special because you don't get this in most other roll centres in the city.

Good place to be
Liked the thali
Bt i think Chinese is speciality there
Ambiance is not that good and structure of the building is old
Still i think pocket friendly and good to go

This place seems to have been here forever. I have been having the rolls here since I was a child. I especially love the chicken tikia roll and the egg roll here. The mashed potatoes inside the egg roll make it different from other roll joints. It's a tiny but great joint,serving delicious rolls at pocket friendly prices. The goodwill of this shop can be made out clearly by the number of people always flocking here for the rolls :-). The service is also quite fast.

After climbing a bunch of stairs of an old building, you finally get to enter the restaurant section of Bedwin. The air-conditioned restaurant area is big and there are sufficient number of tables to accommodate large crowds. The restaurant is best for afternoon and evening visits, so I happened to visit them one afternoon.

Coming to food, Bedwin is more famous for North Indian preparations, but they do serve Chinese as well. The food I ordered was Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Pepper Salt and Chili Chicken. Chicken Fried Rice was very average, rice grains were large and the dish failed to trigger any taste. Chicken Pepper Salt was descent, shredded chicken pieces tasted tangy. Chili Chicken was a disaster, it was just YUCK! tasted overly sweet, or I should say tasteless. The dish was overly filled with gravy¬† which was again tasteless, no signs of spices anywhere. Oh and yes, I also ordered a Fresh Lime Soda at the very last minute (reason for which explained below)

Pricing is a bomb considering the bad quality of food. They charge taxes @ 20.5%, so a bill for two would easily shoot above ‚Çπ900. Quantity is good, one plate of Fried Rice is sufficient for two, same goes with gravy and appetizers.

Ambiance is noisy, Bedwin is not the type of restaurant you would want to visit for a relaxing dinner with your family. Good for chit-chatting lunch with friends. A bonus advice, don't take tables too close to the counter (on the right side after entering) as there they cut onions and other veggies which will eventually hurt your eyes (my poor experience). Cutlery were all non standardized and cheap quality ones. 

Service was not that good, waiters were non efficient. The food came after waiting for almost 25 minutes or so. Don't even think of having regular water as it is dirty. When the waiter filled my glass, something small fell out from the jug. I did not drink the water after that and decided to order a Lime Soda instead.

Overall very bad experience to sum it up. Maybe I would try their North Indian preparations, but Chinese, never again!

This place hosts many of my childhood memories. Came here for a number of times with my parents. Didn't visit this place in a while. We used to have kathi rolls here or a very weird combination of biryani with chilli chicken. Don't know how is this place doing now, but I remember, that time when the dining out options were limited we used to love this place and frequented often.

This joint is divided into two separate stalls. The outside one sells rolls only. The inside one, sells stuff like momos , chilli chicken chow mein etc.

People flock here for lack of options may be, but their rolls suck. Taste wise okayish, quantity wise- nope.

What sucks more is their momos and chili chicken and chow mein combo. Two pieces of Chili chicken is served with a plate of haka noodles. Disgusting in taste.

If you are in Calcutta this the place to have authentic kati rolls. Quite pocket friendly. The egg chicken rolls are mouth watering. For vegetarians don't be dissapointed go for the aloo tikka roll that is probably one of their specialities.

Lack of both good quality food and the mere presence of an ambiance, warrants such low ratings. Although the mughlai dishes are palatable, the Chinese food spells disaster! Stodgy rice was a big let down. I wonder why they even feature a Chinese menu! The dingy stuffy place can barely be called a restaurant. So the whole experience was disappointing.

Visited this place in December last year on a special occasion with a friend. We ordered the mixed noodles and chilli chicken along with soft drinks. It was very well prepared and noodles had the perfect balance of veggies,chickens,prawns and fried eggs. But the mood got spoilt when I discovered a hair strands in my noodles. I brought it to the notice of the server but the guy was like nothing has happened and it's okay and normal stuff. Disappointed. The points goes only for the good and tasty food.

Never really liked anything here other than their rolls. Famous for their legendary rolls, and rightly so, these ones used to be in the same league as Nizam's. I still remember how my father used to take me here occasionally to bite into some of their rolls. The same ares still good, although there has been a substantial degradation in the quality.

‚ô¶ Food quantity is quite satisfying.
‚ô¶ Bedwin rolls are a special mention. Specially the tikka rolls. Though that's in a separate location.
‚ô¶ My fav picks are Chicken chap, and kebabs.
‚ô¶ Not much fond of their biryani. Bcz clearly we have better biryani places.

Taste and quality of the items are a bit above average. But the cleanliness and the behaviour of the staff destroys it all. One must try a take away here rather than their dine-in options. As usual their rolls are something that one must give a try at least once as it tastes different and on the better side.

The waiter advised us to take peas pulao in Indian cuisine and our experience was horrible.. Kebabs were okay.. After that we didn't visit again.. But rolls available in counter was good..

I took a Special Chicken Biriyani for Parcel. First of all I had known this place from one of my friend, and one day we had roll also. That was too good. Chicken Tikka Roll it was.
So coming back The Biriyani consisted of 1 Potato 1 Egg and 2pcs Chicken(which was quite a solid piece). The rice quantity was more than enough. Enough for 2 people. Though it's a bit spicy but it tastes real good. I loved it. Served and having eaten it hot tastes better or else it kinda gets dried up.

Best for snacks particularly it's variety of rolls. Kebabs are satisfactory and they lack pudina-dhaniya chutney served in other restaurants. Good option for on budget people.

I cannot speak for the rolls Bedwin is so famous for as I've never tried one, but when it comes to dining, I must say. Engage. With. Caution.

On this year Saptami, we entered Bedwin only because Kimli had a huge queue. Bedwin, surprisingly, was almost empty. Makes you question the state of the restaurant right there, doesn't it? Anyway, we entered expecting nothing but found that the food was not half bad.

During the puja times the menu was shortened anyway. Along with that, the waiter told us that nothing apart from Roomali Rotis will be available. Disheartened, as we really wanted Tandoori Roti and Kulcha, our order in was 4 Roomali Rotis, 1 Chicken Boti Kebab, and 1 Chicken Begum Bahar.

Kebabs arrived first, and they were, well, excellent. Beautifully cooked with a lovely charr. Even the mint chutney served with it was excellent. Almost immediately, the rotis and the chicken were served. This caused the rotis to turn cold and leathery in the AC by the time we started eating them. The begum bahar was pretty ordinary. Seemed like a simple chaanp gravy in which the kebab pieces were thrown in.

Along with all this, the service was pretty bad. We could see the waiters paying more attention to larger groups than us. Also, they were constantly hurrying us even though more than half the place was empty.

I don't exactly remember the bill, but it was around 550. Not coming back again if I can help it.

Please try this place only if ur very hungry and need a roll. It was late and we wanted to pack some food so thought of Biriyani and Chap as the safest option. We ordered two plates of Biriyani and two chicken chaaps. Firstly they were unsure if they have two plates of Biriyani then they confirmed they can. Now comes the best part they actually tossed plain rice with Biriyani to increase the quantity . It was tasteless,  oily & they added a chaap chicken to make it chicken Biriyani.  Coming to the chaap it was pink and raw inside with a tasteless char magaz gravy floating in oil. Clearly they didn't bother a least about the food. Stay away if u don't want to waste money and fall sick. AVOID!!!!!

Its a surprise when you find a place which serves you equally good mughlai and chinese food! Have been here umpteen times and it never displeasures us! The biriyani and chicken chaap was cooked perfectly in Kolkata style. In chinese, I loved the mixed fried rice, noodles, the spicy pork, schezwan chicken the most.

Is it possible to give a rating of below 1??? I guess not, hence have to stick to 1. The experience was the worst I've had so far in Kolkata. It was 10:20 at night when I went there for take away. I was informed only Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap was avbl. Ordered for 2 plates of Chicken Biriyani, 2 plates of Chicken Chaap and 2 Tandoori Roti's. 

When we sat down to have food at home, imagine our surprise, anguish and frustration to see the chicken pieces undercooked. Well, undercooked would be an understatement; the meat was raw - it was pink inside, no seasoning at all and absolutely yucky to taste. Even my 4yr old and 9yr old sons refused to have the meat. The Biriyani tasted as if some plain rice was added to the existing Biriyani and fried in plain oil. There was no flavor of Biriyani whatsoever.

I understand it might have been late and they were short of resources, but they should've been honest and said so instead of trying to feed us that crap. They lost a genuine loyal customer and more future business in trying to earn that extra money that 1 day.

Bedwin is one of my favorite roll corners in Calcutta. I must visit this whenever I go to my opthalmologist in Dover Lane or gariahaat.
To me, Bedwin serves the best tikia roll & plain roll in the city. Their amazing recipe, makes the veg rolls yummy also!

Please try this place only if ur very hungry and need a roll. It was late and we wanted to pack some food so thought of Biriyani and Chap as the safest option. We ordered two plates of Biriyani and two chicken chaaps. Firstly they were unsure if they have two plates of Biriyani then they confirmed they can. Now comes the best part they actually tossed plain rice with Biriyani to increase the quantity . It was tasteless,  oily & they added a chaap chicken to make it chicken Biriyani.  Coming to the chaap it was pink and raw inside with a tasteless char magaz gravy floating in oil. Clearly they didn't bother a least about the food. Stay away if u don't want to waste money and fall sick. AVOID!!!!!

Is really I had been there in BEDWIN.. Uff.. You really want to read the review.. Yup I m positively giving a negative review.. First of all whole day Barrish.. Then this BEDWIN. First off all a "Bekar" ambience I had ever seen .. Then they never know the table etiquettes.. A single waiter.. Its the place only where u gets STARTERS after your MAIN course.. Nw something about the food.. Its hilarious.. U cant bite the pieces of mutton may be a rubber band is softer than that.. They cant even segregate between which is Botti kabab and Reshmi kabab.. They think both are same.. May be for them.. Okk now something about Paneer butter masala.. Where the taste of butter must be dominated.. And in here u only getting the taste of Ginger and Garlic and you may smell raw oil too.. If u really knows about food.. Nw lachha paratha.  May be its not lachha paratha you may called it as lachha papad.. Might be its not enough to stop here.. But I m ending it here.. Plz dont ever think to eatout there..

Any trek in Gariahat is incomplete without polishing off a couple of rolls in either Bedouin or bang opposite Nawab,which is a personal favourite.
I follow Bedouin from the times they were just a shop selling rolls and all the aura of Sher E Bengal multiple outlets had not engulfed them.Even then their roll was not a favourite but many a times I had it anyway,when accompanying my mom on the periodic sale which Gariahat is famous for.What I did prefer is the mutton tikia,small kababs which combined with roomali roti or paratha were a mean twosome with bites of green chiili.I get a little intimidated by the elaborate menu now but found out today that their roll still carries a punch....thankfully!!!!!

I loved this place.. my first encounter with roll was here.. nd since then i have been a fan of bedwin tht too the one in gariahat. Now a branch is there in nagarbazar too.. Bedwin introduced me to the world of the "laccha parathas" drapped in chicken/fish/mutton famously known as Rolls in kolkata.. mind you,no other ordinary paratha,it has to be a laccha paratha.. They served some unbeatable Rolls..but unfortunately with time quality degraded and cuz of that my visits too. I hope it improves the quality and becomes the best.

One of the has been of the good restaurants in the city. Now stands at a basic availability store in a good locations.
The biriyani is ok....nothing too special about it and neither is it inedible. But the mutton chaanp is really lacking the conviction of being called a properly enjoyable dish.
The rolls are good enough and quite simple that's it.

This place is nostalgic. I used to eat here as a kid when there was less competition in the city for Biryani. They used to make good biryani and kebabs but what i liked the most is the Mutton tikiya along with some roomali rotis. It was heavenly believe me. I dont like the chinese here. And i have no idea how is the food now. The review is based on my childhood experiences

This outlet is just a stone's throw away from where I live, and naturally from time to time have ordered food from here for home delivery. Even some years back there were people who used to worship their biriyani and kebabs and used to swear by them, but with time, the quality of their food has deterioted along with the taste.
Honestly haven't been inside for more than fifteen years, but from time to time have ordered their food, what I still like about them is of course their chicken rolls, the paratha is nice and crunchy,perfectly fried with good seasoning and nicely diced chunks of chicken marinated in masala, I usually skip the ketchup and onions! The rolls are really good and if here one should not miss these ! I have never tried their chinese dishes but their mutton biriyani and chicken chap is rather good, nothing great though. The age old signature dishes like chicken tandoori needs to be corrected a little more, I find them rather hard and dry.
Bedwin is a brand by now, having many outlets in different parts of the city, I genuinely feel with some effort, it can go back to it's glory days, also the restaurant just needs a facelift, the age old interiors is just way too boring. Located in a good area just very near to golpark, they should seriously stop taking their customers for granted, and do some serious reinvention.

I've been to this restaurant many a times but without being biased I have to admit that lately the quality has deteriorated. The rolls have certainly gotten a lot of hype but the other ¬†food items also taste good. Once my chicken item smelled bad. It seemed that they had given stale food in spite of me being their old attender. From then I ask them what will be good to order or what is the best available dish. This works out. So I've a mixed feeling regarding Bedwin.¬†

It's a very pocket friendly restaurant ¬†and often serves good food but enter at your own risk. :)

Once it served the meatiest rolls in South Kolkata. At present, others have emulated the model and gone better. But the one thing Bedwin never ch he's is to serve chicken roll without any tomato sauce. They seem to be particularly adamant about it. And when most of the city believed that rolls cannot exist without tomato sauce, it was a really bold step. But it paid off well and is one of the reasons why I still visit this place for my chicken roll. The meat is soft and has a unique taste. Sometimes, the paratha can be a little dry but probably most won't notice because of the overall taste.  If you have visited Gariahat you must have had roll from this place or else your experience of the busiest part of south kolkata is still incomplete.

The points are more for nostalgia and impact than ambience and food quality. Most people have confused this between with the one in Nandi street. The one here is a simple roll joint.... Which is how bedwin started....  

Chicken rolls were just rs 10 in 1998/1999 and in those early days of freedom and being able to make choices with meagre pocket money... Bedwin with its low proceed decently good rolls offered us that escape.... 
I still go there.. Stand behind a queue of new freedom seekers and office goers.... 
It's a south Calcutta landmark few give it credit for..

People die to have rolls here but I really didn't like what they serve. There is too much of oil, the parathas are almost deep fried in a huge pool of oil. But more importantly the chicken inside is less, not tasty and what they put inside is lot of onion, some capsicum and a little lemon.¬†
The output was bland and didn't taste anything special. I wouldn't visit it again. There are a million roll centers who serve rolls which taste a lot better than this. Not sure why people die for it. Either it has a name, which it is not able to live upto or people from kolkata don't know how a roll tastes. Being a kolkata boy, I know the second is not true.

Be it some branded store or simple street pick.. shopping at gariahat without 
a roll from bedwin... How about some party dinner that simply ommits the end sweet dish... incomplete isnt it.. Bedwin specially the gariahat branch makes some best roll you can get here.. The double mania is a bonus top up to the taste buds . Momos cutlets and all if not divine tastes good but rolls are like nothing but the best. Space is a factor... getting a seat during shopping season is like giving ur self a nostalgic rehersal of musical chair you played in school.Well giving ur legs a bit of pain for the delicious stuffs can be considered worth it!

Oh My God this place makes the BEST rolls in the city! I've been gorging on them since my childhood, and the taste and the quality simply doesn't falter!

A small front, they make and give you the rolls there, to stand and have. No seats, sorry. But there will always be a hoard of people crowding and pushing each other for their turn at the roll-counter. Behind the front there's a small alley and a sligtly broader room, both crowded with rickety benches and chairs, for people ordering other stuff than rolls - biriyani, chowmein (not noodles in kolkata!) and chilli chicken and etc etc.

I will speak only for the rolls though. It's what they are best in. Double egg? Wow. Double chicken? Yummy! Double egg-chicken? Whoof I can't walk home, I'm too heavy!

Simply delicious. Small roadside food joints like this keeps the street food culture of the city alive.

If you happen to take a stroll down Gariahat road on any given evening (or any other time of the day, for that matter), you'll most likely chance upon a cluster of people blocking your right of way, waiting patiently and staring in anticipation, in front of what might seem to be a quaint little take-away eatery. This would be Bedwin for you, ladies and gentlemen. 

Bedwin is known to make the finest rolls in this part of the world. Their menu boasts of a wider repertoire, but I have never seen anyone order anything else. Ever. The paratha is prepared to melt in your mouth, and the chicken or mutton filling is succulent and delectable. Oh and vegetable roll is an alien concept in Kolkata. 

The waiting time is usually short, and the price, very reasonable. Of late, however, their quality seems to have taken a slight dip. But that is no excuse to give this virtuoso a miss. In fact, to be in Gariahat, and not have a roll from Bedwin, is considered a sin in my book.

I had food from here sometime back last year. I had no idea this was on zomato, anyway moving on to a quick review. 
What to order ? 
Chowmien , chilli baby corn , garlic chicken and chicken momo. 
You can order any chowmein. I ordered egg it was well cooked ! 
Chilli baby corn is now something I found okayish. Not too great. 
Garlic chicken was good ! 
Chicken momo was also a thumbs up ! 
In conclusion if you are looking for good food when hungry you can drop in !

One of the lesser known bedwin outlets, I had been to this one, mainly because of the it's close vicinity of golpark, where I visited regularly in my schooldays.. There is not much to tell, except that their rolls are better than the other outlets, and their main course, chicken preparations and naans may disappoint you from time to time..

Well, it's an average restaurant in all aspects. Quality and taste of food, ambience, service, all average. I have tried Chicken Biryani, Chicken Bharta, peas pulao, chicken reshmi butter masala, butter nan, reshmi kebab. They may not take you to a different world but they will not disappoint you for sure. Prices are very competitive when think of their location. It will not pinch your pocket. Highly recommended for those who loves to eat out once in a while but do not want to spend a lot.

An economical place to fall back to when there's a pull at one's wallet. This one, at Gariahat, stands out tall among the other ones because of its service and the size of the bowls in which the ordered dishes are brought. However, speaking of the staff here, just like in the other outlets, they show not even a trace of elegance. In addition to this, they cannot be trusted with your payment. Suppose the bill is Rs 480 and one gives a 500 rupee note, they shall bring back Rs 10 instead of Rs 20, meaning that they take their tips themselves. Recommended if, and only if, one doesn't find a suitable food joint within his/her budget.

Decent place with decent food . Price moderate. Small but comfortable . The quantity of the food is great. I had chinese once and biryani the next time. It was good. Always packed with people since the place is small and located at GARIAHAT. Therefore sometimes u might have to wait outside. If you are tired and hungry after shopping and wanted to have some good food you can come to this place without hesitation .

Roll is street-food originating from Kolkata, India. "Egg roll" refers to a fried egg wrapped inside a paratha  fried flat-bread. Bedwin   serves good egg rolls and I really love it. The food is hygienic and the ingredients are standard. Slightly expensive than other street shops serving rolls. There are other varieties of Rolls

This is one of the fast food centers that i have been visiting for the last 15-16 years, since my early school days. There's a strange nostalgic connect with this shop. There too many memories associated with this shop. 
I haven't ever tried out the dine-out section so won't review on that, rather will write only about the roll section. I have tried out most of their rolls and believe me, they are just delicious. The rolls are made right in front of you and the aroma will increase your appetite to a great extent. The bald man standing in front of the shop is a great guy and is very polite. 
Do have the double egg chicken roll and the egg potato roll. They are great. Also, the parathas are nicely fried and that surely increases the taste quotient...!!

Yes, a place that has great rolls to offer, I usually have the special chicken roll or the egg-chicken one. The don't pu sauce into the rolls and yet they taste divine. If you are in the area, do try the rolls. In the main course, they have a very good tandoori platter. The biriyani is not excellent and quantity was a bit less as well. Yet, it is better restaurant than the others in the area. My advice, do try out the rolls if nothing else.

Once it was a good place to eat. But now it is just a nightmare. Apart from the biriyani, nothing here attracts so much. The walls are hardly decorated with just a large mirror, the waiters are dull, and there is not much gap between the chair and table. One has to learn aerobics in order to move smoothly in and out of their seat. Its very strange that once a great place to eat with family and friends has now become quite unattractive.

**Location-> It is located at Gariahat Road, near Golpark.

**Brief -> I have tried mostly their rolls, including egg,chicken and my favourite special chicken roll :) Havent tried their dine out section, so wont review on that.

**Ambience -> A small outlet(the roll section) with the hot rolls being prepared in front of you.

**Food -> The rolls they make are special to your taste buds. They have always been famous for their boiled potato fillings in the rolls. Though the quality has degraded much in the last 4-5 years. I have my maternal uncle's house at gariahat and we used to try out their rolls everytime I used to visit. 
I still feel the Spcl Chicken Roll is a delight amongst the rest. They are served hot,spicy and with succulent chicken pieces. The paratha of the roll is nicely fried and is pretty oily :D

**Purse Check -> The rolls here cost around Rs.30/- to Rs.50/-. So I would say Rs.100/- shall be enough for one person to satisfy his hunger for spicy rolls :) They serve fast, which is a plus point. But during the evening(busy hours), one needs to wait for their order :)

Recommended :)

Compared to Iceberg in Gariahat, the rolls at Bedwin are definitely better but yeah for some reason or the other they don't put any kinda sauce inside their rolls. The regular ones like plain chicken roll etc. might taste a bit drier because of this. But the egg chicken rolls are damn good.  This used to be one of my favorite haunts around 4-5 years ago and I remember the man at the stall was very polite and friendly with us. We played a prank on one of our friends by asking him to put extra chillies in her chicken roll .. to which he initially didn't agree because he thought the reputation of his shop would be at the stake after that :P but had to comply finally on our repeated coaxing LOL. Located bang next to the huge old book stalls at Gariahat .. this place draws many a college students and office goers everyday.

Bedwin has been famous for its rolls for many years but sadly the Lake Gardens Branch took a downward dive when I last tried it. I then decided to try another branch out because I used to really enjoy these rolls once upon a time. We ordered a regular Chicken Roll and a Tikia Roll since I had gone with a friend and though it was a bit better than the Lake Gardens outlet I was not too excited by it  .... very average experience.

The ambience is also very good suited to both families/friends and couples.

There is  a huge reason why I am going to give Bedwin a 3/5 although the food I ordered was tasty. We were four people and we were hungry, and  assuming we would get hungry through the night we decided to eat something at the spot and pack some food for the night. I went for the chicken biryani at that point, and decided to pack a chicken chaap and 2 rumali rotis for later. My friends ordered the same for themselves with varying number of rotis, and between us we split 2 reshmi kababs at that point. The reshmi kabab was tasty, freshly made, and we liked it a lot. Same went for the biryani. We really liked the soft potato, chicken and nicely done rice. The service was fast, although the place could do with a cleaning up.

However, we came back, put our food in the fridge so that it would not be spoiled till we ate it. However, when I took out the package of chicken chaap I found a very thick, solid layer of dalda on top of it. Yuck! I was quite repelled by it, and had to dispel off it mostly, and although tasty, I still shudder to think of the amount of dalda that went into whatever we ate.

I came across this place with recommendation from somebody. At first look, I was bit dejected by its appearance at the entrance; which very much questions your conscience before stepping-in. 

Voila ! I was correct. The place inside even looks totally unhygienic and the management should pay attention to it. In addition to its congested seating arrangement, the ambiance looks pathetically dull. The service is bit sluggish and the staff looks moderately trained. But wait ! Here is the turn around ‚Äì the food.

We ordered Mughlai (as we were recommended by others), and didn't think it would be a good idea to order Chinese from this place. May be next time, huh ? Well, the Tandoori Chicken was really amazing; and I would say, better than most of the established Mughlai joints in the city. The Chicken Biryani was good, but not that great.

Overall, I would prefer home-delivery instead of dine-in.

You will get according to your expectations from this low cost restaurant. Bedwin is a very standard restaurant that serves north Indian dishes. The rolls are good and used to be my staple food after coaching classes in Gariahat when I was at school. But that was years ago. Recently i found out that the quality and taste of the rolls have degraded to a great extent. Still if you want something to be recommended from here it will be the chicken roll. The biriyani and other dishes are pretty average here. There are better places in Gariahat. So you can bid this place a goodbye.

Was a biryani hotspot before Arsalan's and Zeeshan's age. Now their biryanis are no longer a hit.
But when it comes to rolls and kebabs, this place has still got its charm. 
            
                                                     You get the aroma of the delicious dishes being cooked, from outside the restaurant. Cheap and delicious chicken rolls, tikka rolls, etc makes this place a favourite haunt for school students, office goers and shoppers who throng this place ever so often.

The air from Bedwin Restaurant will tickle your senses invariably as you leaf through the used book stores at Golpark. It would be a smart decisionat at this point to go inside and order some food. First and foremost go for the rolls that bedwin is famous for. The chicken roll is what chicken roll should be like and the value for money that you receive even from a veg roll will amaze you. The menu is nothing out of the ordinary filled as it is with popular fast food options like chili chicken and Egg Tadka. Steer clear of the Chinese. Once Bedwin was the first of its type, a small chain of food joints across the city offering good foof at affordable prices. This particular type of establishments have since then flourished. 

Chakraborty Tip : Do NOT go inside for a sit and eat. The first floor seating area is crampy as well as poorly lit and in between getting jostled by other customers, won't be a nice experience.

This place has always been famous for its rolls. A shopping experience in gariahat is incomplete without a roll from their counter. But when it comes to fine dining,you should rather stay away. I won't say the food is bad,it's average street food like,their noodles,chicken preps,everything. Only once have i dared enter this place,that too coz i was low on money,and it's the ambience which i didn't like at all. Well you can always opt for take away from here! 2.5 from me,that too solely for their rolls.

Its one of those value for money food counters which are found all over Kolkata with the ever so common menu of Rolls, Chowmein, Chilli chicken et al. I have never been to this place and my acquaintance with their food is through my dad who sometimes brings home food from this place while returning from work.
Their egg roll is pretty decent and worth eating though the same cannot be said about the other items on the menu. The Chinese boneless side dishes are a sham really! You will find hardly any meat in the large dumplings. They should consider renaming them Cornflour side dishes......
Then their chowmein is far too oily and you would have to search for the vegetables if you expected any in the first place..
But one thing that you got to give them credit for is their portions of food which are very generous and filling...
Order from this place only if you are ravenously hungry and don't care much for the quality of food...

Bedwin is the quintessential fast-food place. It is a no-nonsense place that does not have an air about it, the decor is average and the service mostly muted - though quick, although that is more due to the kitchen, I believe.
The food is above average but not something to talk about. I personally favour the Mughlai dishes more over the Chinese. The variety on the menu is also substantially better for the Indian section than the Oriental spread. The location is its prime positive, and it banks on the inflow of running customers looking for a quick bite rather than dedicated foodies who are coming here for the food. It is also reasonably priced, which is one of the main attractions.

Verdict: Food that is reasonably tasty, at comfortable prices at a fantastic location. If you're nearby, you might just want to drop in.

my first visit to this place was when i was hardly 8 or 10 years old. that fond memory of having bedwin's mutton roll while sitting inside our car parked below the then newly built gariahat flyover will continue to linger around. 

bedwin is famous for their rolls and trust me they are truly worth the fame. their rolls are filling with the exact spices and a tinge of lemon over perfectly cooked chicken or mutton. i would not suggest their plain egg rolls for foodies of kolkata. it's a waste to try their chicken chap which comes with a thick gravy cooked in dalda. rather you can try their chicken bharta with rumali roti. 

the worst thing about the place is that it is overcrowded. moreover, they donot empty their dustbins from time to time which litters the footpaths. a request to all who visit the place, please throw your roll papers only in the dustbins.

I had visited here on a winter afternoon and ordered rumali roti and chicken chap. I think they had put too much dalda (vanaspati) in the chap and as I was eating the food, the gravy started forming a cake with yellowish vanaspati clearly visible. It was clearly disapponting.

I am a fan of their rolls though which they serve through a counter just outside the restaurant. My particular favorite is Double Egg Chicken roll. The parathas are well prepared, the chicken put inside is cooked well with onions and capsicum, and the masalas they add are also pretty good. I would recommend the rolls but not the restaurant food. 

The counter is normally crowded and you may need to wait awhile to get served, but it is worth the wait.

Food: 3/5
Ambiance: 2/5
Service: 3/5
Value for money: 3/5

It is a very nice restaurant located amidst the market of Gariahat. I have visited there 4 to 5 times. You get Mughlai and Chinese dishes there.

Ambience is okay and sitting arrangent is divided into three to four floors that means sitting arrangement is on all the floors. But on sundays,, its packed up. service is too slow and only the downside. Staffs are well. Quantity is also immense.

Food quality is good. I like their Tengri kabab, Chicken Chaap and Butter Naan. Fish Butter masala is also a nice one. In soups, i like the tomato soup. They need improvement in some cases like cleanliness and hygiene. 

I would rate 3.5 for BEDWIN.

The thing about bedwin is that you can have a dig in if you are shopping in Gariahat. 
The thing about quality is that it can be far better. You cannot hope for a smacky-lip food out here.
The quantity is quite wholesome if you are one those typical foodies who like eating upto the heart's content.

The lookover onto the streets of Gariahat is worth mentioning though the foliage plays a spoil-sport to this view.
The place needs cleaning and the staffs a litle more presentable.

Bedwin is as familiar as Traffic Jam or Bandh in Kolkata. It has been there as an epitome of fast food for years. The food quality - does it matter? When you are hungry and street shopping near Gariahaat, you look for a Bedwin.. and that is where it has own the heart of Kolkatans. However, the issue here is not tradition but the quality of food..so I can't help giving it 3/5. But at the same time, the best part of Bedwin is that like many other food joints, they have not changed the quality of food. The quality is still the same I tasted probably 15 years back.

I will entirely agree with mainak in this regard that bedwin has many areas to improve but its like it has stopped growing up. The quality of food is quite good according to it's price. I tried both chinese and indian cuisines over here and indian foods are really good. Chinese are not that bad also. 
Chicken tengri kabab, mutton chap, mutton biriyani, these items in bedwin are better than most other restaurants in south kolkata. It serves quality food with a reasonable price but if it comes to ambiance and mordenization, it will not be counted. Bedwin needs to improve it's service, ambiance, menu card as soon as possible.

One of the oldest places in south kolkata to dine. Very good Indian cuisine. You will get the traditional biryani of old Calcutta served with a piece of mutton/chicken, potato, egg. The butter masala and the curry items are good too. Service is quite okay. But the only drawback is, like many other old restaurants of calcutta, it could not keep up with time. There is no upgradation or modernization of the place and looks quite untidy. Lots of areas where it can improve, cleanliness and hygiene being the front runner.
