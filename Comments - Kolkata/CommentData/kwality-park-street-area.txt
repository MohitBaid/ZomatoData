This place is situated jus between bar b q n the park ..one of the famous places to be.. Though I visited this place on Christmas so I found the place extremely crowded.. It's a typical dimly lit place.. Coming to the food, the quantity is quite less compared to the price...quality is so so.. Overall an average place..

This restaurant is one of the greats from times bygone, famous for its Indian dishes, I must have visited after a break of 15-20 years. I had been asking my friend where I could get a good Veg sizzler in and around park street and he recommended the place. Well, it was a decent dish, like old times, but not something I would come back for. There has been no innovation done, I have had better sizzlers elsewhere with refinement in the recipe. I feel if you want a taste of old times, this is a good place to try. The ambiance is also so-so, very forgettable. 

This place has not moved with times, still sticking to the receipts and ambiance which made it a legend two decades back, it works for them as the place is still packed with long waiting lines most of the days. I feel in the restaurant business continues drive for improvement is needed, Kwality has gone stagnant for my taste.

Located at Park Street this is one of the oldest restaurants. It serves both North Indian and Chinese predominantly North Indian. In my visit I had tried their Reshmi kebab, Chicken Tandoori kebab. The main course portions are a bit less compared to the price, but in a nut shell the experience was good. It can always be tried atleast once.

I don't understand why this restaurant is negatively rated.
I went with my friends on 25th december 2017 for lunch and we were not disappointed. After a quite short wait we ordered and the food was there within 35 mins while we drank and had our starters. 
All items we ordered tasted delicious and the service was nice and clean. Btw we ordered all non veg.
We were 5 people in total and the bill amounted to Rs3700 which is around Rs700 per person including alcohol which was very reasonable for the amount we ordered.
Decor had nostalgic and fine touch which was perfect.
Overall-4.5/5 for me.

Kwality used to reflect the essence of Park Street restaurants - great food, great ambiance and to top it off, excellent service. But this Christmas, I think i had one of the worst dining experience of my life which was embarassing to say the least. 

Like most restaurants on the strip, Kwality too was fully booked and we had to wait to be seated. The wait was short as we were soon offered a seat. 

As the part of the meal we had Smirnoff, lime soda and Pineapple punch. The drinks were good and set the tone for the meal... Untill the rest arrived. 

Stuffed tangri, Veg Gold Coin, Chicken Sizzler, Masala Kulcha, Murg Bharta were the items on order and sadly each and every item raised the disappointment meter higher. Stuffed Tangri was falling apart. Veg gold coin was like a huge bread ball stuffed with cute lil veggies and served with a truckload of uncle chips. Sizzler gravy was disastrous and the bharta was really unworthy of being plated. 

The wait staff is an ageing group and the service reflects it. They are slow, spill food while serving and describe the dish given wrongly. 

One thing truely consistent about the food was that every dish was bland. All that for INR 2265/- and i feel a lil cheated

I honestly feel I have paid my last visit here.

The signature dishes of quality are spinach rice, paneer butter masala, chicken bharta, roasted chicken and malai kofta.¬†

This is the worst place I have ever been to.
Food quality and service sucks.
This restaurant should be a never visit for non-veg lovers.
Even basic veg. Items like butter panneer, naan, tandoori roti were below average in taste.
Value for money is 0 both in terms of quality and quantity.
It's better to go for  a dhaba, or street food than wasting your bucks at such place

Well, this was my second visit in 3 decades forget childhood visits, I went to this place and that too to savour the famous Sizzlers and was not enthused by the preparation and found it to be very average. Of all the things, why did it have a pineapple piece as a stuffing and that too over cooked?

Though the restaurant seemed to be renovated especially for me coz I went there after a long long time, but was still disappointed to find it a non family place. There was just one table that had a family of four seated with 2 women. Disappointed! My daughter was the only child in the restaurant and that‚Äôs when I realised, this place will never mature to grow up to be a family place. It‚Äôs a sophisticated Theka if I may call it.

To me it was strange that the stewart really encouraged us to have the chana which is apparently again very famous and my wife suggested to taste it too, I should say at this point that Mission Cafe ka chana beats it in all regards from taste to perfect cooking. 

It‚Äôs like one of those flop Bollywood movies of the 80s which if it had even one thing striking, it would stay down well in your memory and would cherish it always. For many it just has that one connection of the past.

The waiters are utterly inhospitable, they stand near the billing counter and the adjacent bar counter and shout away to glory while glasses rattle, bottles crackle and others croak at each other. 

For me it didn‚Äôt work well and is a complete No No. 

I am so amazed to write that the restaurant is not named as ‚ÄúQuality‚Äù.

In chilli chicken small pieces of chickens were fired with beson. Taste was not that good as expected in the restaurant. Cost of the food is very high compared to the quantity and quality of the food.

An iconic restaurant on Park Street that is very popular for its North Indian and Punjabi cuisine, both veg and non veg. The food is tasty and with robust flavours. I particularly like their chana bhatura, which is a humongous puri and along with that they serve black pindi chole. The chole is soft and packed with flavours.Awesome ...not to be missed. The place is generally too crowded and thus very noisy. But the food is good.

Waiters need to be taught service. When you order they will bring food, and in our case 3 of them stood there staring what and how we ate, probably waiting for us to order main course. When I did prder main course, they brought it before starters were over, only to serve us cold food in main course. And while we having main course, they stood there giggling and staring. Please teach your staff basic manners. Used to be a favorite place since childhood, but after this incident I am probably not visiting Kwality ever again. Thumbs down!

The interior of the hotel is pleasant with British influence, the lighting on the upper tier was a bit too dull, color of the food was hardly visible.
I had Indian and Mughlai food, the taste was a bit unique and unique was good. The only con in the cuisine was Biryani, it was not at all Biryani and trust me i know my Biryanis well. It was more like Akhni Pulao.
Over all the services were fair enough, rate pretty decent accourding to the area.
PS: If you are a Biryani lover then please don't visit this place

The quantity in the spring roll was not all satisfying! The taste,no doubt was delicious. We proceeded with Pindi Chana,Chicken Bharta,Malai Kofta,Panner Butter Masala.Other than the Bharta everything was up to the mark.Chicken looked a lil less cooked in the dish. We ordered for mocktails & hard drinks as well.I am satisfied overall & definitely coming again! Cheers üç∫

If there's one word to describe this place it would be "OVER-HYPED". Since it's attached to the park hotel building I think you expect a certain amount of elegance and quality from this place (more so since it's name hints at Quality) but you'll be disappointed. The tables are cramped into a small place leaving barely enough space for people to pass. The staff is neither friendly nor very courteous. The food is just average with above average pricing. There's really nothing that stood out for me and I'd definitely not recommend this place to anyone.

I had ordered a plate of chilly chicken which was nothing different than a street side stall.perhaps it would have been better at the streetside stall.quality of rice was horrible. And sizzler was the foul of the day..over all a waste of money and a waste of time. But their price tags in the menu seemed to me like they are just the price of a streetfood but having it on park street.

We had walked in for a late lunch. The staff were super curt which was really nice to see. But the food was disappointing. We had ordered aloo Gobi but got aloo mutter. When we wanted to raise the issue no one really was around so we (being super hungry) just started eating as it didn't matter. The tandoori roti was dry and wasn't hot enough. My friend who had chicken biriyani were also a little disappointed with the food as they did say that the flavour and spices  were on the lower side. The only perfect thing on our table that day was the sweet lime juice! Ambience was a little old (am assuming that it's a pretty old restaurant) and a bit too dull for comfort.

The food was decent with pindi chana being the standout dish. The soups were way below par. We asked them to change it but even after they did it was not any better. The table was quite small given the number of people. A pretty average experience overall. Looking forward to better outings here.

Used to be one of the best in park street but its not that special anymore.it still will give you the legendary feeling but thats not enough to me..they serve a very limited variety of food..the foods are ok but not to die for.Service is good but not great..One time visit is ok.

Russian Salad @ Kwality, Park Street, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Being originally created by Lucien Olivier, Russian Salad is also known as Olivier Salad. Primarily comprising of diced vegetables and mayonnaise dressing, it is a traditional salad dish in the Russian Cuisine.

In our day-to-day life, Russian Salad has kind of a permanent place on the buffet tables of restaurants and banquets. 

Recently, an associate visited Kwality and we asked him to get us their Russian Salad.

The chilled salad came packed in an aluminium foil tub. It comprised of parboiled fine choppings of carrot and beans, along with  parboiled peas and chunks of canned pineapples. The aforesaid veggies were shrouded in an abundance of creamy mayonnaise. Colorful juliennes of raw cabbage, carrot and beetroot were strewn on top for garnishing.

The veggies were well cooked and the pineapple chunks complimented the creamy salad with their sweet and tangy taste. The creamy mayonnaise also tasted fresh and nice.

We paired this Salad with butter toasts, sprinkled with pepper powder.

The quantity parcelled was more than sufficient for 2 people.

Menu Price: Rs. 175/-

Food is good. Not "Wow".
Butter chicken is too sweet. Paneer chilli is cooked in the simplest possible way.

The food is just average. I think the place has been overrated since it is one of the oldest restaurants. The waiters have a very casual approach. And the place seems very crowded most of the times

My first review in zomato and sadly this had to be Kwality.After a very long time visted a foodjoint were people working behaved like government bank employees who had no interest regarding the problems of the customers.Anyhow,things well went in the beginning untill the food was served.
We ordered for some kebabs which turned out to be very dry and tasteless.The biriyani was pathetic.It tasted nothing like a mughlai dish.Just the smell of rice and saltless.Butter roti was stiff and disgusting.For side dish we ordered reshmi butter masala(god knows why the gravy was red in colour) and mutton dahi.Both tasted the same.
Finally the chicken sizzler arrived.The dish costed 370 bucks but the quantity was so less.It had no bread served with it and to top it all 50% of the sizzler had chunks of chicken liver.I mean who serves so much of chicken liver when youare supposed to give good fillets of chicken.I had sizzlers in so many places in kolkata but one of my worst experience here.
To top this all the managers were rude,unapologitic about the whole situation and showed so much of attitude.Along with us so many other people from other tables complained but all the managment did was argued.
Must mention this that Chefs are pathetic.Its high time to replace them or shut down the place as there is 0 satisfaction after visiting here,rather you get out with total disgust.
Very very bad experience.I advise noone to visit this place.

The name is just the opposite of what they serve.. I had the most disgusting and disappointing experience ever. I went there for a Valentine's Day dinner with my friends but what was served to us was cry worthy. 
Let's start with kebabs, I have never eaten such dry and undercooked kebabs in my life. How do you even serve that on someone's plate. Then came the biriyani, sizzler, rotis, chicken reshmi butter masala and mutton dahiwala. The biriyani rice had no taste. The kabuli naan was made out of shit, the mutton n chicken dishes tasted just the same. So overall it was the most HORRIBLE experience of food of my life.
What's most disappointing is the behaviour of the staff, as if they are doing some charity on us, the manager tried to convince us that we don't know how sizzlers should be as if we don't know what fine dining experience should be
I have had food here in my childhood and that's what was our deciding factor to go there. I feel so ashmed to have even suggested a shitty restaurant like this.
The price is exorbitant for no reason, food quality and taste is just horrendous. I wonder how is this restaurant even running with such cheap product served on plates. They should add the word 'UNDER' in front of Kwality because that's exactly what they are serving right now.
Never bother yourself to even try that resturant. Honestly I felt like crying because our hard earned money was exhorted from us at gun point, the gun being the food!!

For this review i would be simple and straightforward so let me start this by saying that it was a very average experience in this much hyped eating place at park Street . Kwality is the second name after Trincas in the long chain of restaurants that stretches   from the park hotel . And just like the others, Kwality has also had its round of applause and cheers but a small dinner recently at this prestigious place made us kind of jeer after coming out of the restaurant . Let's go straight to the food to explain why .

-----------------------------------
FOOD :- Kwality does not boast in innovative dishes . Neither will you see names of the dishes that they serve well in their Zomato page . So, when the menu consists of traditional mughlai and chinese with skyrocketing prices you expect them to be at least worth the money but unfortunately it was far from it . Thus , the absence of a particular dish name made us realise that they have not been able to churn anything masterful . But still , since they are known to present authentic North Indian dishes we decided to order the same . Please note that the Zomato menu for this restaurant is not updated .

1. Fish makhmali kabaab ( 3 / 5 ) :- Donot quite remember the cost but it was around 350 . Only 5 small sized pieces of bhetki ( as the restaurant said ) were served . I know they won't serve basa if they say bhetki but still I felt that it was not bhetki . The texture was way loose so it didn't feel like bhetki . The fish was not flaky but yes it was fresh . I felt the marination could have been better to present this as makhmali kabaab . A big dissapointment was served on the table in the name of a fish kabaab .

2. Mutton burra kabaab :- I refuse to rate this kabaab because it was supposed to blow our mind but instead pissed us off . You must be knowing that our city does it boast a lot of calibre in serving mutton kabaab.  The closest you can get is the mutton seekh kabaab and that is minced . Mutton burra kabaab is a delicacy that if served properly can make your day . You will be familiar with this by the name of adrak ke panje served in some restaurants . Anyways, there were 4 burnt mutton ribs portions . Yes, " burnt " . So much burnt that the meat was already spoiled so and we ended up licking the burnt ribs . So much for serving authentic North Indian cuisine . 

3. Butter garlic naan ( 3.5 / 5  ) :- Nothing extraordinary here but it was not catastrophic as the kabaabs . 

4. Chicken makhaani ( 3 / 5 ) :- Or the Indian butter chicken or the original orange gravy . Whatever you name it , this is the most basic chicken dish that goes with the naan or the roti . And guess what , once again they were simply ordinary . Once again 5 pieces of boneless small sized chicken were served in the platter with the orange gravy which seemed quite basic . Nothing extraordinary , with Malai on top the dish went okay with the naan and still we were expecting a little more .

------------------------------

¬∞ VERDICT :- Below are the reasons why you should overlook this veteran over hyped restaurant whenever you are walking by . 

1. Way too overpriced for the ordinary dishes that are served .
2. The quantity is horrendous .
3. The kabaabs are a failure . A more apt destination would be esplanade .
4. Most of the audience are drinkers and to our surprise some of them became quite loud .

When we talk of park Street we normally do not talk about the best of food but a lifestyle . Lifestyle as in servers wearing turbans and being extra cautious in serving you food . There is an air of aristocracy in every dining places that you visit but you will rarely be served bad food . This was a rare negative experience and inspite of recommending this restaurant I still wish them all the best because they are one of the.oldies and deserve to bounce back .

Food - This is a restaurant i frequent often, as my mother still loves Kwality, and this place never disappoints. The food was smashing, had the regulars, Chicken bharta with butter naan, peas pulao, baked fish and paneer. Every element of the food was impeccable and it was served at good speed. The ambiance remains the same, with added doses of nostalgia.

Another of the Park Street oldies. Visited with family. Has a rather predictable menu. Ordered Chicken Mayonnaise and Fish Mayonnaise for me and my sister, while parents ordered Peas Pulao, Chicken do Pyaza and Vegetable Malai Kofta. All of the items tasted OK, but I felt the Kofta was a bit more sweet than I liked. Service is pretty quick, interiors pretty neat as well. But they could upgrade the menu if they want a new generation of regular visitors.

The main reasons why we chose to eat at Kwality were because, we heard that the food was good and the atmosphere was festive. The ambiance was soothing. We ordered Chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken fried rice. The service was warm and the waiter was attentive to our liking towards dishes, he also suggested a few dishes to try. So we ordered a kebab platter for starters. The food was average to good which did not justify the price on the list. I felt the dishes are priced a bit higher than the similar dishes in other counterparts of Kwality in that area. I did not feel the charm that the name "Kwality" promises to offer. Nevertheless, experiences always come handy.

I had the fried fish with tartare sauce which was delicious.
Also, the chocolate sundae was well presented.

My first visit to this old restaurant, the service was good. You need to make a reservation and be on time, this was probably due to puja time. The food was good, Really nothing exceptional. We ordered chilly prawn, chicken bharta (supposedly it's speciality) , yellow dal and naan. Chilly prawn was awesome. Chinese is always the safest choice. Chicken bharta was light and good too, reminded me of soup made in chicken stock and over use of soup powder that I do at home sometimes. Dal was yummy.

Old world hospitality is on point.

When talking about legendary restaurants of Kolkata, it would be hard not to include Kwality. This place has been in business for decades.¬†

I have had countless meals here in my childhood (90s), their famed chole-bhature was a much cherished dish which we all used to look forward.

Now that the Kolkata restaurant scene has gone a sea-change, it would be a travesty to still include Kwality among the legendary restaurants.  

The legend has fallen and a very bad fall at that. Though in all fairness, I hope mine was an one-off case. 

It was my better half's bday and since we both hadnt dined-in at Kwality for a long time, we thought of visiting here instead of the tried and tested neighbouring Bar-B-Q. As it turned out, it was a very wrong decision. :-( 

Lets get to the experience straight away - 

Positives :

1. This place still has an old world charm to it. One can literally soak in nostalgia just by being here.

2. Service is still very good, the managers and waiters all very efficient and very friendly and polite. A true rarity in today's time and this is the ONLY reason I am giving it 1 rating. 

3. Prices are still VFM, where else will you get Dal Makhni (among others) for 170 bucks! Its a different matter (more below) that its mediocre at best. 

Negatives : 

1. Food quality has deterioted so badly, this place doesnt deserve to be in Park Street at all which has full of restaurants serving super delicious food.  

2. The mezzaline section is quite cramped up. 

What we ordered : 

2 Tomato Soup, Rs 145 each - Excellent, this is the kind of soup which is available everywhere in Kolkata but no where in Bangalore (where I stay). 

1 Dahi Kebab, Rs. 225 - This was usual kebab and served with Dahi dip. This is NOT Dahi Kebab by any stretch of imagination. Taste didnt justify the price. Avoidable. 

1 Dal Makhni, Rs. 170 - Insult to Dal Makhni. When a place like Kwality can mess up a basic dish like Dal Makhni, its a signal that it needs to do something about it and ASAP. Avoidable. 

1 Aloo Do Pyaaza, Rs. 185 - Very good, but very oily. On the plate after serving, one can see oil in puddles. This was apparenly their special which they had placed on a card. Can be ordered if this is the ONLY dish being served in Kolkata. 

1 Paneer Amritsari, Rs. 230 - Another special, horrible. Too oily, some particular spice, I think Methi, was too overpowering. Avoidable. 

1 Paneer Butter Masala (PBM), Rs. 220 - After a not so very good experience with the above dishes and also that the quantity was less among 6 of us, I thought of ordering PBM thinking it would be as heavenly as the one in Bar-B-Q. Another big mistake. It looked very white and the taste was like having Paneer in Milk. Horrible. Avoidable. 

1 Veg Raita, Rs. 115 - With nothing to eat the bread with, I had to order Raita. Saving grace. 

Mix of Bread - Kulcha, Kabuli Naan, etc. Decent but nothing great. Kabuli naan was too thin and unlike what a Kabuli Naan should be. 

Total Tab - Rs. 2882. As mentioned earlier, this place is very VFM. But not worth it at all. Way better alternative is to spend a little extra and visit other places in the vicinity. 

To Kwality Chef - You all should be ashamed of working in Kwality and serving such horrible food. Please visit Bar-B-Q, taste their food (I will gladly reimburse), learn from their chef and think of improving your food. You are doing a disservice to your own profession which is about providing happiness and satisfaction through food. 

Should you visit? Absolutely and vehemently NO. 

Real estate is not cheap in Park Street and Kwality is blocking space which can be better utilised by other places. Heck even Jai Hind Dhaba would be a super contender to open at Park Street instead of Kwality.

Loaction-Beside oxford book store,Park street.

This restaurant is just contrary to its name and has totally changed from what it used to be few years back.Just got a chance to visit this place a few days back and was totally disappointed on visit.

Service-Service by the staff was kind of average.They served the dishes too late which may be due to crowd or staff laziness.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is too noisy.It is recatangular space which has a good seating capacity and the interiors are just very simple.

Food-The main thing which covers other faults of a restaurant was the most disappointing.We had few of the vegetarian dishes at this place and it was totally a disaster for us.The taste at this place has changed alot from what it used to be.It was equivalent to burning money.

Food-2/5
Ambiance-3.5/5
Service 3/5

Would never recommend you to visit this place.üòï

Highly disappointed after visiting the place recently. The quality of food at Kwality has gone down terribly. The shrimp/prawn cocktail was too sour and was actually more of mayonnaise cheese dip than the actual shrimps which were only very few in number. And tasted very dry. The baked fish had a strong smell of raw fish smell and was enough to make a friend of mine fall sick and puke thrice. The chicken sizzler, though slightly better had a large quantity of liver which went undercooked. To top it all the ambience was not great anymore either. The place was hot and seemed as if the ac wasn't working. On us requesting the manager and waiter to turn the stand fan on as we were quite literally sweating he just said it's not hot straight on our face and went his way. Then after our pressing more on the topic they would turn it on only to turn it off within the next 5mins. And this happens 4 times. Overall a horrible and very disappointing experience. Shame on you @Kwality.

Kwality at ballygunj was a restaurant which I used to visit frequently during my childhood days. To recapture those old memories I went to this new branch, but to my dismay it turned out to bad choice. Food was nothing spectacular. We opted for full plate chicken tandoori and I was shocked to see the size of pieces served. They served chicken wings and small size legs. Also the curry was very ordinary and the mutton pieces in curry was all bones. Not visiting again in this branch. Service is fast that is the only plus point I found.

However I had ordered a tutti frutti ice cream for dessert and it was the best tutti frutti I ever had! I would come back to this place only for their tutti frutti. Also, the service is good!

Been there almost a year ago.
Located in Park St.......It has that look from the 90's n reminded me of my childhood days!
It was quite late in the night n we were too hungry to experiment with the food.
Played safe n ordered for chicken do piyaza and tandoori roti.
The food was average in taste. While the gravy tasted good ,the chicken was chewy! Considering the price I really expected much better in terms of the quality of the food.
The service wasn't up to the mark as the place was overcrowded.
It was hot n suffocating n noisy.
Just good for a couple of visits ... that too if you r absolutely out of options!

Some say it's a legendary restaurant. I say it's a disgrace when compared to true legends it stands alongside - Mocambo, Moulin Rouge et al. Food quality is nothing extraordinary, No house specialties to talk about, Cramped chairs and over priced drinks. Visit if all other's on Park Street are full. Else stay away !!

Kwality has been quite a phenomenon for past few generations. I have heard my parents singing praises for this place. However, cut to the present, it does not stand upto its past reputation. Absolutely mediocre menu options which as per my opnion doesn't justify its price. Slow service just worsened the experience. Its unlikely for me to visit this place again, unless I am forced to!!

You cant miss out on this place if you want to try out good Indian dishes. Trust me, they have got a good menu. The Chinese menu is very limited though. Went for a lunch with family. Ordered pea pulao, vegetable malai kofta, dal makhani, vegetable noodles, chilly chicken and ice creams. A warm, cozy place for a good meal.  The decor is simple and classy. The staff is quite friendly (something that is lost by many of the good restaurants), service is good.
The location is something that attracts the crowd. Overall it was a good experience. Wouldn't hesitate to visit again. :)

We have been to Kwality numerous times and it always leaves us happy and fulfilled. One of our favorite stops for lunch / dinner here on the famous Park Street. It is just next to one of the oldest five star hotels here - The Park. ¬†It is not a huge restaurant but still has that level in Kolkata - which most of the new places do not have. The service is very good, ambiance is homely (like Bengali!). Coming to the food - Naan, Chicken, Sizzler, Rice - you name it, I have tried many of they offerings and all were good. A nice place in Cal to chill out with family. All the best!

LOCATION:

Right next to The Park Hotel on the main park street stretch.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Kwality has been around forever and is one of the institutions of Park Street. While I dare say that it does not share the same fan club as that of Barbq and Peter Cat, it does have a lot of people in the city who swear by the North Indian food here.¬†

The interiors are newly renovated. They are quite basic but at the same time have been modernized. The restaurant is mostly on the ground floor with a few tables on the mezzanine floor. The old charm of the place is still intact with some stewards who recognize me from childhood :)

WINE & DINE:

We ordered Paneer Tikka, Kali Dal, Paneer Butter Masala and Pindi Chana Masala along with Tandoori Roti and Garlic Naan.

The Paneer Tikka was really nice. It had a layer of coriander and chilli chutney in the middle. The Paneer itself was soft and very well marinated. A side of spicy onion salad was served with it which was once again really good.

The Kali Dal was a little weak in flavor. I found it to be under seasoned and lacking in creaminess. It had a waterish texture to it which was a bit of a put off.

The Paneer Butter Masala was good. The Panner chunks had not been fried which was a plus and the gravy was just right. I also did not find oil floating at the corners which meant they had got the oil and butter content spot on.

The Pindi Chana Masala was again good. Many people come to this restaurant just for this one dish. I found the same to be good but not life changing. It tasted good but was a little hard for my taste. I expected the Chickpeas themselves to be softer. It also had chunks of potatoes which were really nice.

Service was great with old school stewards and their own charm. Its something new and upcoming places cannot replicate.¬†

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The Kali Dal is in dire need of improvement as for most North Indian diners, it forms the backbone of their lunch or dinner. The rest of the food was great.¬†

PRICING:

On the higher side. The food costed us around Rs.2000 along with soft drinks.

VERDICT:

A reminder of the great gastronomic traditions of Kolkata. You might get better and cooler cafes elsewhere, but you will not find the charm and nostalgia that these places have anywhere else. Happy Dining !

Went there for dinner in a big group couple of days back. We had ordered vegetarian food. The starters were amazing like crispy chilli baby corn, dahi kebab. Sizzler was just sizzling with good taste. Main course items like Chana, kofta were very good. Paneer Butter Masala was below par else would have given a higher rating. Breads were descent. The Dessert Tutti Frutti ice-cream was sub-standard as it contained only apple and bananas without traces of mango (seasonal fruit) or any other fruit. If you want to get a taste of vintage Park Street the  head to this place without thinking twice. Ambiance was good and service perfect.

We ordered a light dinner two nights ago. Sindhi daal, Boondi raita, papri chaat and tandoori roti. After a few minutes of placing the order we were told that they didnt have yoghurt so we would have to replace the yoghurt-based items ordered. By the time we made up our mind, we were told that they have yoghurt now! So we continued with the original order. The Papdi Chaat was absolutely bland. Anyone can put imli chutney on the papdi and yoghurt but that doesn't make it a chaat! The Sindhi dal was spicy despite being told it would not be so.
There are a few chinese items but it is tough spotting them in the menu. They dont have a separate section for chinese. 
Since it is a busy place it was very noisy. You can hear conversations of those sitting around your table even if you try not to!
The only good thing was the staff who were very courteous.

Have long heard of Kwality in Park Street being a legacy in itself. While there is no denying that, I have to say that I found it to be just about good and nothing extraordinary. There are very restricted options for you if you are a vegetarian and at times you literally cannot choose, you are compelled to order a particular dish because they have that less a variety of vegetarian items. However the food they serve is really good and the mocktails, again not diverse but are very tasty. A good experience none the less.:)!

It was noisy because staffs were talking and laughing very loudly, and the topic they were talking about, I shouldn't say here.¬†
Order taker was helpful and food came on my table really really fast.¬†
Breads and chicken dish were hard and same was told to the gentleman who was serving me, the second bread came after 15 minutes as I was coming back from work and was hungry, I had to eat the food.¬†
Overall yukkkk experience....not recommending people to go there and waste their time.

Starter 'dahi ke kabab' was decent, Minestrone soup was good.

Moving to main course, their historically famous chana was v good but rest vegetables were really bad. We just had food with one dish i.e. chana masala. Others were complete waste if money!

Very nostalgic place. Food is of a good quality. The pindi channa is superb though one can taste the soda bi carbonate in it sometimes. Other items like the paneer butter masala, dal makhani and paneer tikka are also superb. The gratin is sublime in taste. The place is too cramped however. Always get the feeling that you get squished into place.

Where do I begin?
To tell the story of how great a love can be,
The sweet love story that is older than the sea,
The simple truth about the love Kwality brings to me!!!!
Where do I start?

We are big fans of chhola bathura and this is THE place to go to if you want to experience Heaven on Earth. Every time we have been here, we have eaten chhola bathura without even glancing at any other item on their otherwise extensive menu. 

This review is based entirely on the awesomeness of their chhola bathura. We actually ask people coming from Kolkata to Delhi to get it packed and bring it over. It is by far the best that we have eaten in any city, at any time and in any dimension. 

Docked .5 points since there has been a very slight degradation in quality over the years, but it is still better than the competition. Would give it a 4.9 if we could.

The food here is quite good. One of our regular places to visit for North Indian food. The Pindi Chana is the usually highlight of our meal but the Gratin sometimes steals the show from it. Service is very quick and the staff always tells us about the items that will take time (like the gratin).
A major problem is that the tables are too small to fit people. A table of 4 is very cramped. There is limited room on the table to place all the dishes that we have ordered.

Most of the times, I have overlooked this restaurant while walking down on Park Street. It is an old restaurant famous for its Indian cuisine. But over the time it has included new items in the menu to provide varieties. Here you get the wine at the cheapest rate in Park Street, except some neighbouring pubs. The food is delicious as always and the service lives up to its reputation. This is a kind of restaurant minus splendid decor and ambiance which is good for a change.

The moment I stepped in to Kwality it brought back memories for me from my days when I was a regular. The ambience is pretty much the same as I remember it with the cosy feel and smallish tables ensuring that you are sitting rather close to your fellow diners.

We ordered the folllowing:-

1. Sweet Corn Chicken Soup - very tasty but the pieces of chicken were a bit too big for my liking.

2. Fish Fingers - five thick pieces of fish fingers batter fried served with potato chips. Extremely sumptuous and equally delicious.

3. Rogan Josh - traditional mutton gravy with three big pieces. The gravy was exceptional although the meat was a little chewy.

4. Paneer Butter Masala - the best I have eaten in India made the way it is supposed to be with cashew and yellowish in colour unlike the red stuff that you get in the South. Superb.

5. Mutton Seekh Kebab - lovely succulent long pieces of mutton kebab (boneless) served with pickled onions. Just fantabulous.

Prices have risen quite a bit bug it was worth every penny.

Cheers,

This restaurant was always on my wishlist....Although the restaurant seems small from outside but once you enter...you can see the spacious hall along with a very good decor & upscale ambience.The restaurant has two floors,since we were in a group of six we choose to sit upstairs,which gives you way more privacy.Now coming to the food,we had very high standards in mind but were dissapointed,we ordered-

Sweet corn chicken soup & fish amritsari,the first dissapointment of the evening came with the soup...which was bland & tasteless...but the fish amritsari saved our starter..it was very good...crunchy on the outside & juicy inside with the perfect tad of seasoning.

Vegetable au gratin...which was cheesy & perfectly made thumbs up for it..!!!¬†

Next was Pindi chana & butter naan...the chana was like the normal homemade chana & was nothing close to the rawalpindi chana,was a major dissapointment although the butter naan was decent enough.

Then comes Mutton handi biriyani,kadhai chicken,chicken bharta,the mutton in the biriyani was hard to separate from it's bone & the biriyani in itself was also bland with a major lack in seasoning....although the chicken sides were good enough.

Chicken sizzler,was good and the only thing of high standard.

Tutti frutti,pistachio ice cream,vanilla cream these three were the star dishes...our meal got saved due to these desserts...They were awesome and worth stopping by.

P.S-->0.5 marks more for the desserts.

Situated amidst The Park and Rajdhani, Kwality has made quite a name for itself. Claiming to be a specialist in the North Indian department, it also serves delicacies from Chinese and continental cuisines, supplementing it with great, prompt service. Their kebabs and tikkas also deserve special mention. Was disappointed that the Cassata was not available, but was pleasantly surprised after having their double sundae instead. Overall, good place for a family dinner.

One of the oldest and best places in cal for north indian food. Their quality is the same everytime i have been there. Truly commendable to keep the quality same.

I dont like the chicken items they are horrendous, if you are a veggie this is the place.

Having left Macambo in a huff over the terrible service and active construction going on during dining hours, we were wandering Park street looking for a meal when we walked by Kwality and my dining companions assured me it would be reliable and tasty. It was both, and hospitable to boot. 

We dined on dahi kababs, fried kulchi, chickpeas in a dry spice rub and chicken bharta. The dahi kababs were lovely, light and
 airy and well flavored, while the kulchi was out of this world,  gentle puff of bread softly deflating as we tore it apart. The chickpeas were excellent, but the real star was the chicken bharta, whose stew-like consistency and rich flavors were warming and comforting. My companion had childhood memories of the tutti fruitti Sunday, so we had to get it, of course, in all its artificial glory, and it wasn't half bad from a 1950's sensibility. 

It could have just been the contrast from Macambo, but the service was excellent and the atmosphere comfortable and pleasant. When looking for a vintage Kolkata dining spot, this is the one I would want to revisit.

OK a moderately pricey restaurant in Park Street but m sorry to break it to u all so bluntly folks, its a place totally unworthy of spending your evening at, specially not in parkstreet. The food was way below average for an above average bill. Mughlai Biryani was just bland rice, no spice , no masala and the mutton was 20gm flesh with 180gm bone and my hands ached to just separate the flesh from the bones. Mixed vegetables was useless no taste. Palak paneer was OK OK! Enjoyed the ice creams alone. I did feel that the mixed vegetables and my chicken dish had the same gravy. Go here for sundaes nothing else. Totally disappointed with the service too. We had to ask for everything n call out every time we wanted our water glasses filled. The plates arrived wet and dripping which is a big no-no for me. Sorry folks... Unless they go and have a major menu redo or complete change m never going here again.

We had cream of chicken soup and grilled chicken sandwich and cold coffee with ice cream slabs. 
The servers are well versed with menu, so the kitchen and the dining room are in perfect sync.  The soup was really good! The grilled chicken sandwich, better than most places... and it's all pretty cheap!

Calcutta was the destination of the sophisticated lot right up to the 90's.

The British Raaj with all is provocative finery was displayed in the 'Club Culture ' here....

Now, Kolkata is a different ball game.... it's as cosmopolitan as Mumbai or Delhi except for the occasional blink-and-miss reccurance of the Old World Charm....

Kwality is one such place that has trapped within it that long lost flavour.

Situated on Park Street, it's in one of the best locations in Kolkata. 

We were in a largish group and tried a few dishes , most of which were unique and very classic .

The Prawn Cocktail was loaded with dressing and most certainly could account for 30% of the heart attacks in the City.... yum 7/10

The Fish and chips transports you to TaulleyGanj Club , where you nearly see images of elderly couples , dressed finely on a lazy Sunday in the lawns.... 7/10

Roasted Chicken.... fabulous   8/10

The Indian selection was amazing too...

A reasonable place  to be...  Not high priced...  Food quality is good and service Staffs are well trained and quick. 
Sitting arrangement is bit tight and congested.  I would prefer to go tis place with friends rather than family. 
Overall a reasonable place..  Not highly rated but satisfactory.

Very disappointed with my experience at Kwality. While the interiors hint at a quiet elegance, the food was average at best. The tomato soup was lukewarm. The chilli baby corn was, as instructed beforehand, not crispy to the point of being soggy. The breads were lackluster while even the homely aloo mutter (which we had to settle given the lack of vegetarian non paneer subzi options) was forgettable. Slight improvements were the jeera rice and the caramel custard; the latter was served with an unnecessary runny spoon of cream.¬†

The service is unspeakably bad. Each time you manage to get the staff's attention feels like a victory.¬†

Just never again.

I regularly visit this outlet for lunch for its fast service and good foods. My favourite cuisine are Tandoori fish tikka masala and Patiyala, chicken other dishes are equally delicious. Pleasing ambiance with better air-conditioning, this restaurant you will find always filled with the people. A better choice @ Park Street. 
#Review addition on visit dated 05/05/16:
We visited this outlet for lunch and order seek kawab, Paneer chilli dry, Dal Makhani, Alu dopyaza with tandoori rotis, butter Nan and a Masala Kulcha and we find the food quality except, seek kawab and Paneer chilli, has deteriorated and bread quality is worst, they are not taking any concern about the quality of food. Table sizes has been reduced such a manner that there is no room to acodomate above order easily, we feel very congested. Finally we back with displeasure and It is difficult for me to visit again.

The Kwality on Park Street has always been one of my favourite restaurants.Several reasons.One,its location.Every Calcuttan worth his salt crosses this place at least once every day.Second its proximity to Oxford book store allows you the luxury of browsing books and when hungry just walk two steps into Kwality.Third its accessibility by the metro allows people to congregate easily.

Having seen reviews of some eateries lately,with all humility I must submit that one should also know what to order or look for in a particular place.While all multi cuisine( I hate this word) restaurants have elaborate menus you identify particular eateries with a couple of dishes.Say chello kabab in Peter cat,Devils crab in Mocambo,the chateaudebriand in olypub though it's long gone now.

For me the real Kwality menu is hidden in the black coat stewards pocket in the 'days special'.One common item is fish masala kabab.Try it like I did today.its unforgettable.Then you have the delectable mutton rara with thick gravy as well as the chicken butter masala which was not as good today.My vegetarian friend swore by the black chana masala and I love their chilli chicken which is served with potato chips and of the 10,000 recipes of Kolkata Chilli Chicken ,ranks rather high in my books.I polished it off with the signature Tutti Fruti ice cream ( small) and walked out a happy man

We visited this place on a late weekend afternoon. The first thing that came to mind when I entered the place was that the place was very averagely decorated. It had basic tables, chairs and crockery. Even the table cloth was basic.

Then we were seated and the menu cards brought to us. There were a lot of options to choose from. We chose to have Indian, and so ordered prawn fries, Masala Kulcha, Garlic Naan, peas pulao, Fish kebabs, mutton curry preparation and mocktails.

The serving was very shoddy. The person who was serving us spilled a lot of water on the table but did not bother to change it. Then came the food. Food and mocktails were tasty. I have no complaints with the food, but there was a lot of mismanagement going on as after serving us the rest of the food, the waiter informed us that peas pulao is not available and the kitchen has been closed. Whereas a couple sitting right next to us was served peas pulao just 2 minutes before he came and informed us.

This should have been informed to us when we were ordering and not after serving us the rest of the food.

Lastly we ordered for deserts. Trutti Fruity was good and so was caramel custard.

What I felt was that everything other than the food was not at all up to the mark. And with a bill amounting to Rs. 8000, you would definitely want the whole experience to be good.

When I was just looking out for sizzlers, the first name which clicked in my mind was Kwality of Park Street. Located near the Park hotel of Kolkata, this hotel is around 100 yrs.  old and is still standing with heads held high...........not only sizzlers, but continental and Chinese also needs a special mention..... Fish and chicken preparations are also on my favourite carte.......
Overall, this place made my day :)

Firstly it's not a place for Airtel users because there is no network in the restaurant. Secondly there is no management in allotting the tables if you are lucky enough that the manager acknowledges you then you might get a seat. Lastly the food was average I ordered north Indian food which was not up to the mark. I recommend you to have north Indian food in a dhaba instead.

Hello foodies!

I visited this place on the 14th of June, 2015. It was my mother's birthday and I suggested this place to her because this restaurant in Park Street is often ignored despite serving some really good dishes.

The decor is pleasant. Yes, considering it's a Park Street restaurant, you won't be disappointed. Although, I would suggest avoiding a seat on the upper floor as it may seem a little cramped.

As for the food, I would really like it if they totally scrapped the Continental section from their menu, because quite frankly, they are not that good at it. They only have ONE sizzler. Just the one. Also, you would immediately start regretting ordering it there rather than at Mocambo or Peter Cat. 

I believe the USP of this restaurant is the Indian menu and they should constantly strive to make it better. That would really make it stand out. We ordered the Mutton Rogan Josh and Butter Naan and as expected, they were delightful. 

As an endnote, I would suggest visiting this place only to experiment with the Indian menu.

Bon Appetite. :)

Chicken cutlets, cream of chicken is also very good.Caramel pudding, ice creams are also quiet delactable. Located in the heart of park street, it showcases pure park street cuisine. Enjoy.:-)

Having heard about this place a lot, the experience came along as a bit of disappointment for me. The service was a bit slow and the shakes that I ordered were a bit of disaster. I ordered pindi chana and they were very dry to eat with the kulchas. I recommend to add some more of curry gravy to it. Other items were also not that good.

Quiet meetings r no meetings ;) food is also good esp pindi channa and bhatura.  It is an amazing surprise to find pindi channa cooking of this quality here in kolkatta!  Prices can be a little less i think

No matter how much i say about this place, its less. Modern setting with ultra-aged service, i think their waiters are equity holders in the restaurant - i have never seen a new face in 25 years of my visit to them! 

Lets get to the food:

Their Paneer butter masala is lip smacking. you can truly taste ounces of butter in every bite... 
Chana Masala - the best dry kabuli chana i have ever had anywhere... perfectly boiled, flavoured, with adequate amount of ginger, half a potato and half an onion as garnish
Black dal - you can see the butter floating on the top - yum. 
Butter Nan - its cooked to perfection with a generous spread of butter on top - just blends perfectly well with the food. 

Not everyone might appreciate this place, for its "babu-moshai" service, cleanliness of the linen, chipped plates, etc. and I would completely understand their feeling, however people who have grown in this place, like me, will understand the reason and relevance of that laid back attitude - totally british raj style. 

In fact, till date i have people bring me a parcel of paneer and chana if they are taking an evening flight to mumbai!!

Kwality is again one of those fallen angels in the Kolkata cullinary map..It used to be a family favourite and I have visited this outlet multiple times in my childhood,I believe they also had an outlet in Ballygunge..This is one of those legendary classy typical Park Street restuarants with its grandeur, highly appreciated food menu and high end ambiance..At a point of time they used to serve one of the better Indian spreads alongwith Amber in Kolkata..their Golden Fried Prawn is undoubtedly my all time favourite and even today if I visit this joint will surely order it..However,sadly the quality and tastewise the foods have degraded over time..Still the food is quite delectable and the prices are not to high when compared to similar restaurants in Park Street..The serevers however seems to be a bit inefficient and slow nowadays..Coming to the food some of the highly recommended items are: Golden Fried Prawns, Fish Orly,Fish Peshawari Tikka, Mutton Roganjosh and Chicken A-La-Kiev..Last but not the least no reviews of Kwality can be complete without a special mention of their Ice Creams..Holding a legacy for over decades,this is still one of the best in the city..It is at this place I have actually learned to love my Tutti Frutti or Chocolate Sundae..You can visit this outlet only to taste their Ice Creams..Average cost will be Rs.1500/- for two including alcohol..

Dont consider yourself very lucky when almost all restaurants on Park street have serpentine queues but u walk in at kwality. That sums it all. Once a delight now a compromise.  Food, service , hygiene all at abysmal  levels.  We had rats running between our feet and te management there  gave an excuse saying  that rodents are common where food is cooked and served.....

I recall visiting this restaurant once, after office hours, a long time back, during my internship days. Somehow, haven't visited it again, in ages...though I am a frequent visitor of the other legends of Park street such as Peter Cat, BBQ etc. The ambience here, was less classy, than other Park street joints. However, I remember having a pretty tasty dose of Chicken Biryani, and the quantity was more than enough for two people. A pretty decent place, minus the decor and ambience.

In the middle of Park Street this ¬†seemed to be a famous North Indian restaurant... it was full within 15 mins of the clock striking 9 on a Saturday evening!!
We did not have much of food there except for soups and a starter, as the food was decent but the quantity did not seem to justify the price!
The soups were decent though the chicken in the sweet corn soup was a little smelly and the quantity of the starter (some fried fish) was very less compared to the price.
The ambience of the restaurant is good with nice white interiors but the waiters seem to be working here since this restaurant had begun and are least interested in serving you.
Overall an average experience at the place, and the prices are pretty high compared to the quantity!!

If you want to go for good north Indian food then this place is definitely a good place. other than food their service is like very well oiled machinery. Ambiance, price, quality and quantity - ¬†in this all category they fit very well.

We took prawn tandoori which was very well made and fresh, chicken butter masala, dal makhani, chicken hariyali all were good.

One of the best known and finest restaurants in park street area...visited this place about a year back. Everything about this place impressed me..starting from its decorations,to food,service,everything. Only on one part it did disappoint me..that the place isn't very spacious. The day i went there it was a sunday and there was a huge queue of people waiting..they didn't have their own waiting area and they stuffed all people inside the restaurant where people were having their food and it really caused a disturbance for those people. Other than that,this place serves quality food. No complaints regarding quantity or quality. Though price is a bit on the higher side still the food doesn't disappoint you and its worth it. Looking forward to my next visit here.

Went there with few cousins for dinner on a Sunday. 
The place was rather less crowded considering it was a Sunday. 
I've heard about this place having good food and RUDE waiters. 
We ordered for vegetable au gratin and cheese balls as starters.... And it was a total let down. The au gratin had abundance of peas and lacked the cheese layer . The Right balance of vegetable in this dish is the key to a proper taste. The cheese balls were awful. It was rather a fried Besan dough with no taste of cheese. We didn't even bother to finish the dish. 
We also ordered a tomato and a manchow soup. They were just warm. 
The manchow soup Was more of a vegetable clear soup with traces of fried noodles. We had to ask for a plate of extra fried noodles. 

For the main course we ordered Pindi chana, paneer hyderabadi, butter naan and garlic naan. These dishes were rather better than the starters. 
Overall I am not going back there and will suggest you to go only to try your luck. May be you'll get good food! 

Food - 2/5
Ambience - 3/5
Cost - 2.5/5
Overall - 2.5/5

It is one of my most favourite restaurant to visit since my childhood days. It has many many cherished memories over the years with great family outings that has been etched in my memory forever. It was like a favourite place to visit almost every Sunday with family. At that time, the food was great and the ambience was so so nostalgic. The last visit was also good with great food especially the North Indian delicacies. I would recommend this place to everyone. A must must visit ...

Got renovated few months ago... Ambience is good.... Last time I was here the food tasted bland specially north Indian. Love their baked fish and reshmi kebabs n fish tikka ,fish fingers Better they try to bring the old taste in foods. And elaborate menu is the demand of time. Other wise good place for business or family outings. And with friends. Over beer. Quantity wise also they need to upgrade. I love this place so it's feels bad when expectations are not met.

Kwality at Park Street is a lovely place to enjoy your dinner with family or friends.

A place always full with enthusiastic Bengali People,as you can hear the loud chats from anywhere in the restaurant.Places like this keep you cheerful and make you feel more alive with their liveliness.

Enjoyed almost everything we ordered¬†
Russian Salad
Fish FIngers
Chilli Chicken
Dahi ke Kabab
Dal Makhani
Pindi Chana
Order whatever you want you are going to like it.As in my case i liked all the items we ordered.

Beautiful place to be there and even the Park Street.¬†
Don't forget to enjoy your PAAN from the Panwalas out side Kwality Restaurant, if you enjoy having one.

Busy park street fills you with energy and enthusiasm.I enjoyed both the Kwality Restaurant and the Park Street with its beautiful lights and energetic People.

For the first time I visited Kolkata. The very first Restaurant I opted for veg food. Round around 10.15pm I checked in for dinner. The guards greeted us well. We were 6 ppl in all. So had to wait a while till a table was allotted to us. The ambience was calm and soothing. The environment was pleasant. Now comes the bad part. Even aftr 10 mins none of the managers were bothered to entertain us. We weren't served water. Aftr askin 3 times a menu was provided. The menu had very limited options. For placing the order we had to call out for a manager a couple of times. This experience was extremely hopeless. Management needs to review the food options as well as KWALITY of its services.

While coming back from our trip to gangasagar (in feb 14) we got to kolkata around 11.00 and I was frantically looking for places to eat on zomato and google, I asked the cabby if this place was en route to our hotel and he replied in the affirmative. I got there exactly at 11.00 and I asked the manager if the bar was still open but he politely refused, well i was miffed and pleaded with him but he would not budge but remained polite, I understood that he was just doing his job and let it be. The ambience is very upmarket and the crowd there was well heeled. We ordered Daal Makhni, Chicken Do Piaza, Dahi Kebab (Amazing). The food mostly was a bit on the sweeter side but I know bengali cuisine is like that, however still being a punjabi its just not my kind of food.

I have visited the park street outlet of Kwality several times. Recently been renovated its just located beside the oxford book store. It is considered as one of the pioneers among the restaurants in park street. It sketched out its legacy by serving one of the best varieties of north indian and mughlai cuisines. Its kind of a trend in my family for blindly choosing Kwality when it comes to north indian and mughlai dishes. After dining here for more than a decade now, the most important thing which i have experienced is, all their dishes have a perfect blend and balance of the spices and even after being north indian and mughlai cuisines which are rather considered as rich and spicy it never creates any kind of harsh impact to your tastebuds. Kwality is the place where you can get to experience the versatile and succumbing aroma and texture of your favorite north indian cuisine. The tantalizing quality which this restaurant offers to the fan of mughlai and north ineian cuisines is incomparable.

Used to go there when they held a name for their north indian fare ...
They served a delicious bharta which was miraculously not too heavy and appetite-upsetting. It teamed up well with the pulao we had.The chicken do pyaaza was excellent as well.
The service is good...a large boisterous group behind us were politely asked to reduce the commotion,showing that the erstwhile waiters were skilled at handling people.
Definitely a nice place to hang out.

Kwality is the first restaurant that I have visited so it has certain nostalgic feel for me but for a new customer the same old world feeling may not work. 
As I've said earlier, there is a certain old world charm about this place which I love. From the moment enter you are greeted by person till you leave you will feel the old Calcutta (mind you it is not Kolkata). It was one of the poshest joint back in days. A dinner here would be a status symbol. But like the others in this locality it failed to keep up with the newer trends and fads.
Food is good. Special mention -  dry chhole, kulchha, chicken tandoori and peas pulao (these are the items that I have ordered here forever)

Kwality! The happening place of the 60s, 70s & 80s and today a place where largely the old patrons frequent. I have been coming here right since my childhood - this used to probably be the only place which served Ice Cream Sundaes. Hence, there are many memories attached to this place. Kwality always had a limited menu but is best known for its Punjabi/Tandoori dishes. I have always felt that one of the reasons why Kwality lost out is because of it's limited menu - but the cutlets, fish fries and fish fingers, the butter chicken, the tandoori murghs is still one of the best in Calcutta. Now let me tell you a connoiseur's secret to conclude - this is not on the menu and so is a secret - and the secret is to ask the stewards to serve you¬†cheese balls. I can say with complete authority that they make the BEST cheese balls (and not Paneer balls!)¬†in entire India! It is available only during snacks time though.

Kwality in Park Street is apparently a restaurant which is known for its North Indian food. Since I was new to Kolkata I settled for this place. My wife and me ordered some light Kingfisher beer and tandoori prawns. The prawns were rubbery and dry and the quantity was meagre. But the chilled beer made for the prawns. For lunch we ordered a Dum Biryani and the dish turned out to be great. A surprise element was dried plums in the biryani, like the ones you get in Afghanistan pulav or biryani.
The ambience was nice but the service was great and they even guided us to other food joints when we asked them about places which served Bengali food.
I am not sure whether I will lunch or dinner at Kwality's again, but certainly will visit the restaurant for its beer and hospitality.

After a theatrical evening show, on a beautiful busy Saturday night we literally forced ourselves into Kwality on Park Street having been politely informed about a waiting period for at least half an hour in other acclaimed restaurants in the same locality. We had frequented this place in Ballygunje many a times since childhood and I fondly remembered the delectable taste of some of their signature Mughlai dishes though I could not remember a single name. The d√©cor of the place was simple yet tasteful with a special touch having been given on the occasion of the Brazilian soccer carnival. We instantly hit on the yummaliciousTandoori Chicken and sheek kebabs entree gulped down with fresh lime soda. The main one comprised of a simple spread of soft naan and tandori roti along with dalmakhni, mutton roganjosh , chicken do piaza and raita. The grilled fish was also a simple and tasty creation. However, the caramel custard and the tooty fruity turned out to be a surprise for the evening with the custard having been given the apt time to be baked into its soft, jelly-like caramelised form while the fresh fruits tasted lovely with the ice-cream. Overall, a 3.5 on 5 on food, d√©cor and service a high 5 on its prime location. This place is worth a visit.

Although we're now at chennai, our roots are from Kolkata twenty five years ago. This is one of the few places that my dad raves about and has spent a major portion of his youth at. And true to his claims, they do have one of the tastiest north Indian food. Although I want to warn, that you might end up really bloated and heavy after a eating, but the food is totally worth it. Staff and service is very good. The place always has a mixed crowd including expats. Overall, you will never be disappointed here. Parking as all other places in Kolkata is a major problem.

Was looking forward to visit this legendary restaurant after a gap of around 12-13 years. It is still the same - old charm and some very old waiters as well.They have renovated a bit but they surely lack the cleanness and hygiene.

With regards to food, was waiting to taste and recall the old times,hence went ahead and ordered my old time favourites,

Fish peshawari tikka - Lovely mouthwatering tandoori fish - succulent and still tastes very good.
Mutton Barra Kabab - Just love the mutton dishes here - again very well made and perfect combination with drinks
Brain Masala - Wow - this is the ultimate dish and legendary dish - best eaten with a tandoori roti
Chicken Bharta - Again a very good dish and tasted simply super.

Had eaten to my hearts content and finally gave me a nostalgic feeling as well. Whatever points am deducting is for the same old decor which is not pleasing to the eye.

It's been there for ages and from the looks of it neither the decor has changed, nor the Menu. On the plus side they have maintained their quality. Their food is reasonable and so are their portions. I visit now and then and a few items are must haves - Fried fish with tartar sauce, Grilled fish, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka and Chicken Bharta. The quality of their fish in particular is delightful. If you're looking for a variant in taste I would also recommend the Tandoori Prawns.

But a word of caution - avoid their Chinese food like a plague to the tastebuds.¬†

All in all, a Park Street legend, which is going strong and will, God willing go on.

So.. It was my father's choice today! He recalled going to this restaurant 20 years before..when he used to have business trips to kolkata. And now after 20 years..he savoured the flavors of one of the oldest eateries of the city..along with me! 

Well the decor seemed okay-ish! I guess... Every restaurant u go in park street.. It has nearly the same sense of decor! Neither overdone nor dull! The service guy.. Actually covered the table with table cloth after we were seated..! When I had a look around the other tables..some of them. Had table cloth while some didn't! That was the **question mark** moment! 
Anyways.. Coming to the FOOD! They have quite a decent spread of options..! So we had.. Chicken sweet corn soup..! Which was regular in taste ... Salt was less though! Fish masala kabab...was great in taste! I loved it! Great flavors! It was cooked to perfection! but it was overpriced! ‚Çπ400 (approx) for 2 pieces ...i dont think soo..that its price should have been this sky high! Fish peshawari tikka .. Was scrumptious too! Vegetable Au Gratin..is one of the most famous dishes of this place,and after having it, I realized.. Why it was worth it!! What a great dish it was!! I wish I could know..how its made! 
In the mains..we had chicken bhurta and pindi chana! Pindi chana was my father's choice..because he pondered that it was one of the most amazing dishes of those times ! But to his surprise..it was not even near to that in taste! Even I found it to be very ordinary in taste! Chicken bhurta..had minced chicken..in a GOOD flavor gravy! 

Overall a 3.5! And yeah..one more thing..don't expect..a quantity food here! The portions are meagre! ‚Çπ2000 for 3 people...I was looking for a lil bit more quantity of food portions!since we had our dinner at 7pm..very few tables were occupied..and the service guys..were literally standing just next to table..3-4 just on our head!*Literally* ! I didn't like it at all!! So..service wise..it was sheer disappointment! 
Hope.. You guys work upon it.. To maintain the "kwality" of the place!

Kwality, right next to the Park, is one of the older restaurants at Park Street. But its certainly not lost its charm. The last time I visited was with my overseas boss and his wife.

For the best Chana-Kulcha in Kolkata..

It was a nostalgic visit to recapture the taste that lingered since childhood. The ambience has undergone some change but the service as warm as ever.

My agenda was to have fried Kulcha and pindi chana. Both were excellent and the chana tasted the same even after 40 years. We went on to try the Amritsari Kulcha which was also excellent. The Dal Bukhara although very good was slightly sweeter than it should have been. 
If you have not had Chana-Kulcha here, you have missed something important in life

If one goes to Kwality, Park Street, it is because it never disappoints. Parking is a problem, the decor is nothing to write home about (yesterday when we went there was a lingering smell of paint), it is stark, there are no tankards, silver or otherwise for the beer, and the upholstery could do with a change...but the food and service more than make up for all this. Our waiter, Salauddin, was solicitous of our comfort. Little things he did showed that he cared about the people he was serving and the way he served, and that it was not just a job for him. The beer was chilled to the right temperature. He switched off the fan that threatened to blow us off, when he brought the food, served us with care, replaced a chipped glass, and generally saw to it that we enjoyed the whole experience of eating. The grilled food - we had Reshmi kebabs, and a fish kebab with the lightest possible naan. Dessert was Triple Sundae for my husband and the most divine caramel custard for me. The food was so good that we ordered some takeaway too!

This was definitely not something I had read up before about or a pre-decided choice for family dinner on Saturday night. I an elderly aunt with me and mom and another aunt and we were just out of a concert, eating out seemed the perfect end to the evening. We got parking close by which was a near miracle and I opted to walk into Trincas, however they were playing Rock music that night and that was not everyone's choice so we decided to walk ahead upto Barbe Que, the unsuspecting watchman led me in and then it was quite a disappointment, the steps were full of people waiting and it would be close to at least another hour before we got seated anywhere. we walked out. Mocambo had 50 minutes waiting, so while heading back I noticed Kwality where the watchman and doorkeeper had a smile and was polite. 

We were seated within arrival and soon greeted by courteous waiters and a manager, in the beginning I thought I smelt a rat because they were a little bit over enthusiastic, but the menu came and we decided our orders. Chicken soup, dahi ke kebab,fresh lime soda, masala papad. The dahi ke kebab featured in a special menu and I took a chance and ordered it, and was not at all disappointed , ti was really well done and tasted yum and quite filling.

We ordered grilled fish, rogan josh, kadai chicken with tandoori roti and garli naans. The gravy of the Rogan Josh was really well done and tasted yum, it was not very greasy and the taste was perfect, the mutton pieces were tender, juicy and melted in our mouth and went perfectly with the naan. The grilled fish was accompanied  by vegetables and potatoes and excellent except that it had a coating and my mom preferred it grilled minus the coating, taste wise it was fresh bhetki and quite yum on the whole.
The chicken gravy had large pieces of chicken and was a bit sweetish but well made, soft and tender.
The desert was caramel custard, banana split and mango with icecream which was also quite delicious and well presented.

On the whole this place is a must visit and honestly perfect for family dinner, the service was excellent and fast and considering it was Saturday night, this would be a hot pick that surprised us and surpassed expectations.

Meal for four with taxes and Vat came upto around 2700.

kwality is yester-year's favourite but sadly no more . the   ambiance is average & the prices are ABOVE AVERAGE . We went there on a quiet evening & found the place half empty .  just to give you an example the naan we ordered costs us rs 70  a piece, considering the ambiance i found that to be extravagant . coming to our order , we ordered   1 plate of fried prawns ( Rs 310  )   along with 1 plate of fish peshawari tikka   ( rs 310  ) in starters along with 1 bottle of budweider ( rs 215  ) &   1 pint of kingfisher blue   ( rs 140) . in the main course we ordered 1 plate of rogan josh   ( rs 215 )   & 2  plain Naans   ( rs 70  X 2  = rs 140 )   . & the bill came at a thundering rs 1586 . that is because kwality charges 12% service tax on top of 14.5 %  VAT . And that' s not all , they even charge a 2 % education cess . it seemed for  a while that i was dining in a  5 star michelin restaurant & not  ( after  reading the bill )  & not kwality .   however after paying the bill i assured myself it's not that extravagant considering the fact that i will hardly visit it again in the  near future . in my  honest opinion kwality is  now one of  those wannabe restaurants  of yester years which generates business  only through  nostalgia  than their " value for money theme " which they were known for once in the not so distant past .

I am not great of this dull looking resturant from outside and inside.
Car parking is such an issue in Park Street.
However, my dad loves Pindi channa and bhatura of this place. It actually best pindi chana in city. 
Masala kulchas are amazing as well..
The ambiance n the food remains consistant with this place that's the perfect thing about it. Would get food Kwality everytime you visit.

Location: Park Street.

This is the place to which I was introduced to by my father when I was just about 9 years old.
Since then, this is a place I have been quite often going to, just to relish the favorites, flavors of which have simply kept lingering on my taste buds since my introduction to them.

To be on an unbiased note, this place has been slowly travelling downhill due to it's fall in the quality of service and food it serves.

Though the quality of signature dishes have somewhat remained the same, the rest have taken their route to disappointment.

Coming to the point,
The dishes that have always been on my order card:-

Paneer Tikka
Is soft, succulent but has lost it's nailing flavors. Is now just like the ones served at other joints.
Disappointed.¬†

Pindi Chana
Aah just the same!
My favorite among all the other favorites. :-P
The preparation of this dish is quite different from the other restaurants.
It's a must try!

Paneer Butter Masala
Paneer was soft, flavorful and the creamy gravy seemed to add a finishing touch to it.
Lovely.

Dal Makhani
Black Lentils soaked overnight and cooked along with a mixture of spices in an earthen pot tastes heavenly.
Delectable.

Butter Naan
Soft and perfect cooked, served with a dollop of butter.¬†
Satisfied.

Masala Kulcha
Lost it's charm. The spice mix in the filling is no more the same, and the amount of filling in it is just enough to make u feel it has a filling but not enough to make u feel the flavors.¬†
Disappointed.

Tutti-Frutti
One dessert my family loves to relish upon. This has remained quite just the same just that the offering sizes have changed.¬†
Manageable.¬†

Staff:
Earlier used to be courteous enough, have off late turned quite ignorant (not all, but a few).
Well informed but sloppy.

Pricing slightly towards the higher end.

Overall an average experience.

First time in Kolkata and living near Park Street is the most ideal situation to be in as a foodie with most of the legendary restaurants (as per Zomato) just at a walking distance. But the cramped streets of the Kolkata‚Äôs heart have been making an amazing adventure for us with so many outlets pooping here and there. The true spirit of Kolkata is on a great display when you walk around these streets; people unbelievably create a living out of places that just seem not to exist.

But to get started, we chose this really old place which bears quite a resemblance to the one in Pune in the way ‚ÄòKwality‚Äô is written on the board. It is quite a human nature to find some common links with your home town however small they might be.

Though not dilapidated but certainly the place seems to have lost its shine with age; dullness is completely visible in the d√©cor. The cream white walls look listless while the yellow lights make it look even more dull than somber. Even more interesting is the table height which is pretty low and the size of the table makes you feel cramped up once the food arrives.

Apart from the need to upgrade the atmosphere, the menu also needs some look over as the variety is really less and the veg section is so short that it ends as soon as it starts. But still not going for anything unusual, we tried the following:

Kurkure Kebab: The dish justifies the name somewhat by being really crisp from outside. The good thing is that the crispiness does the not hamper the chewing factor and cause any toothache. Rather the dish presented more in thicker spring roll form is delight to taste buds. The vegetable stuffing bonded by smashed potato holds up quite well.

Dal Amritsari: This was rather an odd ball or rather say odd dal which did not create any flutter. It was bland and looked more of a failed experiment. Either the moong dal or the spices used had a problem as the amalgamation just failed to excite us.

Paneer Rara: Nothing to go gaga/rara over but this one was quite likable. The deep fried paneer cubes in the thick onion gravy with glimpses of ‚Äòpaneer tikka masala‚Äô reaped benefits due to the inconsistent ‚Äòdal amritsari‚Äô which made this taste so much better.

Dal Makhani: This was taken to go along with rice as it seemed a safer bet. It turned to be rather well. Having tasted this dal in North India so many times does make the taste less significant but we must admit that nothing better would have gone with the rice. Though the aroma was not magnetic; the taste was great.

Indian Breads and Jeera Pulao: So we had tandoori roti, pudina paratha (where was the pudina?) and butter naan (we did see a really thin film of butter or was it a mere illusion?). The jeera rice/pulao was great to have and the only dish that was presented in right quantity.

Fresh Mango with Vanilla Ice-cream: The mango season is fast coming to an end and we always try to stuff ourselves with them wherever and whenever possible. So this was a obvious choice but the server seemed to think otherwise. He gave a big staring look and then took permission to ask for its availability. After getting a nod he brought the farewell dessert. The good old alphonso mango pieces with vanilla ice-cream never fail to miss the trick and they were at the mesmerizing best here. Great ending!

The service was fine but the problem was the number of people standing beside your table. The servers and managers ought to remain at a little distance to let the customers enjoy the food. It reminded us of our college mess days when people are standing beside you so that you wrap up your meal as quickly as possible and they get the seat. So we could here all the possible bickering which included lot of scolding.

The prices are decent considering the area but the quantities are pretty less. They take their own time to bring food and the billing seems a great task with the good old matrix printer. We were left scratching our head with the bill taking more than 15 minutes to come and the server was in similar position as he had made a mistake in the bill (for which the manager was reprimanding him).

For the readers, Kwality does not serve quality food but for the history that this place holds for many and lots of memories that have been captured over the tables, this place might just hold your interest‚Ä¶

Kwality provides authentic Indian food. I liked everything about the place but the deadly environment inside which attracts more of the elderly crowd. The place has a formal ambience which I personally dislike. The here might be better than Bar-B-Q in the same street but still I would prefer dining at Bar-B-Q cause of the lively environment.

The service and hospitality is pretty good. The menu is limited, however, they offer all popular favorites. Do check out the today's special menu, that gives a variety. I loved the dal makhani and lehsoon palak. The cream of tomato soup and the reshmi kebab were the best part of the meal. The pricing is quite good, it won't hurt your pocket. And yes, don't forget to try the caramel pudding and the tutti frooti !

A visit to Kwality restaurant has never been a bad experience for me. 

After my last visit on a sultry Summer SUNDAY afternoon, I realized that the heavy Indian food can be thoroughly enjoyed only in the colder months. 

The service was prompt and efficient even on a Sunday afternoon. 

We tried some new items -
Dahi Kebab - Soft, crisp and served with a nice dip. 
Vegetable Malai Kofta - It wasn't finger licking but still tasted good. The dish wasn't sweet, like it typically is in Mumbai.
Sizzler - Bad! It was full of soy sauce. And had a lot of fried items in it. Will never order again!
Caramel Custard (picture attached) - Yummy!!
Chocolate Sundae (picture attached)‚Äì It was a slice cut from a block of chocolate ice-cream. Not a sundae in any manner. ‚òπ
 
The Chana is a must eat in every meal and the Tutti- Frutti (picture attached) must end it. ‚ò∫

Kwality in Calcutta invokes many memories, specially of summer months enjoying tutti frutti after a hearty meal. Later on the ice cream business got sold to Walls and rest is history. I visited Kwality after many moons with my family and had a good time last night. First the ambience.  The decor and feel of Kwality remains the same. I always have this feeling that I am in "the Delhi" when I visit this place buzzing with predominantly non bengali crowd. We had a robust meal of pipingly hot Dal Amritsari seasonsed with fresh ginger, garlic and onions teamed up with hot butter naan and masala kulcha on the side. We also ordered Chicken Bharta which tasted equally good. One must also try their kebabs specially chicken reshmi kebabs. The place is also well known for their pindi chana and chole bhatura. The service is very prompt and all servers are very courteous and helpful. We rounded off our meal with off course tutti frutti- a all time favourite!

Kwality located at Park st the food hub of Kolkata is a yesteryear restaurant popular between a specific section of crowd. U will find middle aged men sipping beer at the tables. Apart from that the tomato soup,vegetable starter,chana masala and fried kulcha are some of it's renowned dishes. 3.5 stars from me.

Some restaurants like this are part of the food history in Calcutta.Kwality,situated in park street has been an absolute delight to visit always.The interiors are warm and cosy and you ll see many families celebrating birthdays and having dinner parties here.
The place has level seating, and is a big place to accomodate many.Kwality is always buzzing with life, in my many visits i have noticed that it is never i mean never empty,filled with people,brimming with joy and happiness. The servers naturally are very busy,but they never miss out on you,very friendly chaps.My last visit in january was like always quite pleasant.A friend had come down from mumbai and wanted to try all iconic places in calcutta.So we got him here and also took him to other places(im sure you know which places in park street :) ) 
Our order was a few softdrinks,1 screwdriver,1 paneer butter masala,1 dal makhni,butter nan,masala kulchas.It was a wonderful and quite enjoyable meal.Though we had no room for deserrts that day but on the basis on my previous visits i would recommend the tutti fruity,pinapple surprise,banana split, all of them are very good and make you nostalgic.

Popular place for decades for the standard Chola Bhaturas,Tandoori Chicken ,Reshmi kebabs,and the famous Tuttifrutti icecream to finish. Kwals as its popularily known as has maintained its "popular" standard particularily of its tandoori and punjabi food. The Pastas were never a forte but the fried fish has dropped in standard from a fairly chunky/flaky Bekti to smaller pieces and a bit over fried.
Kwals is worth a visit if youre  on a tightish budget and looking to fill your stomach---budget tourists,babus,students and young execs looking for a cold beer ,quick service and fair satisfaction.

The only item that was worth having was Fresh lime soda. Every single item was way below our expectations and the entire birthday treat was a waste. Even the service was unprofessional...people kept dropping food on the table.

For all those who do not know where this is, Kwality is located right beside oxford book store and for food lovers this is nothing short of a landmark on park street . I have seen in  always full on weekends for the last 25 years and thus that speaks for itself . 

The place used to make Pindi chholey to die for and and even better on than Ambar. The Cheese Cherry Pineapple sticks used to be a childhood favorite and even now when we get nostalgic we order a plate and laugh about it .

As kids we used to be really exited about TOOTI _FRUITY  ice-cream. Basically a sundae made with jelly and canned fruits and nuts and served in a glass.  

Went there a few days back and the paneer butter masala and the chicken bharta was as good as always and the masala kuchas were lovely. I also like the fish finger and fried fish here.

Kwality is nothing short of an institution in the food world.

Every time I visit kolkata I have to go to kwality for one plain reason-chola Bhatura. Its the best I have ever had and always make it a point to parcel the same and fly to bangalore for my friends ( never reaches them I finish everything before I even land in bangalore). The kebabs are heavenly and I my personalised favourite is the kebab platter. One other thing which I really like is the tutti frooti ice cream. It has a old world feel to it and have a lot of memories here.

Visited my old favorite during the Puja Week for lunch and was a little concerned as sometimes due to the rush the food quality in almost all the restaurants dip a bit however was delighted to find that was not the case in this instance. Ordered the Chicken Cutlet to start with .... love the way they make it stick to the basics a seasoned chicken breast crumb-fried to perfection served with thick hand-cut home made fries .... yummmmyyyyy !!!! Went on to order the awesome paneer butter masala which was delicious and pared beautifully with the chicken bharta and mutton burra kebabs that we ordered along with naans. A special mention to the burra kebab .... perfectly cooked  soft and juicy with just a bit of char on the surface that I love in my tandoori items. End that with the good old tooti -frooti and your in foodie bliss !



----- 22 Aug, 2013 -----

This is one of those old old favorites where I keep going on and off just to have the particular old favorites the flavours of which have lingered on my taste-buds almost all my life. Chicken Cutlet , the Pindi Channa ( one of the best ever) , Chicken Bharta , Fish Orly , Chicken Reshmi Kebab with Butter Naan..... Yummm !!! I recently also enjoyed the Saag Meat which I had not tasted earlier. The Chilli Chicken/ Prawn are tasty but not authentic very indiananised  infact but go well with a beer incase you want something other than the kebabs as do the fish fingers. End on a sweet note and take a full and happy stomach home !



----- 19 Oct, 2012 -----

At one time this was one of my most favored place to eat ....  but though I still have my favorites that I keep going back for the over-all standard and service of the place has really gone downhill. The Chicken Cutlet and Fish Orly are tasty fried and sinful and not for the calorie conscious. They still serve a delicious chicken bharta and pindi channa and that I enjoy but lately I have stopped eating the Kulcha which is drenched in oil and switched over to the naan. The tutti-frutti or fruit salad is a good note to end your meal on.

Being one of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata, Kwality fails to retain its name. Though, the North Indian dishes and kebabs there are my personal favourites. The service is bit on the slower side. The ambience is fine, the food is good and affordable. The Chinese food here is nothing more than average. 

Kwality can do a lot better if they improve their service.

Kwality is a veteran in this field !!! But yes the place has failed to retain that greatness over time which leaves it banking mainly on the nostalgia and location factors or few of its signature dishes.

Kwality in park street has been there since like forever. It is divided in to two floors with first floor being the family dining area which is very congested and compact unlike the ground one which is a bit more spacious. The seats are comfortable though. The staff contains several old and known faces who are polite and deliver a fast paced service. The prices are very very easy on the pockets.

Few of the dishes they make are really delicious but a few have lost that essence over time. Kebabs and other starters are average. I like their soups especially the cream of tomato which i tend to avoid at most of the places. Black dal is decent and as mentioned in the other reviews, pindi chana is their star dish beyond any doubts. Paneer lababdar is claimed to be another signature dish though i never found it to be that spectacular. Rotis are my biggest problem with kwality which i think should improve and be thinner and better roasted. Peas pulao is my favorite rice preparation . Deserts are just fine.

Inspite of a few great preparations, i dont feel so satisfied after a dining here mainly  because of the lack of consistency, presentation of food and the cutlery etc which have not been updated with time. I think even the interiors need a fresh revamp. Overall the way it is being run today does not do justice to its legacy in my opinion.

My head wants to rate it a 3.0 but my heart demands a 3.5 !!!!!

One of the earlier restaurants to open up on Park Street, this restaurant WAS one of the top restaurants in town, for a variety of reasons. For the food they served, for the " quality " of people who frequented, for the location and for many reasons that are unknown to me. But when I visited this place, I did not feel anything special at all. 

This place now is not even at par with the new crop of restaurants opening up everyday, when it comes to service of staff, and maintaining the restaurant. 

The staff really were rude. They started counting the currency notes that we handed over to them after our meal, and blatantly asked for a tip, which we were ready to give them anyway.

We ordered the usual Chinese dishes, and none of them were special.
One dish though deserves a special mention, the BAKED FISH, which was the only thing that I liked about the restaurant.

Location: Kwality Restaurant is located in Park Street. There is no more quality left in Kwality as it has lost its charm over the year. They serve indian cuisine, kebabs and both mocktails and cocktails. Ambience has deteriorated and quality of food declined. The reasons why this restaurant is working is just because of its prime location and due to its loyal customers. 

Coming to the pros and cons of this place:-

Pros:-
1)Food is Moderately delicious
2)Staffs are polite
3)Serves liquor and food both.
4) Located at the posh area

Cons:-
1) Service is not that great. 
2) Ambience has deteriorated
3) Food quality also have gone down tremendously
4) Inappropriate masala and spice addition in few of dishes and breads. 
5) Ambience needs a redesign. 
6) Costly affair as per food provided, one would rather go barbq. 

Disappointed, Kwality can do much more better.

Great setting and ambiance; good food yet slow service together earn Kwality a solid 3.5. Of course, the fact that it's one of the older names when it comes to food in Kolkata definitely earns it some brownie points - and regular customers.

The first thing you notice when you walk past the Oxford Bookstore on Park Street and enter the restaurant is that it's an extremely cosy place, with mellow lighting conducive to an enjoyable meal, along with the low sound of chatter that puts you at ease. Depending on your luck as well as the day of the week, sound levels may rise in the restaurant; but that's something foodies all over Kolkata have to deal with anyway.

The restaurant has the distinct old-style feel of Kolkata (I may be biased, having visited such places from a very young age) that so many new restaurants try and fail to emulate. Moreover, like most old restaurants of Kolkata, Kwality is on the edge of a knife, liable to tilt both ways. The food isn't brilliant, neither is it absolutely horrible. Instead, Kwality establishes and almost revels in its mediocrity, perfectly content to serve merely 'good' (leaning towards average in some cases) food. Of course, this is perfectly satisfactory for most eaters; but having grown up hearing tales of dine-outs at Park Street and this restaurant, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Ces't la vie.

Kwality offers three cuisines besides myriad snacks and a specials menu - Indian, Chinese, and Continental.

First off, the Chinese here is a solid average and nothing more. Considering the fact that the place isn't best known for this cuisine, that's quite reasonable. If you walk out of Oxford and the urge strikes you to get some Chinese without spending exorbitant prices, you may walk in next door and indulge in the Fried Rice and Chillie Chicken. You won't walk it with a memory, I guarantee.

Continental, on the other hand, was a bit of a surprise for me. I confess that I'm a Continental Buff, and Kwality did not leave an impression, but definitely earned a small niche in my mental food directory. A Prawn Cocktail worshipper, that was the first dish I ordered. Service took far longer than necessary, but the wait immediately became worth it as soon as I placed the first spoonful inside my mouth. It may not have been perfectly chilled, it may even have been slightly overpriced, but it was fresh. Mouth wateringly, brain cleansingly so. The prawns were the right consistency, the sauce left the perfect tingles in my tongue and the carrot...was very orange. We'll get to that later. However, the taste won over the warmth factor for me - in their defence, they had tried to chill it slightly - and I was impressed. Enough to risk a Chicken Ala Kiev as my entree. The crust gave me high hopes with it's light golden-brown colour, the potatoes were the perfect mixture of sweet and seasoning on my first bite. The cons? The butter. The very idea of ala Kiev I have involves butter streaming out as soon as my knife pierces through - never mind the consequences for my heart. The butter oozed out here, it didn't stream. And the vegetables were watery and tasteless, something that puts me off my greens and simultaneously earns the ire of my mother. 

Moving on to Indian, which is also the main fare served here, I can happily say that Kwality doesn't disappoint. The Chana and Kulcha combination is one of their most famous, and I will carry the memory of their Cheese Kulcha for the next couple of days - crisp at the edges and with a consistent filling - just the way I like it. The kebabs aren't a let down either, despite the extremely overspiced onions they serve with it. Overspiced meaning that they're almost coloured red with the spices. Chicken and mutton dishes are very decent - standouts being the Chicken Butter Masala and the Rogan Josh. Besides the Chana-Kulcha/Bhatura combination, the one other must-try here is the Tandoori Chicken - the first thing my grandmother reminisced about when she walked in here. 

And finally, to the deserts we come. Reasonably famous amongst people with a sweet tooth, Kwality does not disappoint. Their ice-cream (since I'm told it's homemade) and their Tutti-frutti are standouts, and so is the seasonal Mango Melba - a very sinful portion of which I enjoyed today. 

With decent prices and even more decent food, Kwality is a place I'd visit again if I wasn't aiming to impress my fellow eaters. One a side note, I was severely disappointed when I actually had to request a waiter to offer me a refill of water; that is something which is not expected from a restaurant of such (pardon the pun) quality. Also, a place like this needs a better designed menu card. Just a suggestion.

Not all that is old is really gold! Kwality has been around for years and was one the best restaurants in Kolkata back in the times.. but now it "quality" has really taken a nose dive.. it still sees a steady stream of customers because of its old popularity but almost everyone goes out unsatisfied. As I had visited it after a long time.. the new decor gave a good first impression. But the expectations were broken as soon as we sat to order.  The service was slow and waiters seemed to be a disinterested lot. Then when the food finally came it was tasteless and bland. A bad case of resting on past laurels. Three things make for a good restaurant.. food, decor and service and the restaurant fails on 2 counts miserably.

This resturant is filled with rude impolite stewards and waiters. I have been to over 100 restaurants in Calcutta and this definitely has the most ill mannered people. We were 18 people who came to dine on 4 June, only 8 of us had arrived to seat when we were rudely said to wait outside unless everyone arrives, disgusting. What the hell did my guests from Delhi think. The main course is basically a selection of 5 for veggies. Food quite below average. One step up and bbq ate miles better. In food and service, its no way a family restaurant. Good for orthodox people and business class who don't give a damn to food.

Consistent high quality food at Kwality!
3.5 out of 5

Delicious food, cosy ambience and good service is a very rare combination altogether. Most restaurants meet any two of the above criteria, but finding all three together is rare, to say the least. I have been to a very few restaurants where I actually liked the ambience, food and services all together. Kwality is one such restaurant where you can find this rare combination. Although, Kwality has two outlets in Kolkata, I have always been to the one at Park Street (since I was a chid). I must say that I quite like the brightly lit interiors of this restaurant. The plush sofas and cushioned chairs offer seating arrangement for many diners.

Eating at Kwality is not at all an expensive affair. Meal for two costs Rs.800 approximately (VAT is extra).  I have tasted both the Indian as well as Chinese preparations at Kwality and I like both these cuisines.  I have tried their sweet corn chicken soup and fried chicken as starter and I simply loved both these preparations. Whenever I ordered anything other than Indian food, my main course items have consisted of chicken tetrazzini, chicken mayonnaise, chilli prawns, chicken chowmein and chicken fried rice here. 

Any Indian a la carte meal here almost always consists of a combination of the following - chicken do piaza, chicken reshmi butter masala, rogan josh, saag meat, jeera pulao and (this is the best in town here!) chana bhathura. I always liked their tandoori chicken and mutton seekh kabab as startersas they are just awesome!

Not that you always have to eat a three-course meal at Kwality. You can also try some snacks and munchies any hour of the day. Kwality prepares some lip smacking paneer pakoras, egg pakoras, samosa chaats, sandwiches and stuffed omelettes. You can treat yourself on the above delicacies with some piping hot tea, coffee or chocolate shake (if you love chocolate).

'Old is gold' , and even if its not 'gold' it is always reliable and restaurants such as Kwality prove the point. It has proudly stood all these years  right beside Oxford Bookstore on Park Street and even though it might fall short of a few things it is always reliable. I personally feel when visiting these old restaurants one should stick to the heritage items which are well prepared and not venture into unknown territory which might be disappointing. There was a time when Baskin Robbins and any other chain of ice-cream had yet to set foot in town and those were the times when one could get extremely good ice-creams in this heritage restaurant. Their continental items are simple yet delicious, for instance the roast chicken which is coated with a nice burnt sauce served with potatoes and other steamed vegetables is delicious and very reasonably priced. The baked fish was creamy with chunks of soft fillet of fish and an instant hit with my little brother. The food from their Indian spread is not authentic or exquisite but quite delicious. The tandoori is far too spicy (not hot but has an overdose of garam masala ) in my opinion. Their ice-creams which are made by the restaurant is still very delicious. The chicken butter masala has a standard taste to it. Overall even though the decor might not be trendy and the ambiance might not be ultra modern but the restaurant can be compared to an old reliable friend. The bonus is the unpretentious food and the reasonable pricing.

Kwality is indeed a heritage restaurant located beside The Park on Park Street but of late it has endangered all its reputation by making wholesale changes in the seating style and food quality has gone down tremendously. The tables are ver small and an 2 average people can hardly sit on a single sofa in some seats. The place is still bustling with people due to the huge reputation it has. The ambiance has become like a fish market. The drinkers there often create an uproar which can really spoil your lunch/dinner (and then we are told they are Regulars!).

The food quality has become sorry. The starters and soup were so bad on my last visit that we literally went to BarBQ for dinner after that. The prices are soaring even after all this. The north indian is the lone saving grace for this place which isnt reason enough for me to visit this place again.2 stars for Kwality.

Went in, had a look inside and first impressions were good. That's when the good stopped.

The service is slow, the tables are too small - our 4 seat table had just about enough space to hold the plates, glasses and cutlery for 4 people. Thankfully there were 3 of us so there was space on the table for our food. The spare chair on the table was used as a shelf for keeping menus. Time and again a server would appear to either pick up or drop off menus. The space in the wall behind our table was used to keep the water jug. Pfft, remove one table, and get a station for the menus and water! Jeez.

So it wasn't the experience I expected. But the main thing is the food. If that is excellent, everything else becomes secondary.

So, the food. Their menu is awfully limited. Not enough choices. But that's okay. Do few things and do them well.

Unfortunately the food wasn't anything more than average.

With a lot of places with much much better food and service, and in the same price range, a short walk from Kwality, don't think I'll ever go their again.

Had gone with my family for lunch to Kwality . Nothing in the restaurant  had anything to do with quality, it is their good luck it isnt named as Quality. The ambience was shabby,the tables were in a wretched condition. There were several floor managers but no station for them,they did not even have the courtesy to hand the menus just dropped them on the table, and after placing the order they just took the menus and flung it next to our table. None of the floor managers came to check on us after. A server came with glasses of water with water dripping all over.When we requested for mineral water he just threw the water from the glasses and placed it on the table and came and placed a bottle of water on the table.He then placed the side dishes with napkins on the table and gave us spoons and forks without giving enough for all just randomly.The drinks we ordered were given 25 mins later and then fried prawn starter was served which was shabbily presented. Maincourse plates were then given with stains of dirt on them . When I returned my plate for another a dirtier plate was given. main course served was horrible to eat specially the chana masala tasted of excessive soda. We had to ask them to give the accompaniments with the meal they were least bothered about service. When the horrid meal was over the server gave bowls of water to clean our hands and he just spilled the water all over the table. In all the food and whole experience was the worst I have ever had in a restaurant.Would recommend people that if you want a good meal without wasting your money please never go there.

Kwality is an very old restuarent, has not been renovated for atleast 17years now as that's first I went there, waiters are also of same period hence are complacent, slow and antiquated form of service although I have not faced any serious problem. Food quality is not same as what it was 5-7years ago. Try Chilli Prawns, Brain masala, Mutton Saag or Fried Fish, for vegetarians can recommend Palak Paneer or Daal. Overall food is average hence do not come with very high expectations but I will not say I am disappointed either. Another thing to add is drinks are also OK priced.

Once upon a time Kwality used to be a good restaurant but is worsening. You get Continental and North Indian Cuisine here. 

One thing to be improved there is the waiters....they are rude and much inattentive. Food quantity is fine and prices are not worth it now. I have been eating the Baked Fish there many times but when i went there this december, it was flavourless,,believe me.......

A lot of improvement is needed specially with staffs and also the quality of food.
i would rate 2.5 for Kwality.

Probably the worst meal I have had in Kolkata. From the supercilious attitude of the waiters, the limited menu, and the absolutely tasteless food, everything about this place was wrong. Considering the quality and taste of food, the prices are amazingly high - you can do far better for far less in their Park Street neighbourhood.
Simply avoid - even if you have to die of hunger!

Ive been a regular at kwality since the last 7-8 years. wenever i crave a hearty north indian meal, kwality is the place for me.. even though im a vegetarian, i find kwality having an excellent vegetarian menu. the paneer tikka, dahi kebabs, veg gold coins and their most simple starter- masala chips are to die for..many people wud account for the amazing pindi chana they serve. the food is not too heavy like many other north indian eateries in calcutta. its light on ur stomach and not too heavy on ur pocket. i find it well maintained with courteous staff and a warm ambience. ive never faced any issue with service or any dish over here. so i can safely maintain that kwality is one the best restaurants that kolkata can offer.

Snacks are real good over here. We take biriyani but it was very dry. It is good if you limit yourself within drinks and snacks. Chicken mayonnaise is very good. It is good to avoid the main courses like biriyani.

Old place that you can always rely on when confused about where to go and what to eat.

The food has been consistently good (not very good though) all through the years. There has been no change in their mutton and chicken curry... its has been consistently yummy.

The best dish that we always have at Kwality is Pindi Chana and Bhtura. The Chana's are just perfect.

Kwality.. Located in Park Street .. Just beside The Park Hotel. A perfect example of a restaurant from yester years, which failed to keep up with time. Not everything in Kwality is as good as it was before. This place is nice but you really have to look beyond the middle-aged group of people mostly businessmen drinking and making merry. However, if you can overlook that, you might have a nice time. The food is not good, both quality and quantity. And it is quite over priced for the food they serve. There was nothing which was stand out to mention here. It has very less options for the Vegetarians - hardly 10/12 in the main course. The service too is also slow. One star.

According to me, its a very gratifying place for having north indian and continental food. My favourite is the Baked fish. I just cannot find the taste of the baked fish anywhere else. Ambience is pleasant and sitting arrangement is also comfy. The only disadvantage here is that,they serve food very lately. Service and staff is very poor. Pricing is okay and food is also up to the mark. Suggestion goes obviously. Staffs are not good at service. Kwality has totally lost its standard and its reaching near ruin. But anyway i have fallen out of favour of baked fish. Only 2 stars is ideal for "Modern day's Kwality"

The days of the glory are fast gone if you cannot keep up the place. Well that's exactly what happened with this place. Once a glorious place in Park street for families now a average place slipping in the ruins.

The food is decent and not that great as if used to be. But I would still give it a average score as some of the items in the menu are really delicious. 

The services is executed by arrogant staff members and ambiance is decent.

The verdict:-
Food/Taste - 3/5
Service - 2.5/5
Value for Money - 2.5/5
Ambiance - 3/5

Make sure you check the food before eating for its right temperature and freshness. Still, an average place for families.

i wouldn't want to give this place a single star .... just because its on park street, its got a steady business ... me being a vegan, its just pathetic ... plus the biggest problem is the pricing, its low on quantity and expensive on the other end, and the food is really not that great ... so all in all if you want to try any restaurant for north indian food on park street, please do not go to Kwality.

1. This is a relic of days gone by, and I love to go here to go back to days gone by. The ambience, waiters, food etc.. is just the same as it has always been. The clientele is usually repeat customers.
2. The 'hip' new generation that has never seen a casette player will not 'get' this place.
3. Well cooked, simple, tasty food, priced reasonably (not cheap, but reasonable). The menu is the same as it was for decades.
4. I love the fish cutlets.
5. The menu is not extensive. The food is mainly unpretentious comfort food. It is not swanky.
