Never been fond of South Indian cuisine, but located close to my work place, we often order from this place. The filter coffee is something which I can die for and so ar the vadas. Food is good but since I am not fond of them, i end up feeling average about them. Recommended if you love Idly, Dosa and the likes

Had a nice South Indian lunch with colleagues at Rao’s Udipi. Set Thali meal was wholesome, Sambhar actually tasted very authentic & flavourful. Dosas are of good quality. Finished the meal with Hot cup of Filter coffee.

My husband loves South Indian food and thus we have bee regulars at the original Udupi at Deshapriya Park. We loved going there. Old house, no AC, but good hearty food. We went to this one for the first time. Fancier looking, good location but the food was not up to the mark. We took Dosa and tried dahi vada. Both were disappointing.

Udipi home for breakfast. Idlis are average. Vada was nice. Masala vada was undercooked. Their sambar is nice. 3 types of chutneys - coconut, chili and coriander. Filter coffee is nice. Good place for dosas.

It's located near Vivekanand park. Small South Indian outlet. 
It's has good taste as you find in most of the South Indian joints in calcutta. 
Dhaniya dosa
Filter coffee 
Green and red chutney are some of the things must have. 
Idli is nice and soft.

This is a name that's been going around since my dad was my age. Famous for its South Indian cuisine, the interior is plain and unadorned. It has a small space on the outside as well, suitable for a group of 4 to 5. The food is good. Uttapam's, Idli Sambar, Dosas and Vadas. Good place for breakfast/lunch if you're in the mood for authentic and affordable South Indian food :)

The place having a below par ambience and the day I visited the food quality was average too, rather even below. Most pf the items listed on the menu were not available. They kept on serving us Jain sambhar even when we refused to accept. The service provided by staff was very rude. Basic etiquette and hospitality wasn't there. This experience was really a bad one compared to the other times I visited. I probably won't visit this place as more south restaurants have come up and until I hear some good reviews of this place.

This eating house is located in a small road opposite to Car fill petrol pump in Deshapriya park. From outside it may look like a small eatery but it is not that small and has enough tables and chairs. Now the service is quite fast and the food was really good. The only thing was if it had ac then we could have enjoyed the food more being comfortable.

This small south indian joint is located near Vivekananda Park beside Southern Avenue. They serve delicious south indian dishes that will satisfy your taste buds. Their chutneys here are different and can be something that you may or may not like. They have three different types of chutneys but I didn't like any of them much. The ambience is very mediocre and not some place to take lot of selfies. They are mostly well known as a breakfast place as they open early to lots of hungry families who regularly have breakfast here. Service here is equally ordinary keeping with the interior and nothing great. In short, come here, eat and move on. No point spending long hours here. Definitely not a place to bring your girlfriend.

If you want to taste authentic South Indian food, then this is one place to be. The dosas,  Rava dosas,  Idlis and Vadas... you name it... they've got it. They provide unique chutneys (coconut, mint and tomato) along with the above which really does add that extra special bit to the flavours.The fruit juices on offer are exquisite. The seating space is small, but spread over two floors and that allows quite a number of people to be seated. The service is quite homely. The prices are pretty reasonable too. 
A cosy little place,  comfortable in all aspects.

Best POSSIBLE South Indian restaurant in Kolkata. After trying so called joints at Manohar Pukur Road or Lake Road or typical Kolkata based south food, I was really disgusted. If you want to get true or nearest to foods served by Sarvana Bhavan , please try this joint. However they do not serve lunch or dinner.

This has been a personal favourite for years now!
I would go here whenever I needed time all by myself...sip some juice,usually watermelon and order a Rava Masala dosa which crisp,yum & as south-ey as it gets.
Always finish it off with the madrasi coffee here!
The staff is alert & friendly While the place is warm & pocket friendly!
It's the place for you if you like digging into authentic,no- frills food at your own (really slow) pace!
Chill maadi!

Ratings 4.5 - for the consistency in taste & nostalgia over the years! 
Rao's udipi home tucked in a lane in jatin das rd has been my favourite for years! Would love to sit outside on chairs placed on the footpath during winters & indoors during summers/rainy season! Masala Vada with 3 different chutneys (coconut, tomato & mint) & sambhar always taste awesome! The rawa dosa tastes crisp & the idlis are soft & filling! The owner Mr Rao (in his eighties or more) is a charming personality with a witty keralite humour! My love for filter coffee ☕ developed from here and till date sip from their brass tumbler whenever I get a chance! Probably one of the best filter coffees available in Kolkata! 
Cost for 2 would be anything between 150-300 depending upon the items, but its worth its bucks! 

P. S. Their entrance has a proud notice of serving the then president of India Mr Abdul Kalam! #kolkatavegfoodwalk #nomnom #delicious #streetfood #foodie #instafood #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodporn #blogger #foodblogger #foodblog #vegetarian #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #kolkata #southindia #southindian #vada

Located near Vivekananda park,  this is a south Indian food joint. It is very spacious and one can enjoy the lip smacking dosas accompanied by the view outside. It is a two storey restaurant. I visited it today evening and had masala dosa which was very nice. I also tried the sambar idli and sambar vada. The sambar is perfectly spiced, not too tangy. Service is very quick and price is reasonable.

Family run, spotlessly clean, fresh food aroma, efficient service, pocket friendly and just plain good South Indian food, housed in the broad balcony of a lovely old mansion - this is a quintessentially old Kolkata experience - when the Lake Market area used to the hub of the South Indian community. 

This is my go-to place for idly & upma breakfast while the kids at home prefer the dosas. I also frequently take away upma for breakfast at home and the wait time is literally 2 minutes as fresh food is kept in steaming cauldrons and served with over generous servings of sambar & chutneys. The fresh fruit juices are also excellent. 

Highly recommended if one is looking for good simple food. 
Avoid if you expect fancy setting, seating, etc.

Cheap n Tasty..!! Thats what you want. Yummy cheese masala dosa..though cheese was less applied in amount..deep fried onion uttapaam tastes pretty good. Best thing is its cheaper dan many other South Indian restaurants. I hope food here, stays dis cheap in future too, so dat we can have it. :D

Always feels at home here!!! Lovely food as usual.Would recommend all to drop in here... Come for Dosa, come for Idli, or just come for the filter coffee... The real stuff always my favourite.

Visited this outlet last weekend.Me and my friend ordered sada onion dosa and mixed uttahapam.Both the items were very tasty.Behaviour of the staff is also good.The only drawback that I see is the shortage of space for which the number of tables is inadequate.The filter coeffee here is also good.Looking forward for another visit here soon.

Raos upidi home located in the bylanes of southern avenue is the revamped version of udipi which is also pretty close by. I have been here once but I usually order in food from here when at work.
I have tried their masala dosa , rava masala Dosa, cheese onion rava Dosa, onion uttapam. The tomato rice is amazing here and makes for a complete meal with papad and curd. 
The food is delicious and the sambhar here is my favorite. They serve three chutneys ( coconut, tomato and coriander mint) and all three are equally good.
The food is always neatly packed. 
A good option for good south Indian. Especially recommended for those who like evolved Dosa dishes like, rava, cheese, dhania etc.

Located so close to Vivekananda Park… this place knows it location well… it is right next to Coffee n Mood and Karma Fitness… coming to the place I think maximum of us know the Actual Udipi home in the middle of lake market and deshpriya park… wee that place is gem and one of Kolkata best south indian food can be found there….

This place is of the same Udipi Home which is there for many years… to the level it is same that the sambar and the chutneys and the main idli batter and dosa batter is bought from there itself… by doing so they have made sure that the food quality is still the same as before and people cannot and should not complain about that…

On the other hand they have taken the trained dosa maker guy from their old place and put him here… so he knows his job very well and makes the perfect dosa and uttapams…

Many places in Kolkata it seems is going down in terms of south indian cuisine… the market is increasing and a lot of people choose to eat this… I personally love the cuisine and can have it any time….

Though there are places to go but their quality and taste is going down and you wont enjoy it as you would a couple of years back… fortunately that is not the case with Udipi.. their taste has not changed and neither has their style…

They serve you one of the best sambars in town and with that they serve 3 varieties of Chutney… Normal, Tomato and Coriander… all 3 are just great to taste…

Udipi is known for its soft idlis and this place does not disappoint… in the dosa section I always order the paper dosa which always does come as thin as paper and crisp to the core…

The service is good as well… I always sit in the ground floor and the people are right there and always helpful… maximum times I don’t even have to ask for refills as they are standing ready with the same.

Over and above I am a regular at this place as the food is just awesome and the location just great…

I have always been a fan of South Indian delicacies and what can be better than an outlet dedicated for South Indian cuisines. For a quick bite or for filling our appetite during lunch or dinner, this outlet near Vivekananda's park(Southern Avenue) is a good vegetarian option. Nothing different from other South Indian outlets, it manages to do justice to it's preparations.

South indian is any day not my cup of tea. Still on a sunday noon i went to this place with my brother, we were so hungry. N they were tooo fast to meet our demands within minutes they just placed our order, nd i loved it, proper fresh and authentic south indian.

We had onion masala dosa which was crispy and tasty and the same time, masala was amazingly made with proper flavours, chutney was with proper smell if coconut and they have given 3 types if chutney nd all of them was good tangy and different. Butter idli was very soft, buttery, amazing texture and yum, so that was the day i enjoyed my south indian lunch at rao's udippi home.

Pocket friendly, easy to locate as it is just near vivekananda park. Ambience is like very common with iron chairs and quiet a congested area, but food there is just worth to have. So i was just in another world after that south indian meal so please go n have it!!😊

Located just near Deshapriya Park, just behind Lake Road, Rao's Udipi Home has been one of the popular names serving South Indian delicacies in a locality, which does have numerous competitors of providing the same. As a South Indian, there are few such delicacies, which are available in only pure and authentic eateries. 
I had Tomato Rice, which had Raita and two chutneys ( Pudina and Cocounut) as a side dip option along with a Papad. Taste wise it was absolutely brilliant and there aint a reason why, I shouldn't recommend this place for South Indian food lovers. 
Filter Coffee is a mesmerizing beverage for a given South Indian. A cup of authentic filter coffee was served in the typical stainless steel cup and saucer, and the taste was brilliantly authentic. The price of the filter coffee could have been a little lesser, the Tomato rice was super reasonably priced.

Serves very fresh south indian foods. Prices are quite pocket friendly. Service is nice. Food taste is good. Very fresh.
Sitting arrangements are quite in number but the stiff stairs could be difficult for some aged persons. Overall good place.

A nice small place to go to. Unlike other south indian restaurants the chutnis are served separately before the food is served in small covered containers. Which is a very different touch to the traditional way of serving the chutnis along with food on the plate. 
The rava onion cheese dosa is good to taste. Crispy with fried onion and whole peppers to enhance the taste, bit different from the usual. 
The cheese dosa is good but not enough cheese in it. The dosa is although good and soft.
The cold coffee is alright but quite over priced.

Sometimes a good meal served in cleaner neater place adds to the experience. The food has always been good and now in this new and bright place you will enjoy your freshly made mouthwatering south Indian even more. I love the onion rawa dosa(plain) with peppercorn and cumin seeds. Nice and crispy, it tastes great with the green chutney which has a dominant coriander flavour. The idlis are the best, soft and milky white. I loved them dipped in the flavourful sambar. Also tried the south Indian sweet which is essentially like a balusahi. Location is an added advantage with good parking space available. You can do a take away or order it home through their delivery partners. They pack the stuff well and no flavour is lost in transit. Great food at great prices.

Simple is the word , when it comes to this restaurant. They know their South Indian really well. Their menu is quite clear and understandable with usual South dishes. Now the reason this place wins the cherry is it's quantity and taste at THAT PRICE. You will never feel guilty after eating here , it's so pocket friendly and yet delivers what it should . Don't inflate the price and it will be one of the top South Indian restaurant one day.

Edit 1.0 : Last time I had food here the chutneys were a little stale , and dosa had a sour taste. Due to this I will -1 my rating from 4 to 3. Consistency is very important.

Aah aah, after few weeks I m back to my Sunday breakfast review. Last few weeks we went for restaurent he had already been in the past so there was no new review. 

This Udipi home at southern avenue serves super authentic south Indian dishes. Piping hot idly and vada. With three types of chutney and sambar. 

And you don't find them properly served in plates because we went on group of fifteen.  

Like most of the South Indian restaurant it is reasonably priced.

we are regulars at Udipi House.
The breakfast menu is excellent with Dosas of all kinds, their Rava dosas are must try , similarly Idlis , vadas , pongal. Possibly only south indian restaurant in kolkata where idlis and dosas come with 3 chutneys and unlimited quantity of chutney served. 
Crispiest dosas :)
their buttermilk is yummy , nicely spiced.
Overall comfort food for 2 within 120 including coffee.
Lunch veg thali is not that great by the way but considering the price is is kind of ok

New outlet of the joint near Lake Market. Have been to the old outlet numerous times and do not have any complaints. The new place opened up in Pujas and have been there thrice and had mixed experience on all the three occasions. Although the preparation of the food is good , the hygiene factor has scope for improvement. The idli, vada and dosa all were very good served with 3 different varieties of chutney. The milk shake was though a huge disappointment and was over priced . Ordered for a parcel also for parents and surprisingly masala for the masala dosas were missing!

It was an absolute delight to visit this South Indian food joint.. I am a Dosa lover.. Even though the prices are very high but the taste and quality is very good.. The kind of Dosa, sambhar and chatni you find in the East is difficult to find in West India where I now live.. 
The ambiance is very good, properly served dishes and clean environment.. It is near to Priya Cinema and hence could not resist a delicious meal after an excellent movie !!

This is the new outlet of Rao's Udipi Home on Lake Road,near Vivekananda Park on Southern Avenue. The old one is on Jatin Das Road near Deshapriya Park. I have been to their old place on Jatin Das Road innumerable times and even reviewed it. My only grouse against the old place is the ambience and the decor(lacking). In my opinion they needed to look into hygiene. In this new place they have removed my concerns about this. The place is spic and span,with good comfortable seats. The staff too are in uniform....bright orange t'shirts and look smart. But maybe because the restaurant is on two levels I felt that the service was a little slow and tardy.(tho not for us as we were known to the staff from the old restaurant). But I did hear more than one customer complain about slow service). The food was excellent, maintaining their standards. The sada dosa was perfect and tasted great with the three chutneys and sambar. The vada was golden brown and crispy..great. Loved their onion uttapam...though I felt that the size was bigger. Some might like this but I didn't coz I think the old size was just correct. The price is slightly more so maybe that's why they've increased the size so that people feel that they're getting value for their money. But I feel it becomes to much to eat.(heavy),Their filter coffee too was excellent and thankfully still served in the steel glass with katori and not in a glass tumbler. The typical steel glass and katori enhances the aromatic coffee experience in my opinion. This second outlet of Udipi Home is great....can visit innumerable times.

This newly opened branch at Lake Road has kept their standards at par with their master outlet (Deshapriya Park, Sarat Bose Road).

We ordered 'Dahi Vada', 'Cheese Onion Rava Dosa' - 2 Plates, 'Cheese Plain Dosa', 'Onion Rava Dosa' & 'Masala Dosa'...(looks like we entered a maths class learning permutations & combinations with Dosas as learning tool !!!🤑)...as sweet dish we tried 'Mysore Paak' & 'Suji Laddu'.

Good taste, clean new-age ambience, kitchen visible from road through the glass facade...spread across 2 storied sitting provision for approx 32 people, you can also sit outside & sip through the filter coffee once your are done with a light snacks...put together it's a worth try if your are around Lake Road/Southern Avenue.

We paid 705/- for all of the above menus ordered. 

P.s.- 
'Suji Laddu' too hard but was good, but 'Mysore Paak' was too too hard, usually it should not be, if it is fresh.
