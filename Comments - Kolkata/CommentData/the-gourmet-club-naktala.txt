Good food at a reasonable price. We ordered chicken Manchurian fried rice, Manchurian noodles, chicken 65, hot garlic chicken and crispy chicken. The crispy chicken was overcooked. The quantity was huge and taste was also good. A nice place for Chinese food, at a reasonable price.

Really surprised to found quality has gone down drastically. Ordered last Sunday two Mixed Rice Noodle and one Hot Garlic Chicken and one Schezwan Chicken.
1. The person taking the order seems to be with all concerns of this world and therefore took the order half heartedly by repeating several times and said that it will take  45 minutes to deliver. 
2. After one hour  we enquired about our food and another person enquired what we have ordered. We repeated the order but of no use. Another half hour called again, same process of repeating order and then told the delivery person is out for delivery. Another half hour then a call comes that our food is ready for delivery but where to come,  whom we gave  clear instructions about our address. He came and told that he was just given the food and told to go for delivery while address and phone number will be given while he is en route. Finally we got the food. 
1. On getting the food we found that the price varies from the price given in the menu in the site. On enquiring blamed GST by the delivery man though it was only 10/15 Rs difference. 
2. Mixed Rice Noodle was with  little of chicken and egg with no vegetable at all and tasted totally bland.
3. Both the chicken items tasted same and surprisingly sweet while it should have been hot. Both tasted totally bad. 

We had got food from them earlier and both taste and quantities were good but they have disappointed us this time in both these criteria to the infinity. It seems they are taking orders beyond their capacity and that's why quality is deteriorating.

I have given my honest review which goes against them but when you had received good food earlier from them and then such bad food along with late delivery disappoints you Very much. I am attaching the KOT for information.

The quality and quantity of foods is too good. Ambience is also very familiar, but service is so so and this is a pocket friendly restaurant. Overall the restaurant is very good.

This place has been a hunger savior since childhood. Whenever i crave for Chinese food i ring up and order food from this place... Quantity is more than sufficient. One full plate fried rice is enough for two to fill your stomach more than required ðŸ˜… poultry items are very tasty. All of them.. Pocket friendly good food. They are doing a great job.

This is a life saviour restaurant for me. Because when I am really really hungry and crave for Chinese, without burning a hole in my pocket as there is already a big hole (hahah), this is the place I land to. Plus this really really a good restaurant, located in a off place, you can go from Usha bridge( holy home school Kolkata), near mete Masjid. Quantity is super awesome as well the quality. I have been here numeral times. Love their spicy chicken. They don't charge any tax, neither they charge too much.

Situated near the Agradut Club before Brahmapur, this place has become one of my favourite take away ventures whenever I happen to be at my Brother's place which is very close to this place. It is a purely take away venture with hardly any seating arrangements. But the beauty of the place is its food. The sheer quantity which they serve is unbelievable. One portion of rice can feed two young hungry souls (men) and still some portion of it might be left un devoured. The quality is also amazing with nearly all the items being extremely decent and quite delecious specially if you take into account the cheap prices at which they are offered. Overall a highly recommended place for take aways.

The Chinese cuisine is good... Really good along with huge quantity.  One must try the chicken tangri kebab... It's Smoky taste will play with your taste buds. Place to dine is not up to the mark but when you are hungry and ordered a Hunan...it will make ur day.. The services and the staff both are great.. They serve you with a smile which is more important nowadays.. I will give u 4 for that.

Location wise not so convenient. But taste wise I could not underrate this place :)
We decided to go there just because we were super hungry & had no time for cooking also that afternoon.
3 of us were there. So we decided to order 2plates mixed rice and Hunan chicken. Waiter insisted on ordering just one plate rice as he said it would be enough for us. I was amazed.
Anyway we did so.
Surprisingly he was so correct and actually that one plate was more than enough for us.
Quality was very good.
Quantity superb ;)
Would drop in once again for sure â˜º

This place is located very close to my sister's residence and has become one of our most preferred food joints. For a  small food joint, they have quite a tempting menu to choose from. The variety of noodles and fried rice are truly worth trying. The dishes are mostly spicy, but delicious and healthy. The best part is their pricing and the huge quantity you get at such cheap prices. Highly recommended.

Had heard a lot of great things about this small food joint that has garnered great amount of respect as a take away counter over the years. 
Well today I visited this place with a few buddies and it was a pleasant visit. The small joint had a great variety in its menu and dishes that we tried were good. Only disappointment was a certain fish dish that tasted funny. My guess it had something to do with refrigeration of the uncooked fish. 
A dish called Pahari kebab stole the show for me, and the other chicken items were great as well. 
Quantity!!! Oh man!!! That huge quantity. Be it a plate of biryani or a plate of plain fried rice, the quantity is enough to fill the stomachs of two easily. And when you compare it with the price, it's a double Bingo!!
The staff were very friendly and that is a very heartwarming thing to witness. 
The dining area is quite small however. So, getting a seat during rush hours might be a problem.
Quality: 3.5/5
Location: 2.5/5
Quantity: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5

A great experience it was undoubtedly. Will visit again for sure. Had it not been for the fish dish, I would have given it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.

This little food joint near my house is haven for food lovers who having a pocket crunch. Both their chinese and indian preparations are delicious. Ordered tandoori chicken yesterday. The full plate comes with 4 huge pieces that too at â‚¹270 a plate. Other items are equally cheap. In love with Gourmet Club and I urge my fellow friends to give it a try. :)

I am a long time customer of this restaurant since 2009. Unfortunately i never dine in however always ordered from home delivery. The food is awesome from the beginning and there are variety of foods are available herein. Each and every one have knowledge of the food and the suggestions are also fantastic. The manager of the restaurant an the delivery boy (Pinku) is very good in behavior. But, now-a-days, the proprietor (Manash Banerjee) kept two receptionist who take home delivery orders are not that knowledgeable. My humble request is to donate them some idea about foods, which the rest of the people have there.
Last I can say they maintain a good and delicious quality and deliver orders on time.

P.S. Please arrange biriyani as well

This restaurant is located in Northern Park. For me it is convenient and I often order food from here.  Quantity is good enough for two. Tried the momo,:pan-fried, steam (with soup). 
Kebabs, fried rice, chowmein . For some of the items I think it is overpriced. Take away and home delivery and sitting arrangements are there at your service.
