This is a relatively new outlet when compared to some of the oldies in Kolkata and it specializes in South Indian. Although i did not have any specific plans to visit this place, I decided to drop in randomly when I was passing by and ended up ordering a masala dosa.

The dosa, chutney and sambar were all pretty good and the place was hygienic. The service was also quite quick and the waiters were really polite. All in all, my experience was decent and I will definitely be visiting this place in the future to try some of their other stuff.

A simple joint serving delicious South Indian food. The ambiance is OK with typical steel chairs and tables. 

I had tasted Medu Wada Sambhar, Soft Idly, Ring Idly, Paper Chili Onion Dosa and Special Chutneys.

Medu Vada Sambhar taste was authentic and good, Ring Idly was something unique, potato masala filled in the center of the Idly.

Paper Chili Onion Dosa was crispy and good in taste! 

Coconut chutney and sambhar were delicious as well. Special tomato & green coconut chutney were spicy but delicious too!

Staff were courteous and helpful, cost wise reasonable! A must for South Indian food fans!

Two things which I love the most at Kurry Patta is the Plain Paper Dosa cooked in Ghee and the fried Idli. Best in town. Better than Sarvana‚Äôs in Chennai and close to Murugan (The best Ghee Roast in India)! Go eat it to believe it!

This small South Indian outlet is located near theatre road with very ordinary seating arrangement and nothing to mention type ambience but amazing South Indian food. I went to this place for the first time during Saturday lunch hours. Got seated immediately. We Ordered rasam, idli, vada, Mysore masala dosa and onion masala dosa. I must admit that this place is there to give perfect competition to Other popular South Indian places in Kolkata. They have a very fast service and great idlis and chutneys. Their filter coffee again is worth the mention. Quite pocket friendly too. Must visit for a quick South Indian bite if you are hungry and in that area.

Located near the back gate of St. Xavier's this place is a good option for South Indian lovers.
Serves mostly south Indian, it is a soberly made restaurant. Nothing worth mentioning about the ambience.
The food was good.
The Sambhar had the perfect blend of spices.
The molagapudi idli with gun powder is a must try.
The rava dosa is good.
One thing that was different was their options of add ons and lubricants. 
For me a restaurant that is not on a very large scale having these options was impressive.
The only thing, I didn't like was the service.
The staff is customer friendly but probably the chef is very very slow.
The prices are pocket friendly.

Located in the posh area of theatre road kurry patta attracts a teeming crowd mostly from near by colleges. They specialise in different forms of dosa among which cheese dosa is a common favourite. Their winsome menus have a lot of crazy stuff that include a blend of Indian spices with western herbs......apart from being a intoxicating food join their prices are quite pocket friendly üòçüòçüòçüòç

Food portions are good and reasonably priced. The sambhar chutney were super fresh. Service was quick even on a Sunday.. the ring idli and hand churned ice cream were too good. A must visit..

This place is not an extravagant one with something that is out of our imaginations, and that makes it a must visit. A simple place with happy and well lit interior sets the mood just right. The menu has enough options for a foodie to splurge on. It visits the old school south indian dishes with a few new additions. A pocket friendly and easy to locate place which can be visited with both family and friends.

Situated a few steps away from the backgate of St. Xavier's college (while moving towards Moira street), Kurry Patta is a delightful place to have around one's college campus. It isn't very costly and the‚Äã ambience is not bad. The service is very fast and they serve very freshly prepared and well prepared dishes. The Dosas are to die for. Do not miss the pyramid dosa

After a nice short visit to Victoria Memorial we were in need of a nice breakfast. Altough i have heard about this place but was not able to locate it. I called them up several times and they were patient enough to guide me. We had a nice  breakfast and i must say the staffs were very helpful. Coming to the food, i really loved their food. We oderd cheese chilli dosa, plain dosa,  idli & vada & buttermilk. I must say that i have lived in Bangalore for 3 years and the quality of the sambar i got here was exact the same i had there.
All in total we had good time with quality food.  Cheers...keep up the good work.

The chutney could be better. We ordered a chilli vada which was superb. Its a must try. Idlis were soft and well made. Cheese dosa is a must try. Its full of cheese. Dahi Idli was good. It was sweet. I prefer a little salty tho. The gunpowder dosa is bang on. Its a little spicy tho. Its a must try. The fresh lime soda they serve has got the perfect balance of flavours and is super refreshing. üëç

Instead of sounding insanely monotonous, I would rather opt for a subtle phrase to justify my experience -PERFECTLY AVERAGE!

This phrase comes very organically to my mind when I think of my dining experience at Kurry Patta. They may not surprise you with any oomph factor, neither would they disappoint you with the quality of food, just keeping things simple. 
We had-
Mysore Dosa
Gunpowder Dosa
Cheese Chili Dosa 
Sambar Vada
Prices are nominal for a typical South Indian eatery.
Service was extremely fast even on a Sunday. Although new items to the tightly packed strictly South Indian menu would be a welcome addition.

With the increase in the joints for South Indian the quality and options are also increasing. Now going out on a dinner for South Indian has become an option too. This place is just behind the St.Xaviers back gate.
As soon as you enter you get the feeling of a typical South Indian joint, CLean, refreshing and soothing.

Service is good. The sambhar, dosa are really good. Must try the different varieties available. Idlis are soft and vadas are a must try. ( I am not too fond of vadas) yet I loved the crispy vadas here.

Do visit :) Pocket pinch 200/head. Vadakamm :)

I have rarely come across people who doesn't like south Indian food. With the growing love for south Indian food, the number of south Indian joints have also increased. A few excel in their genre while few fail to be at par. Kurry patta happens to be a pioneer at it's genre. I have been going back repeatedly for their idlis and Rasam vada. Dosa's are equally amazing. I love the way they present the food, in white crockeries, it just adds to a class.

And the hot coffee... the serving style is too impressive with steel desi glass and dish which makes it easier for the guest to drink
Overall a good place to invest your money if ur a dosa lover

The experience overall was good.Why:- The food ordered were ¬†Tasty and exactly as showcased. We had some extra requirements which was taken care off properly.Considering the location the place's cheap.(1 idly & wada, 2 different types of dosa and a uttapam within 600).Interior and ambience- 4.5/5 ¬†Service-4/5

This place is very close to my office so have called for food quite a number of times. Love the idliy's they are extremely soft. A must have item here is the mushroom dosa. I love the coconut chutney too its thick and not watery like other south Indian joints. Only thing its a bit expensive.

South Indian vegetarian food at its best. Amazing food at such pocket friendly prices. Interiors are very modest and very simple. We ordered mysore dosa, gunpowder dosa, cheese corn dosa, cheese onion uttapam, appam with korma, idli, vada and an array of special chutneys, and I can't complain about any single thing. All served fresh and hot in a winter morning. Service was at light speed. Highly recommended.

Fabulous food. Loved the diversity in menu and the fact that they were willingness to customize. We went on a Sunday morning, not too much crowd, so the service was reasonably quick. The ambience is friendly, the staff is helpful. They must ensure that the quality of food does not suffer, as they become popular. All th best!

Located right next to St. Xavier's back gate. The bright yellow board is hard to miss. 

As the name suggests that the serves south Indian. Unlike the regular south Indian joints in the area, the place is fresh and fun. The menu looks like a fresher CV, but has a depth of content. Each dish on the menu is tried and tested. I have yet to have a bad dish here. 

I visit the place quite frequently, usually for the dosa but sometimes I like to differ. 

Order Highlights: 

Masala Vada

Gun Powder Dosa

Onion Chilli Dosa

Bissa Belle Rice

Curd Rice

Sitafal Ice cream: Do try if available

Filter Coffee

Located in Hungerford Street near the ¬†back gate of St.Xaviers, The interiors are done well with place having a seating capacity of more than 50.pax ¬†
Was afraid of going there as it was near to empty on a SUNDAY Dinner time, but after having it felt satisfied. We ordered a no. of dishes and all were quite good. Starting from Rasam Vada, Rasam Idly, Normal Idly and Vada, Masala Vada, Onion Chilli Vada, Idly Finger, Cheese Mushroom Dosa, Rava Dosa Masala Dosa and Paper Dosas. All the items were served hot. Only minus point is they serve only Cocnut chutney with the Items. For dessert they only have hand churned Icecream and the quantity they serve is really small. Filter coffee was equally good. Overalla nice south Indian joint and wish to be back there.

Visited Kurry Patta for lunch today...the place was crowded and very noisy...we ordered mushroom dosa  and gun powder rava dosa..with special chutneys. Both the dosa were very tasty and filling..thereafter we had their masala vada which was extremely crunchy and tasty..finished off with their pistachio icecream which I felt was not that tasty considering it was hand made through the sancha..it could have been more creamy, but overall, place worth a visit..will go back to try their other items like appam and appalam..it give the food and decor a four star.

The service here is more or less good except the fact that people could be a bit more friendly. 
However, the food is pretty nice. The appams are pretty delicious, loaded with cheese. 
They need to work on the decor though and also try to put away the coconut smell always lingering in the air.

Located in theater road pretty close to the back gate of St.Xaviers, Kurry Patta was on my wish list for long. Finally, went here for a family dinner today.
The interiors are done well compared to other south indian joints. The place is big covering 60 pax.

We ordered for the following-
‚Ä¢ Idli- finger Chips which was extremely crisp and tasty #recommended
‚Ä¢ Masala vada was stuffed well with dal and spices and was a good order #recommended
‚Ä¢ Cheese chilli Dosa with green chillies and cheese was a good variation from a normal order.
‚Ä¢ Cheese mushroom Dosa was lip smacking #recommended
‚Ä¢ coconut dosa was just about okay
‚Ä¢ Filter coffee was made really well
‚Ä¢ Churned kesar pista icecream was delicious. It was not too heavy! #recommended

PROS-
Food taste and service

CONS-
Small menu, no masala dosa ( you have to order masala separate, sane with green chutney)

Prices are okay considering the quality of food.
One small miss was a hair strand in my icecream, which they later replaced.

Overall, a good experience!

Come here to be ill treated by waiters who lack basic courtesy and etiquette. Even though I have had similar experience here earlier my friends insisted to try this new place .
The waiter one Mr Amit was obnoxious and would not agree to any short comings . Guess the Management has employed him for exactly this reasons. The ring idli that we ordered had less of chutney and tasted bland , on request for some chunti top up ... a very curt answer ... nothing will be changed and additional chutney is chargeable. Very well ... The filter coffee served was room temperature and the thumps up was Flat . On requesting to replace the Thumps up Mr Amit said the Thumps up is Fine and won't be replaced. So we ordered one more fresh Thumps up . It's very clever way my the management to charge you extra by giving Less chutney on the idli that costs you Rs. 130 at a restaurant where the kitchen is noisy and you can hear staff shouting and yelling .

Went to this place on a busy Puja day. We had to wait for 15 minutes for a table of two. I honestly didn't expect it to be so crowded. Nevertheless. The service was quick and good. We tried the masala vada which was quite tasty. The gun powder Dosa was just okay. I didn't love it. The mix veg uttapam was good. 
All in all it was a good meal.

Being a fan of Jyoti Vihar, which in my view has the best South Indian food, the comparison was inevitable and though this place has a lot of variety, I still would take the later any day! 
But that said the food and presentation is still good and the staff attentive.

FIrst of all i liked the name which they have coined for themselves - Kurry Patta. it sounds very refreshing. The interiors are done up very elegantly. From the complexity part the interiors are very simple, yet the look is very refreshing. Usage of yellow and white seems to have worked for them.¬†
The food here is decent. i had their gun powder paper dosa. it was pretty well done up. The taste was mouth watering too. The condiments need more improvement by market standards since they have a higher price point. The service was prompt too.¬†
Overall a good experience and will definitely come back for more. Good job Anant.

I visited it last Sunday and was the place crammed. The waited were all harassed and running around. 
The decor is minimal and functional 

Coming to the food the onion chilli vada was pretty good. Spicy and different. 
The cheese dosage was decent. Nothing great about it. 
The let down was the rawa dosa- twas thick, and undercooked and the masala dosage which was bland. 

There was no paw bhaji available. 

It was an okay experience.

The hand churned icecreams there are a must have, absolutely heaven melting in your mouth and given the price I expect no less. Much recommended. Good for us college goers, satiates economically :)

Food: good. We had masala dosas, ghee idlies with gunpowder and buttermilk. The dosas were nice, though the masala was too little. The ghee idlies were very nice - and I added some gunpowder to it - and it tasted great. Ambience - basic, the seating is adequate, not too comforting. The waiters keep huddling and chatting with each other, and in an empty restaurant with 2 tables occupied, one had to call for their attention. But the waiters were polite, for sure. The doorman was helpful - especially courteous to my parents, who are of age.

We went to this place on one rainy evening to try some hot South Indian food!  The servers are polite and cooperative. We wanted to eat the ring idli on the menu which was sadly not available then.  We ordered masala wada which was average and nothing to write home about.  The chutney was good and sambar was okay. The dosa was spectacular! We ordered the paper masala dosa.  The dosa was made to a T. It was crispy and perfect.  The masala was quite less given the size of the dosa.overall a good place for quick meal out!

Kurry Patta stands apart from most of the south indian joints in the city when it comes to their menu. However,they lack the same in terms of taste. I have had better south indian before so the place was pretty average. The lime soda was awful. 
Pricing is decent. 
P.S - I love the name of the joint. That's what brought me here in the first place.

A simple but elegant decor gives a lovely ambiance to this place. Amongst the very few South Indian joints that serve appam and apalam...beyond the varieties of dosa, idly and uttapams. Decent Andhra style taste, though I found the strong aroma missing in the filter coffee. But would give them 8 on 10 for the Onion Rava Dosa! Most decent place for a South Indian treat in Camac Street area.

The litmus test for a south Indian joint is it's sambhar(according to me) and thankfully this place has good sambhar apart from fantastic idly and Chutni. Although items are limited like bhupis but still the food is at par with bhupis. So buckle up bhupendra mansion you have finally found a rival in the name of kurry patta

Then I ordered a hand churned ice cream for my colleague in sitaphal flavour going by d popular opinion on zomato as expected it to b gud but then surpassed my expectation. I couldn't stop myself frm tasting it...D ice cream melts in d mouth and leaves you to savor d fruit bits‚ô• it was a scoop of heavenüòâ
Thanks to all who recommended it on zomato... it was a treat.

We went to tryout this new place Kurry Patta for lunch. The place serves finger licking food. We had the Rasam Vada since it is not available everywhere. The rasam was very good with just the right amount of spice and tanginess.
We also called for the Bisi Bele Bhaat which was very tasty. 
To finish our meal we called for the hand churned ice cream. They served us the sitaphal flavour and it was excellent with pieces of the fruit in every bite.
To sum it up, a goto place for every foodie in Kolkata.

Heard a lot about this place so came down after travelling 8kms to.Dissapointment to the core...ordered idli and its batter was beyond fermentation and the dosa suddenly turned out to be tasteless and and soft......no South Indian feeling here.food being served in glass plates while the sambar and chutney in steel bowls...like seriously ...what were they thinking....guess it's the first and last time here

This place is right in the heart of Kolkata next to Xaviers back gate. We were treated to lovely food and amazing hospitality. The taste is authentic, do try out the Dhania Dosa and the Onion Uthapam. The sitafal ice-cream is epic much better than Naturals I would say. It's become one of my favourite places in Kolkata :)

Small South Indian restaurant located near Xavier's back gate. Liked the menu. Ordered the rasam with the appalapam, dhaniya rava dosa and a plain rava dosa. The dosas were good. I liked the rasam, though I have absolutely no idea how an authentic rasam tastes. The service was a little slow, considering it is a South Indian joint. But can go there if one is in the vicinity.

Really nice place for authentic south Indian food. Tried the idlis and they were super soft and served hot. The gunpowder dosa was very well made and the bisibella rice was spot on. A great addition to the Kolkata food scene. Great work!!

Went last Saturday to this cute little restaurant on Hungerford Street, a stone's throw from my office. I like well made south indian food and I must say I enjoyed the food here. I had a cheese mushroom dosa which was tasty and innovative. I also liked their coriander coconut chutney even though at Rs.30- extra it is a tad expensive. Their sambar is excellent and like olden days they do give second helpings. The onion masala vada was crunchy, but a little undercooked inside. They have hand churned ice cream, which was fun. ¬†

The sitting arrangement is unimaginative as usual and single diners are stared at (both by waiters and other diners) in this country as if they were from Mars. They are also made to sit in the most awkward places - in front of the kitchen, behind a pillar, next to the toilet!

Visited Kurry Patta for the first time this afternoon. If you are looking for excellent South Indian food, a must try. Hygienic and clean place. Great service. Food was excellent.

Must try the Family dosa, rasam idli, butter milk and South Indian coffee. 

Run by a young couple who were personally present, greeting whoever walked in and making sure everything runs smoothly. They were taking personal interest talking to all the guests taking feedback and making sure that everything was running smoothly.

A must visit for people who like South Indian cuisine.

Heard about this new south Indian food joint from friends and was eagerly waiting for a chance to visit and sample their fare. So on a rainy afternoon with shopping in Vardaan also thrown into the outing finally landed up here. Thus place is quite close to Vardaan....near the back gate of St. Xavier's. Liked this place a lot. If you like South Indian food then you must visit this place. Tastewise the food was good,whatever we had made us happy. But yes, price wise it is definitely higher than other South Indian food joints. But if they continue to deliver good quality in food and good ambience then one doesn't mind paying a little more.
I simply loved the rasam vada. The rasam was just perfect for a rainy day, tingling the taste buds with its peppery taste. It was slightly spicy but the blend of spices was completely to my liking. The Mysore dosa too was excellent with the potato masala and gunpowder masala combined well together. The mixed Veg Uttapam too was good, well cooked. They informed,when we ordered that it'll take some time and we were ok. with that as we weren't in any hurry. We continued our adda and very soon the plate of Uttapam was on our table. We ended the meal with their hand churned icecreams...the sitaphal one was delicious imparting true flavours and taste of the fruit. The kesar pista was ordinary. But one minus point about this place...the service needs to buck up. They don't see if you need more chutney and sambaar and come immediately. But otherwise servers were courteous and helpful.
Place definitely recommended and I will also go back whenever I can.

I went to Kurry Patta this afternoon for lunch with my mom. She being a devoted fan of South Indian food, wanted to visit this place since she had seen it.

I really like the font with which Kurry Patta has been written. The place is neat and simple though the chairs deserve a special mention.

We were warmly greeted by someone who seemed to be the owner. Service was quick. Food was served totally as per order.

An interesting feature is that though the dosa menu is not too elaborate, each dosa is customisable in ( plain / paper / rava) options.

We had
Idli
Vada
Mushroom paper dosa with masala add on
Sitaphal hand churned ice cream

The idli and vada were good. The dosa was crisp and as per a paper dosa should be. The Masala was yummy. I was not impressed with sambhar here. Nor did the chutney score marks with me. Nothing wrong with them. Just did not excite my taste buds enough.

The mushroom topping is a bad option with paper dosa if it's without cheese I realised. The mushroom was not clinging on to the dosa.

But all's well that ends well they say.

The sitaphal hand churned ice cream was beautiful. It was goodness in each bite. The sweetness quotient was just perfect and it was a well churned ice cream. There were pieces of the fruit in every bite. It was something I'll keep going back for. I'm craving more of it while writing this.

Alas! after having visited so many traditionally oriented South Indian joints, this new rendezvous right in the heart of the city is a pleasant delight for many a foodies and those that love our very own Dakshin ka khana. Khana ka khazana is how I will refer to this place. Very well lit and contemporary setting makes it feel all the more lively which you ideally don't expect from a South Indian hangout. Kudos to the couple who personally manage the place by their own. Very smart and young people. Thumsup!!!

God! You ought to try the family dosa, please get your entire family to gobble up else you may need the help of the neighbours on the next table. Splendidly courteous, sambar helpings are unlimited and so are the chutneys. Do try the tomato onion chutney!!  

I m crazy about the idea of cheese mushroom dosa and I would thus rate their dosa a notch above the one at Garden Cafe. Superb Idlis, gigantic vadas, lovely rasam and to top it all, the best fresh lime water juice as you get in Udipi. (Udipi is a small town in Karnataka where dosa took birth. Thus you find Udipi restaurants in every city in our country.) crushed ice missing though; they can have it as an option.

I reached when it was raining and to my taste buds content I won't crib about getting wet. Request the management to arrange a shade for the guests waiting unless you want to cure their cold with your warm Sambars and Rasams :) ;)

In the end, since it's new I would give the staff a little more time to settle down and learn to handle heavy traffic on weekends. Until then guys #happyfooding  at #kurrypatta.

Simplicity is reflected when the food comes and crockery is not extravagant. Do well people!!! All the foody love üíöüíØ

So had been to this place last nite, to start with would  say thou a south indian joint but more a restaurant kinda feel. Had ordered rasam vada - thumbs up to the taste. Chilly onion vada - nice again , pav bhaaji ( yeah i know its a south indian joint ) but still very good to taste. Takes ur memory back to mumbai 
Nd then the moor or the butter milk spiced up. A bit spicy if u cant have but i relished every sip of it and then to sum it up had ordered their homemade sitafal hand churned ice cream thou they only serve a scoop , alas njoyed - will be back soon

We visited on a crowded Sunday afternoon, but the quality of food, taste and the service were bang on. The special coconut chutney and the masala vada were finger licking good. The idlis were super soft and the pav-bhaji deserves a special mention as the pavs were grilled to perfection. After such a tasty first course the expectation from the dosas were sky high and boy did they live up to it. The dosas were perfectly cooked and were very light. In summary this restaurant is a must visit.

visited this place on saturday evening....place was neat and clean with decent interiors and was  almost full. we ordered onion vada, dhania dosa, gunpowder dosa and chilly cheese dosa. 

vadas were nicely done ....light and crispy....must say one of the best in city though for price charged  felt it is small in size

dosas - were nicely made and tasted good

chutney- the quality of regular chutney is nice and fresh

sambhar- was hot and ok types....jain option was also available.

service- was really quick and the entire order was served within 10 minutes of ordering, even request for refill of chutney and sambhar was prompt.

¬†bill for entire order with taxes was 500

My only suggestion to the owners would be if they can improve upon quantity of servings.....otherwise they are doing a very nice job and I am sure soon this place will be among the best joints for south indian food in town

As fond of Southindian food, we wanted to try this new restaurant , but was very disappointed.
We ordered masala dosa - the size was less than average, the filling also was little, the dosa was hardly crispy... The cocounut chutney was tasteless. Dosas made at home would be far better....
The waiters kept parading the table area which was very annoying.
He was waiting to sntach away the plate, the moment we had finished eating...even though the restaurant was empty....awful trained staff...no courtesy to let guests eat in peace...
The managemnet should think in a big way to look at these aspects else this restaiurant will earn a bad name

Happened to be passing by after shopping n decided to dine here as my three n a half year old daughter likes eating idlis. It's a nice place with simple yet pleasing decor nothing very over the top. This area lacks a good south indian joint so I was pretty much pleased to dine here.
 The idlis were nice n soft. The dosas were good too. The paper dosa needs to be crispier. The sambar was fine but the coconut chutney was great. One thing worth mention is their fried idli it was crispy outside n soft inside, a real winner.
I found the staff, though new and a little under trained, quite attentive n friendly. The owner was also on his toes attending customers.
Over all a good experience.

Coming to the food we ordered Mysore Dosa, Dhaniya Dosa, Khichudi. All the items tasted really good particularly Khichudi as it was made in South Indian style. The owner Mr. Kanoi was was receptive and was continuously monitoring everything. Will visit the place again soon.

By seeing the reviews in zomato I thought that this would be a good south Indian restaurant. But after visiting this restaurant I don't think so that those reviews were true . The service is very poor. And..the waiters r quiet impolite. They don't pay any heed to their customer's satisfaction. They should be well trained that how to treat the customers .
I told the waiters to lower the ac atleast for three times but they did not pay any heed. 
It is considered to be a rude behaviour . 
They don't even provide the menu and ask for the order before. This shows the lack of concentration in waiters. We should not visit this restaurant with guests .

Very well located, near St. Xavier's college back gate. This place can seat around 40-50 people.
I would like to start by saying that i understand that Sunday's are busy for restaurants. But a new restaurant like this should have better service. I found the behavior of the owner extremely impolite and I don't think, I can visit this place again. The gentleman came and asked us to place the order at least thrice within ten minutes of being seated. I understand he needs to be quick. But he did not notice that the first time his waiters had not even given us the menu. The third time he asked I was extremely pissed off and wanted to leave but din because I had guests with me. The owner did not check if water was served on the table. But he checked if the order was placed or not. Sir, I think if your waiters din have enough time to serve water on the tables then I don't think they had time to take the order as well.
I did not really have time to read their menu because of the owners insistence on placing the order. So I just ordered basic idli and rava dosa which I think the owner must have placed on the menu. 
The taste of the food was good. Though the size of their dosas was a little small, and the waiters took a lot of time to get chutney and sambhar. 
One small suggestion, please change your plates, dosas stick to plates you serve in. Almost half the dosa went waste as I couldn't get it off the plate. 
All in all, I would say there are much better South Indian Restaurants in Kolkata, so don't take your guests to this restaurant as you may be embarrassed.

Went to this place on a Sunday with a lot of excitement but was disappointed. Kurry Pata is a new South Indian joint located just opposite Saturday Club. The d√©cor is okay and so was the food. Though the idlis were quite good and soft, the masala of the dosas was quite bland. The mushroom and cheese dosa was decent but I've had better. The chutney and sambar were nice. The size of the dosas were also small as compared to other south Indian joints. Another thing which was a huge let down , was the service of this place. The manager came to our table 2-3 times to know whether we had ordered but water was served to us 10 minutes after arriving. In spite of requesting the staff to lower the temperature of the air conditioner twice , they turned a deaf ear to our requests. The staff was also not attentive and efficient even though there were enough of them. We had to remind them to get extra chutney and sambar 2-3 times before they got some for us. The prices were also relatively higher than other south Indian joints, keeping the quality and service in mind. All in all the service of the place was very disappointing and I would not want to visit this place again.

I guess because this place is new they are not able to keep up with the demand on weekends. Went on Sunday for lunch and they were out of pav bhaji, montecarlo among other things. Appam is in the menu but not started yet. Service is slow and requires further efficiency wrt clearing plates and not forgetting to get some food items ordered and inform correctly. Food quality is also average. Ordered a Dhania dosa and found that it is much better in roof top. Rava dosa was good but again everything else was normal. I hope the management takes this review positively to improve things as the location is good and the place ambience and tables are good for a south Indian place as everyone is aware there are always a lot of other good south Indian places people can flock too instead.

If it can maintain its quality and service, it eill be here for the long haul.

Try out Kurry Patta for the best South Indian in the city. The family dosa is outstanding! The vadas are super crunchy. And don't forget to try the chutneys! We finished our meal with Monte Carlo ice cream - perfect end to our great meal! Also the service is fast. Highly recommended!

Had been to this south Indian joint tonight with my wife and daughter,nice taste of vada and dosa,sambhar was also good.
Service was excellent.
Personal attention by the owners which was nice to see.
Regarding improvement,special chutney should be a bit spicy.
Plain Dosa should be a little bit crisp(not like paper).

Absolutely outstanding food and service. The best part is that the owner is present during dinner hours to personally supervise the quality and service which makes all the difference. Prices are reasonable and quantities are good. We were 5 of us and the bill came to about Rs. 920.

Their vadas are light, crisp and fluffy. Their dosas are like we have never tasted anywhere else before. Only disappointment was that they had run out of desserts but that only speaks for the popularity of this new restaurant. And above all, the place is spotlessly clean. Highly recommended for those looking for excellent food combined with fast, courteous and efficient service.

Went here for lunch today around 2:30 pm. My nephew who's just 8 reached half n hour before me and was waiting inside for me to reach. The owner Mrs. Kanoria took great care of him and helped him order a pyramid dosa and idli.
We ordered for the gunpowder paper dosa and onion chilli rava dosa. Both were absolutely delicious. The idlis were soft and the sambhar just perfect. Loved the tomato onion chutney which you can order separately. The butter milk was fresh and refreshing.. Just what you want in this humid weather. 
The meal ended on their in house kesar post a hand churned ice cream which was super! 
The owners took great care as they came to the table many a times to ask about the quality and our feedback. 
The only disappointment was that they were not serving appam with korma.
The menu is limited which worked perfectly for me because I knew exactly what to order. The food is well priced and doesn't pinch the pocket.
A must visit for anybody who has the palate for South Indian food. Simple place with great flavours!

Kurry Patta is a neat little South India eatery at theatre road. The food is average, tried out the Chilli Mushroom Dosa and Chilli Onion Uttapam with Filter Coffee. The dosa was decent but the Uttapam wasn't upto the mark. The coffee at the end was the saving grace.. ¬†Am i looking to be back again? mmm...maybe...just maybe..

Came here with family. The place looks pretty exciting, with whitish theme and ironed chairs.

We ordered few plates of idly, some plates of vada and a masala dosa. The idly was soft whereas bada was fantastically crispy. Gun powder dosa was simply astounding. I liked the food very much and also it was pretty much enjoyed by the entire family. All the idlies and vadas were yummy and the chutneys and sambher were pretty good too. The service is excellent: prompt and all items come with necessary accompaniments.

Prices are reasonable and you can try a variety of dishes;

The first thing that struck me when I entered the place was the no-fuss interiors - a refreshing change from other places.¬†
Coming to the food - the idlis and the vadas are a must try. There is a choice between plain vada and onion chilli vada - my personal favorite is the latter. If you are a fan of spicy food, then the rasam should definitely be ordered. For the dosas, I called for the Mysore and the Dhania dosa and both of them were lip smacking. There are a few other interesting options such as the Gunpowder dosa and the mushroom dosa which I am reserving for next time. A special mention must be made for the Filter Coffee. The taste is quite authentic and it is exceedingly well made.¬†
Thank you team Kurry Patta, I shall visit soon !!!

I was a little sceptical about having dosa for dinner, but considering how tasteful the experience was at kurry patta, there is no reason to not have this on my itinerary for when i feel like having a not too heavy dinner
the no nonsense approach to interiors was a refreshing change from the shenanigans one is forced to witness at certain diners thus ensuring that the best experience is always served in the menu not off it
i tries paneer rava dosa and topped it with a nice and hot filter coffee
if you are looking for a genuine south indian flavour, kurry patta shall not disappoint for sure

Went to this place seeing its Facebook page. The interiors are very very basic.

The service os very slow. On sunday ¬†when out of 15 tables just 3 tables were occupied, the service was very slow. wonder what would have happened had it been full.

the idli and the chilli onion vada was good, ordered for a gun powder dosa which was also amazing. But the chutney and sambar was very basic. th sambar was more of a hello daal.

when you go for south indian, you generally don't see ambiance or interiors. but the focus is always on quality of food.

i think if they can improve on their chutney, sambar and service, they can do really really well.

location is good. prices are reasonable, looking forward to go again after a month.

Spent the last weekend in the sweetest part of India, Kolkata.  Crossing the Hungerford street felt hungry and landed up in this south indian restaurant with a not so southy but classic look n feel.

Kurry Patta offers a variety of options to full your pallet. I particularly found idli very soft and the Vadas quite crunchy. Overall, had a great time there with my friends. the owner who was also present there was very involved and helpful. This place is a must visit if your around this street.

I guess they should think of opening a branch in Delhi NCR as well... there is a dearth of good South Indian options here.

Ok an honest admission first. Am a die hard fan of south indian cuisine...so when was in kolkata last sunday, and was roaming on the park street, camac street, the hunger pangs suggested me to look for some nice south indian food in the vicinity.....came across this hidden gem in Kurry Patta on the hungerford street, which i later got to understand is a very recent addition, and ya what a great addition to already mesmerizing options available in the land of food.¬†
To start with really liked the calm ambience, soothing yet vibrant interiors (specially the white powder coated iron chairs and the hint of red all across). Then was amazed to see so many Dosa options on the Menu, but ya wanted to lay my hands or should i say my taste buds to the idly vada first before the experimentation. So ordered the idly vada combo which came in a jiffy. It was the softest idly i have had in a while as just about melted in the mouth and the crunchiest yet soft vada i ever had. Gave me a lot of confidence to try out the mysore dosa nd the cheese chilly uthapam...both the items were equally excellent with a very distinct flavor...ordered the specially hand tossed mango icecream and was a treat to have that..simply awsum is the term for it...
Service was decent (dint look like the place opened just a week back) and the owner is a gem of a person and gave so much attention personally to every table...
surely visiting this place everytime am in kolkata...and guys please open one in gurgaon....v really dont have any good options here.

A nice quirky South Indian 'cafe'. Good to see such places opening in our city. 
A variety of innovative dosas and soft idlis makes it a place one must definitely try. Amazing service. 
The variety of rava dosas deserve a special mention. Also, the hand churned mango ice cream is yum! 
Do make sure to ask about the special dish of the day!

Situated in hunger ford street (right next to St Xavier's college back gate), this place comes with a new flavor to South Indian food.. The idly is very soft and tasty.

This has taken over the CCD near the St. Xavier's backdate. A huge 56 seater south Indian restaurant. Location wise it is situated at a great spot. The school and college combined with the offices can give a good impact to this place. 
Coming to the interiors of the place.
Well lit with the colour white being the prominent one. The chairs and tables also look very nice. But the interiors doesn't justify the menu being served. Serving just the basic south Indian Dosa, idli and vada won't be sufficient. The same is available in the roadside stalls too at a cheaper rate.
Ordered a plate of idli, a glass of buttermilk and a  sweet and salty fresh lime soda.

Idli:- 75 per plate and only 2 pieces of idli doesn't justify the cost. The sambar was too sour. The idli was pre made and served. The white chutney was not runny so thank god for that. The red chutney did not have the coconut flavor maybe because the chili was overused.
Yesterday was the first time I tasted buttermilk and it will be the last for sure. It looked diluted and tasted weird. The green chili pieces given were extra, at least for me. 
The fresh lime soda was overloaded with salt and it was just sprite or limca garnished with a lemon wedge.
The only reason my rating is a 3 and not a 2.5 is because of the pretty interiors.

Kurry patta undoubtedly serves some of the best south Indian fare in the city.their super soft idlies and crispy vadas make for a perfect start to a delicious meal.the place also boasts of an extensive dosa menu.The Mysore dosa that I tried is highly recommended.the restaurant is neat and clean with a fun and informal vibe.
Looking forward to my next meal here..
