Ordered food from here on Swiggy. Was pretty good, I would say. Definitely doesn't deserve the 2.5 rating which is currently being shown here on Zomato! Plain Dosa was pretty decent, though not that much crispy! The Rawa Dosa was also upto the standard! Utthapam was really delicious! Though I would say that their Sambar can improve. Chutney was provided aplenty! So was pretty OK. Keeping the price in mind, I would definitely recommend this place, if you are having a craving for good South Indian food within a small budget...

The worst South Indian food I ever had. The Uttapam was horribly undercooked. Just mashed potatoes on half baked rice cake. They did not provide the red chutney and the white Coconut chutney smelled foul, reeking of old coconut powder.  Would not recommend it to anyone who has a taste for authentic South Indian flavours.

There were hair strands in the items.. Found ant in chutney..Stay  food, just heated and given. Very bad quality and also very less quantity. Will never order in this hotel. In fact it is the worst restaurant to have south Indian food in Kolkata.

One of the worst experience I have ever had was at this place. Wanted to have authentic South Indian food hence went ahead and placed the order with them. Curd rice, coconut rice, masala dosa and uttapam was what we ordered. The food tastes horrible. The dosa was stiff and was hard to break. The rice was mushy and was terrible. The food is almost unpalatable and far from being either authentic or south Indian.

Horrible experience,why have they written breakfast delivery when they have not yet started,complete customer dissatisfaction at the onset.When i called they clearly said home delivery post 1pm. Zomato pls ensure that restaurants who publish such in genuine information are blacklisted.

Horrible experience. We ordered Mysore cheese masala dosa which was completely burnt, there was no trace of cheese.. Stuffing was pathetic..no taste.sheer waste of money. Staff whom we rang to ordered replied very rudely when we informed just replied sorry and they can't help. I would recommend people not to waste their money and effort for this place.

Good for south indian foods. Reasonable. Dosa, idli, sambhar, the coconut chutney, their service is also very good. However ektai problem, era dahi vara banate janena. Dahi vara tastes like sweet dish. Vara quality r size dutoi bhalo kintu eto misti, je kheye mone hoyeni je dahi vara. Their chole bhature is also very good as per quality and quantity. Hoping the food quality stays maintained and dahi vara tastes more like dahi vara than sweet dish.
