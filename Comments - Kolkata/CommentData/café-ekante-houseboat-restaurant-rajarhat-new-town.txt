To start with Cafe Ekante lacks a proper description that the House Boat restaurant is entirely thriving on Chinese Cuisine and has no other menu available and the menu listed in Zomato has no connection with what is available there.
#Zomato Team its a must check from your end to have the menu section updated with a proper heads up that what menu is available at Cafe Ekante House Boat Restro- Eco Island outlet. When the place itself ensures such variation in the menu.
However moving forward for people visiting Cafe Ekante first time they should not fall prey to this trick.
What all went bad:-
1. OVERPRICED
2.Quantity is so less that even one adult person cannot feel, filled with one plate of noodles. Honestly the roadside noodles would taste better than this, I expected a much better quality and taste fle the price enduree by me.
3. The Chicken is hard as rubber felt like I was chewing chewing gum.
4.Mineral water over priced.
5. Dimsums were half cooked, though the fillers were properly filled with Chicken.
6. Veggies served with Chicken Lat MaKai were not cooked just fresh cut vegetable added for seasoning however generally vegetable are tossed along with chicken in sauce for added taste, I mean that Is how I had found my chicken at prior Chinese Cuisine outlets and expected the same while placing my order.
Something Good:-
1. Only yhe Fresh lime tasted good.
2. Staff is well behaved amd neatly dressed.
3. Calm serene view of the lake from the houseboat.
For me I fell prey just because I wanted to enjoy the bliss of sitting by the lake and enjoy my lunch, however it turned out to be quite a sour and expensive affair.

Aweful experience!

visit here only if you are accompanied with someone with whom you want to have a romantic dinner..the ambience is beautiful with a view of the lake,well decorated and perfect for couples..But if you are a food lover,my recommendation is a big NO.Highly overpriced,not much variety,quantity less as compared to pricing,no mocktails..it was big let down for me..prices they charge is mainly because of the ambience..otherwise there are a lot of other restaurants serving better foods at the same price..

Been there just yesterday for lunch. The location of this houseboat cafe is awesome. Beautiful interior, though not spacious , still ambiance has some good vibes.
You can reach there by free boat service from eco park or by foot through the bridge. We took the boat and after reaching came to know about two restaurants one is "cafe ekante" and other is "cafe ekante houseboat restaurant" . Here in zomato it is shown that they serve continental and bengali cuisines, which is wrong. The only cuisine available there is chinese.
The restaurant must update their information in zomato and the menu too.

So after reaching there we have to wait for 15-20min. The staffs were not efficient enough. We had to ask for tissue papers two times.

As we were there for bengali cuisine, we just had the starter. We ordered Drunken chicken wings and chicken dim sum. But dim sum was not available. So had just Drunken chicken wings, which was nice in taste but was not fully cooked.
Overall not satisfied at all.

Well if you want to propose a girl or go to a romantic date with your beloved someone it's the right place. But if u consider the food, it's quite pathetic & frustrating. For starter we ordered a spring roll kinda thing which tasted nothing.  Then we ordered mix hakka noodles which they mistakenly served mix fried rice. It was poor & tasteless. Honey sauced fish preparation was also ordered but it was hard to find that whether it was fish or chicken or lamb. So poor r the foods that it should be immediately improved.

This place is just 'the perfect place' for romantic dinners. The weather made it all more romantic.The concept of a restraunt in a boat is quite unique and interesting. I loved the food. We ordered some chinese dishes. The view was breathtaking. Will surely visit the place again.

For the Idea and Decor it will get ten on ten.

We celebrate the Last Bijoya Dashami by staying at Ekante Cottagea.

Last time when we were there this restaurant was under construction.

Basically it caters the Chinese and Continental dishes.We ordered a Lamb preparation and Chicken Lolipop preparation.Both was too good.In addition we   ordered one Ice pice and another mocktail.

Went there with family last evening. Its basically a houseboat situated beside the main cafe ekante outlet. They serve chinese food. The decor with the scenic view is really eye catching. We ordered chicken dim sum and S &P infused paneer for starters. Singaporean chicken noodles, triple sechuan chicken rice, veg hakka noodles, kung pao chicken,  soya chilli chicken and sezuan chicken. All of the food items were very lip smacking. Quantity is moderate, can be shared among two people. Really had a great experience. :)

The only thing that is worth mentioning about this restaurant is it's ambience. I have given a rating of 1.5 only for the ambience. The food was pathetic and hardly edible. We left after having starters as we didnt have the courage to try out the maincourse.

All in all a waste of an oppurtunity.

I visited this place with my mom and 2 brothers based on the high ratings and it was just a horrible experience. Thanks to them that our evening got ruined. The restaurant was full when we visited it at around 7pm today. We asked the waiter how long it will take to get a table and he said give your name to me so that I can note it down and noted down my name. It will take around 10 mins. We said OK and waited outside for around 15mins. After that a family finished their food and left the place. So we again went inside and my brother told the manager-kind of guy(he seemed to be at the top position inside the restaurant) that our name is next and requested him to give us a table. The manager said wait for 15mins again. My brother said that the table was empty but he insisted that we should wait for 15 mins. We agreed and as we were going outside I noticed that a group of 4 men came...talked with the manager and sat on that empty table. I went in front of him again and asked that how did they sit on that table even though they came after us. I asked him "what was the point of writing down my name when u will let any person u like to sit inside the restaurant? " It is absolutely fine if u say u can't give us a table. We will go to other restaurants. But what is this? U tell us to wait and then give the table to someone else. The manager tried saying some gibberish. I didn't listen. By this time the waiters were again trying to tell us that wait outside. Those 4 men didn't want to leave the table. It was a total chaos. The manager finally gave us the table after around 10 more minutes. Those men left the table. Our good mood was ruined. We lost our appetite. Now the food. My god. I have never eaten such tasteless saltless dumplings and only the Dip which was provided with the dumplings were eatable. The drums of heaven were average. Earlier we had dinner plans there but the staff behavior.. their biasness and discrimination really ruined our mood and made us angry. We left the place after having those 2dishes. The bill was Rs. 492.

Everything is bad except for the location. Food is pathetic. The chicken main course was full of green pepper with traces of chicken. The coke had no fizz (perhaps served the leftover of a 2l bottle that was opened long back). The fried rice tasted flat. The only bright spot was the fish sweet chilli.

To sit down and dine with family is religion to some and an weekend fun for others...But when things turns out to be the exact opposite of what could have been a pleasant dinner by the lake, it's disastrous. The manager failed to arrange a table for the entire family and asked to manage the space with 2 different tables at different corners. #ManagerNotBothered #AttitudeNotFitForHospitality Nd yes won't forget one more thing- Here you can order noddles but have an end to end possibility of being served chowmein. #FoodIsNotBadThough #NeverReturningBack

Wonderful ambiance and sumptuous food reminded us of Kerala!  It is parked on middle island of ecopark. Their closing time is 1600 hrs for lunch but they served us at 1550 hrs with equal warmth. food was fresh and warm. overall a recommendable restaurant.
They also have some stay options ,surrounding was artistic and thoughtful.
one complain though:

1) ferry boat should have more capacity and more sophisticated.

Cafe Ekante is one of the best additions to Kolkata, this decade..There is this houseboat restaurant and other food outlets under the same brand name, including cafeterias, predominantly in the New Town Area..As far as the houseboat restaurant is concerned, a romantic dinner with your better half is always on the cards..You get a free boat ride to the restaurant anchored in the midst of the water body which in itself sets you up for a lovely and a memorable evening..The decor is classy, led by the golden dim lights and it goes amazingly well with the surroundings..You can sit indoors or grab a seat by the water side..Cuisine served is primarily bengali..We had ordered the Ekante Special Platter, which included Butter Rice with poached egg , kasundi murgi, mutton kebab and cheese fish steak + roasted papad..Quantity of this platter would leave 1 full but 2 wanting for a bit more..Kasundi murgi and the butter rice deserves special mention as both of them tasted delightfully delicious..mutton was good too..the steak was a disappointment though and despite being a huge fan of fishes i found the dish smelly...Service was okay and prices on the moderately higher side, but fine enough if you consider the lovely experience you are gonna have in the entire to and fro journey & the dinner combo...Would definitely recommend, specially to the couples and families..Have also tried their maacher chop at the cafeteria at the Nazrultirtha and was quite happy with the taste..

Very well conceived and planned. Excellent ambience and a perfect getaway from the city life. But could have cheaper food options and at least a complimentary breakfast, given the price we are paying. That was quite disappointing. 

Also, the maintenance should be better planned. We did feel disturbed by the noise of the grass cutting machine, in the afternoon, right after we arrived on a Sunday. These could have been easily done on weekdays when crowds are less.

Lastly, with numerous cottages lying vacant, we were not sure why we were not given the one closest to the restaurant. At least a choice could be given. And these things do create a personalized experience which helps build a special and long lasting memory.

Not too much of its kind in Calcutta. So definitely you are going to enjoy the evening sitting inside a houseboat and getting a pleasant view of the waterbody outside. Food quality is good, they serve only Chinese. And if you are more interested in Indian, then cafe ekaante also offers the same which is just beside the houseboat located on the greenery of eco park. Personally I liked the Indian more than the Chinese. Prices are a bit on the higher side compared to the food you are having. But for a first time experience, one can definitely try out these two spots in town! The credit definitely goes to the view and ambience...

There's nothing I can say that will justify the ambience of this houseboat restaurant. There's a waterbody on one side, with the beautiful buildings of the city on its bank, and on the other side, there's a stretch of greenery. But that's about it. All my 2 points go to the ambience. Because, when I go to a restaurant, it is for good food and drinks, timely service, etc. If the ambience was all, then I'd sit in the park beside the restaurant. Its menu is quite limited, and the items on them, though fancy to read, are unimpressive, especially when you're sitting amid such an ambience, and doling out a fortune. The only item that was somewhat ok was a kasundi¬†murgi. The portions and quantity were extremely small, especially in case of the platters. What was most disappointing was that the meat pieces barely had any meat - it was all bones! It has a bar-like section that's really tempting - but sadly, with nothing but mocktails. The drinks were beautiful to look at, but not as good on the tongue. Not to mention, food is hugely overpriced here. The service was so slow that the lunch became high tea for us. It was a complete wastage of time and money. A very disappointing experience.

Went to Caf√© Ekante Houseboat Restaurant(not to be confused with Caf√© Ekante) for lunch. Firstly i loved the d√©cor. It felt like i was on a houseboat but not in Kerala,in Kolkata. The ambience was good. You can choose to sit both outdoors and indoors-outdoors if you want to get a feel of the lake.
Coming to the food,we ordered simolina fish fingers,followed by poulet a la king with buttered rice and ekante special platter. Loved all the dishes and service was also good.
Hope to drop by again soon.

A great ambience, great theme, great location, mostly good looking food, but service not up to the mark. I have been here couple of times and both the times we had problem with the baked fish.Last time we went here for a casual office lunch and ordered for the Ekante Special platter which comes with a cheesy fish bake. And to our horrors the fish was smelling rotten. We even complained to the server that the fish is not fresh and is smelling and we were told it was the smell of the cheese. On our insistence, the server checked with chef and confirmed back that the smell must have been of the cheese - all this without even smelling the fish for once, despite our strong complaint that cheese do not smell like rotten food. We were promptly offered a replacement dish, but the way they treated the complaint (not wanting to check the fish) was appalling and shows how much they care about customer complaints.I may go back again for the location and the theme, but I am staying away for anything fish or baked, but would hope to gain better experiences later on.

Much much more than the food, the high rating is for the ambiance. What a lovely sight! A big houseboat housing a restaurant. Limited seats, an extension to Cafe Ekante. They remain closed from 4:00-6:00 p.m. The menu is a fusion menu. Named, Cafe Ekante only their menu is different from the land cafe. The scenery setting is beautiful, with sofas to just sit and watch the sun set. The food is okay, a little overpriced. There is a bar but only for mocktails.

Cafe Ekante at Rajarhat-Newtown Ecopark or Prakriti Tirtha excels in its own beautiful surroundings and excellent Bengali & continental food offerings.

Located at the Island in the lake Cafe Ekante gives you charming natural beauty to make you romantic to feel the solitude. The place is actually a resort offering living in the cottages and includes a total of 3 restaurants - main one, houseboat and lawn. Houseboat serves only continental while the other two serve Bengali & North Indian only.

They don't serve alcohol to make the place perfect for family dining out. 

Enjoy the food with the scenic beauty!

Lovely experience sitting by the lake, enjoying a gentle breeze. Items are limited but of very good quality. The yakhni shorba wqs good and so was the mulayam fish kabab. The staff are a little ignorant about the nature of the items. For eg, we were told that the yakhni shorba is a mutton item, but it turned out to be a chicken item. The good food made up for it though.

A perfect birthday lunch it was...it's a restaurant with the concept of floatel. The outer structure of the restaurant was like a house boat. It's situated inside eco park, at the bank of eco island. It is beautifully decorated with wooden base. They have both ac and outside sitting arrangements. 
The food quality is equally good...we ordered 4 platters for 4 people..and the quantity was satisfactory. 
We ordered, 2 ekante special platter, 1 lamb strogenoff,1 amish tandoori platter, 4 freshlime soda n as desert pabrai's nalen gurer ice cream.
service is good but if you'll prefer to go on Sundays then it will take a little time as they do not have tat much manpower(from my personal experience).
But they are humble n co-operative.
Would like to visit again and again.... in love with the place.

The first thing notable about the restaurant is it's ambience. Situated on a house boat the restaurant offers spectacular view of the lake. The fusion foods are nice though of a bit higher price range. Especially good if you want to enjoy a scenic/romantic sundown sipping a cup of coffee. 

Food suggestion: the fish fingers are actually awesome. Also I liked the spaghetti. 

Highly recommended for romantic twosome sit togethers. Dinner is not recommended as the restaurant closes around 7:30 in the evening. If you want to go for lunch you may feel disappointed.

Note: You need to take a boat ride to reach the restaurant. Yes, that helps to build the romantic mood.

Went there for the first time today.. Inside eco park in a small island whre ekante cottages has bn set up , the place is  peaceful, away from the huzzy buzzy city schedule, it makes u calm down, and enjoy nature.. Cafe ekante has been set up mainly for the people staying in the ekante cottages.. The look and feel of the houseboat restaurant is tempting enough to make you grow crazy to explore the food in@ there. Its actually a houseboat.. There are seating arrangements on the deck as well as inside. But there's more than what meets your eye.. Seeing the ambience and the setup , anyone would be expecting good quality food.. We ordered deep fried chicken wings with mexican sauce.. It was more like a sweet chicken preparation rather than tangy saucy yet sweet preparation we love to hve.. Next was the ekante special platter. Seeing the menu card description we had high hopes that it would be something different vd chicken, mutton, kebabs all included in one dish.. But it turned out to be more like a chelo kebab platter.. The difference was instead of chelo kebabs , salads and they served one chicken preparation , one mutton prep and cheese chicken kebab.. Thats it on one plate.. With the same rice and egg poach on top.. Thats not wat we expected.. Food quality also needs to be improved a lot.. We enjoyed our time as the ambience and environment made it worth spending the money.. But in terms of food, this place needs to improve, in recipes,preparation and even in their taste of the dishes.. Good luck to the management.

This place has an amazing ambience by the lake. The fusion food creations are nice and a bit diff from the normal restaurants. This place is well decorated and is also friendly to pocket.

An unique themed restaurant - first of its kind ( I never been @flotel, but I am sure this one is better looking, at least I hope soüò†). Looking for a lovely quite romantic evening with your bae@ water side???this is the Place. You have to reach there by boat ride arranged free of cost by cafe ekante management with condition you 'have to' eat something thereüòÉ & trust me, you won't mind nor you would regret eating there....at least I didn'tüò†.
The rating and the review is only for the ambiance and only that... you can spent hours looking at the sunset or the park or people enjoying water sports in the lake or the night sky listening to the water keep thrusting the boat, I would recommend to seat outside only... coming to food, mocktails are good, rest items are nothing special, rather very ordinary and overpriced. Service is very slow but I won't blame the waiters as there's only two of them managing the entire section. As I am in love this place, I am not complaining any of that and I would keep visiting this placeüòÉüò†.

The theme of the restaurant is very interesting. You will love it if go there on a breezy evening. Sitting outside will be much more fun than inside.Food served is fresh and quite okay, but the options are extremely limited.
 I think the overall concept of the place and the location make it a good option. The highlight is not the food. Menu needs to be upgraded.

Excellect ambiance , a lovely place to dine with your family in the evening. Wanted to sit on deck by the lake , but we were 4 so had to sit inside the AC cabin . But a very nice experience. There is a seperate entrance away from the eco park crowd. Menu was limited but very interesting. Only continental with mocktails . The other resturant has more options i suppose. Food was nice we tried the ekhante platter , a bhetki preparation , bangldeshi chicken preparation , norel gur er icecream .... price is at a higher side but that was expected. Overall good experience will surely visit again.

The rating is entirely for the ambience. Open air outdoor seating and next to the lake - this is definitely the best in terms of ambience in kolkata. Service was also good. However the food quality left a lot to be desired. There is a separate entry and you do not have to enter  eco park and hence can avoid the crowd and also the time required to wait for the boat to ferry you to the other side. The entire stretch is very well lit up, beautifully maintained and very romantic! Must visit for the ambience. And yes, this one on the houseboat serves only continental and mocktails.

Well it is actually a resturant on a boat. The whole concept is amazing. The outside sitting by the water will give you a perfect date ambience. Sitting arrangements are small though. But this dining on a boat is an out of the world experience. Tried their mocktails. Well made, tastes good. 
P.S As this place getting popular, waiting for this place is becoming longer.
