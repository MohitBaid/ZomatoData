Nested beside the busy B.T. road near sintheemore. This place is just perfect for coffee -lovers. A small cozy cafe with great taste. The decor is as perfect as it's perfect cup of coffee. With fresh muffins and a variety of mocktails it can bring a big smile on one's face. Love the quirky decor which gives an Italian cafe feel. Staffs are very well- behaved  and at times owner herself assist you.
We orange mojito ,green apple mojito,grilled chicken sandwich, white sauce pasta and chicken wings and muffin(rum chocolate and blueberry)
Orange mojito and green apple mojito-5/5 for taste and garnishing
Grilled chicken sandwich -4.5/5 for taste 0.5 less for too much cheese
White sauce paste- 5/5 best pasta I have had.
Chicken wings-5/5 juicy and tender chicken wings tossed in BBW sauce ,just perfectly baked
Muffins-5/5 obviously..it was yummlicious....
Highly recommended... Will surely keep on visiting.

Nice place to spend an evening. Would love to visit once again. The coffee they serve is awesome. Not rooftop maybe, but would give you the essence of being beside a busy street.

A much needed place in that area. Have been there twice and would love to visit again. Nicely decorated, small and cozy cafe. A pocket friendly place for a little chit chat over a refreshing coffee or a milk shake..
You'll also get some other titbits to nibble on.
Ambience and decor is good.
Coffee is refreshing indeed, and I would prefer the blue berry milkshake with ice cream. Tried the strawberry milkshake too.
Fish fry was crisp and juicy, they served it with sauce and french fries.
Accepts paytm payments but an option for payment by card would be good.

Nice small and cosy cafe... Prices are reasonable, totally affordable by students... Huge variety of tea, coffee and shakes available... Also the pasta, sandwiches are lip smacking.... Love the nice small pillows they provide for sitting and the bluetooth speaker to play your own music...
Only con is that the door is still not installed so a bit dusty, but the owner assured it's gonna be fixed soon enough...
