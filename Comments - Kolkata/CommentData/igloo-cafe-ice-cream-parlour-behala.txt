A rather small place, but a delight for scorching summer noons! 
Reasonably priced.

We had Cold Chocolate Coffee,Brownie bites Sundae and Crumbled chocolate sundae. 
The ice creams tasted average, though the quantity sufficed the quality I guess. 
I liked the cold coffee, had a good blend of chocolate flavour. 

The only problem is, one can overhear conversations as the place is a bit too small. Didnot try their food yet.

A very small cafe. The food is good.  Not much variety available. A small ice-cream parlour basically. It's such a small palace as a cafe that you can't spend time properly because however softly you talk people can hear you. Lack of privacy . Otherwise everything else is fine .

This cafe is one of the hidden gems in Behala. The cafe is located on James long road just 2 steps away from Brand factory.
The speciality of this cafe are the sundaes. The desert department always manages to create an impression on the customers. Not only this but they also serve freshly prepared snacks too.
The cozy ambiance, the homely atmosphere , the pocket friendly price all makes you come back here for more hangouts with friends.
This is surely now on my regular visit list.
Thank you for reading my review.

Nice and cheap place to hang out with your gf/bf. But it gets overcrowded as soon as another person enters. Hence space is a big issue here. Hopefully they are extending the space. The desserts are a must try along with the mocktails. But I wouldn't recommend eating the foods over here as they are not that good. But you can try the grilled cheese sandwich if you feel that you must munch onto something solid.

An awesome place to spend a lazy evening for everyone out in Behala. We went here today and grabbed some french fries, chicken sandwich and blue lagoon. The mocktail was the best part which was suggested by the owner herself. It had some different punch which tasted a bit different than any other place. We also enjoyed the homely environment over here. The pocket pinch is very low and also cash is the only medium to pay. It is highly recommended to everyone to visit this place and have some quick bite. I will be visiting quite often now.

It's a small place dedicated to anyone who is up for some cozy time with their friends or their loved ones.¬†
The Main Attraction here are the wide varieties of Ice cream related delicacies.
Treat yourself to the various varieties of Ice cream dishes along with anything that compliments the main attraction. Anytime Grab a Quick Bite if you want too.
The reasonable pricing and the homely feeling makes this one of the best places for " Getting a Break " once in a while. Even though the place is very underrated, you will still find customers flocking to this place especially during the festive seasons.
The only problem with this place is that it can only accommodate a very small percentage of customers at a time.
Go ahead & Visit .. Leave with a Smile on your face.

Okay so.. the last sunday evening.. me and my sister were looking for places to hangout.. while surfing different cafes in behala area on Zomato, we came across this place.. and instantly decided to pay a visit. As we reached we found the place to be full with people being a very tiny joint..

About the food.. the egg grilled cheese sandwich which we order was very tasty.. the french fries were not anything noteworthy.. Bt the usp of the place which is ice cream stole the show.. we ordered one cookie love sundae and one broenie delight sundae ehich were basically chocolate based stuffs with subtle taste alterations.. they were yummy.. and we found that they have quite a varied option in the dessert section..

Now, about the price.. it is quite apt for the amount they provide . The ice creams we ordered were nothing less than 3 scoops along with oreo, brownies, and chocolate shavings and sauces.. but that did not seem to have cost a fortune..

Coming to the ambience.. it is nothing extraodinary just a small place with 4 tables and plastic chairs and a kitchen counter..

The behaviour of the staff was very impressive and cordial. The wait in the queue was pretty long for us bt as soon as we ordered it did not take them any long time to serve..

Overall it seemed a nice place and a must visit for ice cream lovers out there.. ‚ò∫

Icecreams are great here! It's wonderful to have an icecream parlour in Behala where icecreams are at such an affordable price. We ordered Irish coffee delight and cookie lover's sundae. Both of them were amazing. The coffee flavour in thr irish coffee delight icecream was amazing. In the cookie lover's sundae, brownie's amount was very less, but there were many pieces of oreo..overall taste was very nice.
Apart from the icecreams, we tried grilled chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets. Nuggets were tasty, they seemed to be ready to fry ones. Sandwich wasn't good in taste. Never gonna have sandwich here again.
Ambience is nothing great. It is a small place with few tables. I wish they decorate it and create a good ambience,it would be cherry on the cake!
Service is prompt. The lady, probably the owner  herself was very active in taking the orders.

Located opposite the MP Birla School, this place boasts of being the first ice cream parlour in the area. The place is on the first floor and looks on to the JL Sarani. However, it is very small and congested with only 3 tables. We ordered 2 sandwiches and 1 Irish Coffee Delight and 1 Moonrocker. Sandwiches were okay. But both the ice creams were absolutely tasteless and worthless. Basically the money went down the drain in case of the icecreams. The service was slow and the place does not accept cards. 

P.S: The staffs keep on eating while preparing the orders. Something not very professional.

There is no ambience and decor as such. It is located beside sholo ana bangali (james long sarani)in the second floor. A small joint with 4 tables. This lovely cute place has best ice creams in the area. The sundaes are something to die for. I tried their mickey mouse mocktail, chicken grilled sandwich, chicken nuggets, cookie lover sundae and blue lagoon. The mickey mouse mocktail was not upto the mark. It was just coke with a vanilla ice cream floating on top. The sundae was really tasty. Pocket pinch is also not high. Overall, a good experience.

This place is a small yet cosy cafe cum ice-cream parlour. It is located almost opposite to M.P.Birla F.H.S. School on James Long Sarani. There isn't any decor as such to mention about hence, let me come to the food directly. I had ordered Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwich, Brownie Bites Sundae, Tutti Frutti, Masala Cold Drink. The Nuggets were nothing great, they were so-so. The Sandwich was quite filling and was deftly made. The Sundae was excellent and is a must try. The Tutti Frutti was good as well. The Masala Cold Drink was very refreshing, however, the presence of too many ice cubes diluted the cold drink to a little extent which is undesirable.

Although, this place has no decors as such but what it offers is a very homey atmosphere which, makes the experience better. I would like to visit this place again in the future to try out some of the other items.

That was a day we took a visit there to reduce my friend's distress. An ice cream parlour- what could be better than that. Not too far from my home, I was visiting that place for the first time. It was a small place with 4 tables around with 2 chairs to each. Owner, the lady of the place welcomed us with warm smile. My friend suggested me to try "As You Like It" from their options of Ice cream. It was a bowl of five scoop of ice creams of our choice topped with fresh fruits and chocolate sauce. & it was delicious. Must to mention, their behaviour was very homely to visit them again.

I ordered through Swiggy so cant talk about the restaurant decor or staffs. They also should think about packaging for the snacks items to make sure they deliver it hot. Packaging for the ice creams are perfect though.

Both the snacks I ordered were OK
Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwich
Chicken Popcorn

Being a Ice Cream parlour they have quite a few options and they are quite good at it...

Moon Rockers - One scoop of vanilla and two scoops of butter scotch ice cream topped with chocolate sauce and rich chocolate.
Cookie Lover's Sundae - Two scoops of chocolate ice cream, One scoop of vanilla ice cream, crumbled brownie, crumbled Oreo - chocolate flavoured, Choco Chips, fudge sauce and whipped cream topped with cherry.
Love with Blackcurrant - Three scoops of Blackcurrant Ice Cream goes with raisin, blackcurrant sauce and honey.

The sandwiches and food are a little over priced here according to their quantity. But this place remains empty most of the times. It's quiet and provides a peaceful ambience for group addas or long hour chit-chats. (You have to keep on ordering though)

It's a layback place and not very hi-fi.

Try out the sundae ice creams here and the cheese grilled sandwich!

Had their chicken cheese n egg sandwichs and French fries delivered through Swiggy.  The delivery was quick. 
Packaging looked like from a road side vendors,  the ketchup was too cheap and almost inedible.  The sandwiches were not even made using sandwich bread!!!!  Seems they forgot to add the cheese! The roughly julliened onions didn't go well at all with the egg and chicken which too were not at all upto the standard. The French fries too could have been a lot better.  
Overall a total letdown!!  Thanks for spoiling my evening snack

If you love ice cream this is the destination you should head for in the behala area. It's a nice and Cosy joint and the people there makes you feel at home. The ice creams are lip smacking and quite moderately priced. The cold coffee is a must try and I personally feel that it's the best I have ever had. The finger food available is also quite tempting. I recently had the momo there. They were quite huge in size and the portion is enough to feed the appetite of two. I have been a regular there for the past 5 years and good quality is something that has been constantly adhered to all along. So if you have an ice cream craving with some finger food this is the place you should visit where you get absolutely amazing varieties of sundaes, sandwiches and tit bits without burning a hole in your pocket. Keep up the good worküëç.

Quite pocket friendly and a favourable place to go with your friends.Their combo offers are pretty good as the quantity is really great as for the prices they offer. Mrs Nanda the owner handles all the chores herself and her gentle behaviour is something which really attracts people to visit this place. Overall a decent place with some delicious food..the varieties of ice cream is a speciality here.

"True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked."
-Erich Segal

For every foodies out there, I'm quite sure that every food story is a love story, which achieve its optimal truth, the moment it is topped up with some sweet anecdotes.
And that's the way, this cute little romantic place of Behala, is spreading true love in the air, with its wide offerings of ice-cream and sweet treats, SILENTLY, without any flashing banners or pompous publicity. In fact, if you are not well aware of the area, you might have to go through a serious treasure hunt to discover this place.
Located at the first floor of the building right beside 'solo ana bangali', on James Long Sarani, this ice-cream parlour is a pure bliss for the sweet toothed foodies for their heavenly delicious offerings. The space inside is cramped up and congested, but the mellifluous vibes of romantic charm is there in the ambience which anybody will fall for, undoubtedly.
Miss Nanda, the owner of this parlour deserves a standing ovation for the way she handles the entire operation, almost single handedly, with bare minimum help.
And so far the taste is concerned, anybody will love to indulge in to the heavenly taste of each and every item, crafted with care and love.
A place to achieve a prized sweet experience for sure.

Thanks a lot to

At last we visited this place this Sunday. It is located just above the 16 ana bangali. Its a small ice cream parlour with a sitting arrangement for 10-12people. Bt once u r in, the place never disappoints u. The hosts were warm and cordial .and the sundaes we ordered, tasted heavenly .though they do not upload the whole menu (it consists almost 10 pages and in zomato u can only find 4pages) ,u can find some interesting combos in a pocket friendly price. One of the combo which I like most was burger- sandwitch- moon rocker ice cream-cold drink combo and it will cost u around Rs.275. They charge only 5 bucks if u want to pack ur food.
Since we reached around 8.30 pm ,we only opted for ice creams (we already had our dinner) .we ordered tutti- fruity sundae and crumbled chocolate sundae. Though I m not a big ice cream lover ( ice creams r too cold for me,u heard me right :p ) ,bt I really like d subltle flavour of different types of ice creams mixed with different fruit flavoured syrup and a whole lot of freshly cut fruits. And believe me ,my taste buds fell in love with this awesomeness. I did not taste d other sundae (don't roll ur eyes, I hate chocolate) bt my friend was literally drooling over it. So we made a pact to visit this place very soon.

Suggestion :please make ur sign board visible /noticeable .its very hard to locate it without zomato reviews or (in my case ) calling u up for direction at around 11pm (yeah mrs nanda , I m that foodie who called u up that night for direction to pay a visit on this weekend and I did visit )

Even if it says "cafe" or "ice-cream parlor", the sandwiches are just as great! :) the decor is nice, loved it when I recently stopped by for some hot coffee as I was drenched in the rain. Highly recommended.

A very pretty place located at James Long Sarani to enjoy some delicious ice creams and snacks. Quite pocket friendly and a favourable place to go with your friends.Their combo offers are pretty good as the quantity is really great as for the prices they offer. Mrs Nanda the owner handles all the chores herself and her gentle behaviour is something which really attracts people to visit this place. Overall a decent place with some delicious food..the varieties of ice cream is a speciality here.

Cosy n comfortable place with amazingly warm n friendly environment.
Best place to sit n chat with your friends over ice creams n snacks, specially with very little pinch to your pocket. 
Cookie lover's sundae is a must try here.. specially the one made by the proprietress herself.
If you want a cafe with a homely feeling... Then this is it!!

"True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked."
-Erich Segal

For every foodies out there, I'm quite sure that every food story is a love story, which achieve its optimal truth, the moment it is topped up with some sweet anecdotes.
And that's the way, this cute little romantic place of Behala, is spreading true love in the air, with its wide offerings of ice-cream and sweet treats, SILENTLY, without any flashing banners or pompous publicity. In fact, if you are not well aware of the area, you might have to go through a serious treasure hunt to discover this place.
Located at the first floor of the building right beside 'solo ana bangali', on James Long Sarani, this ice-cream parlour is a pure bliss for the sweet toothed foodies for their heavenly delicious offerings. The space inside is cramped up and congested, but the mellifluous vibes of romantic charm is there in the ambience which anybody will fall for, undoubtedly.
Miss Nanda, the owner of this parlour deserves a standing ovation for the way she handles the entire operation, almost single handedly, with bare minimum help.
And so far the taste is concerned, anybody will love to indulge in to the heavenly taste of each and every item, crafted with care and love.
A place to achieve a prized sweet experience for sure.

Thanks a lot to

Visited this parlour twice in long years back.As soon as I discovered it zomato I want to review them as it was the first ice cream parlour I went :) It is inside a flat with some decoration,the ambience is ok.Now I come to the food.Ordered chicken samosa.Nice in taste with good filling but felt the portion was small.Then ordered some sundae which is good.Overall a good experience.

A small, but romantic Ice Cream Parlor located close to M. P Birla School. Its inside a flat, so you will have to climb two flights of stairs. The eatery overlooks the road and the glass walls gives it a romantic touch. The prices are very reasonable. Mrs. Nanda who owns this place is a friendly lady and she single-handedly runs the show.¬† 

We had the following:
1. Mock Campaign(mocktail) : It was a brownish color drink. It was creamy, tangy and tasted yum.
2. Blue Lagoon(Mocktail) : It was refreshing but tasted mainly of limca.
3. Naughty Choco Khake(mocktail) : It was a chocolatey drink with an unconventional flare. It tasted okish.
4. Tuti-Fruti Sundae : It had lots and lots and lots of fresh fruits, with some vanilla & strawberry ice cream and strawberry syrup. This was the show stopper of the afternoon.
5. Cookie Lovers Sundae : Comprising of chocolate & vanilla ice cream and some cookies this was an yuumylicious sundae. 

I quite liked this small but homely outlet, and wish the all the very best for the future!

Kolkata has some very few ice cream parlours with varieties of additional serivces and with some very good and decent food and drink stuffs for your taste buds. Known for their Mocktails and variety of ice creams they make.

After being done with a fine lunch just at a nearby restaurant, it took us 10 mins walk on the James Long Sarani to reach this place just opposite of M. P Birla School. A very small outlet on the 1st floor. Run by  Mrs. Nanda herself with her staff. A very smiling and joyful lady.

We tried the following :

1. Mock Campaign - Made of grapes with crust of ice cream over the top. Very tasty and refreshing.

2. Blue Lagoon - Blue Lagoon is always been my fav. This drink was quite refreshing but lacked little bit of fizz in it.

3. Cookie lovers sundae - Loved it!

4. Naughty Choco shake - Very delicious, it was very chocolaty and from the top to bottom the shake didnt change.

5. Tutti Fruti - Very colorful, Three scoops of ice cream mixed with seasonal fruits in it. They way it looked the same it tasted. Surprisingly well.

With all the items we had it surely gave us something to smile and comeback again to this place. The prices are reasonable and pocket friendly. I Wish Mrs. Nanda all the best and thanks them for being so humble and friendly to all of us,

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Igloo turned out to be a hidden gem which was not witnessed by me even after staying so near to this place. It has been quite a few occasions when I have seen this place but never entered but today I entered the place and I am really impressed with the food and at the price which they were offering. This is one of the first cafes and ice cream parlour of the area and has really done a good job in maintaining its position for 7 years.

Location:
Just few steps away from M.P. Birla School and beside Sholo Ana Bangali. You will just have to climb a few staircases to reach this place.

Ambience:
Very small but cute. The place will give you a very homely atmosphere and you will enjoy eating your food here.

Food:
Yeah the best thing about this place is their food and at the price they are giving. I ordered a Combo of Chicken Sandwich, French Fries and Apple Juice. The Sandwich was really well grilled with a good filling of Chicken inside it.
The French Fries was huge in quantity and was crispy. It was salted just perfectly which made me finish it quite fast.
The Apple Juice was the Tropicana Juice and nothing special.

Mrs.Runa Nanda, the owner was really humble and a great person to talk with. She offered me a Pinacolada which she made herself. The taste was really good. The blend of Pineapple syrup with coconut milk along with whipped cream was next to perfection. The best was saved for last.

Last Words:
A great pocket friendly place to have some nice food. I haven't tried their Ice Creams but i would definitely going back soon.

3.5/5 because of value for money.

I had been to this place a while back, its in Behala, on James Long Sarani, near M.P. Birla F.H.S. School. I had their Moon Rocker, and it was amazing, the place is a little cosy but is also the best place to have ice creams in Behala, it isn't too costly either.

This place is just like the next door cafe. If you know where SholoAna Bangali is, all you need to do is to climb up to the first floor. Being located just opposite to M.P. Birla High School on James Long Sarani, this place has mostly attracted school going kids.

The offerings here are pretty basic. The ice cream flavors are decent, nothing to boast about. They make some standard snacks as well. Had tried the Chicken Sandwich long time back. I felt that the portion sizes were a bit small compared to the price. But, this place does offer you a homely ambiance which you won't get elsewhere!

Located near MP Birla School beside Creams and Bean.I ordered food from this cafe for a couple of times now via Swiggy and all I would say is that there Fish Fries are to die for. The prices are pocket-friendly and student-friendly .¬†
I didn't really like their chicken sandwich , burgers and fries much. Like they are okay-ish . Nothing too fancy .¬†
But definitely they makes some delicious stuff so do not miss it.

Childhood memories.. Lots of them actuallly!!

This place is located opposite to m.p birla high school on james long sarani, behala. It is actually a part of a flat turned cafe. So its in 1st floor.. 

Teenage cafe actually. Sandwiches were cheap and were tasty when i used to go during my school times. Dnt know abt them right now. Ice cream parlour served good flavours.

Interiors were just apt for the teenage eyes. Fun and not overdone.

I have crossed my age and thats y i simply felt old when i had visited this place a few months back. Lots of young energies.

If u are a student living in and around behala this is one simple and cheap place for u. People like me also can go if u wanna feel young.

It is a small ice cream parlour but the ice cream quantity they server is good enough for 2 people. They use Kwality Walls Ice cream and all the fried product they use, is of IFB so we can trust on its quality. We odered chicken samosa, paneer cheese grill sandwich and 2 ice cream. I am a sandwich lover so i have tried sandwiches from many good places n igloo's sandwich tastes decent,only the chips were missing. Chicken samosa small but yumm samosas, one can enjoy it with a cup of coffee or tea. About ice cream i would jus say guys go and try ice cream. Many people will think that it dsnt look like a cafe but i will go again n again. Instead of buying Kwality walls ice creams from shop, i will go to igloo sit back n enjoy ice cream with those delicious things dey add to ice cream.

The ice creams are good as the come in a boat shaped bowls. I loved the chicken sandwiches which are standard and does not affects your pocket much!
If you miss out the entry just look up,It is just on the first floor of Sholo ana Bangali restaurant on James Long Sarani.

I was taken to this place by a friend, so I don't really have a clear idea about it's location. Talking about igloo, honestly there is nothing special about this place. It is located in the second or third floor (I don't remember exactly) of a residential building. The interiors are just mediocre. Nothing fancy at all. The ice creams are good, given the prices. (Haven't tried their other items, so cannot comment on that) but looking at the menu, they surely seem reasonable. This can be a good place if you are broke and have catching up to do with a friend.

Been to this cafe for a whole number of times. It serves drinks & ice cream & a few variety of snacks. Located on james long sarani this is a small place in an apartment building. It is ideal for small chitchats with friends or a date. Many items are not available most of the times & if you order some fruit juice they just pour it from the cans available in market. Its like having a fruity in a glass there & give hell of extra bucks for that. This place is all about spending some time in peace when in the neighbourhood with some rare drinks & icecreams.

It was an okay place even six months ago. Then they increased the prices and started servicing in paper plates. I admit having a lot memories there but it doesn't really make up for the average food which burns a considerable hole in your wallet. But again, you don't have a lot of options when it comes to ice cream parlour in behala.

It's located just near my school and I've been here once. The items are cheap and worth the money. To be honest, it is quite better than its next door neighbour Cafe Coffee Day. ¬†People might find some trouble locating the parlour as it's situated on the first floor and you have to climb a flight of stairs to gain entry. I liked the restaurant. The coffee was great.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have coffee or ice-cream and doesn't have enough money to go to CCD. Personally, I'd rather go here than CCD. The price is lower and the food tastes almost the same.

People might have some trouble locating the entrance as it is in a house and there is a flight of stairs that leads to the Ice Cream Parlour.

The ambience is nothing to write about , eventhough it has a warm, cozy and a homely feeling to it.

We ordered a chicken cheese grilled sandwich and a Black Forest Ice Cream Sundae and a Pina Colada mocktail.

The pina colada was a disappointment as  I could not find the coconutty taste in it. It was more like a milky drink with some pineapple juice in it.

The Sundae was okay though there was no whipped cream, just some milk maybe. and honey, well you can forget about it. Inspite of these faults, the ice cream scoops were big and filling. One sundae is enough for two.

The sandwich was dry and we were served on a paper plate. :/

I mean, a standard ice cream parlour or cafe should have at least fibre plates to serve the customers. the paper plates looked extremely tacky , if you compare the place with it. 

If you ask me, then I would suggest you to buy a cornetto for half the Sundae's price and a sandwich from Just baked.

Ambiance- Simple,homely,small(4 tables. dining and kitchen at the same cozy room),clean but comfortable decor.
Price Pinch-pocket friendly (would cost around 200-220 for two)

This is one of the best Ice-cream parlours I have visited in the city.We ordered Irish Coffee Delight and Pure Ecstacy(one scoop vanilla,2 scoop chocolate,hot fudge chocolate ,chocolate powder and choco chips)and cherry on top(literally !).True to their names,the first spoon in your mouth would take you to another land with its soft,crunchy and perfect sweetness.Small pieces of nuts were evenly mixed with the hot chocolate sauce .Halfway through the Ice-cream you will feel like ordering another ¬†but one plate is enough to fill up to your heart's content.I am looking forward to trying all the other Sundae's available on the menu.Especially their Black Forest and Dark Chocolate Temptation.

Just opposite m.p.birla school , this place offers heavenly sundaes at reasonable prices. I went there this evening with a friend after reading the reviews on zomato. It has three four seater tables with a cozy and homely ambiance. We ordered pure ecstasy and a chocolate dark temptation along with chicken cutlets. The cutlets were okay but the sundaes were awesome and melt-in-your-mouth with generous amounts of chocolate chips thrown in. It is definitely worth more visits and i would love to go there again and again.

well this place is very small but they have a good collection of ice-creams....worth a quite date if you want to also look out for your pocket.....i was amazed to see how they used a very mall low ceiling room as a kitchen and also a dining place.....less resources but good product....food is very homely and its bang on the road.....that place could have been used a little more if they had a seperate kitchen space....dont go there with a huge expectation...its moderate and fine based on the price they charge....

Get to Igloo to relish their super icy, creamy igloo-ish flavours
3 out of 5

Well named, Igloo Cafe & Ice Cream Parlour is probably the one of the best dessert parlours in Behala and offers really awesome ice creams; it is definitely worth a visit. Situated in James Long Sarani at Behala, this parlour offers varieties of sundaes along with snacks. It is an old ice cream parlour with a homely ambience, simple decor and a pleasing lady always around to serve her customers with a smile. I had been to this place after a long time, and every time I have been here the service has been really friendly. Nothing can disappoint you about this place if you can compromise with its simple decor, which is no way comparable to the modern interior decor seen in today's ice cream joints. 

I tasted a couple of their sundaes along with their sandwiches but have never opted for anything else because their tempting sundaes don't allow me to do so. Their Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwich and Russian Cold Sandwich are the best sandwiches here.
 
All the sundaes are well made. Pure Ecstasy will surely take you to a world of ecstasy as soon as you taste a spoonful of it. It is delicate, rich in whipped cream and hot fudge chocolate, and the ice cream scoop melts in your mouth, leaving you wanting more. Their Chocolate Dark Temptation, Brownie Bites Sundae, Crumbled Chocolate Sundae, Irish Coffee Delight and Amazing Black Forest are all really good options one can order here. If you love fruity flavours (I don't!), then order As you like it, apparently the best fruity treat available for your taste buds here.

Here the ice-cream is just awesome. Fish fry is great, all snacks and mainly Ice-cream is really mind-blowing. No compromise with quality and price is reasonable. Can say that an evening is great there, but it's test will attract you again and again...  The Tutti-Fruity is really fantastic.

I have just three words for it. awesome, awesome, awesome. it's perhaps the only place in Calcutta where you can have your heartful of sundaes without having to worry about your pocket. a very reasonable place but that doesn't compromise with the quality. very humble, very homely and the lady there is really sweet. It's been there for ages and it's about time zomato noticed it. I am a regular there and trust me, you won't regret your visit.
