It is located close to the Kalighat Kali temple. Visited it a number of times and tried few of their South Indian delicacies such as dosas. Dosa is good but earlier it used to be better. Their hing-er Â kachuri is liked by many but is a no no for me...the prices of the sweets are crazily high...quality now has deteriorated over the years. The joint is big and can accomodate many people. Ambience is normal.
