Went to this place near presidency just to have snacks and since Coffee house was already full, this was our only choice. And believe me, we weren't at all disappointed. Simple decor and Staff. We ordered Fish Kabiraji and tea. A plate of fish kabiraji here can be termed as being enough for two that huge was the size and Quantity. Great for having fun addas if you are in college street area.

It is one of the oldest Restaurant in Kolkata famous for its Kabiraji. And yes the Kabiraji here is something awesome to have. The Kabiraji here is light compared to any other restaurants. The Fish Kabiraji is the one that I loved here a lot.
The chowmein here is also good but not upto the mark. The service here is too fast but the ambience is somewhat clumsy here.

Its a pretty old restaurant situated at the heart of College street.The ambience of the restaurant will suddenly take you to the 90's feeling.The menucard is pasted as poster on the wall and there is a huge mirror beside the sitting place.All the waiters stay in particular maroon coloured attire which will certainly give you the nostalgic feeling.The chicken and fish kobiraji tastes really nice with kasundi.I ordered a chicken Biriyani  and a chicken kabiraji.The Chicken biriyani tasted like any average roadside stall.But the chicken kobiraji was really good.The kasundi and salad provided with the Chicken kabiraji was not good quality though.I also ordered an egg devil.It was also good.

This place has very little things to munch on, mostly non-vegetarian stuff. We went for fish kobiraji, 3 plates and one veg chow mien. Kobirajis were very heavy, three of us could only eat 1/5 of it and rest packed for later. It mostly had egg and was very oily, very little stuffing of fish. I heard so much about this place, like this is been there for almost hundred years. So kinda disappointed. I didn‚Äôt try the veg chow mien so cannot comment on it. Honestly will not go again.

This place will always be in my mind and soul as my Dad inherited the foodie rendezvous into me when he took me here for the first time back in 2000. 17 long years have passed. But still, whenever I come to College Street, I manage my schedule to have Kabirajis here. Well, they also serve loads of delicious cutlets and chowmein. But in my opinion, nothing can beat their Kabirajis. Needless to say that I will come again here to please my stomach.

This age old shop has served a lot of happy customers and they could satiate the need of the fellow Calcuttans. Located at College Street junction this place , though not so well furnished ,is a foodie's delight. Famous for the Mutton Breast Cutlet and kabiraji this place could satisfy your tastebuds.

Great food, cheap and tasty is what I can sumup for this place.
If you haven't yet visited this place then I believe you are missing one hidden gem (just kidding)

Happy a g(f)ood day!!!

Famed for its 'mutton breast cutlet' , Dikhusha Cabin is a favourite haunt for bengali foodies. The generous sprinkling of butter and oil is an excuse for those on diet. The age old gorgeous kobiraji is a front runner and one of a kind too.¬† It is almost an old dilapidated place but thrives on nostalgia and mouthwatering snacks!

Dilkhusa is one of the old Calcutta food eateries still surviving in the town . It's well known for its Kabiraji and Cutlet's . It's at the junction of College street and MG Road . You won't be very fond of thier ambience , it looks shabby and old . But what mind bring you here is the heritage and taste of old Calcutta . You would get delicious foods here at cheaper rates . If you are a foody then this place is a must visit .

We ordered 1 chieken Kabiraji , 1 mutton breast cutlet , 1 egg chicken fried rice and 1 plate chicken kosha.
The cutlet was the best of all the items we ordered. The Kabiraji was good too . The fried rice had a huge quantity. But the chicken kosha was at all well prepared and tasted awful . Of all items we tasted the chicken kosha is not at all recommended.

Reputed to be an iconic place,this restaurant is located very conveniently at the crossing of M.G.Road & College Street.Bang in the middle of the shopping district, Calcutta University and the Boipara, it has a very middle class price point.Two fish kabiraji & 3 cups of tea added up to a bill of Rs 205.
The decor of the place,comprising of marble topped tables & old wooden chairs,don't seem to have changed since perhaps late sixties or early seventies.I could see black ants running along the wall.
The fish kabiraji had a thin layer of fish with an unnecessarily thick coating of egg batter.The layer,though thin,tasted ok.The seasoning could have been better though.As is normal with all kabiraji,this one also was dripping with oil.The tea was served in miniscule cups.It had good flavour but was extremely sweet.
The staff was prompt,efficient and quite polite.
The place survives due to three reasons namely,
Price Point,location(no decent cafes around except Indian Coffee House) & nostalgia.
Quality and hygiene,both are just about ok.

Dilkhusha's heritage is richer than the taste of its food.
Recently went to Dilkhusha for a treat with friends.
Chicken cutlet, mutton cutlet and fish kabiraji were on the plate. The kabiraji tasted good, but the cutlet wasn't up to the mark.

This is a very old place like 200 years old and the kabiraji is a specialty of this cabin which is a must try.
Whenever i come here one fish kabiraji is a must and other than that their noodles are also very good and the quantity is  enough for two people if ordered one. The kabiraji is priced at 95 bucks and the chicken noodles is about 80 bucks. So this is very pocket friendly and great value for money.

Location: At one end of the eminent College Street ( towards M.G.Road).

Pros: 
Authentic kobiraji & other non-veg delicacies. 
Reasonably cheap. 
Antique place- clinging with history.

Cons:
Space Constraint. Small seating arrangement.
Could be a bit cleaner. 
Problem occurs during excess rush of people.


Need to redesign themselves a bit.
You definitely need to be there once to taste the mutton kobiraji !

Dropped in here for a quick snack after our book hunt. The place was empty enough. The d√©cor was sparse. Marble-topped tables arranged in a row. We ordered Mutton Breast Cutlet and Mutton kabiraji. They cost 80/- and 95/- respectively. We were served soon. So waiting time was not much. 
Coming to the taste, the size of the kabiraji was particularly huge. But the taste was not that great. The taste of the fried oil and the egg batter was prominent. It overpowered the taste of the mutton. The breast Cutlet was big too. And taste was okay. Dilkhush Cabin has attained legendary status in college Street area. It would be a shame if they bring down the quality. Looking forward to a better experience in future.

You can try this place once, and if you are a college/ university student of college st area this place could be your regular lunch place.
Remember: this is not a big restaurant, so please don't compare it with other brands.

A vintage food joint in calcutta. A nice place to have lunch as well as snacks. The main attraction of this place is the gigantic and super delicious kabiraji fish/mutton/chicken.. approximately a 100 bucks but worth each penny.. well fried neither too oily nor too dry well balanced but high on calorie meter. Apart from that the egg devil, the noodles scores decent on the taste meter. Budget joint for friends and family.

Located at the heart of college street this old food joint is very popular among students and shoppers. Their kabiraji¬†and fish fry are better options to go for, but last week we tried their egg fried rice and chilli chicken and to tell you the truth it was much below the standard level. At a much cheaper price YMCA canteen near college square offers similar¬†or better fried rice and chilli chicken!

Have visited this place many times, thanks to my best half üë®. Love it's simplicity, prompt service, some staff members are very courteous. Food is good especially, their fish, mutton cutlets. I've also tried this biryani which isn't bad , if you don't expect royal awadhi standards. Also had mixed noodles which seemed a bit dry but had plenty of prawns, chicken and egg pieces. Really dig their tea. The best part is that it's extremely pocket friendly. So after a hard day of shopping for books or sarees you can head straight to this joint to unwind abd soak in a little more of the old Calcutta charm. üëçüëçüëçüëç

Being a foodie...my mind always keeps hovering here and there ..where to eat...which dish wiill b more delicious....and so on! 
As college street is famous for being BOIPARA ...we sometimes forget that there are many old cafes and restaurants which are inscribed as one of famous cafes in d history of old famous cafes and restaurants!

Direction : Itz right opposite the college street more! To be brief itz right opposite ADI MOHINI MOHAN KANJILAL shop! There will b a bus stop ..and behind d busstop is the hidden treasure - DILKHUSHA CABIN!

Ambience : itz a non-ac restaurant and free from g.s.t!
Ambience is neat and clean!

Service : The staffs ,over here, is so so soooo prudent and disciplined that we were so amazed! Their friendly nature made us glad actually!

Food : so here comes the much awaited food section! We ordered mixed chowmein and chilli chicken; mixed fried rice and boneless chilli chicken!
We were 5 in group,trust me...the quantity they gave is more enough for 2persons!! As we were half starved so we 3 shared 1 plate...
Food quantity is too good but in case of food quality chowmein was much oily but otherwise quality was good!
I want to visit here again!

Food- Oily Cabin food though you cannot fault the taste. Quantity is superb. Chinese is actually like ' rastar dokaner chowmein chili chicken but with generous helpings of chicken, shrimps egg ( I have not tried anything remotely vegetarian over there).
All in all, Value for Money

The years old heritage of this place is amalgamated with the flavors of the famous kabiraji and cutlets. Though the cabins are no more,but you'll enjoy the Dilkhush Karne Wala atmosphere here.

On last week, after pujo shopping with my family, we had our lunch at Dilkhusha Cabin in college street, Kolkata.
We relished our lunch with Mutton Kaviraji Cutlet (a must try), Egg-chicken noodles and post lunch tea. 
Mutton kabiraji cutlet of Dilkhusha Cabin was an ultimate treat to our taste pallete.

May be this place is best known for its cutlets' and kobirajis'...a place where I used to go more or less after every college street visit!!
They do give kashundhi with kobirajis and cutlets but I felt tomato ketchup could have enhanced the taste more..I asked for it... but they don't serve tomato ketchup with it.... Anyways I did enjoy mutton breast cutlet and mutton kobiraji

Had veg chow, chicken kabiraji & tea from dilkhusha cabin, college street few days back.

Veg chow was decent. Quality and quantity were good with respect to the price range. 

Chicken kabiraji is one of it's popular item. But, it tasted pretty average. I didn't like it that much.

Finished the meal with a cup of chai, which was good! Overall, it wasn't a bad experience.

I have been to this little restaurant quite a number of times. It's nothing fancy. Located at the M. G. Road - College Street crossing, this place is extremely popular among youngsters and rightly so. It's both clean and cheap. On our multiple visits we tried their Chicken Kabiraji, Fish Kabiraji, Fish Fry, Chicken Chowmein and Chill Chicken. As far as the quality and quantity of the food are concerned, there's hardly anything to complain about. Given the prices, it's a good place for students to enjoy a good meal.

Most visits to College Street end with a Kobiraji/ Cutlet at Dilkhusha Cabin. This serves delicious foods at an extremely affordable price. The food is slightly oily, but that can be overlooked ( for some :D). The taste of their delicacies are quite impressive.

On a sunny weekday after a with a hungry tummy we entered dilkhusa. After hearing a lot of the place personally I had a great expectations. Obviously the bars didn't meet(the ratings also agree with this). We ordered fish fry of which mine was way too seasoned and other one was less seasoned. The crispness was not desirable either. In all was not a great experience. Still the quality of the fish was good(the only reason giving half marks). Though still will have high hopes as the name itself carries a tradition and heritage with it.

Today, I went to Baithak Khana near Sealdah for the purpose of binding my practical laboratory notebook for my upcoming exam. I was also accompanied by one of my classmates. Post work, we were extensively hungry and began searching for an eatery on Zomato. Initially, we decided to go for Indian Coffee House but changed our mind at the eleventh hour. Dilkhusha Cabin came to our rescue and we decided to give it a shot. This particular eatery is located near the College Street crossing and happens to be a very old place in North Kolkata.
The ambience can be termed as "OKAY". The hygiene is slightly above the average mark.
Coming to the food, we decided to order Roti and Mutton Kosha. The Rotis were not served hot and the Mutton Kosha tasted decent. I personally felt that the Mutton Kosha was slightly on the spicier side. We also took two Mountain Dews as beverages. Over all, it was an average food escapade.

Last visit to this place was during my University days. Anyone who has been to College Street and hasn't tried out this place has obviously made a big blunder. Though this place serves out a limited range of dishes, you'll always find this place packed all the time with a few locals who engage in the Favourite Bengali pass time of antelamo(the interiors kind of help with that) and mostly students. The pocket pinch is very low which is why it attracts the students the most.
This place churns out some of the most wicked Kobirajis you'll ever have. Though yes i guess on Wednesdays you wont get the Mutton Kobiraji and will have to stick to Chicken Kobiraji only. Their Kobirajis will make you salivate right from the time you have planned to visit this place. Also a must try is their tea. The chinese dishes are cheap and decent enough though the gravy dishes might be a bit too gravied.
A typical tradition of the College street area eateries is the interiors. Shabby interiors with interior decoration done during the last century, curtains that come free with the furniture from the british era along with the dust. But as a college goer on a budget most students dont think about these petty things.

The present generation is more into pizza burgers and rolls etc. but if there is a curiosity in your mind what the yesterday's generation relished then this is the ideal place to experience that. The ambience is still the same since ages and the food is really good. I have tried their egg devil, kabirajis, chicken clear soup and chicken braised cutlet and trust me they are worthy of every penny you way, by the way even after a sumptuous meal your pocket will not take a toll. Only thing which you might not find good is the hygiene.

Dilkhusha cabin might be part of the Bong heritage, but this place has disappointed me the two times I have  dropped in here. The ambience is nothing to speak of, I have found the famed kabiraji to be greasy, and the chicken cutlet to be too dry. The only perks are that the pocket-pinch is low, and that it's a decent enough place to catch up with a friend after a book-hunt in College street.

This restaurant one of the old gem in kolkata due to Kabiraji. It is located near my school area. When I was  a student, so many times I will be there for Kabiraji. I just forgot the name becoz it was our canteen type restaurant. When we want kabiraji, we went there. Yesterday I choose fish kabiraji which was awesome taste. Chowmin was average.... Must try their kabiraji.... Highly recommend for kabiraji.....

This place was always in my bucket list since I joined Presidency University... this place upholds the charm of North Kolkata and is a must visit for anyone at college street. The place with its heritage and reputation of serving KOLKATA'S BEST KOBIRAJI attracts customers of all age groups... So to bid adieu to my friends in the final year of graduation we chose this quintessential place for our Farewell eat out. We had ordered 
Fish kobiraji
Mutton cutlet
Chicken fried rice
The mutton cutlets wasn't that good. It was spicy and really dry with no flavour of the meat..
The fried rice was really good and filling...
Coming to the kobiraji, they were huge fried pieces of fish coated in a lot of egg wash and flour... the quality of the fish was good but maybe they can go a bit thinner on the coating. I prefer mitra cafe's kobiraji to this one but all said it did fill out appetite... the amount was really good and two people can easily share a piece of kobiraji. If you are looking for fine dinning experience and healthy  food this is not recommended. However if you want to catch a glimpse of the heritage of our city and relieve the old times with your friends, this place will not disappoint you with its fried treats

Pros:
1. Old legacy
2. Behaviour of the stuffs
3. Good food, Chicken Kabiraji is just awesome
4. Quick service
5. The place where it situated

Cons:
1. Non-AC
2. Interior is not like modern restaurant 
3. No menucard present at each table
4. Timing : its open only upto 8:30pm

I have been here twice. What I think that this is a place where we can feel the old calcutta charm and its heritage. As per my opinion it is a good place for evening snacks. The behaviour of the stuff and the service is good. The food is awesome as I mention earlier. It will be better if they can provide menu card at each table, and converted this place into a AC restaurant.

I have heard the name of Dilkhusha cabin from my father as one of the oldest and leading eateries in College Street. Recently I had been there with my friends. The place has changed over the years and new additions have been made to this old place as we could figure it out. We had ordered Fish Kabirajis. It was average with a bit oily and a heaving coating of egg. However, the quality of fish was good. Overall for a small bite and a low pocket pinch in the bustling streets of College Street, this place would be fine.

I have very fond memories of visiting Dilkhusha as a child with my father. I remember it was ¬†more about the big mirrors and doors and beautiful wooden tables than about the food. But times have changed and so have I. Recently dropped in to Dilkhusha after a quick buy at college street.¬†
¬†We ordered a Chicken Kabiraji and a Mutton Braised Cutlet . Without a doubt both were delicious. The quantity was enough for the 3 of us, anything more would have been extra. The ¬†CHICKEN KABIRAJI was not very oily, and the egg coating was fluffy light deliciousness. The quality of meat in both the items was top notch. The covering in the BRAISED CUTLET was thin and crispy. You bite into juicy meat which slowly melts in your mouth. Served with salad ( I doubt the freshness) and Kasundi, I could have this everyday.¬†
These foods are disappearing from Kolkata, and I love that we still have such places to hold on to our gastronomical heritage. I will turn the corner every other day I visit college street, I hope you do too.

Service:6.5/10

Orders: 
Chicken Kabiraji(8/10): Good size, good taste, looks beautiful, served with Kasundi and onions. The outer golden coat is delicious and crispy. The chicken inside, tender and juicy. 

Fish Fry(6.5/10): Not happy with the quantity! Served with onions and kasundi as well. No smell in the fish, so that's a good thing. Tender and but dry. 

Not so crowded.

An age old legacy. I liked the place, although I didn't get the chance to taste any non-vegetarian food as it was Monday. I have been to this place before so I know that it has the old-calcuttan charm. The service is prompt but the waiters are a little rude. But it is very nice to know that my city has still not given away these places which reek of nostalgia.

This is one of those restaurants which you don't evaluate for the sake of food or ambience etc. but for its legacy. Dilkhusha is
one of those. I was highly recommended by my elderly uncle to visit his "modern standard eatery " as he called it when I started going to College Street to study MA. The main entrance and the marble tabletop give evidence of the legacy.
The waiter looked tired and disinterested. We placed the order of mutton cutlets and chicken chops. Both were tasty and filling.
I sincerely hope that it does not give way to any pizza counter or cafe in future. The old smell is always calming.

'Dilkhusha Cabin' is one of the vintage places of Kolkata whic still serves delicious food. Most of the vintage places are now going down in terms of quality but this place stands head and shoulders above most of them.

I visit College Street frequently but previously I did not get a chance to visit this place due to paucity of time.Finally,on Wednesday we visited this place. It is located at College Street more just opposite to Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal.

We went at 3 pm. It was crowded,luckily we got two seats. The decor was simplistic.We ordered one egg fried rice and boneless chilli chicken. The food came within ten minutes. The quantity of the rice was enough for two people. The chillo chicken had four pieces of boneless chicken meatballs in them and it went well with the rice. Both the egg fried rice and the chilli chicken were delicious. The Chicken metaballs had very little batter around it and was soft,tender and juicy . 

Up next, we ordered one 'Chicken Kobiraji'. The food came within seven minutes.The size of the kobiraji was humongous and was served with complimentary salad and mustard sauce. The coating of fried egg around the inner cutlet was delectable. The cutlet inside was also delicious. We loved it.

The staff was very well behaved and amiable in nature. I will definitely visit again.

The ideal pocket friendly food joint. This is the right place if you're low on your budget. College street is famous mainly for Coffee House, but this is one place which can parallel coffee house in terms of food. The place is not very spacious. The staff are very courteous and co-operative. We ordered fish kabiraji and chicken kabiraji. The amount of food is enough for a person with medium to high appetite. Just that I felt there was a bit less salt in the fish kabiraji.

Dilkhusa Cabin as the name signifies makes one's heart happy on the visit and thus the name purely suits on them. It is 'hidden' among the book stalls of College Street and one needs to dig it up like a 'gem', thus adding a justification to the listing as "Hidden Gems" on Zomato. It is an aged restaurant particularly known for Bengali cuisines, has been serving us for ages.

It is a good place for folks who like to have long conversations about the universe over a plate of fast food. Generally people out here treat this as a cafe, but, unlike the usual coffee shops, people here orders food first and then any beverages. 

The ambience out here is noisy but a typical Bengali in any day would not be irritated about the atmosphere, but, rather like it. The staffs out here are monotonous in behaviour, but, they aren't disrespecting. The food service is rather fast and the price justified.

As the saying goes old is gold, but, the quality of the food is gradually decreasing with time. There was a time when they were said to serve top notch quality and hence the goodwill, making Zomato users review them with high points. However, the passage of time is taking a toll on them, making the quality slowly but gradually deteriorate. Nevertheless, they still serve quality food better than many at the same price.

A visit recommended!

We had fish fry. They serve it with sliced cucumbers and onions and some kasundi. Very pocket friendly. It costs just 60 INR. The staff is extremely courteous. They took less than 5 minutes to serve us and the fry was fresh and hot.

Will be going back to this place for seconds!

Once a legend. Now just a memory...
The famous "kobiraji cutlet" of this cafe (mentioned multiple times in the legendary bengali literatures) tasted bland and too oily.
This outlet along with coffee house,basanta cabin are now just dusky shades of a shining past.

Dilkhusha cabin is a famous and old eatery located at College street.  situated just at the opposite of mohini mohon kanjilal. On the very 1st day of my college life I have tried their fish fry . Also tried their egg fried rice and chilli chicken. Egg fried rice was good but doesn't taste Chinese. Chilli chicken was too sweet.

Its just in the 4 point of college street more on MG road tram line way.... place is small but ok, as compared to other cabins its good enough, nice and tidy, service is tooooo good... familiar behaviour of the serving staff will make your dish more tasteful.
Now coming to the point of food-
Menu is limited, prices are low, not the supreme quality of food but really good that was....... they never leave you complaining with their food, satisfying services make the food more tasty.
The tea was awesome.
And their special kabiraji, oh my god!!! You can never imagine what the size of a kabiraji would be unless you order it. And the top most part its fair enough for the budget foodies, 1 kabiraji is enough as a lunch meal.
I'm satisfied

Dilkhusha cabin is a famous and old eatery located at College street.

It has an old world ambience with sitting arrangenents and nice staffs with quick service.



Tried Mutton cutlet, which was awesome. Fried rice and chilli chicken were nice too and well cooked. Their special egg devil is bit disappointing, large in size, mostly stuffed with potatoes is average.

Overall a nice place.

This restaurant is located at the college street and mahatma gandhi Road crossing. Its very old and hence has a good feel of old Kolkata. 
Now coming to their ambience it has two parts. One at the outer area while One inside. Its very less crowded and the inside of the restaurant was also very clean. 
But they don't provide with any menu card hence one had to go and see their menu hanged on the wall and order from there. 

We ordered one chicken cutlet and one mutton one. Those were served very quickly. But surprisingly the chicken Cutlet costed more than the mutton one. 
Coming to the taste those are very ordinary nothing that special about them. 
Well it's a good for a 1st time experience. You can give it a try when u r hungry in this place...

An easy and pocket friendly choice for students and shoppers. 
Having Tut around there for a year made me go there more than once. Decades ago I went with my mom and then mostly during Tut.
Located at the heart of college Street . It's a old looking eatary with shabby interiors but food is gud .
The chai is awesome .
Things I tried
Chowmin : oily 
Fried rice : nice and tasty
3. Chilly chicken : too much soya sauce but leaving that it's gud
4. Kosha mutton with lacha paratha : very gud 
5 cutlet : grt
6. Kobiraji : real gud 

One can drop once in a while for the fingure foods like cutlets and kobiraji .

Went there for many occasions after buying books from College Street.
Ordered chicken fowl cutlet, mutton cutlet , which were just awesome , a must try for telebhaja lovers.
Tried chicken kobiraji which was delectable , fried rice, chili chicken which were good too both in quality and quantity .
Got disappointed with fish fry and special egg devil, both were dry and stuffed with mostly mashed potatoes.
Decor is very simple with average ambience.
Pocket pinch is high.

I have been born and raised in college street, so I'm no stranger to Dilkhusha Cabin. Because I'm based outside WB for quite a while now, I've not had a chance to try it out in recent times until a few days back during my homecoming. Happened to visit this place for lunch one day. The first thing that will appeal to you is its pricing and quantity. The fried rice, chowmin and chilli chicken are very well priced and have good quantities. Their kabirajis are well known and used to be very good but aren't the same now. Service is very laid back and it seemed that the table attendants weren't very pleased to take the orders. The biggest turnoff is the fish fry, it was very dry and hard. The amount of fish was too less, the patty was more about the other stuff. Very disappointing! Not sure if I would like to go back there. The rating is based on my fond memories of this place during my childhood and the pricing. They will be rated pretty poor in terms of quality, sad but true.

The speciality is Fish kabiraji as I and my family often realized but it doesn't mean you can't go with other dishes all are too good to please you and your tummy, the last but not the list the staff are too good and friendly and caring as well.

Dilkhusha cabin is a namesake for what it does to me - Makes my soul very very happy! 

A small eatery, with a really old history. I've always been hearing of it from my dad's College days and I my self have been visiting it for the past 5 years. 

Chicken Kabiraji, Fish Fry, Egg Chowmeun and Chili Chicken is recommended. 
Food is delicious. It maybe be super greasy but hey it's not something you are eating regularly! 

Some Kolkata Classic still maintaining it's standards. 

Do I recommend it ? YES
Value for Money ? Always. 
What should I order ? Chicken Kabiraji & Coke. 
Will I be back? sooner than you think.

I had heard a lot about this place and finally visited this place with one of my kobiraji cutlet lover friend. We had ordered mutton kobiraji, fish fry , chow, chili chicken. To be honest, I didn't like the taste of any of those dishes. The food was very oily too.This place is pocket Friendly though!

I have very fond memories related to this place and everytime I visit this place it doesn't disappoint me at all. Their kobiraji is mindblowing also their fries.... Ordered chicken noodles this time.  Noodles was ok not that great but entirely suited for a hungry stomach.

Dilkhusha, the name is enough to describe how you feel about the place. If you are a true food lover, the place is heaven for you. If one has not yet experience the kabiraji of dilkhusha, he has missed a lot in his life. Simple restaurant. If you are Ambience conscious people, then you may not like the place. Because there is no decoration, nothing at all. But this is the place, where people go to taste unique taste. Please try the kabiraji item here.

Dilkusha means Dil kush karne wala kuch chiz, and yes, the restaurant holds its name by its taste and tradition... If you want a old traditional restaurant with some good quality food, thn M sure you can't ignore this one...

Location is very easy..Situated at Collage Street Crossing, just opposite to Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal. You may not heard about this restaurant, but you will hardly found any person in Kolkata, who has not heard about Mohini Mohan Kanjilal. So I thing you can understand, where the restaurant actually is!

Old decoration, nothing fancy about it..Basic Table chair sittings arrangement.. In one word, canteen like environment..The place can hold about 30 persons at a time.

The stuffs, those who work there, are working there for many years and they are friendly also..Service is fast

When it comes about Dilkusha cabin, one name will always come to your mind, and that is Kabiraji and cutlet. Yes, they are famous for there kabiraji mainly. When you come to this restaurant, you can see that almost everyone in there are ordering Kabiraji. The offers also Chowmin, fried rice etc. But among all of them, Mutton Cutlet and Chicken Kabiraji is my most fav one till my school days.

Mutton Cutlet ‚Äì Big sized, crispy fried cutlet, served with salads and mustard sauce. The cutlet may seems dry from outside, but it is juicy from inside. Perfect for anytime..

Chicken Kabiraji ‚Äì Yes, this one is the most hit, most ordered item out there....Well fried, no excess oil, but little crispy in nature, juicy from inside..Served with salad and Mustard sauce. Try it, you will love it for sure..Very much recommended..

In conclusion, I can no doubt say that, this restaurant serves food for an decade and still holding it position by its quality and taste. The price of every item is very much budget friendly and no Vat and Tax are added, which is goid for every school and college students. Try this restaurant for once and it will really make you ‚ÄòDil Kush‚Äô..

My review of this place will differ from many others I see.I have gone there 2 times,both experiences was not good. first time we ordered the mutton cutlet,chicken kobiraji both were hard to chew and very oily. next time we went for saree shopping,went there with our family, the staffs were very rude,one of asked if they have a bathroom, the way they replied and behaved it was so Bad. NXT comes the food- we ordered fried rice,mixed chow and chilly fish the rices were undercooked,chowmin was very oily as well,the fish tested bad,it was a fresh fish at all,it was so hard and bad,the worst thing was we found a hair in the chowmin, when we told them they didn't gave it any importance at all the food was bad,unhygienic the worst thing was there behaviour, I definitely will not visit the place again.

Dilkhusha Cabin is among the few very old restaurants of Kolkata. Dilkhusha is located at the College Street junction, just opposite of Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal and serves really good food.
I have tried the Chicken Kabiraji the 1st day I visited and it was good.
Then on my next visit I ordered for Fired rice and Chilli Chicken and it was also fantastic at surprisingly low price.
I also tried the Mixed Chowmine which is also properly made and tasted good.
This place has a small door inlet and is hard to locate. The interior has looks of Old Kolkata with Wooden chairs and tables. Staffs are good although don't except a warm welcome.
Overall this place is good to go.
Must visit if you are in College street looking for affordable food.

It serves the best fast food in the area be it mutton kabiraji, fried rice ,chilly chicken, chowmein and what not. It is a must visit for me whenever I happen to be in the area. Last time I visited had ordered mixed chowmein and chilli chicken. The quantity was really good and the food will definitely excite ur tastebuds. The best place for "adda" with friends over some truly delicious food. The waiters are super friendly and they really take good care of the customers.

From the legends of tenida comes yet another old treasures of kolkata, or so i thought.
We visited this place a few days back, the decor and ambiance is that of an old neglected restaurant, thought it had a renovation few years back.
Lets come to the food, we ordered chicken kabiragi, mutton chop and mutton breast cutlet.
The kabiragi, to much of our surprise, was made in advance and¬† was reheated and served.
The mutton chop was nothing to be proud of.
But the mutton breast cutlet was delicious.
You can visit this place out of nostalgia, to just freshen up some good old college memories.

I had gonne with my bro as he was gaga over it! Honestly d first look of d joint didn't appeal as it was a picture of neglect....
But then when bro ordered chicken kabiraji and fish kabiraji I was taken aback with d taste... local flavour at its best... I digged into d delicacies and v summed it up with tea... dat was my first visit.. 
For me these joints r even better than d theme restaurants as they effortlessly brings out d culture, d legacy....

Definitely I love this place but it pains such gems r not able to bask in its real glory due to utter neglect...

Dilkhusha cabin is a very old food joint located at college street just opposite to Adi mohinimohon kanjilal. 
Since my college is very near to college street I have been here quite a few number of times. 
If you are at college street for some work and you are hungry and you are looking for something to eat with a very low pocket pinch you can easily come here and satisfy your hunger. 
I have had chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. The quantity was good and the food tasted good although the chicken was very spicy. 
I have also had chicken and fish kabiraji. Both them tasted great. :)

Yet another famous restaurant, and has been so for quite sometime now. This restaurant has a very Bengali appeal to it . Kabirajis, cutlets, egg devils, biryanis are a few of the items. In comparison to modern restaurants it might be struggling in some departments but this place has a very authentic vibe that is hard to match.

The service was quite prompt and that is a very good quality that all restaurants should have. The mutton breast cutlet that I ordered had a bone in it and felt a little dry-ish. Yet the taste was decent enough. The cup of tea that they serve is about PERFECT. Yes , that is the word that I am going to use. And a cup of tea only costs Rs 5. :)

A perfect place to grab an evening snack or hang out with buddies. It is oozing with that north Kolkata wala feel . Great experience :)

Awesome place and food in very reasonable price. Delicious and satisfying with a simple ambience. Would like to go there ever and ever again. The fish fry is awesome and well as the fried rice...the chilli chicken had too much soy sauce but it's alright you can still have it with the rice...it's just not preferable to have with roti. Would have been more happy if there was dessert though!

One of the heritages of Kolkata. Exactly at the four points of College Street. From the decorum of the cabin you will feel like you are in the old Calcutta. Must taste the Fish Kabiraji and Fish Cutlet. One of the best Kabirajis and Cutlets they have. Both are served with salad and Kasundi. Eating the Kabiraji & Cutlet will give you the feeling like you are in the heaven and nothing is more delicious than that.

One of the hidden gems in college street located opposite to Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal. It might not look very appealing if you looking a proper restaurant. During my university time we were the regular customer. I specially liked their chicken kabiraji and mixed chowmin. But  only one request - please increse the quantity.. :)

Places like this should be visited for a good plate of Kosha Mangsho, and not the over hyped one serving chewy and tough meat. For me Dilkhusha cabin is synonymous to Kosha Mangsho. Soft, melt in your mouth meat, and rich, spicy and tasty gravy. Only disappointment in this section is the rotis, which are hard and cold. 

The fish fry here comes with a fat fillet, but most of the time I found it to be dry and tasteless. The noodles here are pretty ordinary, and if you must, stick to the veg or egg options. The meat options come with thick pieces of meat which are mostly dry and does not go well with noodles.

Ambience is basic and old house. I love the big mirror inside. Service is fast and friendly.

This place is worth travelling for only for the excellent kosha mangsho.

This place is a perfect example of old calcutta.
The most famous dish served is Kabiraji. Its old...greasy but its delicious. If you are looking for ambience then this is definitely not the place. I have been visiting this place since my college days. It has never disappointed me with the fish and chicken Kabiraji. The usp of t his place is...its very inexpensive. Worth visiting this restaurant if you are an explorer and not fussy about the ambience.

Nowadays as younger generation most of us love visiting cafes but these cabin were a place of adda, romance and lot more for many of our parents. I too visited this place during my childhood and now I understand that shabby, talkative ambiance cannot be replaced by our posh cafes. The food still maintains its quality at lower rates.

Located at the college street more dilkhusa cabin gives you a typical bong vibe. Went for a quick lunch today with my colleagues. We ordered chicken cutlet and chicken kabiraji. Frankly speaking i liked the chicken cultlet more than chicken kajiraji. I am looking forward to have more gastronomical experince from this food joint.

Some place are chock full of old world charm, that comes free with the food that they serve. Dilkhusha Cabin at the college street MG Road crossing is a case in point. This place has been around for a while and it shows. Once you enter the place you are transported back by decades, to the Old Kolkata. particularly love the huge mirror placed on a slant on the side. Since it is close to my college, I have been here quite a few times.

I quite like their fish fry and mutton chop. The chowmein is good too and tastes great on its own with some sauces. Their chilli chicken is okayish to be honest. But my favourite dish would have to be their Chicken Kabiraji. A huge chicken cutlet covered in egg, which is crisp at the frills and with a custard-like softness within, coupled with a more than huge portion size, it is one of my favourite things to eat in the neighbourhood. Perhaps the only con about the dish is its oiliness, but there is nothing wrong wit ha sinful treat once in a while.

Service is quite prompt and the place has great value for money. A must-visit if you are in the area..

Edit:-had fishfry today. Stale and smelly fish. Charged 55 rs. Paid to eat crumbs on the outside.
This is again one of the old places to be visited at least once. One can try the Fish kabiraji but it must be shared between 2 people as the size is really big for a single person to have. I had tried the roti with kosha mangsho, it ¬†was average in taste and the pieces were hard.

Went there quite a few times during my university days. When I am alone, nursing a hungry stomach with very little money. Quaint little place from another era. The entrance gate itself will remind of you of another time. This place is exclusively for cutlets and kabirajis. Actually coffee house, dilkhus, mitra  cafe all are well known for this. With mitra cafe being the best.

Small, dimly lit and screaming of the old world charm we Bongs love to get nostalgic about, Dilkhusa Cabin is a pall bearer of times left behind. The quality has dipped over the years (not as drastically though as in a few other such places) but the kabiraji is still to die for.

¬†¬†Do not call yourself a foodie till you have visited this cabin.

Located just by the College Street signal, this place is one of the hidden gems of this city. Famed due to its heritage and the long association of many legends who have graced this place, their apparent specialty is their Kabirajis. I must say, they were once pretty good with Kabirajis but right now the quality is no better than a cheap roadside joint.

Last time I visited there, the Kabirajis had a weird smell. Actually it was the Mutton Cutlet within which did not taste good. I had to leave my food in between and fill up my tummy with a small bottle of cold drinks. The staffs are very cordial here and the service is fast but with the declining quality of food, I couldn't rate any better than 2.5

the good old charm of Kolkata food. went there on probably the hottest day of this season and was immediately felt comfortable by their cordial behavior - even without an AC. we ordered for chicken kabiraji and mutton breast cutlet and oh wow! they were so tasty ! though as expected the food was a bit oily. overall had a lovely time munching on the food and drinking chilled cold drink despite the hostile weather.

The food was normal. Had roti and chilly chicken, egg chowmein and fish fry.
The roti and chilly chicken was good
Chow was oily.
Fish fry tasted good but was too hard. Should have fried it a little less and maintained a softness inside.
Overall it was average.

Small but definitely livened by the person who attended on us. He offered us advise on what we might eat and we ended up parceling stuff from this nice little restaurant. ¬†Fish fry was huge, came with a salad and mustard chutney (INR 55). All of us cleaned our plates - it was another thing that we were hungry. The tea was a wee bit sweet. ¬†More than anything 5* for the waiter - who offered to autograph the bill for us!

A small little corner tucked away in the folds of memory of central Calcutta. I visited it during the durga puja period with suitable apprehension regarding quality of food and availability of seats. But true to its reputation the cabin with its old world charms and amazing chicken kobiraji stole my heart away. Also a full heavy and tasty meal consisting of the typical Bengali Chinese cuisine is incredibly light on the pocket. A perfect place to court nostalgia with friends to old Manna Dey tunes.

Went there with 3 of my office friends. Tried their Fish Kabiraji which was good. Also tried their Mutton Kosha with Roti. Now their mutton was well cooked and it's gravy was standard. I did like it but should say that it was good not extraordinary. Dont expect much from the ambience front as it is a small roadside kinda joint. Overall a good experience with their Kabiraji & Mutton Kosha.

Just as Pune witnessed the disappearance of the once fabled Irani cafes, Kolkata has its own shares of cafes & cabins on the brink of oblivion and extinction. I visited this one and gorged on mutton kabiraji ( which is nothing but the benglicization of coverage since the mutton is covered with a layer of eggs, the closest cousin being the parsi farcha). The mutton was handsomely generous in quantity and was a delight to the taste buds. Mutton kasha was another surprise, a quarter portion enough to salivate and get satiated.

One of the hidden gems of College Street. This place serves the best fish kabiraji I've ever had! And the size is enormous. It was too big for even a foodie like me to finish in 1 go. Complete value for money. Only complaint- food is too oily.

A place hidden behind the book stalls of College Street, this gem of a restuarent ('bangla hotel' is more suitable term) that can give some of the bug names a run for their money.

Fish Kabiraji and Chicken Cutlet with their signature tea makes anyone's day - I strongly believe that. From my school days this place has always been my favs and I still recommend to people who goes shopping @College Street.

Furnitures and get up is definitely vintage (not at its best) but who cares when the food quality and taste are tip notch at a price beyond comparison. 

Happy fooding üòã

Opposite mohini mohan kanjilal and sons in themg rd is this renowned place known mostly for the kabirajis served here. The kabiraji here is good had fish chickn mutton all 3 kabirajis but they are all too much oily. The cutlet here is good also .Overall if u want to throw a brthday party with limited resources this place is good for u otherwise its a waste ,u will get better chowmeins and rice in other places...

One of the old eateries which I like to visit whenever I am in college street. While enjoying kabiraji/cutlet with 'kasundi' served on a plate over the marble topped table,one can feel the charm of old Bengali eatery.
Fish kabiraji,mutton cutlet,special egg devils are worth trying.
Staffs are experienced and prompt in service.
They are maintaining cleanliness which is not so usual in old food joints.

Today i visited this place to try their reknowned fried items. This place boasts a lot with their popular telebhaja items but to my dismay all the hype which i had heard until now about them came down crashing with utter disappointment.

The place looks like those old bengali eating places with joint tables & wooden chairs with good spacious area to accommodate crowd. So after going through their wall hanging menu board, i ordered the following:-

1. Fish fry- Medium sized but quite compact & nicely filled with thick fish fillet inside. The fry was crisp but the quality of the fish wasn't good at all. It was neither very fresh nor very stale which ruined the taste for me. Very disappointing.

2. Chicken kabiraji- Disaster is the perfect word to sum this dish up. The kabiraji they served was huge in size but it is so not worth it. The filling barely had any chicken contents. The taste left a lot to be desired. So not recommended.

The only positive i found was the service. My order was served within 10mins which was quick enough with the incoming crowd. But i wouldn't like to visit again due to the lack of quality in their food

Visited this place very recently on a friend's suggestion. Menu consisted of almost all the quintessential bengali non-veg popular snack food. Ordered the chicken kabiraji, chicken cutlet and fish fry. The kabiraji was huge! And tasted brilliant. The cutlet and the fish fry were pretty tasty as well. The wide eyed expressions on checking the slightly higher than normal prices eventually though turned out to be pretty justified. 
Located right at the college street crossing on MG Road, this place carries a certain old age legacy with it. Service was a tad slow, but worth every bit of the wait.

One of the oldest joint in college street which I absolutely love to visit though their consistency is not very constant. This place Is situated just opposite mohini mahan kanjilal which is the famous saree shop. Though this place is very old but it is very clean and tidy. Whenever I come to college street I make it a point to eat here which I again did yesterday. We ordered fish fry which my friend did not like at all and was disappointed. The taste was not heightened because it had absolutely no salt so it was tasteless but the coating was well made ,the filling was also well made also the fish was fresh as it had no smell though not bekty.  I would say compared to the price(rs. 55) the fry was okay though some spices in it would give it some taste. I like visiting this place so nothing really would deter me from visiting this place again.

Location : College Street
Locating this place can be very very difficult.. It is very close to the college street crossing if you are coming from Sealdah..It might not look very appealing if you were expecting a prim and proper restaurant.. It is one of those very old North Kolkata joints..We took all the Kabirajis available on the menu.. And I loved all of them..My favorite though will still be Mutton Kabiraji and Fish Fry.
 Just a warning: These are massive so if you are a small eater there is a good chance you might not be able to finish it..

One of those legendary old places situated in the old parts of North Kolkata in College Street. Situated just opposite the Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal store, this place is popular for its chicken cutlets and Kabirajis. Once you enter this, you will find intellectuals debating and talking over issues over a cup of tea and with some cutlets in front of them. I tried the Fish Kabiraji Cutley and let me tell you it has been the best I ever had. Priced at Rs. 80 ,it was big enough for to two people. Delicious really! I am surely going to try out the other things in the menu sometime soon! Highly recommended.

Situated at college street, it's a very heritage and famous place mostly known for their signature item "dim er devil". A cosy place to have adda with your friends or colleagues. 
Have been there quite a couple of times. Recently tried their famous dim er devil and mutton chop. Very well prepared and tasty enough to make you drool over their other items. 
If you're in college street, make sure you don't miss out this amazing food joint.

Went there with my friends and ordered the fish kobiraji and chicken cutlet...was really surprised to see the size of both the items...coming to the cutlet it was great...thoroughly enjoyed the crispiness...and the kobiraji was mouth watering too...and the kashundi served along really enhanced its taste to a great extent...but the fish of the kobiraji had bones on it and it took a good effort to remove all those from it...ambience is ok, nothing much to write about...but what really made the deal a good one was the quantity of the items...

Known for "age-old legacy", correctly stated, this small restaurant in Colleg street is famous for cutlet and kabiraji.(both chicken and fish variants are quite tasty). We also tried the egg devil and mutton cutlet. Nothing noteworthy to mention in terms of ambience, although the service is quick and its quite pocket friendly as well. Overall, 4.0/5.0

Just as Presidency has been my second home, and College Street my para from nearly the past three years, Dilkhusha is like the para's eatery for my friends and myself, a beloved hangout to eat lunch whenever we don't feel like perusing our university canteens or going past college Street to fill our perpetually hungry tummies. Today being my birthday we went all out and ordered a nice number of things, to the delight of the waiter serving us XD The chicken kabiraji was large,crispy, oily and wonderfully eggy as always. The boneless chilli chicken was tender and spicy,well worth the money charged. We had ordered 2 mutton chops for starters amongst the five of us and one of my friends was simply awestruck at the size of a single chop equalling that we usually attribute to a cutlet! Service was relatively quick, a pleasant surprise since its usually a bit slow.

Dilkhusha is fast food restaurant at the heart of the College Street... This place is better known for its Kavirajis and has a age old legacy... Oneday after buying books in college street when we felt a sudden hunger, We decided to visit here... The decor is not so good...
But the Kavirajis have no comparison...
We had Chicken Kaviraji and Fish Fry...
Kaviraji was really scrumptious and enough for one stomach... Fish fry was also good ... but the place is always full of crowd... so it takes time to have a seat and have the dish after ordering...

Reading the reviews about this place i was really excited to go there. The opportunity came today when i went to college street with my father to buy some books and had our lunch there. As we weren't very hungry I ordered one chicken kabiraji and my father ordered one vegetable chow. I thought the kabiraji was supposed to be crispy from outside but it wasn't at all crispy. Apart from that it tasted quite good, though I haven't had kabiraji before so I had nothing to compare it with. The chow was 'fine', nothing extra ordinary though I didn't expect it to be. 
The impressive thing was the quantity. It was good. Finishing one kabiraji was getting difficult for me. Though this opinion may vary from person to person. 
The place had a very old-Calcutta like feel. I liked it. Where i was sitting the tables were joined and there wasn't much privacy but inside, I could see, there were separate tables for two or four people. 
The waiters were attentive enough. 
Overall I had a good experience and won't mind going there again to try the other dishes.

Since the exams got over yesterday, we surely had to eat out and the best part was our professor treated us to the fullest over here. It's a very old place located at the M G Road and College Street crossing. More famous for the Kabirajis, we opted for this only. Some of us went for the Fish Kabirajis and the others for Chicken Kabiraji. Kabirajis are a special kind of fry whose batter is made with egg and cornflour. The Fish Kabiraji was better than the Chicken one as everyone said. It was crispy, well fried and cooked. The spices blended perfectly and many of us got exhausted in gorging that enormously big fry. In the Chicken Kabiraji, they used the breast piece and so it was fibrous and hard to tear. These places do not serve very healthy food, but they are surely good enough to satisfy your taste buds and provide you immense gastronomic pleasure. North Kolkata has a huge treasure of eating joints of this kind. Dilkhusa Cabin is surely one of these. I aspire to try out most of these places in this last six months of my regular life in College Street. Happy Dining, once again! :)

I visit this eatery every time I am in Kolkata. I have been going there ever since I was a sixth grader. I guess at least three generations of Bengali people in Kolkata would feel nostalgic about places like this around the College Street area. I know a few who would just sit there for a long time, order a few cups of tea, ruminate on old memories, and leave with a heavy but satisfied heart.

Ok, the food. Nothing specifically good or bad. Nothing special about the ambiance, either, other than a wrap of nostalgia. Oh, try the Fish Kobiraji!

If you are from outside Kolkata and would like to smell the olden days of the city - try Dilkhusha or the few other oldies around.

True hidden treasure of kolkata. Only non-veg.
Place was old looking and with proper sitting arrangement. Separate room for couples and group or singles. Ambitious was traditional. Hospitality was heart touching. Very friendly behavior by staffs and they very helpful too. Service was quick and presentation was also good. Come to food they serves pure quality Chinese-Bengoli cuisine. As said at beginning pure non-veg foods which are very delicious. I tried their chowmin and Friedrice in veg made by special request and my friend tried egg chicken chowmin and very impressed by tasty, quantity and quality. Must try place for every citizen specially bengoli snacks lover's. Traditional experience. Highly Recommended to all.

Yet another stalwart of North Kolkata situated right amongst the busy streets of College Street boi para..Dilkhusha is a reminiscent of the bygone era..the time when bengalis use to cherish their 'adda' sessions over a cup of tea and a delightful golden crisp cutlet or fry..
Have been going to this place since childhood but it never occured to me to actually write a review for this place..since joints like Dilkhusha seems a bit misfit in zomato or smartphone era..Still this place will give you a nostalgic feeling and the taste of food probably not that frequent in today's pizza invested kolkata..
This place is a pure value for money, a typical cafe/cabin which Bengalis have cherished for long..You won't find any fancy decor or innovative theme but when it comes to the evergreen Fish Fry or Kabiraji or Devil there is no compromise with the taste and quality..Service is super quick and even today you can actually relish Bhetki Fry or Kabiraji at a very economical price..Though the quality and the portions have gone done in recent times..still it can give the newbies a run for their money..

Been there once. Located in the cultural centre of the city, it is very popularly known for common Calcuttian snacks, friendly services and good old ambience. Must try the non veg cutlets and their speciality large, not so oil soaked kabiraji. A little expensive for an evening snacks. A must for the chaivinists and strollers around the place. A lot can happen over a cup of chai and a plate of cutlets.

This was the first time i went to this famous food joint of the past. To tell the truth in the beginning i was not very sure of the quality of food available here seeing the condition of the restaurant. However, i was proven utterly wrong. I had gone for my pre-wedding shopping at Adi Mohini Mohan and of course after shopping hunger drove all of us to this place. The server was so polite and he greeted us and each time he served us we felt as if we were right in the middle of our own home! I was humbled by this level of hospitality and courtesy which is even void in many of our top class five star restaurants of our city. We had ordered 6 chicken kabiraji and 6 teas. Our afternoon jol khabar as we say in bangla was just delicious ! The kabiraji was cooked to perfection so was the tea! This quaint joint restored my faith in old Calcutta food joints which we now claim have lost their taste and charm due to the glitz of the new restaurants. I definitely recommend every single person to visit this place!

The food is simply delicious. The chowmin is one of the best in town. Recently they have started serving biryani which I am yet to taste. Though I would want a makeover for them. Do surely visit this place if ur anywhere in or around college street.

The ambiance has a special north Calcutta and colonized Bengal feel. The behavior of the staff are very decent and whats most important is the cost-its the cheapest you can get considering good quality the serve. On the whole, a really good place to eat in any time of the day, be it lunch,snacks or dinner, they have their menus arranged for every time of the day. Looking forward towards my next visit.

I used to frequent this college street outlet way back with my dad on our routine rambles through the boi para...so its dipped in nostalgia(along with the quintessential kasundi :p ) the chicken kabiraji is definitely the show stealer but I like the devilled eggs n fish cutlets as well. The thing I like most is even  in this Uber laden n 'zomato'ised kolkata it still retains the old world charm of calcutta which is very rare these days even  in North kolkata

After a long time visited Dilkhusa cabin yesterday after covering an assignment. And what did I order? Of course Mutton Kabiraji. The plateful of the delicious Kabiraji served with salad and mustard was somwthing I was yearning for a long time. And I was not disappointed. It just felt like a perfect Kabiraji for an evening snack.

It is a common notion that almost all the once famous cabins of North Kolkata have lost their significance in the food map of the city due to the deteriorating quality of the food they offer. But this is not entirely correct. And to prove the cynics wrong, you have to go there and have the polular dishes.

I used to come here in between tutions at m.g.road in 2013. Old school fried Bengali food at its best! The chicken kabiraji is so good...the thought of it makes me hungry :p the cutlets are crispy and have ample fillings. The chowmein might tend to be on the oily side... Don't go by its look,just step inside and eat to your heart's content,you will not be disappointed..

Visited this place twice with University friends, typical Old Calcutta Cabin atmosphere, didn't find the waiters cordial, we had to go to the counter for ordering.
We had Chicken Kavirazi, Chicken Cutlet and Egg Devil. I tried Chicken Kavirazi before at Mitra cafe and I must say Dilkhusa's Kabirazi is not upto the mark. The Kasundi they provide with the snacks wasn't tasty enough. The size of the egg devil reminded me of the Dinosaur's eggs, but the taste wasn't as good as the size. This place is OK for 'adda' with friends, but if u wanna try awesome Kabiraji, visit Mitra cafe!

Unfortunately this restaurant looses its pride name just under the bus stop, I mean to say the banner of the restaurant is hidden just beside the opposite bus stop of Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal, so it makes it bit difficult to find the restaurant if you are over here for the first time. Fortunately the quality of the food over here is more than enough to hold the pride of this restaurant. The main attraction of this place is the ratio of quality, quantity & price.

Coming to the food, Fish Kaviraji over here tastes so good so that your mouth, tongue & stomach will force you to get another one. All the dishes over here are well priced makes this restaurant a pocket friendly stomach filling place. Also the well maintained organized space is sufficient to relax & eat. The waiters are well behaved too.

Conclusion : Dilkhusha is a value for money restaurant that not only a pleasure to your taste bugs, also as per the name it makes your Dil Khus really well.

Old world charm....my palate renders me to a constrained ordering of a set dinner...mutton breast cutlet followed by kasha mangsho and rotis... just because of the elderly bk da (waiter) i throng this place as he with his limited ways serves me well.. he ensures i get hot rotis when cold rotis are the nirm of this place and green chillies when in his absence if i asked was turned down politely... food ok in its own way... but you have to be very careful ordering as other items though may be a grandeur in sight but a big let down when it hits your palata

Studying at Presidency University, with college street being my second home. Dilkhusha Cabin remains a favourite haunt for me after learning of its legendary status from my grandfather. Have been here numerous times with my girlfriend, and be it the tasty food or the homely waiters Dilkhusha keeps making me go back again and again. 
My personal favourite is their kabiraji, though every single item is tasty and easy on the pocket. 
The best place to hangout and have your fill when at College Street.

It is losing it's glory day by day. Though kabiraji tastes still the same, fish fry became less fished and much spiced. Chinese cuisines were never their signature items, still mixed chowmin and egg fried rice became blunt in taste. paratha is very much oily and not crispy. Chicken items are so so, muttons are average.

Dilkhusha Cabin is one of the legendary eating places in College Street. I used to frequent it in my college days and it was bliss for a perpetually hungry and broke student. I had visited a while back and hope to visit again soon and was quite happy with my experience.¬†
If ambiance is why you visit places then I certainly don't suggest this one .... you have none so to speak but personally I feel like I have climbed into a time machine eveytime I visit as it feels like decades have passed and nothing has changed.
Coming to the food I would suggest Chicken Cutlet ,Prawn Kabiraj , Kosha Mangsho and Dimer Devil. The cutlet and kabiraj are both yum though not for the diet conscious , the kosha mangsho is the real thing and if you like eggs then the Dimer Devil is a must order.
I was also recommended the fried-rice by a friend but I have never eaten the Chinese there ..... well there is always the next time to loo forward to !

Its quite a yesteryear joint...personally i prefer it to coffee house...used to eat a lot here because of their amicable prices and food quality...but today when i walked in i was spellbound by how their prices have sky rocketed..it is just below par with the other famed eateries...really really disappointed...perspective mutton kabiraji used to cost 40 bucks...now its 65

But food here still tastes of north central kolkata and that is a great boon..u cant buy that kind of stuff with cash flow..

The place is on a easy location but it is a little hidden. Went some days back to grab a quick snacks.
Ambience- had that old Kolkata charm. The place looks a bit old, clean and had basic chair-table to sit.
Food- we took one chicken kabiraji and thought to order something later. But it was too big. It was heavy. After having half of it, i was too full. It was oily. Had crispy outer crust and full of chicken. Tasted good when eaten wid mustard sauce and salad.
Staff- very friendly and attentive.
Service- fast
Price- pocket friendly.
I will definitely visit the place again to try their other items.

This is a place I just love stepping into when I feel especially peckish after tiring walks buying books in College Street.
This has a typical old eatery feel...long tables,belgian mirrors,people giving heartfelt adda...
Their dimer devil is quite sumptuous. Another of my favourite is the chicken cutlet,and,of course, the mutton kasha. Beautifully cooked with a very tasty gravy...this is the mutton kasha i favour,much much over golbari.
Somehow never tried their Chinese offerings.
Its an adda den for your gang of friends.

This unique kabiraji specialist is located just opposite to adi mohini mohon. First time I felt its a bit difficult to find the entrance as it is covered by book stalls. But the sensational aroma guided me there. Fish,chicken and mutton kabiraji all three I have tasted and have not given my mind a second chance to declare it as the king of kabiraji in kolkata. Spend 100 bucks and ur stomach is full and tongue is satisfied. Katlet is also impressive.

Haunting for books in College Street? Take some time and hop in. And as the name says, it is sure to make your dil-khus! I went there after a long stressful college day. What I loved there most is the friendly behaviour of the waiters. For a moment I felt like in home savouring my dish. I was so pleased with their dedication of service. I tried out the Chicken Kabiraji, and trust me, the size of the Kabiraji was massive. I was wondering if I could eat it all by myself. You will really feel like they make justified use of money. Everytime I gave a bite, the crispy coating and the soft tendered chicken inside simply made me forget everything else.

To a North Calcuttan, Dilkhusha needs no introduction. To the rest though, it sadly does. Dilkhusha has been serving amazing fast food for decades now and it's part of the Holy Trinity of North Calcutta along with the Indian Coffee House and Paramount.¬†
Go for the kaviraji, that's what it's renowned for. Or the cutlet for that matter, both are equally good. Go for Chinese at your own risk, as you might just be making a stupid choice.¬†
Have no qualms about people smoking around you and you will fall in love with the place!

I was tired of eating at Indian Coffee House and I go to ICH every time I visited College Street. Take my word for it that I do visit College Street a lot. I love ICH but I need something new all the time. I was excited to try Dilkhusha Cabin. So today we had mutton cutlet and chicken cutlet. The same problem with it being too deep fried. I guess I can never love the idea of anything being overly fried. I liked the chicken cutlet more. Best was the chai. Aaaah Heavenly! Will go for chai again. :D

This place might be as old as College Street itself.I have heard stories about it from my uncles,ma and brothers.So when I started college,I made a mental note to check this place out.This place being quite famous for its Kobirajis,I'd rather you go for it even though they make noodles,fried rice etc these days.This restaurant is pretty much one of the heritages of Calcutta and is pretty easy to spot out.Besides being pocket friendly and the nostalgic atmosphere,you can also order your salad for free!

This hole-in-the-wall eatery has been there since time immemorial. They don't have fancy neon signs to beckon you because they know that people will drop in no matter what for the food. After walking down college street, on a busy sweaty Saturday afternoon with hunger in our stomachs we landed here. We ordered one of the things that they are known for: Chicken fried cutlet served with a side of kasundi and salad. Food was served fast and hot and it was quite tasty with the slather of kasundi and the standard cucumber-carrot salad. This wasn't a fancy dish and thank god for that. Even though the cutlet had a higher chicken to bread ratio in my opinion, it was still quite appealing and the chicken was fresh. 
Overall, walking down a heritage lane and eating at a nostalgic place is definitely a good package.

After a long long time I revisited ‚ÄòDilkhusa Cabin‚Äô, I used to love this place more than I thought possible. In my collage days whenever I visit collage street, this was a must visit place for me. We don‚Äôt have to wait for a table. Though the marble top tables were a bit oily and there was no A.C. in this restaurant.

Today we ordered ‚ÄòSpecial Egg Devil‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Fowl Cutlet‚Äô and ‚ÄòMutton Cutlet‚Äô. The taste of their Chicken Fowl Cutlet and Mutton Cutlet don‚Äôt have any other competitor. If you want to spent little much on evening snacks than the "chop/Tele bhaja", Chicken Fowl Cutlet is the best option. The food just simply amazed with its boldness of flavour and lip tingling peppers. I'm personally bowled over by the place and it was great how the staff responded to diners who were loving the food although they hear high praise all the time.

Many of you may felt it‚Äôs overpriced, even I thought the same. They almost doubled the price in last few years. Hope they think about the quantity also. If you are diehard fan of cutlet/ chop/Tele bhaja then worth a visit.

Two tired souls walking in College Street in a mad search for books in the sweltering May heat....there's where Dilkhusha stepped in and became our saviour. 
We'd originally wanted to go to Paramount, but my friend wanted to eat lunch, so we stepped in. Fairly clean inside, a Spartan decor almost, but well lit. And with a menu on the wall.
I chose the Fish Fry and my friend the Chicken Kobiraji. Because for us, crispy fried things can defeat anything else in the menu. A short wait later, which we spent staring at the orders of people around us, the grumpy waiter gave us our food. Crispy fried fish, with just a hint of kashundi, and his, chicken coated with a lacey, pretty eggy cover. I wasted no time and bit in. The fish was fresh, perfectly fried and generous, and in harmony with the brusque, sweet yet spicy mince. One swipe of kashundi and I was in a happy state of mind. 
My friend, however, was out of luck. He was sitting dismally and staring at my fry, which I ignored first, then ultimately gave the poor soul one bite of my heaven while I decided to taste his food. Alas. The chicken was sparse, and the mince was same like my fish fry, only that it wasn't fresh. The fry job was done well, and it was so disheartening to see a legend fall this short. I ultimately gave my fry to him to soothe his soul, while I asked for the bill. It was around 180/-. We paid and left, wondering how erratic legends could sometimes be when senile. 
Dilkhusha, you stopped short of pleasing our heart.

A heritage restaurant mixed with old Kolkata culture. Stepping in there you will go back to golden 50's-60' decades. And their stuffs behave with heartiness as own relative. All nostalgia of childhood family time comes back whenever I step in. But except that foods are pretty average. Kabiraji, cutlet , fry, chop etc are spicy and oily and Chinese are also oily and benglish but tasty ofcourse. So go for there if you are fond of Kolkata culture. Dont go for food.

This eatery has a cult following of devout foodies who swear by its kobiraji and cutlets. It is the perfect haunt for snacking in the evening if you are in the area. The place looks drab and is mostly crowded and stuffy but don't let that daunt you. 
       Try out the famous fish or the chicken kobiraji (Statutory warning : There is more oil in it than in Saudi Arabia; but it tastes heavenly). The cutlets are also pretty good and the noodles is street-food type but good. Top it all off with its famous coffee.

The place looks a little shabby but its guaranteed to leave your taste buds satisfied. Located behind the college street bus stand this place specializes in mouth watering cutlets and crispy kobirajis. It also offers other items like Chinese and Indian dishes like Mutton kosha. This place is mostly filled with college students and office goers. I am a frequent visitor and personally love the chicken kobiraji and Mutton Cutlet and don't forget the coffee after your oily brunch. A must visit if u want to taste yummy cutlets and experience an amazing adda session with your friends :)

I have studied in college street and i recently came to know of this heritage place from scoopwhoop.

First of all,it is difficult to locate,being hidden just behind a bus stand.

I ordered Chicken kabiraji.It was huge,delicious and filling.The chicken filling could have been thicker.(maybe i would rank mitra cafe's kabiraji a little higher on the scale on this front despite being a little small.

I took a chicken cutlet and a mutton cutlet home and they were huge as well and good.

There is not much of an ambience.There is a big mirror which i liked.
Quite affordable.

This is basically a student-centric joint and located exactly opposite to Adi Mohinimohan kanjilal at College street. A very old and not too very tidy, this place offers mainly snacks and some chinese (which are not too very chinese mind you) dishes. Fish kobiraji is a win-win here but very oily. This dish has made Dilkush what it is today. Except the kobiraji and cutlets, Dilkush could never make me fond of the rest of their dishes to be honest. Don't expect gourmet stuff here but well it can definitely satiate your hunger for a day. The amount they serve is moderate and the dishes are edible. It is a cheap eatery hence you don't need to worry about your pocket pinch much. Give this place a shot only if you're running out of your allowance else forget. ;)

One of the oldest and reputed joint of North kolkata. Only thrice I have been there. Short Disclaimer : Dont go by the looks of the joint...given a shabby one it might not attract the first timers. But the one who have been there knows its specility. The best part is Quality Vs Quantity. It scores on both. And if you want to knlw what is the pull factor of the place! It is the Kobiraaji, hands down the best one you would find in kolkata. So the next time you are nearby College Street, dont forget to drop in and have a bite. It is worth it.

Location- This is a small fast food restaurant at college street more.

Ambience- The ambience isn't good. But who cares? The food will surpass all cons.

Service- The restaurant always remains crowded. So, the waitor took approx 15mins to place my order.

Food- I had previously been suggested by my friend to try the kabirajis and cutlets here. So i ordered for a fish kabiraji and a chicken cutlet. Nd both were too yummy. One kabiraji is enough for to fill up the tummy of one person. I never had such huge and tasty kabiraji at such cheap prices. This place is highly recommended by me !!

A quick fill-and-move place to eat from my childhood times. Whenever I would visit this place I tend to undergo the nostalgic old time that it had associated with. But,  alas that old time never comes back.

The menu is limited with sorted less number of culinary delights. I always choose fish fry/cutlet. But sometimes now,  it has come to my notice that the quality has downgraded immensely. The fish was dry and tough and with no test.
The waiters are courteous but clumsy. A notable advice that nostalgia cannot handle business single-handedly, so try to upgrade.

Tucked away in a little corner.. bang at the College Street crossing, this place offers you the old world charm coupled with great food. The Fish Kaviraji was the best I've had in a long time. The Mixed Prawn noodle was also delightful, just a little heavy on the oil. Food quality is excellent in general and the price is really low. The ambience might put off people a bit, but then again, they more than make up for it with their food. Worth a visit.
P.S.-No menu card. You have to choose from a menu hanging from the front wall. And you have to share tables if it gets overcrowded.

The 5 rating is not for ambience, its not a fine dining one but its a part of our history, the chair i was seated might be the same one where netaji sat, or was it Satyajit Ray, who knows, who knows how their food tasted then, but the cutlets we ate today was out of heavens kitchen, :) i ordered 2 cos i was not used to the size and ended up testing the laws of diminishing marginal utility. Loved this place, will visit again whenever i am in college street.

One of the best places in to have an authentic Kolkata dish - Kobiraji! The fish, the chicken and mutton kobiraji are the specialities in this tiny corner hidden behind a myriad of stalls in the heart of College street in Kolkata. The place itself gives you a taste of what Bengalis call "sabek" or vintage. On a fine humid afternoon you may want to forget everything else that you are bothered about and munch for a while on a part of Kolkata that still remains deeply intact both in reality and also in the minds of countless number of people who have thrived in the region! It is indeed a treat.. Although prices have been rising steeply (back in 2009 a kobiraji cost only 35 rupees and now it costs 80), I would still consider this as a rather cheap outlet keeping in mind the costs you bear in any other metro in India!

College street itself gives me a feel of my childhood days and that of vintage kolkata. Just opposite Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal, Dilkusha Cabin has been standing tall for over 50 years.

The Fish Kabiraji as mentioned by Monalisa was well cooked and very tasty. But the fish fry was not far behind...Overall I had a very heavy and delicious evening snack.

But this is not the place for people who do not like oily food.

This has been a true weak point for me..a joint giving you the fflavour of old kolkata..a little hard to locate,just behind the college street bus stop..sort of a dingy entrance,but its a gem..the new renovation and a change of management has tripped the food quality down a bit but still its a lot more better than the others around..do have their fish kabiraji..its a lip smacking treat though it comes with a bit of excess oil..if you are not one of those anorexic health freaks,do try this place out..

The legendary 110 year-old cafe has in recent years done away with its partitioned cabins. Yet I was happy to see that their Edwardian-era dark wood furniture and marble-topped tables still graced the little restaurant. On my most recent visit to Calcutta, I dropped in and said hello to the bored-looking gentleman waiting the table. It was a pleasant February afternoon, and a freak shower had cleared the dust and grime in this crumbling precinct of the city, turning the asphalt of the street gleaming black. I ordered a mutton braised (spelled in these parts invariably as ‚Äúbreast‚Äù) cutlet, and thumbed through the book I purchased a while ago from College Street.

My visit was in part an homage to the old places that are dying a steady death in the city. Business was slow that afternoon, and my order arrived, sizzling at the edges in ten minutes flat. The white porcelain plate was reminiscent of 50‚Äôs-era cutlery that was standard in restaurants of repute, and my food came with a side of chopped onions and cucumbers and a thin spoonful of that potent mustard sauce known as kasundi. The cutlet had a delicate, crumb-fried exterior that revealed a stuffing of steaming hot onions and crumbled meat, and went well with the fiery kasundi. While I could taste an abundance of fillers that stretched the meat content, the taste was still, incredible.

Dilkhusha is nostalgia served on a plate, pure and simple. The ambiance is as old-school as it gets without being pretentious, and the cutlets delicious and filling. Places like this will likely not make it another decade, and needs all the love and support it can get. Visit this little slice of vintage time to soak in the flavour of 1960‚Äôs Calcutta. It‚Äôs an experience increasingly rare in this city that is learning the costs of progress. It‚Äôll be a shame if it shuts down, for Dilkhusha is a heritage treasure. A cultural artefact of a time long gone, and they make damn good cutlets.¬†

We loved: The great vintage ambiance, and the tasty cutlets.
We shrugged: The service is a little slow at times, which is expected

I went to this good old cabin just by chance with a friend of mine. After returning to my home town. I wanted to engulf myself with some nostalgia. So I decided to take a walk from Sealdah to College street and was looking for a cabin nearby. It's an old shabby cabin restaurant which is a story in itself. Typical old school chairs, tables and courteous staff.

I was curious enough whether they prepare chicken moghlai or not which they certainly not. So, we ordered fish kobiraji and chicken cutlet. Since it was Thursday mutton was not available.

Both of them won our heart. Kobiraji was surprisingly less on oil and taste was good. Chicken cutlet was good too, flavor of the chicken stuffing was excellent and the kasundi reminds me of one sentence "pagla khabi ki jhajei more jabi". We had a great time together.

Locating this cabin would be tough because there's a bus stand just in front of that which is a big let down for a charm of an era which is serving food for more than hundred years.

Went to Dilkhusa Cabin with my bestie and with great enthusiasm in hope that their heritage will be reflected upon the taste of the foods! We ordered Fish Kabiraji and Mutton cutlet. The cutlet did not even have a bit of mutton's reflection in it! It was sadly disappointing. The fish kabiraji was of overwhelmingly big size but the quantity of stuffed vetki fish was meager!
However the vetki was very fresh and it was in true sense "Bangalir Vetki Machh".
I want to try braised cutlet once I visit the next time.
Ambiance was good altogether!

So one fine book-bargaining-and-buying day I ended up here with my parents 2 years ago,without knowing that it is 'legendary'. We had chowmein and considering how hungry I was, I loved it! Little did I know why Dilkusha Cabin is famous! A year later I was there again, after reading reviews from zomato! The decor is nothing to talk about and it's a bit difficult to locate until you ask ppl. We had chicken kabiraji and tea. And I was overwhelmed by the hospitality of the waiter. He was so nice. The kabiraji was good too. We again went to this place after a tiring day at college street and it irritated us to learn that you cannot sit inside (there are basically two rooms, in the room outside you need to share the table) unless you order atleast 2 things. So we sat outside.But this time I fell ill after having their kabiraji. I don't know, whether it was the kabiraji or the hot sultry day that made me ill though :/

Food :
Chicken cutlet - just awesome ..crispy ,tasty mustard sauce as a dip...amazing 4.5/5
Fish Kabiraji - was a bit too oily , had to add salt which was lacking ...didn't like it ..2.5/5
Overall - Awesome cutlet ,but Kabiraji failed to impress.. 3.5/5 ..just for the cutlet else the Kabiraji would have pulled the score down badly

What to say about the good 'ol Dilkusha Cabin..
The old world charm is still intact in this century old eatery located in the heart of College Street.
The service is so darn awesome. The staff are very very polite and they serve the food in the least possible time.
Coming to the food.. The fish kabiraji is a must try although it'll surely clog your blood vessels with a generous dose of fat, as will the fish fry and the chicken cutlet .
The Chinese is more of a bonglicized Chinese, and we love that.
Also, the pricing is dirt cheap.

Very highly recommended, especially if you are a student in boi para on the lookout for a hearty evening adda.. :)

One of Kolkata's most heritage and famous fast food joint is the legendary Dilkusha cabin. Used to hear a lot about it from my mom and dad about this place and how delicious its kabiraji and cutlets were. When i visited this place when I was in 10th standard, with my friends, i was simply delighted with the food the was served after taking a bite of it. Honestly speaking no review of dilkusha should speak volumes about its ambiance, but when you taste their mutton kabiraji and cutlet you will surely be mesmerized by it. The service is very amiable, and a foodie like me can't resist the temptation to have another kabiraji or cutlet after finishing one of them. So if you haven't yet visited dilkusha, you must go there soon.

Dilkusha cabin is one of the timeless haunts of foodies in the college street area oozing that old world charm and nostalgia.
The fast food served here is still pretty good and ideal for that mid day hunger pangs!
Do try the fish fry here. The mutton kasha will leave you asking for more. The braised cutlets are aren't that good though. You can also have a go at the chowmein if you are fond of the street food type of chowmein.
The insides of the place has an old world charm with a huge mirror at one side and long tables.
Happy snacking.

The place sets the perfect mood for an adda with friends and also may serve as a quick bite option for people who come around to buy books in college street. Though people throng more at the coffee house doors this place has great surprises for one. I have been here many times and the food has never let me down. They serve good food with minimal pocket pinch. And trust me-their cutlets and kabirajis are surely one of the biggest you can find in Kolkata (correct me if I'm wrong)!!! The chow they serve is also good but the draw is surely the fries. I am sure no one would be disappointed after having them.The decor is nothing to be talked about much.
If you are there in the sitting area inside in a group of two at least,make sure you order 2 or more items coz they do not serve a single dish there!

This place located at college street junction is more than 100 years old now and is renowned for its fried items. With the renovation the place definitely has become a lot cleaner however it has done away with its cabins and somehow has lost the charm it previously had. The quality of food has degraded to some extent but is still very much palatable. The egg devil and chicken cutlet are still among the favourites and it draws quite a large crowd to its doorsteps. However with so many eateries popping up at every nook and cranny the once famous places like dilkusha are somewhere losing their ways despite their best efforts.

Revel in a bit of 70's in the twenty-first century with minimal pinch in your pockets..!!!
Taking delight in some Indian and Chinese cuisine at the heart of College Street, aside from Indian Coffee House, has never been so pocket-friendly. The cordiality of the staffs not only helps in winning your heart but also serves to giving your orders pretty easy. The menu is at their fingertips; one shall be enticed to try out all of them.
However, some of the delectable items that one shall never afford to miss out, from the not-so-huge pool of delicacies they offer, are: Chicken Fried Rice, Mutton Cutlet, Mutton Kabirazi, Chilly Chicken.
Their preparation of Chicken Fried Rice is a bit different from the other restaurants. It's more of a steamed chicken rice rather the rice actually fried. The strong aroma, that issues from the said dish, has got the potency to drive one to drool.
Mutton Cutlet and Mutton Kabirazi are favorites among those who sojourn the place for a short repast. These couple of items, along-with cups of coffee, have still remained as the most coveted items of all.

One of the oldest and legendary eateries in Kolkata, one can find references to it in popular literature as well. I was a regular for years there. I went back there after almost 2 years. The staff still recognized me. Service is prompt. The staff is very cordial. The food is cheap and very delicious. At that price, it is basically a steal. Don't forget to try the legendary Chicken Kabiraji.

We went there with great hopes but were quite disheartened . The place is shabby and the place looks so dirty.  We were a group of 4 and were starving to get some food . 

The service is fast, the waiters are quite fast. We were so hungry that we ordered fried rice and chili chicken . They were good in quantity , prices were very cheap but the quality is average. 

The chicken pieces were only bones and the rice was chewy. They felt like undercooked. We were quite disappointed and hope we will love their cutlets and kabiraji the next time we visit.

Went to College street for usual searching for some books....After a long quest of searching of books we friends were tired and hungry and low in money..... then one of my friend suggested this place..... We didnt think of anything else and headed straight towards adi mohini mohon kanjilal and entered Dilkusha Cabin....
The ambience is not so good but the look has maintained its 70's 80's genre... total bangaliana feeling... !!!! Same as Coffee House And Chowrongi Cabin in Esplanade...
Without wastimg any time We ordered Chicken Chowmin, and Veg Chowmin . the quantity was good and the food was tasty...But the Veg chowmin had got very little veg portion instead my friend found little portion of egg in veg chowmin...:P :P
Then we again ordered Mutton cutlet And Egg Devil..... The size of the egg devil Nd mutton cutlet bowled over me... And it was tasty and spicy much better than coffee house.... Dilkusha Cabin Dilkhush kar dia hum sab logo ko...:) :D And That too within our budget.... If in college street do visit this place and must order Egg Devil And kabiraji also for its huge and goood...;) ;)

Dilkhusha cabin and Coffe house are our favourite stops for food whenever we visit college street.
Some days back, we visit Dilkhusha again.
The ambience is not good but it is compensated by the food.
I always visit college street with my dad and brother and according to my father, Dilkhusha served more tastier dishes back when the owner was alive. Anyway. I cannot distinguish as I haven't tasted their food 20 years back.xD

Now coming to the food.
We ordered :-
1) Fish Kabiraji - Trust me. Its not just egg batter. It has a fat slice of amazing fish and its so filling and tasty(oily too.:P).

2) Dimer Devil : OMG. This was for my father but I had an equal share of it.xD
Egg covered with muttom keema, rolled in bread crumbs and deep fried. The first bite and I was like "lalalalalaaa laa laalaa".

3) Moghlai Porota : OILY. EGG. POROTA. Need I say more about how tasty it was?
[NOTE : The sixe is comparatively smaller to that which is served in the Indian Coffee House]

4) Chilli Chicken and Fried Rice : This was for my brother who always orders for Chinese cuisine irrespective of what place it is. -_-
Well it tasted nice but it was more of an Indianised version.

5) Chicken cutlet : Huge. Tasty.

6) Coffee : Good.

Service is fast.
Pocket pinch was around 450.
Nice.
Recommended if you visit College street.:)

Serving typical bengali snacks for over a 150 years... Dilkhusha Cabin is one of the pioneers of chop and kabiraji making eateries that still exists today...  every single item on their menu card is to die for.. though it remains a big surprise for me that why did they stop making the most popular vegetable cutlet...  I miss it very much...Overall Dilkhusha Cabin a true symbol of typical north calcuttan culture... proud of it

Having grown up with the stories of Dilkhusha cabin and its most famous Egg-devil and Kabiraji cutlet from my father's nostalgia drenched recollection of his college days, I wanted to tint my college days with Dilkhusha as well. I was, however, disappointed slightly with the food quality, perhaps prejudiced by irrational expectations. It is still very much worth trying out, as the place bears testimony to the golden days of Calcutta. Like my parents', it still remains a much coveted dating venue for budding couples of the city!

Visited the famous Dilkusha cabin today at College  Street. The place is just opposite to Mohini Mohon Kanjilal saree shop and difficult to locate due to the high shade of the bus stop. We went for Chicken Kabiraji, the most famous item there, the size was huge and it was simply awesome. The staffs were also very friendly, I will definitely come back for their "Kasha Mangso" !

I went to this place twice with my father while we had gone to College Street to buy books. I was too tired after buying books and wanted to satisfy my tummy and taste buds both. This place is not really a looker compared to our  modern food joints and is located in a narrow lane and there are several book stalls on the footpath beside this restaurant. We got some empty seats at the front section.  
Now coming the the food. We had roti, chilli chicken and cutlet. And yes , no matter how unassuming the place looks, the food they served was actually delightful. Taste of the food was really satisfying. Price was also pocket friendly.  Service was also quite decent. 
On the whole, I would definitely say that it was a good experience to visit this place and  indeed this is a place where you can get the charm of a traditional North Kolkata ambiance.

This place is a MUST when it comes to kabiraji. From the big size to the mouthwatering taste, this place is just perfect for you when you are running short of budget.. This was my second visit with a friend and I promise to go there everytime I go to college street for books... Even the service was really good.. A treat for all the kabiraji lovers!!

Four unhappy friends were smarting after a bad brush with coffee house, when the smartest woman in the group suggested a tryst with Dilkhusha Cabin. The rest were not sure, but they decided to go along as clearly she had a superior sense of direction and taste. 

They entered the cozy portal and spied a seat in the back, confronting an old mirror. They sat down, and the smiling waiter asked what they wanted. Two went for fish fry, one chose a chicken cutlet, and two "dimer devil" were called for. The food arrived within five minutes of order. The fish was fresh and moist, the chicken cutlet was spicy and glorious, and the devil was a huge, fat disc of egg and stuffing that made every one happy in the table after they took bites off it. 

Followed with the quintessential sweet but strong tea, it was a match made in heaven. And it made the day end in a beautiful way for them.

Dilkhusha is a part of my childhood and adulthood. It is for those who loved the idea of sitting at a place where Shibram Chattapadhyay and Saiyad Mujtaba Ali used to reminisce about their past. Personally speaking, I am a major fan of their chicken kabiraji and Kasha manghso, which is served with paper thin parathas here. 

The ambiance is very old world. There is a huge Belgian Glass mirror when you enter, and the entire place reeks of a bit of neglect, but can you not feel the romance of the place when you enter, sit, and eat a deadly combination of chicken and eggs, fried to a crisp and served with a bit of salad and mustard? The prices are, to be very honest, very very reasonable, and I personally feel that they can do better by revising them a bit and making the place air-conditioned, but that is just me. 

Dilkhusha is a good place to go to when you want good, bangali kosha manghso. I swear, you will not be disappointed.

Dilkusha Cabin holds a special place in my heart for couple of reasons. Firstly this joint was frequented by my grandfather  and he used to love his visits to this place when it was in its full glory.Secondly  a place like College Street is one of its kind in India and is special for any book lover.Now coming straight to the point  of food,as factors like ambiance, seating, decor are immaterial. On my recent visit on a weekday afternoon i had the chicken kabiraji cutlet.It was quite decent with a sizeable amount of meaty filling.The size of the cutlet was huge and  some people might find it tough to finish it unless one is really hungry.The chicken chow mien was also pretty well-made and the size of the helping was once again more than adequate for a single person.Items like the egg devil, chicken &mutton kabiraji, fish fry,cutlets are very popular and safe options to order. They do serve mutton & chicken curry with rotis but standards vary wildly and one may repent having these dishes on a bad day. Prices are pocket friendly keeping the academic fraternity in mind. Hygiene is an issue at times though i found the marble top tables and plates to be squeaky clean. Waiters were courteous and polite.Pleasant  surprise indeed!!! Must visit for people who are nostalgic about College Street.

Hustle Bustle, narrow alleys, overloaded book shops and swarm of college students raiding the streets. Yes u guessed it right, Its 'College Street'. Being the house of some of the best educational institutions of the city, it is blessed with the names like, Calcutta University, Presidency College, Sanskrit Collegiate, Medical College etc. But the tale is also not complete without some of the iconic joints of the place like Coffee House and Paramount shakes which provide a perfect hangout along with the traditional reckoning to the vicinity.

An important addition to this tradition is the Dilkusha Cabin. Traditional and Legendary, this place has been in existence forever. Right from the times of independence, this place has seen the evolution of the education diaspora of the city around itself. 

Location: This is located in the corner where the footpath of International Book Trust  meets MG Road, just opposite to Mohani Mohan Kanjilal shop. The entrance is very tricky. You may just walk past it and not realize. So make a good note of all doors around and for a cross check just ask the people around.

Ambiance and Decor: The restaurants is modeled in the old fashioned Kolkata style cabins which make most of the population of the restros in the northern part of the city. The decor is very simple. The front part of the restro houses some chairs and table in the open area and the cabins reside inside. The seating is modest but don't expect a fine dining restro feeling as it doesn't provides so. The building housing is old but the inside is pretty clean and every effort has been put to maintain it to the best.

Food: Well.. this had been here forever and quite so.. as the food they offer still beats a majority of the fine dining restros around the city. The best of the lot is definitely the Kabiraji and the Cutlet. People come off from far off places just to have the taste they cannot have anywhere else. U can see people discussing politics, hanging out and spending a private time all in one over the food they offer. It covers the interest of all generations and types of people as everybody just loves the offerings. My favorite in the main course had always been the fried rice and the chilli chicken. Though a bit hot on taste, this has left me amusing.. always. 

Service: Service is modest. Keeping in view of the total setup, the service just covers up bringing your order and bills :). Though as long as the food is good I really don't mind as this is a heritage restro and obviously old and less staff.

Ambiance= 3/5
Food = 4.5/5
Service = 3/5

Though I will give 4/5 overall to it as going here has always been a special treat to my memory. Its like taking a walk down the memory lane. Its like meeting an old friend. Emotional and mesmerizing. Every inch of it speaks the heritage it holds and the years of service it has been to the people around. A place must visit whenever u want to have a grip on the roots of our history. Happy Eating!!!

This place has a lot of history behind it, but like so many other North Kolkata restaurants, it has left its glory days long behind. The world has moved on but it hasn't. So nowadays it is just a cheap food joint serving some low quality food.

This place epitomizes the phrase 'sasta aur tikau'.... The food here is easy on pocket and yummy on the palate. Chicken and Mutton Kabiraji / Cutlets are a huge draw. You may also choose to have Mutton Kasa and Roti, it is my personal favourite. Bong style Chili Chicken and Roti from this place too is a huge hit. You will really have to struggle and eat a lot to make your bill cross Rs. 200/-. But the biggest challenge is to find this place. It is right on College Street crossing but you may pass by this place several times without even noticing its existence. The seating arrangement here is like that of any other old restaurants in north Calcutta and does not even have AC. No doubt food is the only comfort factor here‚Ä¶. if you manage to find this place I am sure you will agree with me.

This is the place I have been hearing heaps about since I was a kid.. And finally there I was, last Wednesday, my taste buds excited as anything! And guess what, within a week, I was back there twice.. That's how much I liked it!

Like every other heritage eateries, this too is blink-and-you-miss.. Situated on the College Street crossing among the crowd of card shops, this place is exactly what you call a good-ol' 'cabin'! It's hardly fancy or good looking or has spacious tables, but before you panic, you should know that I found it okayish clean and hygienic. There are two sections, the one with large tables, preferably for families, and another with a few tables-for-four. There's a huge Belgian glass mirror, which begs some cleaning by the way, hanging on the wall and on the wall next to it, the rate chart. Remember it, as that's the only visible rate chart in the whole cabin. Take your seat, and waiters are quick to attend you. They're very very well behaved. I mean, they smile so much that your head automatically registers him to be given a nice tip. :D

On our first visit, we went for the classic, Mutton Kosha, Roti and Chicken Kobiraji. I'd heard so much about these dishes, and how they even beat Golbari's, I had huge expectations. I was disappointed. The mutton was awfully hard and rubbery, so much that we couldn't do anything but put the pieces in our mouth and hope teeth does the rest! They do beat Golbari, but only on their days, as I realised on my second visit there. 
The kobiraji was good. But even as we asked the waiter for an extra plate, he said they cannot provide that! It was funny, and a bit annoying. But you don't mind too much realising where you are, and the fact that they are feeding you at the cheapest!

Visit two, we decided to go for Mutton Kosha again, as the waiter said the pieces would be soft that day. And boy, was it great! The pieces were tender, the gravy spiced to perfection, it was simply delicious. Golbari who?

The mutton breast cutlet is good too.. And the quantity! The sheer size of the cutlet was filling by itself! 50 bucks for that is a bargain!

Great, great place. No matter if you're a Bengali or not, no matter if you like 'Bangali Kosha-mangsho-die-ruti' or not, you give a damn about heritage eateries or not, you gotta visit this cabin. Dil Khush toh zaroor ho jayega! :)

I keep harping about kolkata gastronomy and dilkhusha is an important part of it .... Ok, it is not a restaurant, or  very clean either but for people like us, where food is pretty much a  religion ( believe me, i am very religious ). One might just miss the location... its  small dingy door and barely any  sign board, and not at all fancy, bigger than Golbari though. One might even get perturbed by the really old feel to the place. What i like is the huge mirror at the far end of the place. 

Once very famous for its Kobiraji cutlet ( a delicacy i cannot stand ) which is a cutlet fried in an eggy batter to make a crunchy egg mesh. It is very oily but i know many people who swear by it ... 

coming to what i like ... simply adore the kosha mangsho and roti ..... meat is chunky but super delicious ... and the rotis are light and soft... even the mutton breast cutlet and and prawn cutlet are very nice... many a diet have been sabotaged by this eatery... paired with thumbs up the breast cutlet can be quite an addiction. The Kosha is way better than the much harped about GOLBARI 

have been to this place over 20 times and it has always tasted the same ... 1 up for that ... the people working there don't talk much but are sweet and well behaved... 

Need to go again soon... the place is addictive

You can miss this place if you dont know where it actually is. Located on College Street, but hidden almost completely by the billboards of the bus stand, Dilkusha has now probably lost much of its older charm. Nonetheless, it still continues to be pretty decent. The Deviled Eggs are synonymous with Dilkhusha and they're worth a try, any day. Prices are cheap too. A 3 on 5.

This is one of the best places in College Street to fill up your hungry stomach at a low cost. Dilkusha cabin belongs to the group of old Calcutta eateries whose name would make any 
senior foodie think about Kabiraji Cutlets and Kosha Mangsho. It can be easily located at 
the College Street- Harrison Road crossing, diagonally opposite to the centennial College 
Street Market. Being at the hub of colleges, book shops and shops for wedding invitation 
cards, the place never stays too empty at any time of the day. 
 When you enter, you get the ancient feel of the place, sadly, in the form of drabness and 
poor maintenance. Other than that, you'll be greeted by more or less friendly and prompt 
servers and a quick service. One can choose from the two sections (outer one and a bit 
private one) to be seated. Keep in mind to check out the menu board before you enter the 
corner room as they don't provide single menu charts to the customers. Also, make sure that the items you want to order are available, as most of the items are usually not.
 According to me, the best thing in the menu is the Chicken Kabiraji (chicken cutlet in a lacy, brittle egg net). The size is huge with a considerable amount of meat along with the crispy envelope. Even though mustard sauce is the perfect complement for the cutlet, they should still keep a bottle of tomato ketchup handy. It is best however to avoid ordering chowmein over here.
It earns a 3.5, all for the Chicken Kabiraji!

PRESENT:quantity remails same..thats the good part..but the quality has degraded like anything..the kabiraji's size was very big bt d oil it was fried in was of very bad quality..it smelled very bad..the chicken inside it also smelled..i could have more than 4 bites it tasted so bad.the egg noodles had egg shells in them.it couls easily cause food poisoning..
for the people wanting to visit this place i would recommend dat save urselves from d pain of having very bad food here and visit somewhere else.please..

Quite a nostalgic place. Try for the mutton kabiraji and cutlets. Awesome.....A bit of dark and an old place but a great place for students and any shopper in college street area. Very reasonable and very hearty place to have food. Don't except gourmet cuisine but an old place to have a really god food.

Overall out of 5 : 

Quality : 4.5
Quantity : 4.0

Heritage institutions are what gives a city its characteristics. Dilkusha Cabin is one such eatery which stands proudly at a corner of M.G. Road near the College Street crossing on the opposite footpath of the saree shop, 'Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal'. The swinging half wooden doors fascinated me right from the beginning. The marble tables were reminiscence of an era gone by, but what is the icing of this place is a huge Belgian glass with dark wooden frame, which has been maintained properly. The servers usually greet you with a smile. It is quintessentially a place for Bengali Babu's and the menu is only written in Bengali and so I would suggest that people try their 'Kabirajis' whether fish kabiraji, chicken kabiraji or prawn kabiraji. Kabiraji is a batter made with egg whites which gives an ultra crispy and light coating to a slab of well beaten chicken. What I love about these heritage institutions is the unique taste and flavour they offer. No other modern institution  can replicate the blend of spices which gives this snacking item its unique taste. The size was gigantic and both my friend and I requested them to pack half of our Kabirajis to which they obliged and to our pleasant surprise gave it in the age old newspaper bags which is environment friendly but then again the newsprint is not good for the health when it comes in contact with the food and a 'saal' leaf wrap would have been more comforting. When it comes to these cutlets one has to have them piping hot else it loses its taste and charm and you must also remember to use 'Kasundi' (Bengali style mustard sauce) as the perfect condiment along with julienne carrots, onions and cucumbers.  I love immersing myself into these historical eateries. All said and done these deep fried food items are best enjoyed during the monsoons or chilly winters. Due to the deep fried element the item is extremely heavy and tends to make you feel very full and you should never have water with the deep fried kabiraji. May Calcutta's heritage eateries live long and prosper. P.S. They do use dalda which is evident when you take a bite into the item gone cold but then again you should always have it piping hot to enjoy its taste. It is alright to indulge in unhealthy but delicious cuisines on a few occasions.

Dilkhusha Cabin serves what are possibly the finest kabiraji cutlets and egg devils in the city. It is an old-fashioned unpretentious eatery. The staff are helpful and service is quick. The prices are very reasonable, and one only hopes that they are breaking even on them. One wishes, though, that they pay some attention to the quality of the water they serve, and also make the place look a little less dingy. Polishing the old Belgian-glass mirror (which gives the restaurant its spacious feel) should be one of the first things done.

I would recommend the Chicken Kabiraji and the Egg Devil. Items like chow mein, which have been put on the menu to entice barbarians, should be avoided at all costs.

traditional. another proof that old is gold. located just at the MG Road-College street crossing, this place opens not before 2p.m. but in the evening it's a favourite place of the young as well as the older generation who visit the places in the vicinity. the famous fish kabiraji is way cheaper and better than the one served in coffee house which is just a two minutes walk from Dilkhusha. the service is prompt. the food is wholesome. you can also try the chicken cutlet.

Must Have : Cutlet , Kabiraji

Though the marbel top tables are a bit oily and the canteen is non having a A.C but a restaurant established at least 50 years back still have the touch of that old Calcutta. the taste of their kabiraji and cutlet don't have any other competitor. And the old waiter of dilkhusha with a smile is more touchy than a professional educated suited waiters of any other A.C restaurants.
