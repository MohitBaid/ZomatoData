The worst service ever. The waiters are unprofessional and arrogant enough to misbehave when you ask them to take the orders. Recommendations are zero for this place.

Went to this place during the Pujas. The ambience is too good...it's very good! We ordered for chilli fish, chilli chicken, mixed fried rice, chicken manchurian and fish manchurian. All the dishes were very good. And the best thing I found about this place is that they serve fresh food. The fish preparations were fresh and succulent. But they need to work on their furniture and washroom.

Very cheap liquor price compared to others in Sector V...but ambience is horrible...still who cares for the ambience when it comes to money! A great place for daily drinkers :P
Food is moderate...they have no place for large groups...only 2/4 seater tables are there...no adjustments allowed...dont expect a seat on friday after 7...its full on fridays!

Duck masala wasn't up to the mark but chicken tikka was awesome... Nice ambience beside the salt lake of course... Needs to be more professional regarding delivery time

Liquor are cheap, food are budget friendly and good. But ambience is not so good. Very noisy area at peak hours and not so clean. All beer and liquior brand not available all time as per menu. Required too much waiting at weekend and peak hours.

The lake side view is the USP of this place. The food is okay.... especially the finger food. Do not have high expectations regarding the service....at the end it is neither too good nor too bad. Ideal for a group of friends to spend some time... the food is reasonably priced while the ambience is what sets this place apart. There aren't many places in Kolkata where you will be able to enjoy the lake side view as much as here.

The staff is friendly..not the food...though in some pieces lies the scenic beauty..a feast here is not so desirable for me.quality never seems to improve to match the beautiful breeze passing by.

Don't even think about going to this place. Even though it has a great view, if you eat anything from here, you are bound to suffer from food poisoning. I have been suffering for 3 weeks now having eaten here and it is anything but exaggeration. Do stay away for your own sake

Well a pretty comfortable place to grab a beer. Food quality is poor and not priced accordingly otherwise beers are properly priced and you won't regret going there with a beautiful view upfront.

This bar is undertaken by Govt. of WB, mainly known for liquor at cheap rate. Don't expect proper ambience or decent crowd. Waiters are not up to the mark as well. Taste of food is below average.

Out of all bars and restaurants in Kolkata, this place holds a special corner in my heart. Finally after lot of request to the zomato, they have put up the listing. Cheap liquor and average priced food. I would highly recommend their garlic chicken. Its the best! Also the foods are delicious with good quantity. Though tatse of their food  servings are not that awesome but are good and very fresh since they have farms vicinity to their establishment. Service is good. Nice smoking area with all the lawns are greenery. If you want to enjoy with your friends, this is a nice place but if you are looking for ambience then MEH!

well it got some dress codes.. shorts/2-3 quarters/vests are not allowed.. parking will cost you 40 bucks till you are in the bar.. 
The cooling is nice.. ordinary decor.. weekends are rush due to its vicinity to tech parks.. 
Try out their chilly chicken and fish fry.. not so expensive.. be patient with the food service.. booze is bang on.. last order at 10:30 pm..

Food is ok ok type. 
Boating is fine. 
Don't go for food. 
It's for boating and food side by. 
That's it. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

The amazing set up of this restaurant attracts you to this place! They serve liquor and food. In food, their finger food is the fastest flowing items in addition to their Chinese dinner options.
The prices are reasonable but the crowd might be a problem since there is no restriction.

I had been to this restaurant once long ago, with a few colleagues. 

#Location: Nalban(sector 5), opposite Cognizant/Asram bus stand

#Ambiance: Nalban has an amazing ambiance - a tranquil lake, sikaras, birds chirping afar. Everything is peaceful and serene. This restaurant is a part of the Nalban experience.

#Food: They serve a wide variety - fast food , chinese, mughlai. I had tried a few of their Chinese options - some noodles & chili chicken. Food was okish.

Visited so many times with friends.
Just opposite of cognizant.
Reasonable drinks reasonable food.
It's mainly occupied by office people.
They relaxed there after duty hours.
Overall ok.
Very casual.
Few seats.
