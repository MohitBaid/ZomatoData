Sona restaurant is an old staple of Barrackpore, but now it has lost its standards. i went there for dinner a few days ago, but was not satisfied with the food at all.¬†
*First of all, the menu is very large, considering it is such a small restaurant.
*the service was below average
*even the glass they served us water wasn't even clean, we had to drink water from the jug.
*and it takes a long time for the food to reach the table.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† As far as the food goes.. we ordered chicken noodles with gravy, the chicken and noodles were overcooked and was just plain mush. it was dull and bad, after trying that we didn't order anything, considering the standards of the food. you can get better food in a takeout shop.

Had butter nan,double egg tarka and chicken tikka. Butter nan was soft and good to have it tarka. Tarka was also good with egg in it. Chicken tikka was tender and fresh. Ambience of the non ac section is not that great. Overall a good experience and a value for money.

This is the one of the best restaurants to serve biriyani. Their biriyani is far much better than Dada Boudir biriyani. Quality of the mutton used is also good. Go here for both quality and quantity.

Old place..brings back memories..very nice place...the air-conditioned room  is good, dim lighted, faint music running on the background, the ambiance is good, nice seating and the dishes are good, great management. Only one thing to avoid is the biriyani during puja days....its not at all upto the mark, apart from that the place has good standards and the people are nice ...must visit :)

Location- Near Barrackpore Station. 
Food- As a Biriani lover whenever I visit any restaurant I try to taste it's Biriani. Sona Resuturant is also not an exception. Food is ok ok type. Not so good but not so bad also. 
Ambiance- The Restaurant is devided into AC and Non AC part. Both are ok type. For AC they will charge you some extra money.
In short you can leave a visit to this resuturant one time but there re more better Restaurants nearby.

The biryani they serve is a bit better ,but then every day is not the same. To conclude,there are better restaurants with better food and ambiance‚Äã nearby. The choice is yours.

This is an average place to visit, and is easy on pocket. I have gone a number of times to the place and every time the taste remains almost the same. Biriyani wether chicken or mutton is OK OK type, we always order for chicken varta which is gud to taste. Don't have much of a choice in terms of food. The only gud thing over here is chicken tandoor. Hope they work on food and use fresh vegetables and spices because at times it feels like vegetables used are not fresh and are stale.

For me this is probably the worst place to pick when in barrackpore, i have been there just once and m not interested to have another visit.
I had ordered mutton biryani, mixed fried rice and chicken machurian.
The biryani was mediocre and the manchurian was over cooked which made it too fibrous and the worst part was the mixed fried rice coz the shrimps were stale n rotten and the chicken was smelly. Overall it was an awful experince.

If you are taking away your food, it is the best place in Barrackpore. The Biriyani I believe us the best in Kolkata- but for those like me who love spicy food. The quantity is huge, and the size of the meat piece is best comparing to even Arsalan or Aminia. The best two dishes are Biriyani and Chichen Bharta.

Barrackpore has always been a part of my life. I live in Bhatpara. If anyone from there want to plan to dine in a good restaurant, Barrackpore is the nearest location. On my childhood days, there were two Biryani destinations which was pocket-friendly, Dada-Boudi and Sona. The first time I tasted Biryani, it was of 45/-. Now it is 130/- (at least it was when I went there last time). As at Sona I met my love of life (Biryani) first, so this review will be on this place. 
Firstly, the place. If now I compare the restaurant with what I saw it long ago, it has improved a lot. At least people now can move freely over there. But it's not like hugely decorated or something. It has got a AC section with comforting sofas and a bit of decorations. Now, the food. The Biryani is the key item of that restaurant. Talking about Biryani, it's not that bad as few made some reviews. I kinda like it. The piece of meat they give is good enough, and a piece of potato, signature of Bengal Biryani. The quantity is enough to fill the tummy, at least mine. I have tasted other dishes too like fried rice, chowmein, chilli chicken, etc. Those were simple, eatable. THAT'S ALL.

This is not somewhere you come to date. cheap ambience and small place.

Comming here since college. Usually had mutton rezala with jeera rice but mostly had biriani.

My favourite biriani place. If you remove brand name, it is comparable to arsalan. Huge quantity rice with approx 200gm mutton and a soft-crunchy aaloo makes it nearly perfect. 

Come here to have it if you ever come to barrackpore.

Speaking about this place is a must ‚úåüèªÔ∏è visited this restaurant a few days back, inspite of havng "Dada Boudi" in the same locality, this place didn't disappoint me at all. The Biriyani was indeed quite awesome comparing the quantity and the quality tht "Dada Boudi" serves this restaurant clearly beats the mark! Truely a amazing place to visit ‚úåüèªÔ∏è and its pocket friendly tooüòã

Visited this place with a hungry hungry belly and spared no time in ordering a Tandoori Chicken,  Bhuna keema curry and tandoori roti. The tandoori was cooked perfectly and was juicy and smoky. The Bhuna Keema curry, which is listed as their speciality, was greasy and too hot. It was okay with the tandoori roti but was overall very disappointing.

The ambience and decor was below par but the service was excellent, the waiters were helpful and friendly. I'd say this is a one time visit place.

It's a mediocre eating house. Except the biriyani others are better to be avoided. AC section costs more, non AC is good for having biriyani and go out. You may like to spend time with your girl/man as there is no rush here.

First of all of you want to spent time with some one & not care about food quality this place could be OK but if you want to have tasty food this place is not for you at all because the food they serve here are awful in taste they don't know the difference of Hong-Kong rice & Fried Rice. Don't know from where they bring their food because it's not fresh. So don't waste your money in this restaurant.

Sona Restaurant was opened near Barrackpore Railway Station, when there was not much food joints available.

We were among the initial customers, in our college days. In those days quantity was preferred over quality and Sona had been quite satisfying in this regard. We used to have this strange craving for Biriyani those days ( I still have the same craving üòã) and the second best option for Biriyani after the famous Dada-Boudi Biriyani, was the Sona Restaurant...

I have tried garlic chicken, fried rice, butter naan, chicken butter masala from here and everytime i got disappointed with the quality of food they had served.. The only positive side of this restaurant is the price which is very pocket friendly.. But if you are craving for the quality then I would suggest everyone to avoid the place sincerely..
P.S. - (I haven't tried its biriyani till date which is known to be famous in barrackpore after DADA BOUDIR BIRIYANI, so you can give it a try)..

Located on the stretch of road, just beside Barrackpore railway station, which has countless eateries, Sona restaurant manages to forge its own identity. The place has gone through a renovation and now is divided into two sectors(AC and Non-AC). 

They are more famous for their Mughlai and Chinese cuisines, so one can tryout their signature Biriyani or their special Schezwan Fried Rice. The service is decent and the space, although a bit congested, is kind of okay,being in the budget.Worth a shot for their Biryani.

So definitely not a good hotel for take off. Surely a poor supervising! Must check every order before it gets delivered.

serves food in good quality good quantity and a very pocket friendly pricing...two separate section a.c and non a.c....my preference non a.c....a.c also good...foods which are good are.....fried rice ,chilli chicken,chicken pakora,lolypop,crispy chicken,fish finger,motton biriyani.....no vat for both sections....new decor added in the non ac section.. Price hiked but it's OK...as the quality is increased.. Tandoor items ar available from evening ...tasted chicken tandoor here for first time...service was prompt.. Tastes avg ...
But at present it is the worst place to dine in ..... In non ac section they do not properly clean the table clothes and it remains dirty which is very much annoying. ...and surely no one will like to seat their.... Just avoid their non ac section .... In ac section they charge a higher price just for the cool environment and the food quality is as poor as the non ac section. They vl serve u a huge menu card but only a very few of them u vl ever get. Others are always unavailable. Even the taste of the food varies time to time. Waiters are also kind of arrogant. Overall ambiance is not at all good.

Pocket friendly. The portion they serve in a single unit can feed two. 

I was here with one of my friends and not being aware of the huge quantity they serve, we ordered one Chicken Biriyani and one Mixed Chow. The taste of the Biriyani was nice, though I do have a complain about the prawns served in the noodles. We wanted to go for the Tandoori too but it was not available at that time.

I used to take away my food from this restaurant as this was quiet cheap. The service is terrible and the food is equally bad. On My last visit had ordered Egg Fried Rice & Paneer Butter Masala and requested them to put less/no carrot in the Fried Rice. As the Fried Rice out here is more like Carrot Rice. But when I was eating found out the instead of reducing the quantity of carrots in they have put more. This was the 3rd time in a row that they did this to Me.

Frankly this is my Last visit...

Location - Near to Barrackpore station adjacent to Khosla electronics.

Recommendation - Biryani, Chicken Do piyaza,Mixed Fried rice, Chicken tikka masala.

Service - The waiters are very rude and unprofessional..even the service is very slow specially if you order biryani.

Price - The place is reasonable.
The restaurant have two section.One is the AC section where the price is bit high and on the other side the Non AC section charges less.

Ambience and decor - The place is average.. There's no such decor to brag about.. I personally prefer to take away the food as i stay at Barrackpore.

Brief -
The biryani is dry and very spicy.. Perhaps the chef doesn't know how much rosewater should be given to a biryani.. DISSOPOINTING
 
The Chicken Do piyaza is average but the pieces could be better.. If they try to improve.

Fried rice is good in taste but the quality of rice sometimes fluctuate.. Though its the only dish i prefer to have.. And even chicken tikka masala is good.

Pros- cheap rates of food
Quantity is good ( one plate of biryani is enough for two people )

Cons- Rude staff
slow service
Poor quality of food

Overall I'm not at all fond of this place but for some its a place for cheap treats to friends.
There's better place in Barrackpore for meals and dinner rather than Sona restaurant.

Love the chicken biriyani of this place. Its smell can easily distract you while you walk down the station road! A great place for all biriyani lovers! 
However Mutton Rezala (150 for 4 pieces) was not quite good. The gravy was a bit sweet. Not worth it. I had to wait for like 30 minutes for the order. I was observing  the other customers. They were dissatisfied with the poor service. 
I'd go for biriyani only. Any other dish is a no no.

PROS: Quantity
CONS: Service

DISCLAIMER: The below review is based on my visit back on early 2011 and may not match their current status.

Barrackpore + Biryani was always = Dada Boudi for me and I heard nothing, saw nothing and spoke nothing except Dada Boudi. It is then when a friend of mine who stayed at Barrackpore suggested me to visit Sona Restaurant and I was really curious to know what they had to offer to beat the likes of Dada Boudi and others.

This place is close to Barrackpore Railway Station and is adjacent to Dhaka Biriyani House. The ambiance is average with A/C and Non A/C options. The A/C section is so dimly lighted that u'll go colour blind as soon as u enter. The Non A/C section is no fun either.

I went there with my room-mate and we ended up deciding to have a side dish along with Biryani and we were so wrong. Herez why:

1. Mutton Biryani: When the waiter served me the plate I was like "Are you sure this is a single plate biryani?". The serving was enough for two. I was spell bound to see the quantity they served. The mutton piece was the largest piece I ever had on a plate and the potato seemed like an asteroid to me. Jokes apart, the biryani was nice, good enough on taste. The mutton piece was also good enough and I liked it. The potato was a disaster, wasn't cooked properly and was hard. Finishing this plate of biryani was like winning a war.

2. Chicken Do-Pyaza (the SIDE dish): This dish remained in the side forever bcoz of the gigantic serving of the biryani. The taste was average and the chicken pieces were good on size but too much bones. The gravy was OK and more than enough for two.

Service is slow even if u order biryani. Pricing is decent and worth what they offer.

Before recommending it to everyone I would like to visit this place again to find out their current status till then DADA BOUDI still rules the heart.

Sona restaurant was once named as sona hotel and it was just a mere normal hotel for food with no ambience or anything... but presently they renovated and changed the ambience completely....this place is an emergency eatery as whenever we have to order some food we come here. i have had a lot different variety of dishes here. they serve good food and the price is very much pocket friendly...i personally don't like the biriyani they serve i just had it once n didnot like it atalll... but their chinese and tandoori are good and can satisfy your appetite and taste too.... :)

Dr. Ghosh, well i took your advice and purchased a plate of Biryani today from Sona, actually they biryani is made elswhere and it is served from a dachki into boxes for take aways to be precise. i am sending you my feedback on the same, firstly the chef who is cooking biryani is not tasting the biryani what he is cooking, the biryani which i took as parcel definitely the quantity was good in terms of rice and chicken pieces size and potato, but the taste was something which was not to my liking, in my opnion there was too much of the gulab ka pani ( rosewater) that was used and after i had consumed the biryani i kept on repeating the biryani for a long time and i had to take a digene in order to ease the repetation. Please i am not wanting to complain but i am just want to inform the management as to what was wrong in the production of the biryani so that quick improvement can take place and people of barrackpore can get to taste some good food. 

 As such when it comes to Biryani i have grown up in area in kolkata where i am surrounded with some of the best biryani restaurants such as Arsalan, Shiraz, Rahmania, Mezbaan, Golden Spoon, krazy Kebabs, Delhi Darbar and all these restaurants are just far far superior as far as quality is concern for Biryani, however the quantity in kolkata Biryani may be lesser in some of these restaurants that i have mentioned. More so the Biryani in Sona is very dry, it should have be a bit oily, seems that the dalda being used in Biryani is less. But yes the biryani was better than the chinese that i had the first time. But the standard needs to improve of the Biryani.



----- 11 Jun, 2013 -----

terrible food. Me and my cousin visited the restaurant a few days back. First of all the place is dimly lit as if it is a cinema hall, you cannot see the person sitting next to you on the table also. The wait time for the food is too long, in the sense that we ordered for chowmein which on an average should take not more than 15 to 20 mins to prepare but the cook took 45 minutes and i was really becoming impatient. The found was really lousy the chillie chicken was like rubber, not enough capsicum was put in the chillie chicken. The chicken chowmein that i had ordered was as if the chicken was thrown from heaven ( the quantity of chicken was very poor in the chowmein.
