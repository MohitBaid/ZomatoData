Chinese food is my favorite and I always make sure to try new places.
The service was decent.  The hakka noodles and hot garlic chicken was good.
This place deserves a try.

Red bellpeppers used to have their outlets at baghajatin & patuli previously but they closed down & came back with a new outlet at garia near kanungo park. Personally i have not visited the place but so far availed the services of swiggy.

So far i have had the following:-

1. Tom yum soup - Thai soup of with tomato base. The soup was mildly spicy with generous amounts of vegetables,mushrooms & chicken. The taste was on the good side but tom yum soup is generally a bit thick than what i experienced as the soup was runny.

2. Fish fry - The dish had 2 medium sized fries. They use basa fillet. The outer crust was perfect. However the fries were not tasty at all due to lack of seasoning. So a huge disappointment.

3. American corn pepper salt - Lovely starter if you are looking amongst the veg versions apart from babycorn. The quantity was on the higher side. The corns were crunchy & also consisted of chopped onions,belle peppers,garlic & black pepper bits. Lovely flavours which i enjoyed to the fullest.

4. Chicken singapore noodles - Lovely thin noodles prepared in singaporean style with full of flavours & being on the non-spicier side. The dish had generous amount of vegetables & chicken. Just too good in terms of taste as well. The quantity was also huge.

5. Chicken in chilli wine sauce - 8pcs of chicken covered in flour coat prepared in chilli wine sauce with onion & bell peppers. The dish didn't impress to be honest. The taste & mingling of flavours just didn't work together. The chicken most had odd flour coating which wasn't cooked that well.

The pocket pinch is on the lower side but the quality of item varies which might make or destroy your meal experience.

P.s. Some pics have been posted separately.

Super food ... awesome taste and quantity is also good. Be it Mongolian fried rice or Singapore fried rice, each dish stands apart distinctly.

I have ordered food through swiggy. The egg chicken Hakka noodles is totally good to taste and quantity is also quite large. The chilli chicken is also good to taste.

Very near to the Kanungo Park, Garia. This place caters to a wide variety of Chinese and Indian cuisines.
This place offers food at a very pocket friendly price. However, the chowmein at times tastes too bland. I dunno about the Indian cuisines. The quantity they provide is too much for one hungry tummy. :D
The staffs are not well versed with the menu which often leads to miscommunication. But, are very courteous.
Overall a nice place to go for a casual lunch or dinner.

We had an egg chicken hakka noodles on a Saturday afternoon! Quantity wise 1plate was more than enough for two of us. We couldn't able to finish it. Taste was good. There was lots and lots of chicken pieces in the noodles.
Service was prompt.

Location- take the lane that leads to Andrews college play ground! It's on your left if your are coming from garia more.
Just opposite to fashion world garment centre!
