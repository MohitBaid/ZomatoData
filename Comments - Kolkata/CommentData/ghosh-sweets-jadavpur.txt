Oh well, the sweets are better than what I expected. I love sweets, and the slightest of faults ruins the taste for me. But I didn't find anything to complain about. The wide variety of sandesh are very good. The rates are also low, keep up the good work.

Laddu was good .. If you asked them to give two best sweet.. they would probably give you two or three sweet.which are really tasty.. otherwise all are more or less ok ..it's just near Pollisree more..in this area I think it's best one. Otherwise you have to go Ranikuthi then

Located at Bijoygarh Pallysree area this sweet shop offers Bengali sweets as a part of their offerings. A friend of mine got two variety of sweets in office and I tried both them. Though they were extremely sweet but the quality given and the items used are fresh. Decently tasted sweets were good as an option for a post lunch desserts :)

How I love the gorom gorom roshogolla's they make! Tender and it just melts in your mouth. Situated at Pallysree. Quite an old shop and looks better after the renovation. 
A very pocket friendly place to satisfy your tongues with their sweets!

This one's located very close to my place. I am not a big fan of sweets in general. But I really like the rasugulla here. The malpua and other snacks are nice too. Prices are reasonable.

Famous for its rosogolla and jalebi. Its kinda traditional shop for sweets. After all sweets and bengalis go hand in hand. Misti dois are superb in tastes. They also have samosas in the evening time.
