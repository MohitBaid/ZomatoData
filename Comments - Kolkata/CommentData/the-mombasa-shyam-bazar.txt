We have been there for quite a few times now. What I like about this joint is that the quantity of the foods. Also the foods are good. This is a small place with 5-6 tables. The ambience needs to be modified. Cheap place recommended for your end of the month pocket pinch.

I am disappointed. Like. And sad. Used to serve great chinese. Had their special gravy noodles. Now well nothing. You can't really find chicken in their mixed rice /noodles. And don't even ask me the time they take to prepare the order. Not at all a happy experience.

A very small and cozy restaurant in Hati bagan near Shyambazar metro station. Service is ok and fast. Its a Chinese cousin. But all dishes are not up to the mark. Where as Garlic Chicken and Chicken gravy noodles are far better than other dishes. Price is cheap. Must visit this place when your pocket is tight and still need a peaceful place with your loved once...

The Mombasa is located inside one of North Kolkata's innumerable narrow alleys in Shyambazar near the five point crossing. I visited this place with my family during the Durga Pujo. We had to wait for around 15 minutes before we could get a seat. The place is quite small and tries to make the most of the small capacity. We ordered Egg Fried Rice along with Boneless Chicken Manchurian and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The quantity of Egg Fried Rice in a single plate needs to appreciated and would easily suffice a couple of people. Both the Chicken Manchurian and Sweet and Sour Chicken could have been better in its taste. The staff were a bit unkind as they couldn't provide an extra seat to their maximum capacity of six seats in a single table to accommodate our driver. I hope they can rectify such events in the future.

The Mombasa, located at near shymbazar tram depot. I would like to suggest all, Just go at this restaurant and have any chinese dish.But who am I to say this? That you will get to know after eat. Beacause I visited there for almost 30 times. Only fit their food's quality and quantity with cheap rate. I am giving 4.5 rating not 5 beacause they have some sitting arrangment issue and only one staff. But for authentic chinese food, specially mixed hakka noodle, Garlic chicken and chicken hot n sour soup, you can go easily.

Now i cant explain anything else about this silent romantic lovable place. i just speechless. i just loved it very very very very much. its true sitting arrangement approx 20 people at a time. but yet frankly speak we always can wait for best option best food best place best service. sitting capacity & waiting time no matter here in front of all goods. we can compromised for it. once again i just love it very much.

This place has been standing as one of the lone restaurants to fulfill Chinese craving of North kolkatans since the time not many restaurants were there in the area.. The quality n quantity has not been compromised since the last 20yrs I have been eating from there.. In this time of fierce competition with brand names opening their outlet there it is still maintaining its own repute of providing quality n quantity within a very affordable price.. Tried almost the entire menu, but my favourite is their mixed noodle mombasa special one n barbeque chicken..

An average outlet which serves average food but the quantity and quality is decent. But the food cannot satisfy you if you are looking for some exciting gastronomical experience. The soup is decent over here, so is the appetizers. But the main course is not at all good. But if you are looking for a dine-out place with friends near shyambazar, this could be a choice. And to be very honest the service is very slow and the ambience is not at all welcoming. But still you can visit this place once.

The first time a friend took me there the owner told us that the restaurant is closed, in spite of the "open" sign. Why I don't know. Today we again tried our luck there. This time we were let in.

It is a small 24 seater restaurant. There was one staff - he took money, orders, I dare say he cooked(?). The restaurant was neat and clean.

First of all, why "The Mombasa"? The name gives the impression of it serving African cuisine, but actually it serves Chinese. 

We were very hungry and so ordered chicken vegetable soup, mixed fried rice and Shanghai chicken - the last one as per the staff's suggestion.

Food arrived quickly. Soup tasted great but he quantity was little. Fried rice was huge in quantity and tasted like Indian pulao. Shanghai chicken was vile to taste - sour curry, hard and tasteless chicken pieces and crudely cut vegetables.

The staff however is well behaved. Food price pocket friendly.

Now talking about their food. I have tried their soups ,mixed gravy noodles, chilly chicken , chicken sweet and sour, honey chicken, barbeque chicken. All of them are tasty. Quantity wise also good. The behaviour of the staffs are ok. But you can go there for the brilliant chinese dishes. Totally worth a visit! :)

Worst food quality. Me and my friend tried this resturent a few days ago. They use liver in mixed chowmin and low quality prawn. And the chicken item was the worst item I hav ever test. The chicken was hard. Never try this.

The nice cosy Chinese restaurant is a pocket/ budget friendly destination. Being a regular customer have almost tried most of the dishes. Some of the prior fav dishes are removed from menu (like kung pao chicken). But it's a must go for me for my Chinese craving

A pure Chinese restaurant at its best in Shyambajar area. Its a very old food joint,but still they ve kept their reputation consistently.

* Location : Just beside shyambajar tram depot near Dreamland nursing home. Always a busy street for nearby nursing home.

* Ambience : You ll not find anything special in ambience. A small outlet, may b 25 heads sitting arrangement ; nothing decorated, an old fashioned food station as it was 20 years ago when I first came here.

* Food : The speciality is its food. All Chinese items are finest here. I took.....
1. Mixed Gravy Chowmin. Quantity is huge,taste is beautiful and the main feature is, THEY GIVE LOTS OF CHICKEN, PRAWN PIECES YOU WILL NOT GET ANYWHERE. (10 on 10)
2. Chicken baby corn soup. Its also very good,tasty and above all quite healthy. (10 on 10)
3. Chilli Chicken. Pieces were soft, juicy and tasty. I told them not to cook it spicy and they made the item perfectly. So always ambience doesn't matter when the pocket is dry. ( 8 on 10)

* Price : Price is very moderate compared to the quantity and quality they provide. I can assure you that the price is minimum for its quality.

I was here today after almost 5-6 years. The place has not changed a bit from what it used to be. The decor is average, staffs are friendly and waiting time is very less. The food however is also average. Chilli chicken dry was good, but the pepper chicken was bit oily. The chicken sweet corn soup was again average. The price however was a bit high compared to the location and quality of food served. Give this place a try if you are in shyambazar and find other restuarants full😉

This is the place where I had been first acquainted with the beauty of Chinese food and as they say the rest is history! My love for Chinese food has only got stronger with time. I went there when it had first opened way back in 94-95. And this is the place which I love to go back to time and again. Their gravy noodle is just to die for, though my mothers favourite dish is sweet and sour chicken. Well to sum it all, this place is a must visit for all those Chinese food lovers out there.

I had visited this place during the Durga Pujo, this year. After a wait of about 30 minutes we managed seats here. We had ordered chicken hakka noodles and dry chilli chicken and szechuan chicken. Every dish was finger licking with the right amount of ingredients. The quantity was good as per the rates. 

Looking forward to drop in again, soon.

My cousin recommended we try the place so we went there for dinner last night. A tiny nondescript place, but I loved the quietness of it all. The place would sit max 24 people. But it was calm and quiet and the decor was subtle, though not very unique. I did like the Chinese folk tale depictions on the walls, very chic. 

We ordered Drigoan chicken aka Dragon Chicken and Chicken Gravy Noodles. We also packed a Drigoan chicken. It was absolutely to die for. The cashews on top and the spice was so good, I am full right now and I still want more. 😋

The gravy noodles was okay, it tasted normal. I expected it to taste a little more tasty, for the lack of a better word. I am going for a schezwan noodle dish next time, or something with a bit more spice. 

We also ordered chilli chicken and it was wonderful. Really awesome experience. My rating is due to me being hot and cold about the noodle dish. For the three of us the bill came to ₹600, which is pretty okay. 

A thumbs up from me. I'll surely be back for more, if just for the Drigoan chicken. 😆

Been here a lot of times and a review is long overdue. Mombasa is a small resturant with no ambiance or special decor or anything but let that not be a reason for you to avoid this place. This is one of the most budget friendly places you'll ever find. The food here is very good considering the price both quantity wise and quality wise. I generally order mixed Hakka chowmine  with sezwan chicken and they are very tasty. Their service is also very prompt and very good. I would recommend this place to people who would like to have good Chinese food within a certain budget.

As there is a saying ' Don't judge a book by its cover'. Although the facade of the restaurant is not that appealing but the kind of food they serve is just value for money. One of the best place to have the best Chinese while you come to Hatibagan at a very reasonable price. All the chicken items are great. The only negative is that it is a small restro and can accommodate maximum 20 persons.

Located at one of that most peddled corner of Hatibagan (beside Dreamland Nursing Home) Mombasa is a well-known joint among North Kolkatans. 
The space is a bit cramped yet well lit and decorated. Its clean and tidy as well. 
We had placed an order for Mombasa Special Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken. The food was well prepared and quickly served. It tasted delicious. Even the price chart is pocket friendly. 
The staff was friendly and quick.
One of those places which will attract you over and again for their delicacies but won't be harmful on your pocket.

As we are mostly eating out we fall short of cash easily..and then these pocket friendly joints come handy...had egg fried rice....dragon chicken...and Hong Kong chicken..dragon chicken was spicy and dry and really tasty..while Hong Kong chicken was not so spicy..and had little bit of gravy..though the gravy consisted mostly of oil.
Though my bestie liked Hong Kong chicken more as she doesn't like spicy food..I on the other hand liked the dragon chicken more...in both the cases the meat was  really soft and succulent...the quantity was good...and as we become full easily one plate of rice was enough for both of us...

Location of this place is very convenient. This is located near dreamland hospital, hatibagan.
Staffs- attentive.
Service- moderate speed
Ambience- very small place with basic a.c, fan and moderate lighting.
Food- very nice. We ordered
Chicken sweet corn soup- full of chicken but corn was little less. Adding a bit of salt and pepper the soup became amazing though the quantity was little less.
Mixed gravy chow- full of veggies, chicken, prawn, egg and chicken liver. Tasted really good. Quantity was enough.
Chicken prawn fried rice- again full of chicken and prawn tasted really good. Quantity was good.
Bar-b-que chicken- 8 pcs of decently sized chicken, a very new type of item which i have not tasted earlier.
Price- on the cheaper side.
Definitely in my revisiting list when I'm near shyambazar and have Chinese food cravings.

I have literally grown up on their Chinese takeaway, and it still caters to my sudden urges for Chinese food. Though not authentic Chinese, if you are looking for inexpensive Chinese food in North Kolkata then The Mombasa is your key. The place, about 30 years old, doesn't have much of a décor, atmosphere or space, but has always drawn people who come to shop nearby.
The Sweet Corn Soup, Crispy Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Gravy Chowmein, Schezwan Chicken and Garlic Chicken are favourable suggestions. Sticking to the conventional dishes you will never be dissatisfied.

Location and Description: This place is at hatibagan near the fariapukur, close to dreamland hospital. A very ordinary restaurant which stays empty most of the time.

Ambience and Staff: Starting from the main gate so its really looks like entering a cave. No lights, the resto board display is very ordinary looking. Going inside the resto so its not so big. Small sitting seats. Just ac is the feature. Dim lights. It was empty so the staff quick to notice us and follow us on the table.

Food: We went there long ago so we had egg chicken chowmien which was not good at all, the ingredients were not cooked at all. The Chow was very thick. Taste was not upto mark. With it we had chilly chicken gravy which somehow was a bit nice. The pieces were a bit satisfactory and the taste was average. 

QNQ & Prices: Prices are OK but the quality of the food was not good. Needs to improve.
Conclusion: The place is not so attractive neither the food will make u craving. Thou as per resto its just go and eat. 

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

QNQ & Prices: Prices are OK but the quality of the food was not good. Needs to improve.
Conclusion: The place is not so attractive neither the food will make u craving. Thou as per resto its just go and eat. 

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Awesome quality Chinese dishes. The flavors are really amazing here. They maintain both the quantity and quality. The restaurant is not so big so some times people will have to wait for the availability of seats and it'll worth the wait

located at the heart of shyambazaar mombasa stands out to be a one of the busy Chinese restaurant north Kolkata...the dim light and romantic atmosphere along with very good quality food makes me fall in love with that place...whenever i visit shyambazaar for shopping visiting mombasa was a must. But now after almost 3 years I have visited this place again and was my last time. Extremely bad experience. Horrendous behavior of the stuffs, food quality average. I was disappointed

Located at the heart of shyambabar, a decent restaurant for having chinese food and that too at a very reasonable rate. Most of the dishes are tasty, but one of my favorite is the Barbecue Chicken. Its something that I have not found in other place. The quantity and quality is very good. 
Only disadvantage is it is very small and can accommodate max 20 people.

Located at one of the busiest and most crowded place of kolkata, shyam bazar crossing, take the road towards hatibagan, opposite k.c.dass shop. so, obvious the location is their biggest advantage. i have visited this place multiple times, as it hardly takes 20-25 mins to reach from my house. the restaurant is very small, having 2 floors in a single room. nothing to talk much about decor or ambience related things. stuffs are ok, not alwats equally good to speak, not bad also. but one thing i must say their price, it's really very affordable. hence, the maximum count it carries from neighbour colleges. so, rather than being a typical chinese restaurant, it can be referred as the college pals hang out zone. 

regarding food, i have tried different soups, chicken / egg fried rice, chilli chicken, hongkong chicken, schzwan chicken, garlic fish and lots of other sidedishes. soups are good,  the rice quantity is good and quality is quite fine, typical kolkatan chinese fried rice. in side dishes, i would suggest the chicken. their fish dishes are lacking of fish's natural softness. 


but as a whole, i would highly suggest this place to the college students and for the family persons, better to take the parcel for home...

One of the best place in Shyambazar are for Indo-Chinese Cusine. I am going there for over 8 years now, never had any bad experiences whatsoever. If you can then try their "Special Fried Rice" and "Barbeque Chicken (not a traditional grilled one :) but they gave it their own twist)".

**Location = Opposite K.C. Dass Fashions at Shyambazar.

**Brief = When I went there for the first time, it was 1 am in the morning, raining heavily outside, I was accompanied with a bunch of hungry souls , whose hunger rose to the maximum level because of getting wet in the rain. Most importantly it was a Saptami outing :D

**Ambiance = Pretty small place, if its full its pretty crowded. Though its Air conditioned :)

**Things ordered = We ordered 2 plates of Drums of Heaven,3 chicken fried rice,Chilly Chicken,Dry Chilly Fish, and sweet and sour chicken.

The food arrived on time, we expected to wait because of Puja rush, but they were quick. The taste was not really heavenly but pretty decent.

**Recommended = Drums of heaven, Special cashew Chowmien(though I havent tried, a friend of mine told me its a special one) and other chinese side dishes.

**Purse check = Rs. 500/- would be good for 2 people. 

**Overall = The food is not mindblowing here but still they serve decent chinese. :)

This is where I first learnt to eat chinese with fork and spoon. I have been introduced here by my mom when i was two and a half years . Ever since i have been snooping their chicken sweet corn soup. Very nostalgic place indeed. Whenever its chinese, its mombasa. It is near shyambazar tram depot. Initially it had a marred decor but with time their is an improvement . Like other chino restros it is dimly lit. Try the chicken mushroom soup, its stuffed with chicken and mushroom and is tasty as ever. crispy chilli babycorn is a sure recommendation for veggie friendly people. And what i always order and classic out here is the mixed gravy chowmein n chilli fish dry. It is unbeatable , tasty , yumm and a dead favourite. What adds to the taste is the shrimps and the liver they put it. Their garlic chicken is also worth giving a try. So mombasa it is, whenever I am lethargic and hungry for chinese.

This place occupy a great place in my childhood memory and even today as well. The aroma of the place will tell you how excellent the chinese food served here could be. Starting from soup to mixed chowmin gravy - well my heart goes with the food here.

I love the food - I die for the food at Mombasa. And its a true confession.

Only negative is - the ambience is old - from last 10 years at least they haven't changed. So I would suggest to improvise the ambience. 

Otherwise it is the best chinese food outlet in Shyambazar area.

i have visited this place quite a number of times with my school friends..its just the lane beside the shyambazar tram dipo and oppoaite to k.c dass fashions..its a small outlet yet i like it ..though its a bit clumsy and if u visit 1st time u might feel cloistered..

i mostly like their chicken fried rice,mixed kajunut chowmein,drums of heaven and their chilli chicken ...each of these items there are worth a try...their chickn chopseuy is also very nice ...i really like the food here..

maintenance is good and the hospitality of the servers are very nice..and it is a very pocket friendly place and u get to taste some best chicnese platter..i reallly like the food here..its worth a try if u love chinese and want to have it in a less pricen .

I visit Mombasa often since childhood. The quality of food is great and in my opinion food here is definitely a good bang for the buck. Ambience isn't mind blowing, but not horrible either with AC on always.

Ordered a special fried rice and chicken manchurian today. The quantity was decent as me and my friend had a hard time consuming all that in our already half filled stomachs. The special fried rice was really great while I'd call the chicken manchurian just good.

You can definitely consider Mombasa anyway if you are nearby and want to test some Chinese food.

This is just beside Dreamland Nursing home and opposite K.C.Dass Fashions shop in Fariapukur (Shyambazar area).

Ambiance: I was not impressed. You have a very small cramped room with no windows. The lighting was dim. Gives you a sort of suffocating feeling and little space to move around.

Food: The food...ummm...hmmm...I would say is good. But then, if you consider other restaurants in this area, the taste and price are pretty much the same. For example, I ordered Mixed Kajunut Chowmein and the taste was exactly the same as what I had in another restaurant at the same area (except that it did not have kajus).

Price: Price wise I would say this falls in the cheaper side. The quantity is sufficient. 

Here are some of the items you can try out and their prices:
Mixed kajunut chowmein - Rs 140/-
Mombasa Special Soup - Rs 90/-
Drums of heaven (8pieces) - Rs 140/-
Crispy Chicken - Rs 140/-
Chicken Chopsuey - Rs 120/-

If you are looking for cheap chinese food, you may visit this place but there might be other better options at the same price. Use your judgement.

For the past 3 years im a regular visitor of Mombasa- probably the best chinise restaurant in shyambazar area.
Centraly located in hatibagan(opposite lane of k.c das fshions), this food joint is always my fav destination as like the other chinese lovers in the area. Thogh their sitting area is very limited, you could have to wait for sometimes basically on weekends.
As far as the food is concerned, it is terrific. Well & truely a chinese lover's paradise. You can just sit back and enjoy your meal from their large range of chinese dishes just like i do in my each visit. Special fried rice, barbque chicken, chilly chicken( espcialy dry)-to name a few of my favourites.Delicious smell and lip smacking taste, wah!!. Once u start, it will be difficult for u to resist yourself from ordering 2-3 dishes simultaneously after. And believe me, u wii feel very little pinch on your pocket. This is mombasa for u. Plate amount is sufficient, staffs are cordial by nature. What else do u want??????
So, to sum up the story, mombasa is classy yet affordable. WORTH A TRY.

Its one of those places where college goers and Couples 
Go to eat in seclusion, I used to go there with my friend as the food was palatable and in my budget. I have gone through most of the menu and found crispy chicken and fried chicken to be quite appetizing, its lemon chicken and chili chicken is a staple with fried rice. I did not see  bugs but it has a high possibility. All in all, its in proper North Kolkata opposite to K.C DAS and if you have a crunch for cash after shopping or something and want seclusion with AC then this is the place to go.
