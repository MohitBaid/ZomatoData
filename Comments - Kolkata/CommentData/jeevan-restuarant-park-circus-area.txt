Hardly a few mtrs from Quest Mall...Serves decent Tarka.....The owners should it a thought for changing the makeover as the seating area looks quite shabby and untidy...The quality standard and taste of the other dishes to need a nip on the butt....

Ridiculous! The price charged by the restaurant is exactly double of what is written in the menu. Either Zomato has to update it or the restaurant has to charge what is mentioned in the menu above.

It is located just beside Quest mall,small but not so bad restaurant in food quality ,service is very poor,due to lack of waiters i guess,their egg roll and paratha you can try,it can really improve if authority really wants.
