This is near my place and an ideal joint for takeaway of food. The rolls,biryani and fried dishes are quite good here. It is very affordable and the service is fast.

Well this is one place I visit very often. Very near to where I live. Doesn't have a big accomodation so I generally take away my orders. The food is yummy. I like their rolls,chicken chanp and all. And the chicken biriyani costs only 60. So whenever I am at a shortage of money,this is my destination. :)

Moderate... Located on the main road, this could be much better....  Average food....  Uses less oil and much dalda and that too low quality...
