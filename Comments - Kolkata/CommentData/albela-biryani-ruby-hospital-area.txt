A roadside small joint for fast food. They are especially focused on their Biriyani and that's quite cheap as well. The quality is not that great but it's okay for a roadside joint like this. The other items are also ordinary nothing special to mention. Decent for a quick hunger sufficing.

Nothing to specially mention about this Biriyani house.. It's a roadside joint. You can find cheap biriyani in comparison to hotels. The amount is apt. Whatever they give its perfect for 1 guy.. Thier rolls are very oily, I was about to think weather am I eating roll or swallowing oil. Don't expect customer management, they serve customer with higher order first and within that they keep you wait, until they finish their work..
