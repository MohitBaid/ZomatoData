worst quality food. I ordered fried rice and chilly paneer, however rice quality is 3rd graded , chilly paneer . . lol. I think they don't even know what paneer chilly is. it was a sweet paneer, I guess. . in fried rice, maximum 1 beans was there but it was fried in oil, so it became fried rice. . . Not going to have food from here even if they offer in free service. Had to again order food for myself from a different restaurant.   credit goes to Annapurna Veg Restaurant.
