I crossed this place twice last week and finally decided last week to give it a try. Their onion samosas are a must try .. also the dhoklas are just amazing!

Royal is all I can say about this place. The laddus are divine and the samosas are jumbo. This place surely knows to attract you with the size and capture you with taste. 
The dhoklas are my favourite.

Annapurna is a purely veg food joint. They make a lot of breakfast items and my favourite among them is the dhokla. The chutney served with this just flavours up the dhokla and it tastes great.
Also, the namkeens that they make are good for a tea time snack.

Annapurna is a popular farsan joint located near Hindusthan Club.

Morning walkers can be seen crowding around the joint for fresh fare in the morning time.

I had gone to pick up some theplas. Being hungry I ordered the
:
Lehsun pyaz wada which was outstanding . A big flat potato patty a great flavour of onion and garlic batter fried in gramflour. The chutney served with any dish adds a lot to the taste.

Then I ordered a plate of mini onion samosas. They were really yummy as well.

The theplas here are famous with people travelling to locations without much access to Indian food. They have quite a long shelf life.

The dhoklas and khakhras are also very good here.

Located on the crossing of Sarat Bose and Elgin Road on the right side while going towards Minto Park. I like their ghee singaras specially the alloo stuffged inside it. The namkins, gujrati snacks are the best ones.
