It was a rainy evening Kolkata. Me and senior Tanwyee Ray had planned to meet up. I had some work near Rabindra Sadan so I called her up there. We both are very fond of trying out new cafes whenever we meet up. This time it was Bean It Up! on our list as we surfed through Zomato during our search. 
We walked down to the cafe following the map and it was not very far. 
The ambience and decor is quite average. Nothing great about it to mention.
Since it was raining outside, my mood was quite depressed as I typically hate rains like anything and I am quite repulsive about rains, and moreover it was an untimely rain. I decided to sip some hot tea so I ordered two cups of Cardamom Tea for us. 
Next, we ordered one plate of Chicken Momo where I could hardly find any chicken stuffing. More of it was cabbage leaves and too little chicken to even mention. 
Next we went for Chicken Pakoda as rainy season and pakodas hand in hand. They took somewhat more than expected time to serve the dish. The dish was served hot with onion rings. Red tangy tomato sauce and chilli sauce were provided along with the dish. This dish tasted okay. Still nothing wow about it, an okay-ish dish.
The rains had already started my headache. I wanted to sip some hot coffee before leaving. So I ordered one Cappucinno for me. The amount of coffee used was less. The milk was watery and the coffee lacked the desired taste.
Am not recommending this place. Below average kind of a place. The prices are also higher in comparison to the kind of food they serve.

The ultimate place were we used to chill with our group, a small but certainly a entertainment and it packs a punch with its food. A 10-15 seater outlet but the service and friendlyness of the staff is much appreciated.  We have had our craziest times in there and as we used to say never say never to BIU

the prices are much lower than anywhere else..but the quality is at par with the best cafes
the staff especially the guy named nano, is very cool and friendly
not a big place, just three tables but the best place if you wna chill with your friends without the interferance or noise of the rest of the world

One of the cheapest hookah parlour in that area
Try out gumnam over there. 
And the best baked pasta and also garlic bread in foil paper is awesome must try

Decided to check this out to try something new. Firstly, the cafe is too small and can accommodate maximum of three groups (eg. 5 people in a group). Coming to the hookah, well that is not bad but not that great either. Overall the place has no such special vibe about it so totally avoidable.

Worst experience... A place where I went, ordered hookah and just asked fr bill in just fifteen mins.. The AC which failed to chill d place.. Trust me walking outside is better den here, the menu card which seems as if unused for sme years with d dust all around ( perfect to kill ur mood to order anytyn and save ur mney) and their other guests taking dt place to b dere living room walking in d small outlet and talking so loudly adding further to d frustration. Wen complained waiter says dey can't do anytyn.. Total waste of time, money, WHR u come out wid frustration rather den enjoyment. And making the sign board attractive does not make you a bttr place..
