ambience was good. service was upto the mark as we ordered some kebabs which was served after a long time. 
the only thing which didn't match was the price of the drinks and foods. one draught beer glass costs Rs 500, which is pretty expensive. 
the Ambience of the restaurant was good and DJ was also nice.

Visited there umpteen times, and on account of being a regular customer of Heka, Rasam, First Innings and Mirage, I have never been disappointed so far.
Being located inside the serene Salt Lake Stadium, Heka is tranquil, calm with a beautiful ambience and interior design. 
The service and staff behavior is really impressive and so is the value for money. 
The myriad appetizers and vast array of booze are bound to impress you.

We went during the afternoon when it was predictably empty. The place has very dim lighting. They played very loud music which was promptly changed on our request.
The starters chilli chicken dry and reshmi kebab were up to my expectations. Over all, a nice enough experience.

The concept traverses regional  cuisines across India. Ranging from Hara bhara Chana soups to Thenthuk and Rasam. There are some coastal dishes like Konkani fried fish. The outstanding staple however is the Tiranga Ghee Rice.  Also rotis include Satpura Paratha and Bajra roti which is quite an innovative fine in Kolkata. There are diverse dals ranging from Panchmeli dal, langarwaali dal, Chholar daal, Palak toovar dal. The vegetarian line up includes Vegetable poriyal, bateta nu dhaak, dum olav. The meat line up includes Yakhni mutton curry, Goan Fish Curry, Payyoli Chicken fry. The desserts include Jamun e Gul, Rosogolla, Modak Shrikhand, Payasam.

Starting from Masala Vada to Konkan Fried Fish, Thenthuk Soup from Kashmir to Bajra Roti of Rajasthan, Bateta Nu Shaak from Gujarat to Goan Fish Curry, First Innings Multicuisine Restaurant, the flagship restaurant at Stadel gives you enough reason to celebrate the upcoming Independence Day in a much different way.

I have been to this place twice as of now. In both the cases it was my office promotion party.

First time we had around 100 odd people and next time we had around 50 odd people.

We had unlimited drinks, hookah, starters and main course.

I don't really remember much about the first time as it took place a year back. The second time took place a week back so I remember this better.

In unlimited drinks we had the following:

Beer- Kingfisher pint

Whiskey- 100 pipers

Vodka- Smirnoff

Rum-Bacardi white rum

We had cold drinks (limca,coke etc.) for non-drinkers.

In starter we had the following:

Non Veg- Chicken 65, Fish finger

Veg- Crispy chilly babycorn, harabhara kebab

In the non-veg category, fish finger was the best but the chicken 65 was really disappointing.

In the veg category, Crispy chilly babycorn was really good whereas the harabhara kebab was horrible!!

In the main course we had many but hardly anybody covered up everything after drinks and starters.

I had veg pulao and mutton rogan josh in the main course and in dessert I had gulab jamun and rabri.

The mutton preparation was really awesome. The pieces were really tender enough to cut through.

In the dessert , rabri was just mind blowing. The rabri was bit different from what we have from sweet shops where it is more of a liquid preparation. Here it was more like makha sandesh preparation.

Horrible, terrible, bizarre.... The so called Egyptian pub is nowadays cheating people of their money. I have been to heka before, but this recent experience was a nightmare. Went wid some friends hoping to get hookah and booze together, to our surprise hookah was nonfunctional temporarily according to the soft spoken waiter.... Now comes booze... pints of Heineken and some starter. Starters were below average wid very non crispy ....crispy chicken. Just to give u some idea....the pub was totally empty, may b we were the customers in weeks. Coming back to beer....350 rupees per pint...just imagine...they r charging double the price. according to zomato its 180....when we challenged...they said its our new menu new price, though there was nothing new. So after 4 or 5 pints and 2 starters bill was 6000 wid tax. They r duping people in order to sustain....they have no customers, no hookah....no future....they should immediately close this place down.

Heka is at The Stadel which is near gate no-3 of the Salt Lake Stadium.

This is a Egyptian themed lounge cum restaurant and offers somewhat decent quality food and the bar menu is vast. The name Heka means magic in Egyptian language but the place is not that magical indeed. The interiors are good enough but nothing too special about it. It's spacious and tidy but the value for money is not there.

The drinks however are food and you get lots of options to choose from. The bar is well equipped but the prices doesn't justify the quality. Overall, it is a place one can visit for a change. The cost for two would fall around Rs 1300-1500.

Honestly speaking, this place was not our first choice. The bar at Bowlers Den was closed. Curse them. So to try out something new, we ended up here. The pub boasts an Egyptian themed interior. The entrance was uninspiring and the interior is not that interesting as well. They had a large screen showing IPL and a DJ playing music. We had to request few times to level down the volume. On a Friday evening just before the holiday week of Puja, the pub only had eight visitors. Not a great sight.
We ordered Johnny Walker. It arrived with bowl of peanuts, sliced ginger and salt. We ordered some finger foods - Wings of Fire (took 20 mins to serve), Crispy Chicken and Chilli Chicken. Food was ok. Wings of Fire and Chilli Chicken tasted same.
What could have been a great experience diluted to a whimper with absurd price, and dull ambience.

Don't know if my last birth was during Egyptian civilization. I came to know about this place from a friend of mine & immediately I insisted him to join me for a quite lunch. Upon entering I was overwhelmed by the warm greeting of its staff & the Egyptian inspired decoration. Perfect place for food & beverage with mood music. Waiters, I found them to be very efficient & attentive towards us. We started off with beer then ordered continental. The hot served vegetable au gratin was the most delicious along with pasta alio olio & green pepper chicken. Our server recommended us to some delicious desserts to end our meal with. It is easy too on the pockets. I'm definitely coming back, sooner & recommending my friends too.

I went to Heka with a colleague one evening based on his suggestion. The first thing that strikes you about Heka is the ambiance. The darkish setting beautified with amazing decorations on the walls is but a seriously soothing balm to the troubled mind. This, coupled with the choice of music that these guys were playing (80s and 90s pop/rock) is awesome if you want to have a meaningful conversation. Compared to places like opium where you ought to go if you want to hear loud music and where you need to shout if you want yourself to be head, this is a more mellow quiet place. I personally enjoy both places for different moods.

We now come to the service. The stewards were very courteous and suggestive (wrt to dishes that are good). The only hitch was that they mistakenly took an extra order of Martini. They of course were willing to take it back but we were thirsty (if you know what I mean). So we took the extra order and of course we paid for it. 

The quality of food was very good. We ordered dry chilli chicken and chicken sautay and both these dishes were soft, flavoured and fragrant with no taste or smell becoming excessive. It was, in a word, balanced and therefore amazing. The drinks were very well made. Dry Martinis were what we had and the quality of olives were also awesome.

The pocket pinch was as much as any good place, probably on the higher side. One chilli chicken, one chiken sautay and three martinis cost us Rs. 2000.

Salt lake doesn't have a lot of options for drinking. Some are overpriced and some have loud or poor ambience.. Heka is in the right spot. Sadly the location is not great I suppose and it doesn't have a decent crowd. It feels a bit eerie when you are only group in the place. The food is pretty inconsistent but my friend like it and we visit from time to time. It's decent but could do a lot better if the management tried.

From the time this joint was inaugarated,i have been a regular patron.it's a great place to catch up with friends over drinks and even watch a game on the projector screen.good enough ambience with a nice variety of snacks n main courses n an elaborate choice of alcohol.the hookah is a new addition.not very cheap.u can even walk down to the pool side bar n restaurant "the mirage"..which is another favourite of mine.Heka has a resident DJ and decently good music as well.the downside: no screening of the people visiting!

I went to this place to have Hookah with a bunch of friends and trust me it was BAD. The place was dim lit, had no proper maintenance and need painting.

We order for Chicken tikka which was good but not served hot. The Hookah was unbearable so we left the place soon.

Staff was less and LAZY. Such a disappointment.! Never visiting it again definitely!

I have a penchant for all things Egyptian which is why I sometimes drop by to Heka if I am meeting a friend in or around Salt Lake. The mix a cocktail called the Voodoo which is quite nice. The quality of the snacks are quite inconsistent at times  the usual items we order are dry chilli chicken, golden fried prawns , schezwan prawn , chicken reshmi kebab and fish fingers , crispy cheese triangle , american corn pepper salt. We have had all these dishes a number of times ranging from excellent in taste to fairly ordinary. However service is slow and food is often not warm when it reaches your table.

My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting Heka last week. In spite of the reviews I wasn't really impressed. Let me explain. Service was slow. The waiters were too few and too far. The restaurant interiors are slightly run down and in desperate need of paintwork. The beverages scored well but the kebab platter was luke warm. In fact the mutton pieces looked as if the had been fished out of a curry (in a hurry) and plonked on the plate. Not your ideal kebab platter plating if you as me. The staff were courteous but not great value for money.

On seeing in Zomato that the Heka serves Lebanese dish, we visited the restaurant to try out some. When we arrived, to our shock, we were told by the staff that Heka has never had any Lebanese menu.

We sampled some kebab as starter. It was less than ordinary. Overdone, extremely dry and thickly covered with chat masala.

In the main course, we chose to go for Chinese. Cantonese chowmein was a disaster, to say the least. For some reason,it was bitter.

We found the food dissapointing.
