Ordered 3 fried rice, one Manchurian chicken and one plate of chicken popcorn. Pathetic!
The fried rice was made from plain home made rice, wasn't even fried at all. Tasteless and cold, too.
The chicken Manchurian was hot, which made it edible, but actually this too was tasteless.
Even the chicken popcorn was under cooked and under fried.

Ordered one mixed chowmin and full dry chilly chicken . The quantity is enough for 2 adults . I would say it's too much . Food was delivered hot and not that oily . I wish the restaurant can provide sauce for chowmin.
