We tried curry patta special combo here. It is okay but little over priced comparing the quality. Sambar was not that much tasty and idly also little hard.

Okayish food. Nothing extraordinary. I have had here 2-3 times and I feel The food quality has deteoriated a bit. The last time I visited here, I had a chilly paneer masala dosa. The dosa was very very oily. Taste was not bad though. The sambhar and chutney weren't fresh enough

Curry Patta is  located  in the  food  court  of  city centre 2,Rajarhat. This  counter  serves  south Indian  dishes. Whenever  I visit  this  food court I like  to  order  from  different  counters.  So I am familiar with  the  taste  of  masala dosa  only.  I like  it. Price  is  a bit  high  than  the  quality of  the  food.

A visit to the Food Court of City Centre asked for something new and hence I thought for an alternative which didn't please everyone of us, but majority agreed to it. One of us were looking for Chinese, other South Indian and me was searching for Sandwiches. So, finally we decided to give all three a go and hence ordered from Curry Patta, Hidden Dragon and Subway in one go.

This outlet is an identical stall being a part of Food Court. I went there and ordered for two Masala Dosas which was delivered to me in fastest pace possible in less than five  minutes.

The staff attending me was monotonous and soft spoken. There wasn't really any problems in placing the order.

After the order was delivered and we jumped onto the food, I realised that it was good enough but surely not the best. The Dosa was crispy, the sambar was lovely and the chutney was just about right. Getting charged ‚Çπ100 (excluding taxes) for each, I didn't feel the enthusiasm to pay the second visit just for the Dosa.

A visit can be made for forming a personalized opinion.

Curry Patta is located on the empty lanes of New Town in CC2.
The place serves a delicious range of South Indian food. We ordered their Dahi Vada. Tasted decent. Service is nice and fast.

I was treating my mom to her favourite South Indian cuisine and she preferred to have Uttappam (without onion and garlic). So while we ordered, the wait was endless. The food which finally came was cold and honestly with no taste.

The Uttappam was a simple combination of tomatoes and potatoes and totally bland with no addition of salt, chilli or spices. The sambhar was slightly on the sweeter side while coconut chutney was stale.

It's was slightly embarrassing for me treating my mom to such awful food.

Located at the Food Court of City Centre-II, Rajarhat, this place is a pure delight for South Indian food lovers. Had tried Masala Dosa from here, and was quite impressed with the sheer quality of it. The pricing too wasn't much heavy on the pocket.

Tried their masala dosa and onion uttapam on a recent visit to CC2.Decent fare,nothing to write home about.My mother was visibly irritated because she makes better dosas than the ones they make.Also a bit overpriced compared to the quality.Having said that,one can definitely give it a try to satiate sudden dosa cravings.

A South Indian delight!! This little kiosk located in CC2 food court is a wonder indeed. I stopped by for a quick dinner few days back after a movie and since i always have a love for dosas i couldnt resist my craving. 

Curry pata stands upto its name and serves delicious dosas, vadas, dahi vadas. It can give any restaurant a run for their money. I ordered a chefs spl dosa and dahi vada and i was amazed at their quality and quantity. The dosa was generously dipped in butter and wrapped in panner and cheese and alu masala. Very filling and satisfactory. Thr dahi vada was equally yummy, having the right amount of dahi and very well blended with the masalas. 

Staffs are very friendly and courteous and prompt. Pricewise - a very pocket friendly outlet. A big shout out to all those dosa lovers to try the place at minimal price.

Definitely visiting again!

Had their Idli, Dosa and Vada. Idli was soft and nice.. Dosa was also fine (I guess its difficult to make tasteless Dosa üòÅ).. Vada was not at all nice, it was too much crunchy.

My love for south indian food has always been there.It is never ending and worth a try always as it cant go wrong most of the time.This place is a small kiosk at city center rajarhat food court. Tried their plain dosa and sambar vada which was decent in taste.
Pricing is on the higher side compare to the food quality yet considerable as for its location.Decent one.
