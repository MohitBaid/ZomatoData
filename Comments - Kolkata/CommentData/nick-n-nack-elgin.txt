The best place for the college students. No seating available but the food is quite filling and tasty. They serve the best mushroom burger I've had. And they also have a small retail stpre in them which helps you buy some great luxury food items. !

Vegetable Burger is their best item I suppose.I never order any other item because Every time I visit there I always order Vegetable Burger because it is so yummy. Once I've tasted Maggie and it was very bad we literally threw it. And once I had the Momos too it was Good.

A small joint with amazing pure veg snacks counter that serves as a complete solution to beat the hunger tide in the students.. it's a small grocery store with a live fast food counter that serves real good food.
Had the special Maggi(higher recommend),it was finger licking good,the nachos with grated cheese and that awesome dip are a deal to every penny you spend..the serve burgers,Momo, sandwiches that is going to be on my taste buds in a few weeks time.
A highly recommend place and it won't disappoint you for sure

A real very good place for Maggie lovers. This place is very near to bhawanipore college. The place is small. Vegetable Maggie is a must try.Everything is good about  this place except  that they do not charge a fixed  price from customers. I had special Burger which costed me 70 and after two days they charged  me 100 for the same burger. So was really dissapointed that they did not even accept this mistake.

Very close to BGES college and thus a regular for college goers.
Seriously the most over hyped place in Kolkata.
Its a grocery store serving some snacks. Yes they do store chocolates and other stuff not generally available in Kolkata but they charge high for it. Had a burger and a sandwich there, nothing great just a simple burger, the taste didn't justify the price.

Nick 'N' Nack is an outlet located at Elgin, Kolkata. It mainly serves quick bites.

Ambience is ok with slow service due to rush.

Tried Cheese Maggi & Mushroom sandwich , both were delicious . A must try for satisfying hunger pangs.

Pocket pinch is reasonable too.

The must try items are undoubtedly the corn mushroom sandwich and the cheese maagie.

P.S : this place is legendary for using its secret cheesy sauce in every item which adds the real taste :P

It is a very small place yet it calls upon a lot of crowd, due to which you have to wait for at least 20 min to get your order. The food is very nice, but by the time you get it you dont feel like eating. The cheese maggie, mushroom sandwiche, veg burger were yum.

Pretty normal place selling the usual snack food like momos,sandwiches and burgers. I find the stalls near Shri Shikshayatan making better food than them. It's pretty ordinary and I am confused what the hype is about. 
A plus point is that it's also a retail shop where you get a large variety of ice creams,food stuff and many exotic and imported food items.
So if you want to cook something really cool at your place,you can definitely drop by!

As tagged, this place is full of students most times of the day. Mayonnaise, cheese and chilli and used in abundance which is what the demographic they cater to, like. Most of the menu is decent with none being exceptional or too bad. My favourite here is the mushroom burger. I also order momos sometimes.

One very putting off characteristic of this place is the behaviour of the owner and staff with the customers. They are rude, arrogant and cocky. It almost feels like they think they are sent by Gods and are doing us a favour.

Having classes near this place, I've visited this place often.
Their food is good but lacking in places.
First off, the pricing is bad.
The food is junky but tasty. They put adequate amount of mayo, etc. but the amount of veggies are not worth it. Not to mention, if you're buying a mushroom sandwich (my fave veg sandwich), you pay 30 extra and get only a handful pieces.
Could be better IMO. I wouldn't mind paying more if the food was better.
It's a street food junction, no seating, just takeaway or chit-chat.

As a Bhawanipur College student I dont think anyone will not no this place. This is a place to get a quick bite of Maggi, Sandwich, Burger or Pasta. And to be honest they make it just superb. This place has been a hunger saviour specialist for years now. Here you get all kinds of snacks within minutes. This place is always full and crowded and you have to wait sometime to get what you have ordered.
I think everything is perfect other than the price, it can be little less to make it worth. There is no sitting arrangements and people mostly take-away or have it there itself gossiping with friends.

Go and have some quick bite of your favourite snacks.

3/5 for this place. The extra 0.5 for the memories I have here.

They've got variety of maggi, sandwiches, burger, nachos and corn.... This place used to be my everyday spot for lunch when I was in bhawanipore college....its a small place no seating arrangements..... Stand on the footpath and eat.... This place is more of a eatery store for household thing rather than eating joint....just a small counter they've kept for sandwiches n burgers, but whatever it is...its yumm...

Food is of A grade but price is quite expensive  cheese dip's cost is 20-25 and the quantity is very less. Cheese meggi n waiwai cost 60-70 because they add cheese powder mayonise cheese spread as we know the meggi costs 12 rs n waiwai 10rs and after making it completely they charged 60-70 where it should be 30-35 rs anyways if you have more money and food love you can afford it.

I visited this place recently on a recommendation by my friend. A five min. walk from forum mall. This place is a grocery store cum sandwich shop. The behavior is very kind. The sandwich is made with in house sauce. Served with chips. Its a hub for students and a total value for money. Would love to see this place being turned to a restaurant.

They serve exceptional burgers,sandwiches and nachos but the owner and the guy Vikas are way too irritating! They keep asking for tips all the time and no matter what amout you give them, they are never happy with it. Also the guys have a lot of attitude to themselves. Literally pissing off

Location: A stone's throw from Extacy; On the other end of the lane opposite to Chakraberia Auto Stand.

Nick n' Nack is a store-cum-eatery which stores daily household needed food items alongside their eatery menu which is drafted under the quick bite category. This place is always crowded by families as well as students of nearby schools and colleges, but, sadly lacks seating arrangements.
This review is based on three visits in which a number of dishes were tried:

- Wai Wai Noodles
The noodles was nicely prepared with fresh assorted veggies (onion, capsicum & tomato) in it. Tasted good.

- Wai Wai Noodles (Spicy)
The preparation was same as the usual Noodles but, with an extra ingredient (Schezwan sauce) for the spicy flavor. Spot on spiciness. Delicious.

- Steamed Momos (Veg) [5 pieces]
The wrap was thin and the filling was flavorful. Served along with Salsa Dip which was spicy but, lacked the sourness.
Momos along with Salsa dip? Weird combination, yet complimented well. But, the spicy Momo sauce is recommended.

- Cheese Nachos
Cornitos Nachos Crisps topped with Cheese Powder, Salt & Red Chilli powder seasoning and grated Amul Cheese. Served along side their special dip (a mixture of mayo, cheddar cheese and salsa sauce).
Nothing exceptional, but tasted great!

- Special Burger
Crisp and flavorful Aloo Patty along with Onion, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Jalape√±os, two cheese slices sandwiched inside a Grilled Sesame Bun with their special dip spread on one side of the Bun. But, the burger wasn't properly grilled and the layers started oozing out. Kindly grill it with care.
Served along with an accompaniment (mixture of Schezwan sauce, Cheddar Cheese or Thousand Island Dressing and Mayo). The style of giving the accompaniment was quite shocking. Could have been given in a small plastic cup.
But, tasted good.
Recommended.

- Special Burger with French Fries
The special burger was made and served in the aforementioned way. The fries along were crisp, non-greasy and well-seasoned. Happy to see the accompaniment being given in a small cup and the burger being grilled with care.

- Jalape√±o Nachos
Cornitos Nachos Crisps topped with Jalape√±o slices and grated Amul Cheese. Served along side their special dip (a mixture of mayo, cheddar cheese and salsa sauce).
Nothing exceptional, but tasted decent!

The Staff was friendly and polite who managed the crowd pretty well and also served at a prompt speed.
The prices wouldn't steal away the smile on your pocket. Pocket-friendly.

Overall was an above-average experience.
- Yet to try their sandwiches, comments due.

This small shop is on the crossing of Ray Street and Heysham Road. It is essentially a convenience store which sells primarily edible items, including imported products, They also sell cooked Maggi / Wai Wai, soup, corn and make various grilled sandwiches. They have soft drinks and golas, along with a smattering of McCain fried products,

The (all vegetarian) sandwiches are fairly well done, You have vegetable, corn, aloo etc. All in all a conveneient place to hop across to if you are hungry, though ether are so many other options here.

There is no seating available.

The sheer passion and hospitality of the attendants makes one want to try everything that they have on their menu. The excitement biuilds up as they conjure up the varieties right in front of your eyes. Choosing between the various sandwiches, nachos, jalapenos poppers and momos and a whole range of icecreams, the treat meets every expectation. Located snugly away from the main hustle bustle of elgin road it is a quick yet filling grab at a very affordable price. Keep up the good work.

Been visiting this place for years and always had a soft corner for it. Back in the day they used to serve great Gola's and the Kala khatta and khus flavours were awesome and the ice clean so one did not fear falling ill. They are also a well stocked shop where you can pick up lots of useful items. My usual order is the grilled cheese sandwich and french fries which I wash down with a juice from the opposite shop. Makes for a perfect snack.

Situated near Extacy(hookah parlour). Or you can say near the fruit juice shop. 

Serves French fries, wedges, wai wai , sandwiches , momos. 
Veg Momo and Maggi - #must try!
It is basically a retail store which even sells food items.

Coming to pros and cons:-

Pros: 1) located at prime location
2) despite being a retail store, earns pretty well by selling food items.
3) caters to the people of Bhowanipore, always crowded.
4) The basic items they serve is yummy and delicious. 

Cons:-
1) Not a place to visit if one just wants to eat. For a fast bite, it's good.
2) Too small as a place. 
3) No place to sit. 

Rest, all is well.
