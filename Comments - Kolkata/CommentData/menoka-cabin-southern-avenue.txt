Located beside the Manoka movie hall - this is a takeaway counter for fast foods mainly. Like their chicken grilled sandwich. Rates are pocket friendly.

A decent shack/outlet outside the iconic menoka cinema hall. This place was recently discovered by my friend and we ordered from here. 
They have good Chinese, decent snacks and sandwiches..
Prices are naturally low.
Have tried the chilli mushroom from here and I really liked it. The gravy hot garlic noodles are also good with oozdles of veggies.
The veg cheese grilled sandwich was disappointing. It was missing cheese and was loaded with veggies in runny mayo dip. It wasn't grilled but toasted and I didn't quite like it.
Overall, the Chinese is good here and is a decent takeaway option for office goers in the area like me.

A classic Adda place this is. An old favorite Menoka Cabin is located just outside the menoka movie Hall. 

Their tea and fruit cakes for adda is what they are mostly favorite for to masses. I have been here quite a number of times and like their outside sitting arrangements. Also the sandwiches are nice very fresh and quality is nice too.

Used to visit here quite often in the evening. Nice tea and street food. Food is just decent actually. Nothing great. Chill out here and have fun after a tiresome day with cheap stuffs.

I m kindoff daily visitor of this place, its beside menoka movie hall. They make awsm coffee n chai . N 1 thing i lov love about them is , they remember evry customers choice.  As example 1st tym said them " i don't hv suger, dont put it. " 
They remember this thing, n 4m next tym i nvr had to tell the same thing. Its a small place, 1000 of ppl visit here evryday. Its nt big restaurant, where limited ppl will visit with unlimited money. But i was amazed to see this they remember evry customer n their choice.

I am a regular visitor of this place for chai. ;) They make really mindblowing chais and coffees. I am stunned to see that they use Nescafe Gold. Impressive. Quality of chai is equally good. They guys who run the hotel are nice people. 
Its a perfect place to have your evening chai in the rains under a tree. Its that kind of a place.

'Menoka Cabin' is located at Sarat Chatterjee Avenue just behind the Menoka cinema Hall.I went there once with my lover when we both were very hungry.We ordered one Egg-chicken roll,one egg roll & two cold drinks.Rolls were just average taste.Oilly & thin layer of the roll.price is reasonable.Food service is also quick but food quality is just average.

Whenever watching films at Menoka cinema,will surely take a bite from this stall. 
FOOD-》 food is not at all upto the mark. We ordered Chicken Chowmin but 4-5 pieces chickens were just top of the Chowmin.  Not even mixed. Truly disappointed.  But the egg roll was good through. 
Location-》walk side by side of Rabindra Sarobar then after 5mnt you will reach Menoka cinema. 
Tips:: try road side stalls instead of it..not a worthy place.  :-|

Well... 

this is a small eatery right outside menoka cinema and is Strictly OK place and fine if you are in a mood for a quick bite The menu mainly consists of Roll and some Chinese dishes but the small stalls flanked ( if they are a part of it ) make a fairly decent fish fry . The double egg roll is good too, The egg chow is decent too . I don't like the chili chicken. As a child I used to like the cream puff and cream rolls but I guess I have grown out of it ,
