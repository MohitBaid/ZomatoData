It is amazing that The Lalit Great Eastern Bakery has opened a branch .
I had white forest and lemon swiss roll both of them tasted amazing.
The cake prices ranged between 50-100 for a single slice which is a little pricey but it is worth it.
The cakes are really soft .
They also make breads.

Order : Belgium chocolate mousse with hazelnut crunch. 

Comment : Do you remember that television commercial (probably for a chocolate brand) where the camera was following the lady, who was welcomed by floods of chocolate wherever she went, whichever lane she took? That's probably the closest description of what I felt when I had the Belgium chocolate mousse with hazelnut crunch. 

Food : 4.5/5
Ambience : 5/5
Price : 3.5/5

Their pastries are good. Extra soft and creamy. Far better then any other bakery and plus they are "LALIT". Price was reasonable. Perfect outlet for cake lovers.

Situated at the heart of new market and very easy to find out. Nothing much to say for their preparations. Freshly baked. We have tried pineapple pastry and lemon swiss roll. Its mouth-melting. And taste of their masala cheese bread is too good. 

In one word, its "woww-some.........."....

I had a chance to visit The Bakery of Lalit during my Sumner visit to Kolkata and over a high breakfast got deal from Little for 4. To start with the ambience is very sobistique and nice with light music to sooth your buds.The breakfast started with choice of morning Juice of Carrot Melon and Orange Followed by eggs over toast, bacon's, chicken sausages, scrambled eggs and the best of all The in-house pastry specially The Danish crossiant and pastry along with Blueberry Muffin so soft and juicy in every bite that I forced them for a repeat. After this the Darjeeling and English Earl grey Tea are simply soothers. The behaviour of staff was very friendly and courteous. The only cons was service was slow. But still it's manageable and Blissful experience at Lalit

I doubt myself while writing this review.
 I'll definitely fall short of words to describe their preparations.
Well,well if you are an ardent lover of pastries and cakes then this is surely the checkpoint for your tastebuds.
Choco truffle pastry is my FAVOURITE.
I can gorge on it at any time of the day‚ù§
Only sad thing about this place is cakes get sold out really fast. Please increase your stock :)

There are 2 cons. 1. They get sold out really really fast. 2. They do not accept cards. 

Other than these, you will have nothing to complain about. Pastries and Carrot cakes are my recommendations!

Price : Reasonable, considering the fact that it is a "Lalit Great Eastern" outlet.

This is customer service and value for money at its best. Got a 'little' deal for a one pound cake of this outlet, 399 for one pound cake, price similar to what you pay for ready cakes at other joints or even less then some of them. You have to order 24hrs before to get the cake. Contacted them over phone and placed my order. Got my desired cake, a chocolate truffle at the right time and it was so chocolaty. An example of their freshness can be explained as if you order for delivery at 7pm you wouldn't get it at 6pm as it wouldn't be ready by then unless otherwise corrected much before. Duper fresh, you can smell the freshness and taste what you expect from a brand like Lalit, no compromises because of the low price they are offering at. Definitely fixing this bakery for all further cakes at office.

Came here today with my sister post some shopping at New Market. Trust me, this little place is a pocket sized bomb serving some real goodies at a very good price. When we had come in, most of the cakes and pastries were sold out. I am sure that they have more in the stock generally, mostly in the morning. We tried two pastries - 
Chocolate Truffle Pastry - A typical chocolate cake made out of good quality dark chocolate. Loved the frosting on top. The little tempered white chocolate on top was even beautiful. 
Pineapple Pastry - Gosh! That's the best pineapple Pastry I have had till date. The cake was so spongy and moist, still it tasted excellent. The freshly whipped cream was perfect. There was one cherry compote placed on top and that was even better. Definitely a must have. 
Both of these standard sized pastries were priced at 50 each. I must say that they have maintained the standard of the Lalit bakery and catering good quality pastries at such a good price. No reason why their items get sold out so quickly. There were savouries as well but we didn't give a shot. Should definitely try out next time. Only reason why I have deducted points is because the variety available was very less - all being sold out by 4:30 in the evening. Otherwise everything was just perfect. I am surely going to come back here. This place is definitely recommended for some good quality bakes. Happy Dining! :)

Located at the heart of british kolkata, one can get the authentic taste of english bakery and breakfast out here. Although the price is on the higher side,you will enjoy the dishes right from eggs benedict to indiana sandwich. The pastries out here are rich and colourful. The added bonus is a centuries old heritage baking oven

A big hotel having a shop in a Market seems to be an anomaly. But this joint was there from long back, when the place was simply the Great Eastern hotel.
For many years it remained shut but was opened when the hotel changed hands and the Lalit group took over and started restoration work at the hotel. When the hotel reopened in a new avatar this small shop in New Market too was revived.
The stuff is good and they have a good variety. I specifically love their macaroons.

Well I never thought that this 5star hotel has a bakery outlet in the alleys of new market, and to my surprise, all the items they offer are affordable! Mostly costing 50bucks for a slice of cake. I have tasted their choco truffle cake and red velvet cake. The cake slices were good in size and heavenly in taste. It's like a hidden gem. Highly recommended if you have a sweet tooth like me :)

An outlet of the original in Esplanade, selling bakery and confections. Their cakes continue to delight me through the years. I do hope they keep up and retain their quality in the years to come.
