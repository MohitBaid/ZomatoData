I've been to this place several times and they serveral times and was never disappointed. It's a large shop serving mouthwatering sweets as well as the savoury ones. I've tried their paneer puff, mango and kesar milkshakes and some sweets like sorvaja, rosomalai, baked rosogolla and many more. One thing for sure, they never compromise with the quality of the food. 

Plus the ambience is nice with comfortable seating. The staffs were courteous and suggestive. And I feel that this sweet shop is much better than some other overpriced shops in town. 
Would like to try their dahi fuchka and kachori.

This is my go to place for sweets whenever I come to Kolkata. I often pack a variety of sweets to be taken for my guests and office colleagues back to Chennai.

You get all signature sweets here starting from Rasgullas, rajbhog, dry fruit sweets etc. They also serve variety of mishti doi of different flavours. Do try their tulsi flavoured mishti doi as it is one of their creation.

Hindustan Sweets is an old sweet shop and they are well known for their herbal sweets and they take pride upon this fact. Do try out a few of them if you are in the vicinity of Jadavpur.

This place doesn't need a review anymore. 

A 0.5mark less because staff seemed very irriiated to serve as many times as I visited the 8b bustand outlet!

Oh. Yes,yes.

The iconic Hindustan Sweets located beside the 8B bus stand is known to many. 
Providing good quality sweets and snacks over the years ensured patrons flock to their place regularly.
They have a wide variety of sweets to satisfy every sweet tooth out there along breakfast items and evening snacks.
They also have a juice and shakes section inside. Overall the best option in Jadavpur to buy sweets

Quite a big establishment. Items are innovative. But lacks in consistency of quality. It has been around 8B for ages. It is always busy with people. Their ticketing system is a little out of place.

Had a quick breakfast from this place.The savouries included idly dhokla and puri sabzi.The dhokla was nothing exceptional whilst the only fact that it was in the shape of idly and may be little bit more watery.The puri sabzi was good.The sabzi was dry spicy potatoes.Finally I sweetened it up with  rossogolla and komolabhog.The rossogolla was a instant hit,it just melted in the mouth.The komolabhog was also good with a hint of zesty fragrant in it.

Upon complaining to stuff they said it was ok and they said  rabri tastes like this only as if we never had tasted before. Not expected from an ISO certified sweet shop as hindustan sweets.totally disappointed both with quality as well as stuff behaviour.

Located just a few meters walk to the left along Jadavpur Central Road, this sweetmeat shop boasts of a variety of bengali sweets collection.

Have visited this shop innumerable times and had always loved their kheerer kalo goja, amriti, kheerer chop, mishti doi etc etc. Even I enjoy their dahi vada and dhokla. They have also got some chairs sideways as seating arrangement.

Prices are on the higher edge. Staffs are cordial and the service is pretty fast. A must visit for all the sweet-tooths who happen to pass by Jadavpur 8b.

Right beside Jadavpur Bus Terminal, is this shop with a few tables. It was such a respite on a summer day last week to enter the shop and sip on the refreshing watermelon juice. Once cooled, it was time to satiate my hunger with the chana batura, which was good but a tad bit too oily and did not have achaar accompanying it. The rabri at the end was brilliant.

Best best best place to visit if you are a DRY SWEET LOVER ( Sandesh ). The texture of those sweets , their variety and especially the different essence in each of them is pretty unique. Starting from AAM DOI to GULAB JAMUN everything is of up to the mark and whenever that goes down to your throat that gives you a feeling of happiness. I advice everyone to visit that place at least once if you are a sweet lover. The ambience inside the shop itself is marvellous and unlike Kamdhenu's prices are not overrated.

Well that is only pop up in mind when you enter this sweet shop. It has numerous varieties. Still one of the best of Jadavpur. 

However this time, I ordered something different than sweets and that's lassi. Black current lassi. Yummy it was. More cause it's summer.

They serve ice creams, shakes, lassi and juices too. Pay visit guys.

Hindustan Sweets needs no introduction - their rich heritage speaks for itself. The sweet shop has carved a name for itself among other legendary ones, and these are reflected in the walls. There's no end to the different variety of sweets they have on offer - it is very evident from the display at the glass counters. They also offer namkeens and juices. And I, personally am a big fan of their Radhaballavis and Lassi/Fresh Fruit Juices. The Samosa is big enough to satiate your hunger, but they don't provide the chutney, which is a big disappointment. Among the sweets, I love their Baked Rosogolla, Sarbhaja, and Chocolate Sweets. Some of them look so appealing that you almost forget about the taste! I tried the Nolen Gur soufflé(they spelt it wrong though) but it was mostly cream and hardly any trace of Nolen Gur was there.

Have been to this place a few months ago. Its located on the same foot as 8b bus stand. If you are facing the bus stand then it will fall to your left. 
The items are too costly for their taste. 4pcs luchi with cholar dal costs ₹40 and they taste nothing different than the stalls outside, in fact those latter would be more fresh and I'm not being sarcastic! 
I haven't tried much of their sweets though as i don't like sweets and I don't even want to as I expect them to be nothing better taking into account their prices.The snacks aren't even worth half or one-fourth of their prices.

Finally I will make sure that me and my friends don't happen to visit this place again at least for snacks! :/

Name bengali Sweets; the first name that pops up in my mind is Hindustan Sweets. I can kill someone for their sweets. The Baked Rossogulla, the Aabar-Khabo, the Ghee Lengcha-- each one of them is simplyyyy mind-blowing. They are the 1st sweet-shop to have introduced the Ilish-Macher Sandesh in Kolkata, I think. Now that winter is coming, one would find me at their shop every Sunday morning to have their ever-famous Koraishutir Kochuri and Gurer Rasgulla. Overall, definitely one of THE BEST sweet shops in Kolkata!!!

Right adjacent to 8b bus stand is Hindustan Sweets, Jadavpur. Food is here of good quality. I personally love their Rosogolla and Sharbhaja.

It is located near 8B bus stand.I have had their Baked Rosogolla and Mango Doi a couple of times. I just love their Baked Rosogolla. I am practically obsessed with it. Their Mango Doi is yummy too. But my preference will always be baked rosogolla. Their prices are reasonable too.

Have been a fan of their sweetmeats since childhood. The carrot rasgulla is the hot favorite item in my family, though I don't feel much of a difference from regular rasgulla, however the basil yoghurt (tulsi doi) is something that I used to love.

Went to this place after years for a quick breakfast. Ordered peas kachauri and aloo dum. The kachauris were a complete let down. The filling did not contain any trace of peas, it was lentil paste coloured in green. How horrible! If peas are not available in this season, just make plain kachauris instead, why cheat your customers? Now I doubt if the colour was at all certified for human consumption. This is unacceptable. Taste wise it was awful and was dripping oil. The dum aloo was okay, nothing great.

It is really, really heartbreaking to see such a renowned and popular eatery stoop down to such shamelessness. Utter disgrace.

Located just beside the 8B bus stand, it is a beautiful outlet in its own world with such variety of sweets.
We tried plain rosogollas, kalakand, mango barfi, goja and another plain sondesh.  They have chairs for sitting arrangement and the place is cool and calm comparable to the outside fuzz. 
We also tried the Moosambi Fruit juice. It was fresh and refreshing.
Prices are okayish, they need to improve their quality a little bit.

This is one of the oldest sweet shops in jadavpur. It used to be a small outlet. Now they have renovated it and it has become spacious with few tables and chairs. They are also serving snacks and beverages along with sweets here. The quality of sweets are really good here. I am not very much into sweets,but I love the mishti doi and the gulab jamun here. The snacks are priced reasonably and is of standard quality.

The name speaks for itself I guess - Pick any sweet from the aisles, you won't be disappointed. Nolen Gurer Sondesh, Rasagulla, Malpua, Chanar Amriti - everything is just so melt in mouth. The misti doi although good - I rather prefer the ones they serve at Rasayani ( Ganguly bagan ) and Narayan Mistanna Bhandar ( Garia)

I have been living in Delhi for the last 2 years. Apart from Macch, Mishti is the one thing I sorely miss. Visiting home this time, I found the city to be in pretty bad shape in a lot of ways. The only silver lining in this gloomy situation, I noticed, is that scores of Mishtir dokan have popped up across the city.

I found this Hindustan sweet outlet while rushing to see a relative on a sultry June evening, a day before I was to depart from Kolkata. I have been going to Jadavpur 8B for the past 20 years and I was convinced nothing could change the facade of low rise variety shops where this place now stands. The location is bang on.

Nothing to say of the sweets. Ate them with a vengeance. Sheer brilliance. :) The range and innovation going into them makes me proud. Also, any mishtir dokan worth its salt, knows the importance of a magnificent display and Hindustan Sweets is an old pro. I took photos of the briliantly coloured offerings just to show my Delhi friends.

However, the PRICES are quite prohibitive, something I saw at a large number of mishti establishments this time. Sad but needed. I guess.

Thumbs up for the couple of chairs for tired patrons.

Chakraborty Tip : The staff are helpful and will not hesitate to indulge you if you take some time to make up your mind.

One of the old names amongst the sweet shops in Kolkata Hindusthan Sweets is quite popular. Located on the road which is adjacent to the 8B bus stand heading towards Bijoygarh. This outlet is smaller than the outlet they have on Raja S.C. Mullick road. The interior too is inferior to that of the other outlet I just mentioned. The items they serve are very good and that is how they have gained all the name and fame they have all over the city and maybe even beyond. I recently tried out their rasgollas,mishti-doi,gulab jamun and kheer-kodom. Loved their rasgollas as it absolutely melted in my mouth when I had them. It was pure bliss for a sweet lover like me. The mishti-doi was good but I have had better mishti-doi elsewhere so wasn't much impressed by this item. The gulab jamuns were served hot and they too were superb. The sweetness was perfect in all the items. Neither were too sweet to have. Their kheer-kodom too is very good.
This outlet serves fruit juice as well. Although I never tried them but I see people gathering around the juice counter suggesting that they too are great. I would visit this outlet again for sure. Few of the items they serve are simply the best in the city.

I generally do not visit the Jadavpur area much, but one day had a chance to be there for a meeting and after finishing it off, crossed the road and voilla I was in front of this shop. Located just adjacent to 8B bus stand and hence did not wanted to miss this chance to grab some snack.

Tried the samosa which was truly great ended up having 3 of them not it time to quench some thirst so Pomegranate juice. The juice was OK but definitely quenched the thirst and somewhat refreshing too.

Pocket pinch is very low but yet you good nice quality out here.

My first visit to this very popular and hence crowded sweet shop was during college days. Then onward, the trips to dig in to chomchoms or rosogollas from this sweet shop has always been there. Their rajbhog is very  filling by itself. A visit to this sweet shop is sure to make anyone visiting Kolkata happy. It's prime location near, 8B Bus stand in Jadavpur, opposite the Jadavpur university gate is also one of the main reasons for its success.

Located prominently right beside the 8b bus stand this sweet shop is one of the few reputed sweet shops of South Kolkata. Since we bengalis anyway have a sweet tooth, we don't really need an occasion to indulge into sweets. The shop always has customers flocking in to buy their famous sweets. The chomchom, rajbhog, baked rosogolla is any sweet lover's delight. The samosa is quite good too. The service is prompt and they try their best to not keep you waiting. It's a little expensive than other lesser known sweet shops and understandably so. The quality is impeccable. Must try. 😊

They have a huge variety in their offerings starting from sweets , kachori,samosha,dahu bada etc. Different style of sandesh makes the product line more exotic to the sweet lovers for sure.
I simply live their Misti doi. They have a wide variety of flavors in that as well. Quality and taste both are top notch.

Hindustan Sweets, is the most popular Sweet Shop in Jadavpur and for good enough reasons. 

We can hardly imagine a family get together without Hindustan's Mishti Doi to bring everything to a sweet end. Unlike other places, where the Doi or Rosher Mishti is generally served in maatir hari, they will very efficiently, seal everything away in plastic containers. They are also the only place that make a variety of Modaks for Ganesh Chaturthi.

Step into the outlet on a sultry afternoon and treat yourself to some fresh fruit juice. If it is evening time and you are looking for something to put in that grumbling stomach of yours, teh Dal puri is a great choice. 

There are a endless list of mishtis that I can name right now, which you must try, but it certainly does depend on your taste. But, my favorite pick from everything that this institution has to offer is their Baked Rosogolla. It is in one word, DEVINE.

Hindusthan sweets is a popular name in  sweet loving bengali families. The best thing they offer is fresh fruit juice. They prepare it in a hygienic way according to your taste. They cater variety of Cadbury sweets along with traditional sweets like sandesh, kaju barfi , laddu, dahi, payesh, rashomalai etc. In winter they offer different 'pithe's . Personally i like their ksheer chop, lyangcha and laddu a lot. They also serve yummy snacks like singara, chinese singara, veg stuff, kachuri, radha ballavi etc. At their newer outlet which is airconditioned, very clean and organized you will get papri chat , fuchka, south indian also. The taste is nice. Quality is also good. Price is moderate. I cannot say it is very pocket friendly but you can enjoy good food in nice ambience there..

The major issue with this outlet is the rush. They have heavy patronage and hence you might get ignored specially in the morning and evening. 
Otherwise they beat many outlets handsdown when its about shorbhaja, baked rosogolla, sandesh and rabri. Do try the sorbets and shakes. They are value for money. Tastes good I love hindustan sweets. Hindustan sweets have opened one more outlet on the main road.. I wish them success and will keep patronizing them..

Bengali festival is incomplete without sweets and for Subho Nababorsho sweets are mandatory. So for this special occassion i went to Hindustan Sweets. It is right absolutely at the heart of 8b,jadavpur. Took misti doi, baker rasgollas and choco rose.

Misti doi- yummy tasty. Superb. Its sweet as well as soft. The consistency is perfect. Loved it. 5/5

Baked rasgollas- this was also yummy but lacked the proper sweetness. I felt it should have been a bit sweet. Eitherwise the quality is very good. 4/5

Choco rose- cadmishti. Design wise its very good;liked the design. This sweet actually attracts people due to its sheet design. Coming to taste i liked it. The sweetness of misti combined with the sweetness of cadbury is quite good. Good job. 4.5/5

This sweet shop is right on 8B more, so it's very easy to locate. It's a big shop and everything is clean, which is very important for a sweetshop. One more thing i like about this place is that they not only serve sweets but also fruit juice and ice-cream. So they can cater to a wider range of customers. 

Now about the sweets. Well a few of the sweets are really nice, like the rasogollas or murubba, norom paka er sondesh. But rest are not great, i found the rashbhara dry and hard.

Every trip to Kolkata is complete with the rose shaped chocolate sandesh and some new innovation of theirs. This time it was the Ilish Mach shaped sondesh !! I have been going there for almost 25 years ie as long as I can remember and the taste and quality remains same. They have moved on with the times, innovating and adding new varieties all the time.

One of the legendary and popular sweet shops in and around Jadavpur 8B Area. Being situated in a crowded location, this outlet is constantly frequented by sweet lovers and locals. Although, this is situated just beside another legendary sweet shop, Hindustan Sweets has still been able to maintain its share of fame and reputation. The secret behind which is obviously their innovative and quality sweets.

As you enter the store, the first thing that is bound to baffle your senses is the wide array of sweets which is put at display. Something which amounts to a total of 50 varieties atleast. You wouldn't know which one to taste and which one to leave out. All of them would seem so beckoning and tempting! I am a big fan of their Gulab Jamuns/Ledikeni and Lyangcha. Besides, other offerings like Barfis, Curd, Baked Rosogollas and Chocolate Sweets are also something they excel at.

If you are feeling hungry, you can feast on their Radhabollovis and/or Samosas. I am pretty much fond of the latter. Although, they do not provide sweet chuntey with their Samosas, or as we Bengali call them as 'Singara', they are pretty heavy and two of them should silence your hunger.

If you are thirsty enough, head on to their Juice counter or have one of the ice creams. Their Orange/Mosambi Juice is my all-time favorite. Although, I wished they wouldn't put water in it as I have mostly found the juice to be diluted. The sweet shop also has an attached Metro Ice Cream outlet where they sell standard sized scoops at decent prices. Kesar Pista or Mango is a must have here. Or if you are looking for Ayurvedic or Diabetes-free Sondesh, you can hop in here without a second though! The various posters/bill-boards/leaflets found inside this store, speaks volume of their achievement and innovations which ranks them as a pioneer in this sweet business. 

The only con I find here is the billing process, which one needs to adhere to before getting their hands on the delicacies. Sometimes, due to huge queue and excess rush, the process may seem tiring and frustrating. The people on the other side of the counter are mostly courteous but sometimes they do tend to be inattentive.

PS:- If you are getting married, you can also book traditional 'Totto' through them. :-P

We entered this crowded outlet after a long walk and tried the Lassi which was served in large, earthen pots which in itself was very heartening and an immediate mood lifter. The cool and sweet drink was all we needed for a wonderful evening.

Hindustan Sweets has two outlets on both sides of Jadavpur 8B bus stand. One is the 'Boro Dokan' another is the 'Choto Dokan'. I am a regular visitor of both the outlets. I go to their juice counter mostly. I have had pineapple juice, appld juice, watermelon juice etc from here. I love the watermelon juice the most. I also had their bel er morabba. The morabba was juicy and sweet. I loved it. I also had their nimkis and kaju barfis which were equally good. I am definitely visiting this outlet again.

This is the most renowned sweet shop in Jadavpur. It has 2 other sub-branches itself in Jadavpur. It is just like other sweet shops. But it has maintained high standards and quality. What makes it separate from other sweet shops is that it serves wide variety of milk shakes, lassis and juices. It also sells different ice creams and softies. Apart from these, samosa, dal-puri or radha-palabbi, kachories are some of the non-sweet items you will get here. During the Cadburry fastival you can have different variety of chocolate sweets to taste. Although I find prices are a bit comparatively.

The special thing about this sweet shop is everyday sharp at 9pm onwards (Happy Hour) it puts up a few sweets and other items on flat 50% discount. That means you can have the items half the price that was sold for full price for the whole day.

An ever present shop since a long period of time,hindustan sweets have been delivering the goods to many people around jadavpur. A very popular place among the customers in a prime location. They serve lots of varieties of sweets whether sandesh,rosh dripping rasgullas etc which could easily leave a meethai lover in tandrums.

Well i'm not a very big fan of sweets but yet i tried out their lassi(normal) among the drinks which they serve it in a big bhar(earthen pot) & it was okayish tastewise. For better experience go for flavoured lassis namely blackcurrent,kesar etc. Among the sweets my friends & i tried out their baked rasgulla & a mango syrup mousse type of thing(sorry its name wasn't mentioned there) which tasted heavenly & should be a must try.

A few days back while returning home at night my friend and I dropped by this rather renowned Hindustan Sweets shop located right at Jadavpur 8B bus stand for a quick snack and ended up being hugely disappointed.

For starters,I dont know if it was because it was around 9.30 in the night or what the stock seemed very limited.Anyway,we tried the samosas the choco barfi and the rabri.The samosas were decent but cold.The choco barfi was bland and did not taste fresh.The rabri was the worst of the lot.Rabri is one of my favourite sweets and I have never had such a bad rabri.It was unbelievably dilute and tasteless.

This is quite a popular sweet meat shop but for some reason my experience here was quite poor.

I've been going here since I was a kid and this place has never let me down. Their ambience is a lot better than your average local sweet shops. They have chairs for you to sit and enjoy your food.

This Shop is located in such a position that everytime I go to 8B, I crave for their sweets and more importantly their fruit juices. There's a lot of great sweets to choose from but for me the winner has always been Cadbury Misti. The baked rosogolla and Rosomalai holds a special mention. But for me the best attraction of this place is their orange vanilla and mango vanilla juice. Just awesome.

Just like a typical Bengali boy,I am fond of sweets...one should try the koraishutir kochuri,patisapta during the winter.tulsi do I,mango doi  are other choices. The thing I did not like the baked rosogolla and Nolan gurer sandesh here,they are the 2 big drawbacks of this place..

This place is located just below the Bawarchi Family Restuarent, and anyone and everyone living in the vicinity of the Jadavpur area is not unaware of this place. This franchise of sweets/desserts is not unknown to bengalis all over the city as this is one of the famous and well known sweeteries of the town. The sweets are expensive in comaprision to any local sweet shop but absolutely worth it. The "gur" rasogolla and kaju barfi are more than bliss and satisfying. The dahi is also damn delicious and mouth-watery. Highly recommended for those with a sweet tooth like me. ;)

Sweets sweets and sweets. A staple food in a Bengali family. Can you ever think of ending a meal without a rosogulla? I don't think so. Same happens for my family as well. When you are in kolkata, how can you miss the oppurtunity of not having sweets? 
We bought cream roll and my all time favorite Kheer kodombo. The cream roll was fresh with 'chana' melting in your mouth. The flavor of the pistachio ended the sweet experience.
Kheer kodombo was well made. The outside layer of the sandesh was dry and not to sweet to balance the over sweetness of the rosogolla inside. It was quite sweet and juicy. 
I'm gonna have more sweets in the coming days. Will keep you updated :)

Really good place for sweets. Best Indian sweets available here. Specially the rasgullas are just awesome. Even the Cadbury sweet. The dal and pea kachoris along with aloo dum is really good.

I stay near Jadavpur, so I have been visiting this sweet joint since childhood. 
What attracts me and my family here is how they have managed to maintain their quality over the decade. Their variety of goodies are also a plus-point, ranging from the different types of sweets to their malai, doi, sharbat including seasonal fruits, doi bora,lassi and the assorted range of savories. I have tried and tasted most of them. 

But today, I would only review their Mishti Doi and Chinese Samosa. 
Bangalis and Mishti doi go hand in hand, like a match made in heaven. I have hardly come across bangalis who do not adore mishti doi. So, like any other Bangali, I'm a die hard fan of mishti doi and whenever I have my craving, I drop here. The mishti doi here is exquisite with a perfect level of thickness and it not too sweet to the tooth. Sometimes, they even have mango mishti doi which is another favorite. No bangali festivity is complete without an assortment of mishti doi and sweets. So, for every family get together, we order our sweets from here. 

And, coming to the Chinese Samosa. I discovered this jewel few months back and I still did not grow tired of it. The basic difference between Chinese samosa and a normal samosa is that the Chinese one has chowmein as it's stuffing. The outer crust is extremely moist and hardly any oil there. The stuffing has chowmein with veggies that struck the right kind of balance! For 8 bucks, this is a jewel. :)The only thing that seemed to have gone from good to worst is, ofcourse, the behavior of the staff here.

Juice of seasonal fruits is very fresh and good. Lassi of many varieties available. Raadha ballovi is something which I look out for. Many flavoured and different varieties of sondesh and sweets available. Baked rosogollas and carrot rosogollas are my favourite. so is the rabri and the paatisapta.

I like your other sweet shop, the service here is below par. What is perhaps extraordinary is the is the variety they have on offer - it's too much! The signature Doi Bora is best I have ever had. They have also brought out sugar free rasgulla for diabetics  in collaboration with IIT Kharagpur!
The price is slightly on the higher side but variety and quality makes it worth that!

This place is like.....the epitome of sweets. The king size jolbhora sandesh to rosogolla. From tulsi to mango doi, each sweets are  even more sweeter than they seems.

Very easy to spot, fresh sweets and a few savoury items too, Hindustan Sweets, being very close, adding to my convenience, offers a great variety of goodness. They even sell softies right outside the shop, to relax weary souls that are burnt in the scorching heat of the day. The mango doi and baked rosogolla are brilliant! However, be alert when your sweets are being served and make sure no flies are sitting on them. Despite precautions, flies appear where sweets exist. And a fair warning to those who like barfi - I personally d not prefer theirs and find it a little too hard to delve into.

This branch of Hindustan sweets i have been visiting since my childhood. N they have never dissapointed me when it comes to sweets. I always get nostalgic when i visit this place as i used to be a regular there during my school days before going to the tuition classes.

Be it their sandesh or other snack items i have loved each n every one of their items. My all time favourite is  their Dahi vadas. 2 of them is enough for a light snack. The sweet sour taste of the curd n the topping of Jhiri bhaja adds to the delight of any customer. Apart from Dahi vada their Rosomalai is super cool. Immediately melts as u put it in your mouth. Also u will not be dissapointed if u try the mishti doi n dhoklas here. Singara n khasta kochuris are also good.

N moreover there is ample sitting arrangement inside where u can sit n enjoy ur food. The staffs are quick n prompt n serve u deftly. N their management is also good. I have visited this place a number of times on special occassions like bhai phota n bengali new year. But they  never keep you waiting for long in the queue inspite of the tremendous crowd.

The ice cream counter outside is also cheap n offers quite a lot of flavours. Anyone visiting Jadavpur must not miss visiting this place.

Ah Jadavpur ! This place is no doubt my second home.
Every now & then I pass through jadavpur and the thing that attracts me are the shops located near 8B Bus stand.
I've been to this Hindustan Sweets only once and thus fell in  love with the shop.
Me and my friend ordered two strawberry milkshakes from the milkshake counter which costs 35 bucks each.
There a variety of sweets kept & one cannot take away his/her eyes.
I took some Kaju Barfi's & Soan Ppdi for my home.
They were delicious. ^_^

One of the authentic places in southern part of Calcutta to sell some mouth-watering sweetmeats that can make anyone drool any given day..!!!
Conveniently located quite close to what people know as Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand. Renovations have been done on this shop over the years but it failed to leave even the smallest dent in its popularity. The sweetmeats like rasmalai, laddu, barfi, sandesh, rasogolla (diabetes and regular), gulab-jamun, pantuya, sandesh have already erected their names in the people's favorites' list. 
Some unconventional snacks include Chinese Samosa (Indian cakes stuffed with noodles), Chana Sandwich (slices of bread with veggies and green peas in between them), Gurer Sandesh (dry sweetmeats made of jaggery) adding to the varieties offered by this sweetmeat outlet.
There is also a milk shake and fruit juice counter at the far end of the shop. So anyone, averse to checking out the sweet delicacies, can find solace in taking a sip of a glass of milk shake or fruit juice (the latter, obviously, of your chosen fruit).

The milkshakes are a must try, available in flavours like butterscotch and blackcurrant. The sweets have huge variety! Try the Tulsi Doi , which has a slightly sour taste , and their Mango Doi is straight from heaven! The chocolate sandesh section is also great and has variety. The souffle is also a must try and totally yummy !!

This sweet chain makes some best sweets in Kolkata. It's situated in a very convenient place, just beside the 8b busstand. Price is a little bit high, though they don't compromise with the quality. The shop don't have much spaces, hence ambience is not so good.

Hindustan Sweets has other outlets in the City but the one at Jadavpur is one of the oldest. Since childhood I have been eating at this shop. We used to stay at Salt Lake and took a mini-bus (Salt Lake to Jadavpur Mini Bus) to come to Jadavpur and then take a rickshaw to Golf Green where my relatives reside.
This sweet shop is located at the heart of crowded Jadavpur and right next to 8B Bus stand (those who grew up in south Kolkata would remember 8B bus and the double decker buses). Over the years, the shop has morphed and changed in it's getup to become more trendy but they have successfully retained the quality of the sweets.
Hindustan Sweets offer all sorts of sweets starting from Rasgulla, peda, barfi, ras malai, laddu, burfi, chena sandwich and lot more they do of North Indian sweets. And of Bengali sweets they offer Sandesh, Rassogolla, Pattisapta, Abar Khabo, etc.
Popular offerings include Smriti Sandesh, Mukti Sandesh, Carrot Rasogolla, Aam Sandesh and Prana Hara. You would get seasonal sweets like nolen gurer sandesh , pithe during winter season.
I tried out Pantua, Rosogolla, Mishti Doi and Mihidana and the taste is really good. The cost I would say is a bit on the higher side. I saw the sweets which are Rs 10.00/- elsewhere are priced at Rs.12/- here. But that I would say is fine considering the shop cleanliness and packaging. 
If you are at Jadavpur area, you must try out sweets from Hindustan Sweets.It is worth it.

Just a minute walk from my apartment. Okay lets start from morning. Hot Jalebis , Hot Kachoris , Hot Radhaballavi ( Kachori stuffed with edible stuffs ) are a delicious treat to your mouth. The quality and taste of sweets are really good.  They are famous for Herbal Sweets like Tulsi Dahi , Carrot Rasagolla. The shop is quite spacious and everytime there are seasonal sweets like nolen gurer sandesh , pithe during winter season , the traditional dahi or sweet curd is just awesome :) :) . Evening you can have same kachoris , then dahi vada , the ghee made sweets are really great. Try this shop once and you wont regret!!!

I have had my best  Aaam Doi here. Though all the sweets are great, from the spongy roogolla to the different kinds of sandesh. This place is famous for coming up with new types of Sweets to the Bong's palate. The Shop is best for takeway and I sincerely feel, they can create space for a combo of adda and sweets. But if you visit Hindustan Sweets, dont forget to have your share of Aam Doi.

Visited Hindustan Sweets a few months back during their Peethey Utsav .The shop was too much crowded and then I found out that celebrity Indrani Sen had been invited to inaugurate the festival . Coming to the main part, i.e. Peetheys..they didn't impress me. Somehow it seemed that both the sides of the jacket were fried and then the kheer filling had been folded into it .. the correct way to do it is that you fry only the outer portion of the jacket.  However, the doodh peethey was fantastic..had this YUMMY dessicated coconut filling inside them. You'll get decent jalebis and mishti doi in this shop. Also, their PANEER deserves a mention. Lastly, this might be the only sweetmeat shop in Kolkata which has boasts of herbal options like :
1.Carrot rashogolla, beetroot rashogolla, soyabean rashogolla
2.Tulsi dahi
3.Mukti sandesh (with kulekhara which is a blood purifier)
4.Spandan sandesh (with arjuna tree bark which helps with heart diseases)
5.Smriti sandesh (with brahmi which enhances memory)

This famous sweet shop is located at the centre of the Jadavpur area, just adjacent to the 8B bus -stand.  This sweet shop is quite famous for introducing Herbal sweets like Carrot Rasogolla or Herbal Doi in Kolkata. They have a wide range of herbal sweets to satisfy the sweet tooth of the Bengalis, particularly for those who can not have sweets due to their lots of medical restrictions. I have tasted some of the herbal sweets like Herbal Doi or Carrot Rasogolla, it is not bad, but I wont say that it is captivating, rather I would prefer to stick to their traditional sweets as it suits me well. 

I have visited this place many times with my friends or family members as it is quite near to my university. I have had their several items starting from Rasogolla, Pan Sandesh, Kalakand, cream roll and wide range of cashew nut sweets. It is of good taste but still I prefer the taste of traditional sweet shops in Kolkata more.  As far as their price is concerned, they belong to the mixed bag group in my view, as you may find that some sweet products are reasonable while some products are relatively steep . 

The Hindustan Sweet corner in Jadavpur is quite spacious, u can have your seat to enjoy your meal properly and just inside their shop, there is another fruit juice counter with lots of varieties. If you visit this place, you would  not be disappointed and the rest is up to your perception. Happy Eating , Kolkata :) :).

The quality of sweets in this shop is good. The space is nice to sit and eat. You can always opt to have the fruit juice as well. However, what i do not like about the shop is the pre-paid system of procurement. This means waiting in queue and a reduction in the level of comfort. That said, I would like to shed some light on the positive aspects of the shop. Firstly, the snacks are simply wonderful. I always have the radha ballabi alu dam. My friends enjoy the dahi vada. Once you are done eating the wonderful snacks, it is time to wash down the spice with some soothing ras malai. I have very fond memories of hogging in this shop before returning home from JU. In fact I would go on to say that 8B is incomplete without Hiindustan Sweets!

This is one sweet shop in south Kolkata which offers an amazing range of sweets at reasonable prices! One of the busiest sweet shops in that area, Hindustan Sweets gives all the other reputed ones a run for their money; and rightly so!
Their service is very efficient no matter how crowded the place is. The place is spacious, brightly lit and extremely clean. You'll also find some chairs to sit down if you want to gorge on the delicacies then and there.
I have tasted almost all of the items and they are all equally good. One of the best things about the place is that they constantly come up with new ideas to revamp their menu. Like, the recent ‘Chocolate meets Mishti’ campaign has made them add some awesome fusion sweets to their racks. 
I would specially recommend their mango doi, kheer balushahis, kaju barfis, rasmalais, ghee gulab-jamuns and of course, their rasgullas. The rasgullas are exceptionally soft which totally melts in your mouth! They offer carrot rasgullas as well, which are equally commendable. Apart from that, there are also sweets for diabetics and health conscious people (read sugar-free). On some special occasions, they also make some amazing fruit flavoured milkshakes.
It makes my heart and wallet so happy to see that there are still some good shops left in Kolkata where I can get my favourite mishtis starting from five rupees only! Do drop in here the next time you're in 8B, you won’t regret it! :)

Well, this is a sweet shop having outlets throughout Kolkata. The quality of sweets is very good and does not taste too sweet like some other sweet shops. The best thing about the outlet in Jadavpur is their variety. They offer a wide range of choices. Hindusthan sweets is also the pioneer in making herbal sweets having anti-oxidants. I am not too conscious about my health when it comes to having sweets but sweets that take care of health are always welcome. My favorites include malpoa, ghee laddu, kesar chamcham. Their prices are also very reasonable.  Overall highly rated by me.
