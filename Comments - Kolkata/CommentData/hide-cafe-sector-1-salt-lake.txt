I just went there for a weekend hangout with my family. It is located at kwality bus stop, salt lake. When we were there, near 8 pm, we were the only customer at that time. We took crispy chicken as a starter which is good and tasty. My son enjoyed really well. But in the main course chicken chowmin and chilli chicken taste were very average... The chow was very average taste.. We don't like it. Hospitality and stuff were good...

People outside often say that Kolkata hasn’t changed a bit. I would like them to take a better look at Kolkata’s food scene. Numerous cafes have cropped up all over Kolkata, some are famous for being themed cafes and some are just famous for their homely appeal and good food.  HIDE Cafe, Salt Lake is one such place. The cafe has been around since 2011 and Mr. Prantik Basu and Mrs. Arshya Basu are the proprietors of this beautiful place.

The name of the place gives an idea that may be it’s a small cafe but it’s more than a cafe. lips-macking food with beautiful decorative interiors will surely catch your eyes. this place serves extremely good North Indian & Chinese dishes. located in BE Block, walking distance from Kwality bus stop. a food tasting arranged by the management of “Hide Cafe”. I and my fellow foodie friends are invited for a food tasting session.they served us some of the signature dishes along with some platters, North Indian & Chinese both cuisines are one of my favorite.

It is located near kwality bus stand. The ambience and staffs are quite casual. They take a lot of time to serve food. Indian food is better than Chinese. Masala kulcha and chicken tikka butter masala are the best among all. Once we have ordered American chopsy which was worse, after 2 bites we can't have that any more. If you are looking for casual lunch or dinner or evening snacks you can go there.

Cafe culture has its own charm. Its a place where you can relax or spend a lot of time with your friends by watching those interesting cricket matches, with your loved ones listening some romantic music or with your family over a great food. Salt lake has many such cool places, but with Hide Cafe you will get something extra. The owners are really nice and friendly, and with some delicious food you will get a some great hospitality by the owners. This is a nicely decorated cafe joint situated in salt lake area. They have a pretty good seating arrangements regarding the size of this place. Recently me along with the team Pachphoron went there to taste some of their recommended dishes. The spread was huge which included : Chicken lemon coriander Soup, Chicken Manchao Soup, Chicken & Cheese Omelette, Fish & Chips, Fish Tikka Kebab, Devil’s Fish, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken and Cheese Roll, Laccha Paratha, Chicken Dopiyaza, American Chicken Chopsuey, Chinese Non-veg Combo, Indian Non-veg Combo.

HIDE the name itself defines that it's the best place to hide where you can enjoy your food peacefully.
Now while I'm writing this review, this is my promise that I won't HIDE anything from you guys.
This cafe is situated just opposit Kwality Bus Stand, Salt Lake Sec-1.
This cafe can accommodate near about 20heads at a time.

One evening I got a call from the cafe owner. Then his sister and wife invited us, the Team Panchphoron to taste their food.

So me along with my foodie friends of Panch Phoron went to taste the food.

And we have experienced superb delicious food over a loads of ADDA.

The decor is so nice. If you go through the pictures you'll find the entire decor is based on bamboo, which will give you a nice feeling.

And the food is really awesome. But their signature dishes : Fish & Chips, Devils Fish & Chicken Cheese Omelette were the show stopper for me.

We've tasted Chinese and Indian both. After tasting my mind said to my foodie heart that HIDE is a CHHOTA PACKET BADA DHAMAKA.

So please visit this place with your friends and family.

And another thing if you get a chance please don't forget to chat with the owner. He might share such experiences that will be equally thrilling as well as interesting too.

So for now Happy Tummy in advance.

Located near 4 number tank opposite to Xing cafe, this place is the spot you are looking for reasonable chinese meal.
We ordered
Crispy Chilli baby corn
Veg Manchurian
Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles
Veg panfried momo

The service being too slow, you can expect a waiting time above half an hour.

Noodles and manchurian were treat to the taste buds. Crispy chilli baby corn was soggy and semi gravy though we ordered it to be dry.

Pan fried momo was having lack of sauce. The covering was a little too thick. Not recommended. You got better options.

Went here for a birthday party treat.The location set by in google maps was incorrect so we had to walk around the area in search for it.Food was nice especially the Chicken Reshmi masala is a must.Plates smelled a little bit odd as if they were not used for long.But the main negative thing is that they take too long for service and the ambience is not up to par.I suggest this cafe only for small group.i.e a  casual date for two.

HIDE CAFE hides drunken staff! Comfortably nonchalant staff with least bothered an approach towards customer service and hence "SUPER-LATE" service..yea u read dat right! having complained several times about our starter which was more than 40 mins late,  we found out that the staff was drunk and hence service was pathetic.guessing the cook got himself drunk instead of the chicken! 
food wasn't bad of whatever was served but all in all would score -100 of 10 on service!!!!

Hide is one of those next door restaurants you can rely on, especially when the last dregs of your salary have deserted you and your fancy dine-out plans. Located near Kwality bus stop, it is a cozy little place, decently set up, with comfortable seating arrangements and beautiful lighting. The attending staff are very homely and polite. Coming to the food, the place has some amazing starters to offer. Recommended ones are crispy chicken, chicken spring roll and devil chicken. Kebabs are nice and succulent, though not of the quality you would get at a standard North Indian restaurant. The golden fried prawns on the other hand, are an outright disappointment. Main courses taste pretty good, but there is not much variety regarding desserts. Altogether, it's a satisfying experience, if one makes the right choices!

The Mixed Schezwan Noodles had a good amount of chicken and prawns but didn't find egg in it but damn, was it spicy!? Shanghai chicken was okay. Nothing special...
Overall a good food experience.

I went to Hide Cafe with my friends for lunch on Sasthi. After pandal hopping for a long time, we decided to satisfy our hunger. We were a group of 25 people but they could accomodate us. So you can imagine how much spacious it is. But not the same with bamboo chairs. There was no space to keep our legs at all. We ordered Chicken Chowmein and Garlic Chicken. Well, the food was nice..no complaints regarding that, but kinda overpriced. Maybe that was because of Pujo. The AC wasn't working either. The decoration was okay-okay.. Not something that would grab your attention.

Visited there for the first time during puja.  We were doubtful of the food to be served but surprisingly,  they surpasssed our  expectations.
The ambiance was decent with decorated bamboo chairs for seating and  was  comfortable .
We had chilly garlic noodles, chicken fried rice  and garlic chicken .
The fried rice was unexpectedly very  good even during the rush hours of puja. 
The noodles tasted yummy. The garlic chicken had 8 pieces of chicken and was decent as well.
The service was fast.
No added tax.
The food didn't let us down at all.

I found the chinese food here to be decent. Tried their noodles, which was nice taste wise and the quantity of chicken in it was good. Also tried their sweet n sour fish, the good thing is that the quality of the fish was good. Price wise this place won't burn a hole in your pocket. The quantity of the side dishes are good but the noodles & rice are sufficient only for one person from one plate.

Location is good. Service is a bit slow here but the staffs are cordial in nature. Decor is okayish, seems like the place hasn't been renovated for long. Seats are not that comfortable too even though they are a bit fancy, backrests are made of bamboo. Food were well prepared with plentiful of chicken bits and pieces on the rice. Crispy chicken which we ordered was also great! Crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.

What we ordered - Fresh Lime Sweet, Chicken Hot and Sour Soup, Crispy Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken

Honestly, I miss the old Roll shop which was situated at this place before it shut down their operations. They used to make clean and hearty roles maintaining hygienic conditions, something which is not found these days! This cafe came up on its place and is doing fairly well!

However, I wouldn't place this along with the popular cafes in and around Salt Lake, They have a decent sitting area along with minimal decor. I have been here twice. In both the cases, the service issue was predominant. Coming to the food, they prepare decent noddles and chicken side dishes. If there's something I like here, its their fish fingers.

This place is mostly desolated which really makes you wonder about their popularity! Wouldn't recommend anyone coming here often except may be for a visit or two in a month!

A modest setup with a very modest range of dishes. The place was very welcoming though it was empty at the moment. The service was instant and quite impressive. The waiter was a good listener and heard out every detail of our order as the way we customized it.

The food was nice. We had ordered for Chicken Clear soup, Mixed Vegetable soup and Crispy Chilly Babycorn which was customized as per our needs. All of it was very delicious.

Though the place can be cleaner and somewhat more hygienic, I have a positive feeling for this. Worth retrying.

One of the most budget friendly places to go if you're in a hurry,or it is the festival season and you suddenly find that numerous guests have come to your place.
In short what we Bengali people generally like-the North Indian and Chinese dishes are served here.

Located in the buzz of Salt Lake area,this restaurant is very new to me,but the delivery of food is really good and fast.

We had ordered Chicken Hariyali Kebab and Hakka noodles which was well packed.
Rolls and wraps are always served here as well. The variation being on the upper side.

The only problem is if there is too much of rush,you'll be denied of a home delivery.
Otherwise the staff are good and well behaved.
This place has a lot to catch up,but I'm sure they can go about fixing up the small gaps.

Sumptuous meal at reasonable rates. Considering the other options available Hide Cafe is definitely the best around in the area. Nice decor too.

This place is a true diamond in the rough. It's tucked away in an unassuming 'goli'. The decor is soothing and the use of sustainable products like jute and cane is the chic thing. The food is priced just right and packs a bang for the buck. The schezwan noodles was quite good and the mushroom with chicken was worth every penny. All in all, a fantastic little joint for all.

Fish Finger is divine too.
Interiors & Decor are cool . I nearly forgot in kebab section chicken hariyali is the one item you'll really love yo.

While riding my bike I suddenly passed by this place and decided to have my dinner here. An average ambiance with average food and very reasonable price.

Well it was a sudden visit to this place.The overall experience was good;decor was simple n homely. The food quality is good though not excellent.Reasonable prices as compared to salt lake standards! Chicken sheekh kebabs r worth a try.

A very favorite place of mine because of it's warm and cosy interiors, great staff behavior and excellent food. When I first had their Chinese, be it the Hakka noodles, spring rolls, schezwan rice or chilli chicken, I was impressed with each and every item. Recently, tried their Indian segment with kaju kishmish pulao and maharaja chicken. Both the dishes made a special place in my heart. The biggest point is it's pocket friendly!

The Hide Café is an extraordinarily ordinary eatery.
The category of café or deli is inapplicable to Hide.
Yes, it is a B-Grade eatery. :3

I made my mistake of visiting there twice, in an interval of 2 years in between, hoping for some improvement.
But, nothing actually changed.
The place is clumsy as hell, the jute bag like seats are unconfortable, and of course the service is horrible.
I had ordered fish and chips, Chicken lollipops and a mocha.
However, none were cooked properly.
The fish fillet was cold, stinking and stale,
The tartar sauce was actually expired mayonnaise in disguise and the mocha was actually a powerhouse of diabetes.
Only the lollipops were okayish.
So, it's a big thumbs down from me.

This neat little joint is well decorated, fairly low-priced and close to my place, which is why I've visited it several times since it opened its doors a few years ago. I'd rate it higher if the food and service were better though.

A neatly decorated (in patterns of brown and cream) restaurant, Hide is very near to the Kwality bus stop, bang opposite to the Xing restaurant which is about a five-minute walk from the CAP camp island in Salt Lake.

I was meeting a friend after a long time and I decided to introduce her to this place. I hadn't been here myself in a while but I had good memories of it, so we gave it a go. The place is tidy, spacious and quiet but the chairs are kind of small-sized and more on the uncomfortable side. We ordered the Crispy Chicken, the Chicken Hakka Noodles and the Garlic Chicken. When it arrived, Crispy Chicken was surprisingly boneless. The quantity of each was enormous and adequate to stuff two people till dinner. Everything was tasty and absolutely scrumptious. The bill came to around 500 bucks and it was a meal we both relished. Service was swift, though we wished he had served the food. The server disappeared right after putting down the plates, before we could even ask him to distribute the food. 

In any case, I'd love to go back and try other things :)

A small joint in salt lake offering decent food...the decor is nice...we had ordered the konjee chicken, chicken tikka, chicken reshmi, haryali chicken and chicken malai kebabs....the konjee chicken was really good...the kebabs were well done except the malai kebab which I felt lacked flavor... Heard their fish and chips is very good and will try when we visit next... The staffs are very well behaved...a nice quiet place and above all pocket friendly...

Though the ambience is nice and the shop has undergone slight renovation off late, the food is pricey. It might pinch ur pocket as because the price is not proportionate to the quality. I like their fish n chips, chicken pakora, sweet corn soup n conjee chicken. Taste of food is 3/5. Ambience is cool. But food is pricey.

People might not speak much about this place, but me being a regular visitor of this wonderful place can't stop giving a review. Its a great place to hang out with your friend. The food might not be extra delicious but its neither bad. The service is simply excellent. You can simply come here, take a comfortable seat, order some food and keeping watching the TV while waiting for your friends to arrive. ;)  Not a very crowded place which makes you feel at ease. Do try their cheese omelet.

Its basically a sudden visit to kwality bus stand in saltlake which drove me to hide. Its basically a small joint. Prices are reasonable as per saltlake standards.  Whats good about the decor is the use of jute and cane. Preparation is good. Nothing amazing. We ordered for a chicken cheese balls. Then we went straight away to the main course. The schezwan mixed chowmein was exceptionally great. The chilli garlic pepper prawn is a must try. We also tried the french mushroom chicken which was good. Worth visitng.

like any regular restaurant.. though the crispy chicken was good.. but the other foods were somewhat OK.. its a place for time pass.. i would not recommend spending more than 350.. but they can improve very much if they are passionate about food.. the service was lame too.. though the ambiance was fair enough to give a comfortable mood..

Although this place is walking distance from my place, I have never got a chance to order food from here or eat here too . My dad has been a regular at this places and likes their fish fry . 

I decided to order some snacks from here and decided to do for the Chili Chicken dry which was delicious as was the schezwan chicken dry . It disappeared in minutes and we wanted to have more . 

Will soon be ordering a lot more from here .. The food was fresh and delicious . I wish that they add a few mutton dishes as well on the menu

A rather sad and desolate place in Salt Lake. The staff and the place is extremely laid back. It probably has its perks, which we couldn't find. We only ordered tea there, and it took about half hour. Probably a slow and steady kind of place!

First things first, this place is difficult to locate IF you do not know Salt Lake really well which was in my case.
Ok Hide Cafe is a very mediocre cafe which serves indian and chinese. 
We went there today afternoon. 

Ambience : Extremely mediocre, nothing special at all. For people, who are a bit nosy about ambience, please avoid!
We were really hungry so we ordered :
 Mixed fried rice
Schezwan Chicken

As hunger rises, we jumped on the food soon as it came. The fried rice was good. The amount was extremely generous.
However, the schezwan chicken was spicy which was indirectly good for us because the rice was pretty bland. 
Both the dishes were again an indo-chinese version.

But the biggest turn off was, there was a strand of hair in the chicken :/
That was just awful. And the glasses also smelt foul hence I had to go for mineral water straight from the bottle.

I would give a second thought if I have to come here because it did not give me a good impression and also the seating arrangement is pretty crampy.!

Cheers!

Love love love this place. The ambiance is cozy, and the food is very tasty. Try the crispy chicken and The fried rice ! Mouth watering absolutely. Meal for 3 would cost barely above 600. With starters, soft drinks and main course. For a nice outing this is definitely the place.

HIDE CAFE : Loacted In Salt lake, (Opp XING Restaurant)
I Loved the Chinese food it serves, it is good and can give a run for its money to many restaurants.
The Seating is somewhat comfortable & cozy (Only Except the outer Area)
My Only Complain was that, when i placed an order for home delivery they refused the order (after placing the order for ten minutes on the phone) because the bill was 50 rs below their minimum billing of Rs. 1000. (Was Ordering For 2 People). It was kind of irritating because another restaurant 5 steps away from this restaurant gave home delivery for 500+.
Anyways a Nice place, easily recommended.

I am a regular customer of hide. One must try out the Combos. The soups are delicious especially the manchow and the chicken coriander soup. Indian dishes are also quite good over here. Fish and chips is my favourite dish in Hide. 

overall rating:
decor: 4/5
staff: 4/5
food:4/5
value for money:4.5/5

Tucked away from the bustling traffic of Kwality more, Hide Cafe is anything but what I understand by cafe. Its more of what we novices understand by an eatery or restaurant. However the decor is average and the chairs could be a bit more comfortable and the service is real slow. That is why I rate it 4, not 5. Bit the food scores and it is cheap without the ambience being cheap! Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, an all time favourite of mine comes for just 50 bucks. Spring rolls start from 50as well. Most of the starters are decent with my favourites being fish and chips, chicken and chips, crispy baby corn and sandwiches. The Chinese is pretty good too. In fact their Chinese is what you expect out of a decent restaurant. However, whenever I go, i try ordering for Indian! The serve the most amazing CHICKEN DO PYAZA! And seriously their Chicken Bharta is waaaaay better than most other restaurants serving food in the same price bracket. I personally prefer Hide Cafe now to Azad Hind but that is because Im bored of the Azad Hind taste. The Azad Hind bharta has been the same ever since I had it the first time, more than twenty years ago. HIDE gives old timer foodies like me a very good alternative. Drop by when your pocket is tight and you want something good. You wont realize it, but after that you are bound to become a regular!

Firstly I have been to the restaurant and eaten there live so cant really comment on the ambiance and all but I have eaten their food several time through home delivery so if you want to know how their food is here goes- Hide is a comparatively new restaurant here in salt lake (we need more eating hubs here! :( yes seriously) but it has earned quite a bit of recognition. Now they have really good food here no doubt about that. Their Indian food is better than their Chinese, continental and Italian. The chicken curries esp the kasha, butter masala etc are yum and each taste distinctly different (unlike many places where the curry is the same just the chicken pieces vary in sizes ;) ) In starters you could try fish and chips, chilly chicken dry, fish tikka masala etc. They have varieties in Omelettes too (thats new in India) and pastas. They have pulao rather than biryani in their Indian rice section which is okayish. The only thing i like in  their Chinese menu is chicken szechuan chinese, So its good food to eat at home and give your tastes buds a change.
