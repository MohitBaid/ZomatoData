Location: Beside Fiesta Restaurant
Ambience : Though it is a takeaway restaurant, the ambience of the people here is very good.
Food: I have ordered from SR The Best 3 times.
The first time was on a rainy evening when all of a sudden i Craved hot momos. But seeing Wow Momos' price, I had no choice but to try here. I ordered fried momos. Since it was raining outside and I planned to eat outside they told me to sit inside while they prepare my order. Within 10-15 minutes my order was ready. The momos were really good with generous chicken filling.
The second time was very late where i was too tired to cook after day long tiring work and dire need of a takeway pace. But by the time i was off my work every takeaway place was closed due to latenight. But to my relief this place was still open. I ordered egg chicken fried rice chili paneer and Schwann chicken and must say they gave generous portions of each and every item and not to forget the items were much much better than renowned restaurants. Even though chili paneer was little on the bland side
Even my brother had a liking of the food
The next time was my brother's constant suggestions to order take away from here . We ordered the same items minus the chili paneer. 
Price : Must say the pricing is much much affordable than any other take away restaurant.. I can say with 500 u can have ur lunch and dinner from here and may be snacks too.
