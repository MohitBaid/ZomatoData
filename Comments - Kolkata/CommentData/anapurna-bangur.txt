Since my childhood I am going to this sweet shop and eating sweets like chamcham,kalakand,sandesh of different varieties..mishti dhoi..etc.
During festive seasons..it is overcrowded with whole lot of demand.
Itz sweets never dissapont us..:)
Samosa in the evening is an add on.

This place have been in existence from so many years in bangur. The kacha kola gurr ka sandesh in winters is a delight. The singhara is amazing but the drawback is its available only after five in the evening. Although so many sweet shops have been opened recently but this place has not lost its charm.

This is a so popular shop in Bangur Avenue. It has two branches in the Bangur area. They have many varieties in sweets and price little bit high, according to my opinion. Though one the branches is near VIP Road, so it is always full of customers. But after the opening of VIP sweets, it looses some customers. Last year they changed their shop looks which is good to see.

It's a sweet shop centrally located on bangur main road. Famous for its sandesh. They make good sandesh and other chhena items. Must try if u have a sweet tooth.

No where one can find sweet tooth picks as delicious and excellent as available here in the 2 kms local area. Lots of varieties meant for people of all kinds (not just bongs) are available. Chamcham, chocolate sandesh, mishti doi are the M.S.P (Most selling product) of this mithaiwaala.
Bancharam, VIP Sweets are its competitors but the outlet has its own remarkable reputation and is unbeatable.
