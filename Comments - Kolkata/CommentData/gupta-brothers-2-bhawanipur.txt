Gar firdaus, ruhe zamin ast, hamin asto, hamin asto, hami ast” - is what the Mughal emperor Jahangir exclaimed when he visited Kashmir, which means that if there’s heaven on earth, then it’s here, it’s here, it’s here! And I also remarked exactly the same after dining at the not so old Gupta Brothers branch based just opposite Bhowanipore Gurudwara!

Marwaris in general are known to have a sweet tooth as well as a knack for gastronomic snacks! They also enjoy North Indian delicacies and at the same time crave for hygienic chaats! With the advent of fast food picking up quick speed, they also want a bite of pizza as well as the stereotyped milk base products!

The same Marwari is often too lazy to travel to different outlets selling these and hence, expects all to be available under a single roof! And hence, I hereby introduce the Gupta’s Bhowanipore to these species of foodies – a one stop place to satiate all, and I mean all your food cravings!

If I were to taste just 1 item a day from them, it might take me a lifetime to have tasted all their stuff – which explains the endless variety they offer! A quick suggestion would be to grab food as per chef’s choice, or you might be left confused all throughout as to what to order!

We foodie friends nevertheless tasted the below:-

(i)	Momo Tikka – Don’t be confused – something which is both a momo as well as a kebab – West meets East – American meets Marwari – call it anything – but this 1 goes down as the best momo I ever had! Some fusions bring out the best of 2 cuisines and this indeed pertained to that category! The onion peel topping makes it worth a million bucks although it is priced at a modest 35 Rupee. 1 dare not miss out this on visiting them! Even the toothless grandmom can have this as you need not chew, it simply melts on the tongue!

(ii)	Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Paneer Tikka – Crispy babycorns, very crispy in fact, and feather soft paneer – experience crispiness as well as smoothness at the same time – served with mint / curd chutney – this one also does not deserve to be missed.

(iii)	Cheese Paratha and Paneer Do Pyaza – Lots of cheese stuffed to parathas and deep fried in oil, served with paneer butter masala and capsicum slices, a winner of course!

(iv)	Pizza Dosa – Pizza toppings viz capsicum, tomatoes, cheese, sauces etc with a dosa base – innovative as well as tasty! Mind it that this is served with sambhar and coconut chutney!

(v)	Badam Milk – People generally tend to have this on the occasion of Holi, but I recommend that you keep visiting Gupta’s, have this and experience Holi all year long! Each and every sip induces some badam / pista / malai in your mouth and the high taste makes you feel pretty high! Kulhad serving is another attraction!

(vi)	Til Muskan – Respecting winters, we had this dry sweet whish was topped with lots of sesame seeds and awesomely tasty!

(vii)	Gur Bati Sandesh – Another show stopper of the winters, mind the drop of liquid nolen gur atop the sandesh dollop!

(viii)	Kesar Roll Sandesh – True kesar is a rarity these days but not at Gupta’s, they served Sandesh wrapped in a layer of essence with pista and kesar atop – a regular favourite!

(ix)	Sitafal Kulfi – Who does not love a happy ending, and what happier way to end the meal than enjoying real chunks of sitafal frozen in milk! Was mesmerized to see them prepare the live kulfis in a matter of minutes!

All in all, a heavenly experience, 1 of a kind. Given the limited area of the branch and unlimited variety of items they have, seating arrangements are not possible and only a couple of tables have been provided for dine in customers! Prices are high, but you don’t regret paying. Service is excellent and the staff ensure you enjoy your meal! Hygiene as well is good, which is pretty difficult to maintain when operating at such a large scale!

Have visited several Gupta outlets till date but this one definitely stands out from the rest! Good news is I have already paid them a repeat visit and will be visiting them again and again in future!

RECOMMENDED!

I am not a vegetarian neither am I a great fan of sweet dishes but this place made me rethink my tastes. Located at a convenient junction of crossroads, this place is a 5 min walk from Rabindra Sadan metro station. As far as ambiance of this "Abar Khabo Shoppe" is concerned, it's decent enough - neat and hygienic.

The most attractive thing about this joint is that its almost like an all-in-one store for a foodie. This place does not just serve sweet dishes but whips up some amazing and innovative dishes like the momo tikka. It has an array of things to choose from.

Coming to the service, it's fast (they brought in the dishes quick and would clean the table as soon as we finished, making space for the next dish to come in) and the waiters are polite enough to suggest you what to taste and all.

Coming to my experience of the dishes I tasted:

1. Momo tikka: Honestly, I am a GREAT fan of momos and I have never tasted a veg momo before this one and trust me I would be glad to announce gupta brothers' momo tikka to be the king of momos. It was soft, succulent, creamy and the flavours just blew my mind off.

2. Paneer tikka and crispy corn: yet another fascinating dish that I tasted here. The paneer was soft and flavourful and the corn dish was crisp and tasty.

3. Paneer do pyaza and cheese parantha: I am writing this and drooling all over. That cheese parantha was heaven on earth for a cheese lover like me. It was more than stuffed with cheese. The parantha had a crisp and crunchy outer cover with a filling of veggies and cheese, and the experience was so indulgent it was simply OMG!!

4. Pizza dosa and Badam milk: wow and wow!! Pizza being my favourite no doubt I loved the dosa, the badam milk was something exotic I tasted because before this time the only badam milk I ever had was some packaged one. This one here was creamy, full of mewa and had medium sweetness, perfect for my taste.

5. Til Muskan, Gur Bati Sondesh and Kesar Roll Sandesh: like I said before that I am not a great fan of sweets but tasting these made me crave for more specially til muskan, it was different and tasted amazing.

Am I being a Vegetarian day by day? After having some of the dishes at Gupta Brothers, I’m getting addicted to Veg foods. Let me tell you the full story…

Just after entering into this place, colourful foods everywhere looks nothing less than heaven to a foodie. You will be so lost that it will be hard for you to choose what to eat and what not. Thank god we were served their newly launched best dishes that made our decision easier.

Unfortunately they don’t have sittings, although I don’t think you need sitting over here. As you will basically run here to there to collect more and more. The dining is very straight forward and simple full of foods and drinks.

Taking about the food they serve Snacks, Sweets, Dosa, Pao Bhaji, Kulfi, Lassi and many more. Their servers are fast and very well behaved too.

So in our special menu there was…

Momo Tikka (4.5/5) :
---------------------------------
Soft, Creamy, Yummy, it was the perfect way to start the evening. With very light smoky flavour and its creamy filling this was a upgraded version of simple Momo with Tikka flavour that tasted just wonderful. Momo Tikka is a must recommended over here.

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Paneer Tikka (4/5) :
------------------------------------------------------------------
An always everyones favourite Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, they made it with full baby corns with tangy and spicy sauce just like it should be and big sized Paneer Tikka pices that tasted simply brilliant.

Cheese Paratha and Paneer Do Pyaza (4.25/5) :
------------------------------------------------------------------
Another wonderful creation by them, Small Laccha parathas full with tomatoes, capsicum and cheese. With Big Panner pieces in rich and spicy gravy of Do Pyaza it was a perfect combination.

Pizza Dosa (4/5) :
---------------------------------
This one was innovative. Thin Dosa used as pizza crust and on top pizza sauce, cheese and vegetables made it real pizza on top. It was best of both worlds, those two worlds no one usually thinks to match together. This also came with 2 South Indian Chutneys along with garlic sauce.

Badam Milk (5/5) :
---------------------------------
This was of the best Badam Milk I’ve tried till date. Lots of dry fruits in dark milk with Kesariya flavour this one is another recommendation over here.

Desserts (4/5) :
---------------------------------
In desserts we had tried Till Muskan, Gur Bati Sandesh, Kesar Roll Sandesh. All this weren’t new but they made it with distinct flavour with own kind of freshness. All of them tasted really good.

Pricing :
-------------------------
Expect their pricing to be little high but every penny deserves it to be tried at least once.

Final Words :
-------------------------
If you’re a non vegetarian, you will love to be a vegetarian after having some of their dishes. Or if you’re a vegetarian then this place is already a paradise for you.

Being a hard core meat lover's, it's really rare that I try vegetarian dishes. But when veg dishes are this delicious, you will gladly cross over to the other side.
Located on the lane left of Elgin more, this outlet of Gupta Brothers is dishing out lipsmackingly delicious dishes.

Items we tried were -
Momo Tikka- One of the best dishes of the afternoon. I can go on and on about how soft and tender and juicy it was. I literally licked it off my fingers. This came with two dips. I found the pudina dip a bit watery and lacked the punch.

Paneer Tikka & Babycorn- Another great dish. The Paneer Tikka had that subtle smoky flavour that I absolutely adore. And the babycorn just blew me away. It was crunchy and juicy and tangy and spicy.

Cheese Paratha with Paneer Do Piyaza- The Parantha was just oozing with cheese. It was so soft and delicious. And the paneer do piyaza complimented the parantha perfectly. It had just the right amount of tanginess to cut through the heaviness of the cheese.

Pizza Dosa- An innovative dish. Very delicious. The dosa was nice and crispy. The toppings were pretty great.

Badam Milk- My favourite of the lot. It was so thick filled with roasted nuts, almond, pistachios. With the flavour of saffron, it was a clear winner among me and my friends.

Till Muskan- Loved this one. Condensed kheer with a coating of sesame seeds on the outside. Not too sweet but still tasted great.

Gur Bati Sandesh- A bit too sweet for me. But tasted amazing nonetheless.

Kesar Roll Sandesh- Malai with the flavour of saffron. Delicious.

Apart from these, they have a variety of other dishes on offer that are equally tasty and great looking. The prices was reasonable too.

I love having vegetarian delicacies after a long non veg diet, which happened in the festive season of New year. I was suggested by few friends of mine to try out this outlet of Gupta Brothers which is at the crossing of Sambhunath Pandit Street and Harish Mukherjee Road.
I tried 🍴 Momo Tikka which is a veg version of Momo & Paneer Tikka all in one bite. A plate contains 4 pieces. Its a melt in mouth experience, properly grilled crust gave it a smokey flavour. Teamed with green chutney it tasted heavenly.
Next was 🍴Cheese Paratha with Paneer Do piyaza. This is something that kept me drolling. As yoi break the crisp crust of the paratha there is a whole lot of cheese mixed with mild spices and bellpeppers, its like pizza turned upside down. Paneer Do Piyaza was nice. Mildly spicy.
🍴Pizza dosa was next in the list. Its a sour and spicy thin crust dosa with lots of cheese, veg toppings and pizza sauce added to it. Nice light quick bite, comes with two types of dip.
🍴Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Paneer tikka graced our plates next. Chilli Babycorn was perfect in all aspect, properly coated with spicy yummy sauce. Paneer tikka was super soft and has right blend of spices.
Next it was time to savour some sweets amongst the wide varieties of sweets it has to offer. I was amazed at how many sweets a single shop can offer and was spoiled for choice. Finally came up with three sweets and mentally prepared to visit again to try the rest later on. Being a bengali, sweet means a lot to me and perfectly made sweet is a treat.
The 🍴Teel Muskan is my new favourite now. Condensed kheer coated in crispy Teel. A burst of awesomeness in each bite. Next was 🍴Gur Bati Sandesh, as Nolen Gur is the flavour of the season I liked having this Gur flavoured Naram Pak Sandesh.
The last sweet I choose was 🍴Kesar Roll Sandwich which is a soft sandesh coasted in thick Malai layer flavoured with kesar and pista. It has a beautiful rose aroma.
Lastly I gulped down some 🍴Badam Milk, and it was a true happy ending to my veg brunch. The badam milk was full of roasted nuts, almond, kismis and pesta added to it.. flavoured with saffron and served in a clay glass. Pure Foodgasm ❤️

When you visit any normal Sweet shop, you usually get traditional sweet along with some quick bite items like Kachuri, Jalebi etc. But think about such a place where not only you get the sweet, but also will get the whole bunch of quick bite items, other items like Pav Bhaji and even mini thalis, yes Welcome to the Gupta Brothers! The brand is such a chain which is driving by generation to generation & serving the nation for the decades. 

Being a hardcore non-veg lover, I usually don’t visit any pure veg food joint! But few days ago, when some of my foodie friends insist me to visit this place with them, I agreed with their words after their long request. The place is at the crossing of Sambhunath Pandit Street & Harish Mukherjee Road. Nearest metro station is Rabindra Sadan, max 5 min walk from the station. So let’s come & explore this place.

The Sweet shop (if you really want to say so) offer you Snacks, quick bite items & obviously some authentic sweet. They had separate Pav Bhaji section, which opens in the evening & watching the live making of Jalebis are the true blessing for the eyes. So come to the food we ordered –

1.	Veg Momo Tikka – Usually we either eat momo or any types of tikka kebab as a starter item, but getting two types over a single veg item really surprised us. A plate contain 4 pieces of Mono Tikka along with two types of chutney. The thing was soft from inside and lite grilled from the outside. Just a have a bite & the portion will melt down automatically. Cheese coating & the mixture of veggies in inside was the perfect partner of each other. Like it & must try item here.

2.	Paneer Tikka & Crispy Chilli Baby Corn – The items come in two separate way but we ordered it together. Unlike the Momo Tikka, one plate contain 4 pieces of Paneer Tikka. Paneer pieces were big in size, too juicy & perfectly grilled. The spicy touch was not so high, overall a great item to try for. Baby corns were also well cooked & was crunchy from inside, which was really awesome thing. The Baby Corns were well tossed in soya sauce with onion, capsicum & spring onion.

3.	Cheese Paratha with Paneer Do Piyaja – In this combo pack, you will get two pieces of Paratha & a bowlful of Paneer side dish. By the outer look, you can’t guess, which is hiding inside it unless you cut it into two pieces. The Paratha was totally stuffed with cheese, tomato, capsicum etc. & the Paneer side item was too good. Was little oily but taste wise divine. The amount of paneer presence in the side item was also noticeable item. Overall too good.

4.	Pizza Dosa – Don’t know why they use the name Pizza, may be for the pizza sauce they used it in it! Thin crust dosa with pizza sauce at the inner wall with sprinkles of spring onion. The item comes with two types of chutney & the garlic sauce goes absolutely perfect with it.

5.	Badam Milk – After having your meal, people usually drink water. But we want something different & ordered this one. A clay glass full of Flavored milk was served lots of diced almond, roasted nut, pesta etc. The drink was equally tasty like its flavor. Must try item for all.

6.	Teel Muskan – After having some food, it is quite mandatory to have sweet so we order this special sweet of Gupta Brothers. Condensed khir with sesame seed coating from outside. Dense sweet flavor from inside but crispy from outside. Love it.

7.	Gur Bati Sandesh – Naram Pak sondesh it was with gur flavor. Nice.

8.	Kesar Roll Sandesh – Another mid-soft Sandesh wrapped with kesar flavor malai & also malai and pesta on top. The flavored malai coating added the special fragrance in the sweet which really attracts the customer. Love it.

So in conclusion, I’ll say Gupta Brother is not just an ordinary sweet shop, it is a complete package. Do visit this this restaurant & I’m sure you also will be impressed like me. Overall a great dining experiences over some mouthwatering veg delicacies. Will surely visit this Sweet joint again.

Gupta Brothers has become a name to reckon with when you think of North Indian sweets but now they have ventured into Bengali sweets like Sandesh and Rossogollas as well as fusion sweets like chocolate Sandesh, strawberry Sandesh and baked sweets....they excel in all. This outlet is a busy one, it's like a QSR...with a very large variety of snacks and even meals....all their food is delicious. Another advantage of this place is that it remains open throughout...but a disadvantage is that there is no seating. There is a table in the middle and you can stand and eat or else take away.

It is one of the best place near my place. I have heard a lot about this place and finally I visited it today. As my stomach was almost full, I couldn't opt for their main courses. I preferred having dhokla, tiki chat and rasmalai. Every thing was upto the mark. The staff was very polite too. They even asked me of how the chat was tasting like. This was really sweet on their part. They have many many options to choose from. Sweets being on the top. I really wanted to grab a bite of ever piece I saw in their showcase. I am definitely going to visit this place many more times! Don't miss it, you guys!

I'm not a veg food lover, but this place serves really good snacks. Food quality is really good. But their prices are too high. This place is just opposite to Balwant Singh Dhaba. 
I loved there Daab kulfi, which was really  creamy. I also tried their other stuffs but, l am a big fan of their kulfis.

There's no one place like Gupta Brothers when you want a quick snack or a hearty south indian meal. And the best part is, almost every one of their outlets has almost the same food quality.

I visited Gupta Brothers' Bhawanipur outlet, on a particular crappy day and was quite famished on top of that. I ordered a Plain Dosa and a plate of Dahi vada - and boy was I happy. The Dosa was crisp and very heart and filling. The accompaniments - Sambar and Chutney were both outstanding too. 
The Dahi Vada is one of the best I have tasted in Kolkata, with the curd being so thick and creamy and perfectly sweetened (not too sweet, not too sour).

The behaviour of  the staff deserve mention too. The waiter serving us, kept a keen eye on our table and would regularly fill in our empty bowls with more of their lip smacking sambar.

I just loved it :)

The food tastes AMAZING!! Jhaal naan in particular had my heart. Been here once and craving since then to go again. The only thing I dislike is the seating arrangement. If one needs to eat under air conditioner then they will have to stand and eat and if you want to have a seat and eat then you have no option but sit out of the shop. There are two sets of 4 table and chairs that's where you can relax and eat.

Best thing about this place is it remains open till late nights, also a competition for the balwant Singh dhaba as it's bang opposite to this place. When me and my friends had a sudden craving for sweets late night we visited this place. And even at night it was crowded with people. They had fresh stock even at night is what surprised me. They don't have much seats as it's kind of qsr and they had limited options of snacks at night. But if you visit this place then, kulfis are a must try!

This place is one of the best place for nasta, or a quick snack or even a quick meal, menu is so vast and addition and deletions are made depending upon the season, though no seating available but apt tables are there to keep you food and eat. Its open early and closes late which also makes it an ideal spot for odd times cravings, and also full marks for hiegine and fast service, just a less then full 5 for lack of seating.

Must try there lassi and kulfi counter

Located opp. Balwant singh eating house, I had been there many a times and never get enough of them. If u are hungry for real home like food,u better get down here and enjoy the delicacy they serve here. I like their north indian dishes a lot especially cheese onion parantha and garlic naan with palak corn and dal makhani. The lassi they make is also awesome and also the kulfi (hand made icecream). I love this place and also their sweet dishes. But one thing that bothers me is the lack of sitting space. U have to stand and eat or u can sit outside the outlet in open and eat. Overall a nice place.

I am regular to this place only because of the variety of sweets they have and almost all of them are rich with dry fruits and are freshly served.
But these days they serve North Indian food as well giving a tough competition to its nearby outlets.
The food tasted really good, naan and paneer wer soft and tasty. M a big fan of their gajar ka halwa.
Recommendation to all not only for sweets but this time for the food they serve which is tasty as well as good price to quality and quantity ratio :)

This is a sweet and namkeen shop near SSKM . Along with sweets they serve breakfast also. Although I didn't try their dosa or samosa. I had packed some sweets and namkeen for a friend who stays in SSKM hostel. The barfi tasted okay but both of us loved the namkeens.

A stone's throw from IPGMER & SSKM hospital, this outlet has become a part of my weekly itinerary for the last few months. The brand is known for its unparalleled collection of indigenous sweets.
Their most famous item is perhaps the "Rabri Faluda" which is a total bliss. I once savoured its taste for a full 30 mins before finishing up with the entire cup.
            Among the combos available here, Radhaballavi- Aloor dum and Chhola bhatura are perhaps among the best. Whereas, I dint much like the thalis available here...Mango lassi was found to be awesome.
The outlet indeed needs to work on maintaining food hygiene. Most of the time, i found the servers working in bare hands without gloves which is certainly a put-off as far as I am concerned. Furthermore, I feel that most of the items of this brand are a bit overpriced. There is no seating arrangements inside the outlet.
          Overall, sweetlovers in the City of Joy should definitely make it a point to visit "Gupta Brothers" outlets.

Early in the Morning at 5.30 Am when i was out for some important work with my friends. I was all hungry and needed a breakfast badly. Gupta Brothers are Bhawanipur came in to my rescue. 
Tried their club kachori which was really good. As well as their Singhara which i liked too being a non singhara lover. 
That awkward moment came when i was denied to take piks. But from the quality of food to sweets it was all satisfactory,

Gupta brothers is a very renowned name in kolkata.We went to this place for breakfast and were impressed by the food they serve.Its a quite large outlet which serves snacks and sweets.It was totally air conditioned and the service was also extremely fast.Only disappointment was that they donot serve tea.We had
1:Kachori sabzi
2:Vada pav
3:sandwiches
4:samosas

Among them their "vada pav" and "sandwiches" were a must try.

Service-4.5/5

This particular Gupta outlet is owned by the other brother, and is different in terms of the type of restaurants and food served.

The restaurant is new and swanky and is present just opposite to balwant Singh dhaba, though new it gives a lot of competition to the old eatery. Coming to the interiors it has three stalls , one for snacks ,the other for sweets and another one for kulfi. It is air conditioned, the only problem is you'd have to stand and eat, there are chairs provided for toddlers. The food court is spick and span and the service is good though a little slow during rush hours.

This outlet serves Indian, Chinese, a little amount of Italian and a lot of snacks.
You can try

Chinese thaali- consist of Manchurian,fried rice,chowmein,salad,a hot curry

Special gharwali thaali- shahi paneer, mix veg,tadka dal,peas pulao,salad,papad,gulaab jamun,dahi bada.

Pav bhaaji- has a unique taste and has a different stall for it.

Do try the chats , Hakka noodles,tawa momo,dhokla, the kanji ka vada , paneer tikka . Also the kulfii.

The many sweets , choose any as per your choice,i personally love the gulaab jamun and Rabri , not a fan of their pastries.

Give a miss to the mughlai combo and chola bhatura-.

It was a mini food court by gupta brothers. This place was very beautiful and very well designed. This outlet has 3 counters one for sweets 2nd for snacks/meal and third for curd based drinks. In holi occasion their was a separate guruji beverages counter also inside the outlet. Well ambitious was amazing and hospitality was very nice. Staff behavior was very friendly and service was quick and also the presentation was very nice. Because of holi occasion they serving us the free welcome drink guruji thandai ofcourse for their promotion. Their is no sitting arrangement only 3-4 long tables to stand and eat. Okay now come to sweets first all the sweets were beautiful looking they were smelling fresh and tastes delicious. Snacks were very spicy and crispy. They were very tasty and true deri taste. In drink i had a pudina butter milk it was very refreshing and it's taste was delicious. I had a fantastic experience here. Personal favorite. Totally loved it. Highly recommended to all.

I am in love with this outlet they have highest variations of sweets & snacks & are far far better and yummy with all other outlet of Gupta Brothers in kolkata. This particular shop has its own charm.None of their sweets would make u feel like u r eating sugar, the sweetness in each sweet is so carefully balanced that u actually get the real taste of the sweet and u desire to keep on eating along with this I tired the momo tikka today it was unique and delicious give a try whenever u visit I promise u wont feel let down with its taste
Only draw back with the outlet that you have to stand and eat but it can be ignored for so much tasteful offerings

Gupta Brothers is a pretty renowned name in Kolkata, especially in the Bhawanipur area. I had went to this outlet of theirs on Christmas morning to have breakfast with friends. Outwardly, it may look like some ordinary food joint but it is the food they serve that distinguishes them from the rest.
The place does not have any sitting arrangements inside but they do provide some tables where you can stand and eat. There is a table with chairs, but its outside the outlet. However the cleanliness and hygiene standards are maintained pretty well.

They have an extensive menu with all sorts of food items available for starters, main course, desserts and drinks.
We ordered some Cheese Grilled Sandwiches, Club Kachori and Dhokla. All the items were tasteful, especially the sandwiches. We wanted to order some others as well but they weren’t available.

The service was quick. The rates are cheap.

Absolutely disgusting....in the middle of eating my sandwich the owner sat down, without ANY shame, rolled up his trousers and got one of the waiters/chefs to massage his FULL hairy legs with oil...IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RESTAURANT IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS! Wish I had my phone to capture this but I had left it in the car. From a hygeine point of view this is completely unacceptable, as i bet the waiter did not even bother to wash his hands before preparing the food. Could he not have bothered to go into a private room to do this? Did it have to be done during peak hours of business? Cleanliness aside, it was so humiliating for the waiter, I felt so bad for him, the owner showed NO respect for human dignity at all. What a way to treat your staff.

Will be reporting this restaurant to the food & safety authority of West Bengal for this disgusting practice. In addition, the floor was super dirty and the place also STINKS, those are things that can be overlooked since many cheap restaurants in Kolkata have questionable hygiene standards, but what I saw today was a whole other level of disgusting. There are many other places to eat in Kolkata, will never eat here again.

A one stop point for all your hunger need...  Whether it just be sweets or a grab n go snack or a meal,  all the food taste pretty decent and it does not even leave a big hole in your pocket.  The biggest pro for this outlet is that it has the highest variations in terms of any item  Their biggest con there is no seating and being a comparatively bigger outlet during rush one simply gets pushed away...

Gupta brothers has a name and it deserves it. You go to any Gupta brothers shop and their food and sweets are delicious and they have been maintaining the quality for so many years. This particular shop has its own charm. Variety of sweets along with that new chaats, tikkas and kulfies. We tired the momo tikka today and it was unique and delicious. We also had the samosa chhola chaat which was good as well. The kulfies are a definite try. Only draw back ( which one can ignore) that you have to stand and eat.

If u r a sweet lover or love amazing chole bhature or kulfi then u must visit this place. U will be spoilt for choice with the kind of sweets they have on offer and they will let u taste all the sweets u want to before actually buying. No other sweet shop offers u to taste so many sweets with actually charging you. And if u visit this place during the winter months then - Oh my god, u will be tempted to have all those sweets made out of fresh gur (jaggery) and even topped up with fresh gur. I mean i once took one kg of sweet from here which was made with gur and they had put in liquid gur(jaggery) on top of it( mind u not inside)  . None of their sweets would make u feel like u r eating sugar, the sweetness in each sweet is so carefully balanced that u actually get the real taste of the sweet and u desire to keep on eating and keep on eating. 
In addition to these i have tried their cheese grilled sandwiches and malai kulfis which are amazing. I mean i have had my best kulfis in Mumbai an these kulfis from gupta brothers are somewhat comes second to them. (Very close). 
Even the garam garam imartis made in ghee pav bhaji (even available without pyaaZ and lehsun for jains) are a must try out here. Although they dont have a seating place and the parking is a little problem here but he sweets r the best.

This is a new outlet of Gupta Brothers. It's not a restaurant but more like a food court theme with less of seating space. The food though is delicious and very reasonably priced. They have a nice variety right from starters and snacks to main course. Plus they have a huge selection of sweets for every taste.

Too many memories of gorging on chaat and 'phuchka' at gupta's. My mom used to come here as a kid and we continued the tradition. Even recently the place remained unchanged and the food was as vibrant, tasty, and quick as we remembered it. Their dahi chaat and sunset hued kulfi evoke an almost pavlovian response from me!!

This is perhaps the latest outlet of Gupta brothers and possibly the biggest in terms of area. Situated bang opposite Balwant Singh Dhaba, this outlet of Gupta brothers is huge and looks very swanky. 
I visited this outlet a couple of days after Holi. They were still serving Thandai which my friends and I tried out. Tasted pretty decent. Since we were a bit hungry we also tried the crispy chili babycorn which tasted pretty yum. Priced at Rs 80 its good value for money
There were too many varieties of sweets to choose from. Finally we chose one which looked like a treat at least to our eyes. I dont recollect the name of the sweet but it was filled with nuts and costs Rs 30 a piece. Pretty extravagant but it tasted damn nice. 

Pricing is a bit on the higher side but one will not regret spending a little extra for the quality that Gupta brothers are known for.
