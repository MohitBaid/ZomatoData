Very very good selection of menu, considering it's only veggies...loved the Chinese combo meal..also there chaat selection, especially puchka, dahi vada, papri chaat is to die for.. because they are exactly like you get at the street hawkers but only much more hygienic! Prices are quite pocket friendly too!

This outlet is located near maniktala fire station...they serve tastiest sweets must try soan papri,laddu and kaju barfi here. They also have large seating area and some veg food options but I never tried them though. I had a pack of soan papri that I absolutely love from here.

Located just opposite the Bagmari Burial ground, this is like many other haldiram outlets of Kolkata. Vegetarian food but with unique taste is their USP. Visited this place numerous times. However, last time  we visited, we had a Manchurian noodles, one Cantonese noodles, a sandwich dhokla and a Rosogolla chat. The Rosogolla chat which was my choice turned out to be the best. Sweet Rosogolla infused with sour curd and mixed with chat I and jhuribhaja and treated like aloochat made an extremely tasteful combo. It became an instant favourite. The sandwich dhokla was also very tasty and in small price can fill one's stomach. The noodles were not up to the mark. But being a vegetarian place,  it is expected. However, with all the items the price came to be below 400 rupees. Though, I must mention that they have a tendency to manipulate ur bill and print a higher amount. Kindly check the bill after u receive if they have added any more items that you have never ordered or ate. They will refund immediately. But checking is a must. They often make this mistake of counting two orders instead of one. So be safe.

High on price. In fact very high on price. 70 Rs for a pathetic plate of dahi vada. Quality of Dahi Bara is like the taste you have in your mouth after you wake up and before you brush your teeth. I asked the person whether this is dahi vada he is serving to me.

A Haldiram outlet near Kankurgachi & ESI Hospital . Have been visiting here for a long time. They have undertaken renovation work recently . Now the outlet has got a much changed look with seating arrangement on the first floor . Like their Khasta Kachouri & Doi Bora very much . With new look this place has become more attractive .

The 3.5 is for the price.The food is uncompromisingly exquisite and it was,I thought later,worth the pinch in the wallet.Had Kachoris here.They were heavenly,sumptuous. Haldiram's ,as usual maintained its hygiene.The staff were very busy,and nevertheless, they were helpful.The store itself is worth drooling over with its pedas,rabdis and sweets.
Loved it.You will too!

It's weird to write a formal review for Haldirams, because it is literally like the sweet shop next door...

The dhoklas and khandvis are my comfort food, I can finish entire boxes at a time if I am stressed. The number of times I have walked to Haldirams on a date, for a glass of Kesar Lassi or some Mango Kulfi : ah well! I have been known to finish off an entire packet of Soya Sticks at a time when I am munching on it while working, and standing in front of their sweets counter is equivalent to either masochism or a test of mental strength ever since I began watching my weight. :( :(

So if you're one of those people with high metabolism rates, or if you just don't care if you look like a supermodel or a buffalo, just enter and dig in!!

Situated just near Kakurgachi more,this place us very old for all its packaged goodies and pure veg food from a long time.Went to this place for a take away of chola batura,pao bhaji and gulab jamun.Service was very prompt and we did not have to wait long for the preparation.The food was very well packaged.
Coming to the dishes,both the bhaji and chola was perfectly spicy and sour.The batura was soft and not chewy at all.Though for toasting the pao they used margarine and not butter and that is a drawback because pao bhaji has to have butter in it.The gulab jamuns were absolutely fantastic.Soft and warm,with a little saffron flavour,you cannot miss out on this thing in Haldiram's.

Bought a packet of Kaju Barfi from Haldiram's. The price, honestly speaking is on the higher end. But the taste is out of the world. The sweets are richly filled with cashews and you can taste it in each single bite. Undoubtedly one of the best Kaju barfis I have ever eaten. :)

Haldiram's at Kankurgachi is one stop shop for all your desire for your sweet buds. They really serve some of the best sweets like kanju katli, kesher pak, ladoo and lots more. You need to first cut the coupon at cash counter and then handover the coupon to the people over there. They help to pack in great box so that you can easily gift it to anyone. This store is the one of oldest in Haldiram's chain.

I usually order all my sweets to deliver to near and dear ones while visiting them or in any family occasion. Its good place to also order snacks like chanachur, club smosa, bhujia and others.

The food joint near my house. I usually go for the Indian Thali. It consists of Vegetables, Dal, Roti, Rice, Papad, Sweet and Salad. For about Rs. 200, this is the best food you get. Not only this it's enough for two people on a regular day. The Dal and Vegetables are pre prepared but are tasty and mostly without onion and garlic. Anyone looking to visit a place with their grandparents, this wouldn't be a bad option. Not only this, if you want you can buy vegetables by weight also. In case you having a house party,you can buy a kg of Dal or any vegetable available rather than going for a traditional plate system. This will save you almost Rs. 10 per kg and give you loads of food. 

 Anyone wanting to try some Rajasthani Sweets and Chats, then Haldiram's is your place to be. The food is good and hygienic.

They have a affinity towards Paneer. Once I ordered Hakka Noodles and to my surprise it had loads of  in it. Indianisation to it's fullest. Rating: Food: 3.5

I went there quite a lot went i was a kid. They have fresh and quality products.Though now you can get haldiram products at any store ,then it wasnt like that. For me there 'soan papdi' is my favourite still now i buy it and keep them for month . If you are gonna store any of haldiram's product then there are a few tips - 1) dont keep them inside fridge ,it will loose its crunch .2) wrap it around with 3-4 polythene packets , it will keep them from moistening.
They have a few seating arrangements though i have never got a seat ,because they are always filled with non-bengalis(with due respect to all of them)as not all of them like Kolkatan sweets , and these recipies they feel like homemade( this part as told by 1 of my marwari friend).

Recommended by a friend. Ordered their Thaali through Swiggy. Very well packaged, perhaps too well. Had to spend some time opening the tray. 
Dal, paneer and veggies with Naan and Jeera rice and gulab jamun for dessert.
I liked pretty much everything in the meal except that it was too much food.
A nice meal for a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Must try:
1. Kaju Barfi
2. Kesar Laddu
3. Ghee Laddu
4. Son papdi

Mini samosha and Chakli are my fav in snacks.
Also there arevarieties of snacks items to choose from. Do try them.
Service is also very good. I have once got a Diwali special dry fruits pack from here. It is expensive though worth a try.

I became excited after I heard that they unveiled a restaurant at 1st floor in their Kankurgachi premises in December, 2015 and finally had the chance of visiting this place for satisfying my Sunday breakfast craving. The place needs no introduction, may be as old as my grandmother (joke!) and having a great customer share in this area! Their sweets section is now based in the ground floor and restaurant at the 1st floor. The restaurant is pretty much a self-service one with staff serving only water at your tables – nothing else. 

We started off with Club Kachoris which were crisp, red, thin and tasty. The sabji served along with it was hot, tasty and low on oil – just the way I like it and I went for additional servings of the same. Samosas were good, but definitely not great. Jalebis were not great either as the crispiness was missing. My brother went for the wafer masala dosa which was atleast a foot long, masala served separately along with chutney and sambhar which were overall tasty. I also decided to try their veg grilled sandwich, which was served with chips and too much of cheese. Also, ordered their steamed idly for takeaway. Sandwich, again was good. Post breakfast, we ascended downstairs to satisfy our sweet tooth and ordered a rasmalai and chhena toast. Their rasmalai is perhaps 1 of the best in Kolkata, just vanishes into your stomach the moment you put it into your mouth – just no need of chewing it. However, the chhena toast was a big let down –quite hard, very high on sugar content and somewhat stale.

Prices are not high, ambience is overall fine and service is ok.

Cheers!

Am a fan of haldirams... It my ultimate destination for chaat and anything veg...one visit a fortnight is a norm.

Was en route to airport on 20th at 6.10 pm and felt like a bite.. Saw this old landmark...haldiram prabhuji on the airport road and decided to stop for a papdi chaat..

BIG Mistake!!!
The quality and higene norms are obviously different in all the stores... No one and i repeat no one was using gloves. The person making chaat, the person packing sweets, the person serving kulfi or jalebi...all of the staff were using bare hands.
Made me leave all fresh sweets and just walk out with the packed stuff...

Right from their confections and mithais like soanpapdi, laddoo,pera and kaju barfi to their bhujia,moong dal, pretzels and chanachur, I simply adore every thing about their offerings. For any kind of snacks to entertain guest or just among friends or family, pour out a packetful of authentic crispy aloo bhujia, the smell of farm-fresh potatoes and spices would waft in their air making your mouth water. An all time favorite of mine.

We have taken parcel of pav bhaji, jalebi and ras malai. The food was overly priced and the taste was not up to the mark. A strict no no from my side. A big thumbs down

Haldiram is the place to get the most delectable and yummiest sweets in the world.. If someone visiting in Kolkata then this place has to be at the top of their " To Do List" in Kolkata... I guess the biggest brand of Non Bengali sweets in India.. 
Kaju barfi, kesar pista laddoo many more are hot pick.. The reason being, the awesome aroma of pure ghee laddoo.. I usually buy laddoos from here.. The kaju barfi is an absolute love...!

The foods are usually the same that all the outlets of Haldiram's can provide so nothing new to describe... The food cooked and sweets made are tasty and healthy... Perfect for ocassions.. :)
The only disadvantage is there is lack of sitting arrangement, however due to some space constraint it is not possible for any expansion for sitting arrangement... It is still fine... :)

Very disappointing experience, the worst haldiram's here. The place is under renovation but they have made no effort to make it even slightly comfortable for the customers. There is just one menu pasted on a table top with rates edited in pen. Had gone there with friends and was very disheartened. Cold bhaturas and wierd tasting coconut chutney with the dosa.. i would not recommend this place to anyone..

This Kankurgachi outlet was in one word "Pathetic". Poor quality of food as well as service. Chola Batura, was stale and had excess of salt in it; the bread of Paw Bhaji was burnt and Masala Dosa had 'tiny' amount of aloo-masala stuffed in it. It was really an obnoxious experience for us. This outlet of Haldidam's has aggravated immensely.

Visited there once and it was good experience. Lots of varieties of snacks and sweets to choose from and good South and North Indian snacks. Good in taste and total value for money.
