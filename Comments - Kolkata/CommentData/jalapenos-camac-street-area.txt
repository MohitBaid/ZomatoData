This is a pretty decent place opposite the back side of 22 Camac Street on Wood Street. It's a totally vegetarian restaurant and the food and service is very good. The cheese filled items are a must have!! üëçüëç

This place is like no other! To be absolutely truthful, this is my favourite Italian food joint.

What we like:
1. The taste of the food. It's just amazing!
2. The locality
3. The reasonable pricing

What can be improved:
1. There should definitely be a toilet or at least a wash basin in an restaurant. You won't find either here.
2. The place is almost always full; so there should be some provision of table reservations, which currently isn't there.


I've been to this place multiple times. I'll list down the items which I eat here the most.
1. Family Garlic Bread
2. Nachos
3. Cheese Fondue
4. Sizzling Brownie

Must try:
1. Family Garlic Bread

Tucked in a corner in Wood street, this quaint little cafe is definitely a veggie's paradise. I had this place in mind for quite sometimes. The place was nearly empty when I entered it this evening. I ordered Garlicy mushroom with herb bread. Both quantity and quality of the food was excellent. The mushrooms were soft and well cooked . As the dish melted in my mouth, I mentally made a note of coming back again to taste their other culinary delights.

Wow, went to jalape√±os after 8 long years and still seemed the same though I am not sure if they have renovated. But the service is just the same and it‚Äôs bustling all the way through late evening like always. I was very pleased by the flavours of the Mexican rice and the spicy veg, Agliolio being perfect, but I was disappointed by the pizza. They still don‚Äôt serve thin crusts and authentic ones. Their pizzas are still the same as those found in Corner cafe type joints, I call that the pizza we had in childhood or the 90s. 

Boy, chilli flakes has more of red chilli powder mixed with flakes.. super hot!!!üî•

Above all, content and Happy and lots of old memories flashed back with my best buddies.

This place has been serving fine Italian and Mexican from a long time.
The family garlic bread is melt in the mouth and a cheese lovers delight.
The raviolis was great but a little hard.
The sizzler was regular as you could get in any place.
The sizzling brownie was excellent and melt in the mouth.
The customer service is great and all the items we had were recommended by our server who was very friendly.

I went in and ordered for the most famous stuff, a family garlic bread and some nachos.
The cheese had this particular taste, which made everything taste the same, and not in a good way. The garlic bread was so greasy and buttery, I lost my appetite the second I saw it.
Fell sick shortly after I went home. Terrible experience, not going back there again.

I simply love this place! One of the best places to have vegetarian Italian and Mexican food! I've been there multiple times but have never gotten around to writing a review. I simply love the Italian Sizzler here! One of the best dishes here. The last time I went, we ordered Quesadillas and Lasagne. The Quesadillas were made differently and were good. The lasagne was also baked to perfection! Their drinks are also nice. I've never been able to try their Family Cheese Garlic Bread but I hope to! 

The service is good. Polite servers and the service is usually prompt. It's a small place with a nice ambiance. The place looks nothing like the pictures on Zomato. :P it's quite decent and warm, actually.

The food was pathetic. I ordered for three dishes. And all the three dishes were really awful. Nachos seemed to be stale in taste, roasti was full of oil, the herb sauce and the sauces of nachos were absolutely tasteless. The garlic bread was definitely not up to the mark as made at jalapenos.  So many years of built reputation and food quality of jalapenos, gone down the drain. Atleast I would not waste 1200 bucks or even 100 for that matter from the next time at Jalapenos, also recommend others not to.  I also have a picture to show the oil content but no place to share. I also ordered for two portions of nachos out of which one will go completely untouched to the bin. I would like a refund for this quality of food.

Cheated by the Restaurant

Low standard of service and dishes not prepared as they should be or atleast as they themselves potray it.

I order a Cheese Fondue and only got the cheese and bread crumbs..not the side dish as shown in the picture as encircled. The waiter continue to eavsdrop on our conversation and lack intent to serve-testimony to it is that the glasses were brought to us after repeatedly asking and in installments.

I had arrabiata pasta too which was Okayish and kitkat shake which was Okayish too. The ambience of this place is decent and service is good. But when it comes for value for money this place is total fail. And I'm not planning to visit here again ever.

Ordered Cheese fondue, and Italian Sizzler.
Italian sizzler was too good. We were so full that we didnot want to eat anything more after that. Just had Italian Sizzler. Sizzler was amazing. However, salt was a little less in this sizzler.
This is my favorite place in Kolkata. ‚ù§Ô∏è

A small eatery located on the camac street ( one of the happening areas of Kolkata). Visited this place on a friend's recommendation... literally had to wait for a good 30-35 minutes to get a place. well, such a thing further increases one's curiosity and want of having the food there. 

Not a fancy place or exuberant at first glance, but things are different when you enjoy the amazing food they serve. their all time favorite and a must eat is their Family Garlic Bread. I went along with a friend and we ordered their family garlic bread.. the order arrived in about 20 minutes.. wrapped in a foil.. the cheese was all over, very soft and tasted really good. for 2 people, it was too much.  This can be little sweat and hence to balance out your taste buds (provided there's still some space left in your stomach), you can order other things on their menu. 

Another recommendation was there collection of pastas. We ordered their "Perfect Penne" pasta. Was very well cooked, decent amount of chillies and a good amount of capsicum and tomatoes.¬†

On the hospitality front is where I felt they need to improve. the people are slow and you have to shout-out to convey your requirement (despite being a small eatery). Not an issue as food compensated for that.

Price-wise, I felt it is in the medium range.

Overall, a good dining experience!!

This place is an all time favourite and a visit to this place is incomplete without trying their family garlic bread and nachos. I won't be exaggerating if I say that they're the best in town. Their Lasanga and Jacket potato are also good. Over could give their pizza a miss. This is an iconic restaurant in Kolkata and definitely worth a visit.

The food is amazing no doubt about it.
But there's something known as respect for the customer and being treated genuinely.
The entire restaurant was empty, and my friends ordered a family size garlic bread which obviously filled us to the brim. But the gracious staff felt some ungrateful miscreants(us) were sitting and chilling for no good reason, ignoring the fact that the garlic bread was yet to be completed, and we would place the next order only after the first dish was about to get over. I don't expect respect, but atleast they shouldn't have disrespected us by asking us to change the table, and stare continuously at us till the time we place another order. The height of insulting was peaked when they started cleaning the adjoining tables and we overhead the manager instructing the cleaner that our table should be wiped next. This cannot be tolerated under any circumstances whatsoever. Congratulations, you have successfully spoiled a good reputation in my eyes. Please avoid going here if you want to be treated properly. I would suggest get a home delivery, or have a takeaway.

Some of my relatives recommended this place so I finally went there along with my family and I found the ambience quite average. We ordered cheese fondue, family garlic bread, white and mixed sauce pasta and Mexican rice. I must say the quantity was quite good and the pasta especially I liked. It was quite creamy as I like . I am not a huge fan of garlic bread but the one here was really quite good. And as far as Mexican rice is concerned it was something we regretted ordering I would say. Everything was excellent expect Mexican rice. It was not served hot and I didn't like the taste of it. But overall it was a good experience.

A constant feature on the list of the leaf-eating variety of folks. Jalape√±os has served mexican cuisine (rather an Indianised version) for quite some time now, catering to several top clubs in the city. Many swear by the Original Jalape√±os Nachos and Family Garlic bread that they offer. I like them both too but don't advocate the hype that they have. 

The ambience which is used to be a major minus has been spruced up of late and is now a far more peppy and youthful place to be. The lack of a proper bathroom in the vicinity sticks out like a sore thumb for me.

Coming to what we ordered:

Ginger Ale - The ginger ale was a refreshing change to the canned and syrupy versions that are more prevalent and actually came with slices of ginger. This drink completely reboots your sensory organs and gears you up for the food ahead.

Kit-Kat Shake - This tasted like an ordinary glass of cold coffee and on accosting the server about the lack of any Kit-Kat taste in the drink, he chose to defend it saying he himself had churned two strips of it. Sadly, that wasn't the case according to me.

Original Jalape√±os Nachos - A must have whenever you're dining at jalape√±os. The perfect starter. The tortilla chips are crisp and cooked to perfection. The preparation of the salsa dip and refried beans are the accompaniments that augment the taste and add that extra bit of zing.

Quesadillas - Dissapointed by this dish. Bland and uneventful, the tortilla was grossly undercooked and the fillings fell flat on the taste buds. A complete miss.

Overall, Jalape√±os is a decent place if you'd like to have snacks. Wouldn't recommend it for a proper meal.

It's been 4 years since I left Kolkata and this time when I was here, I decided to go to my school-time fav restaurant Jalape√±os on Wood Street. Although the interiors have changed in the last few years but everything else right from the waiters to the Cheese Fondue remained the same. The menu has been beautifully expanded to include some of the famous dishes from quite a number of cuisines such as Burmese khowsuey, Thai curry with Sticky Rice, Roesti, etc

The ambience is quite simple and regular, not a lavish one but the food just makes me ignore everything else. Penne Alfredo was a delight by itself and I don't really know if any other restaurant in Kolkata serves Cheese Fondue as good as this one ( I specially love the spinach garlicky pockets they serve as a side dish with the Fondue)

When it comes to mocktails, it's a bit disappointing. The menu needs to have right segregation and nomenclature. Strawberry Margarita was not something that I expected. They do not offer a water or soda based litchi drink. Pina Colada was one of the better drinks of all. More options can be added

Jalapenos is one of the very few veg-only places in Kolkata that are a must visit. The place is located on Wood Street, behind Vardaan Market and opposite to Pizza Hut. Their service, ambiance and interiors are all very well done. The staff is courteous enough. Menu wise they have a lot of options to offer to the other wise boring vegetarian meal. In case you visit them, you must have their Garlic bread, Mexican Rice, Cheese Fondues and Risotto Florentine. Their dessert menu is where the management needs to put in more effort.

I visited this place with me and two of my friends after i heard that the garlic bread over here is too die for. But sadly, the merits of this restaurant end at that. Sadly, the food which the menu lists as Mexican is no where close to what the cuisine actually means. While the restaurant can boast of superb service, the quality and quantity of the food was terrible and grossly over-priced.

Nice little place to come and enjoy a vegetarian meal. So we had the cheesy garlic bread, which btw I could eat with anything and evrything. I loved it so much. For mains we had the spaghetti all'olio and the khausey which was better than the pasta. It was refreshing and not overly thick which I liked. Only negative it had way too many vegetables for my liking but then again it was meant to since it was a veg dish. All in all it was average. But will surely go back for the garlic bread :)

If I had to describe the cuisine of this place in one word, I would say - 'Cheesy!!!' This place is a cheese lover's paradise. However, a word of caution: too much cheese can be very cloying and make you feel heavy. Order something tangy to eat or some soda to drink with your food. It cuts the heaviness of the cheese.¬†

Some must haves are the Family Garlic Bread, the Cheese Fondue and the Herb Roesti.
                    

Just so you know, the fondue comes only with bread as the thing to dip. There no vegetables or other items.

The place serves veg mexican cuisine..went there with a group of friends..the decor is simoly done. The seats are comfortable‚Äã..have to say, the service is very prompt and the staff is also nice..they know thier stuff well.. we ordered their specialty‚Äã garlic bread..
It was a treat in itself.. the bread melts in the mouth..
For the main course, we ordered‚Äã lasagna, which was also nicely done..not the best of lasagna that i had, but also not bad.. virgin mojito was okiesh and their blossom was very nice.. overall, a fine place to have cheesy stuff..

I take¬† pride in being a¬† hardcore carnivore. I love my meats and vegetarian food isn't something that I seldom eat. But this place has succeeded in making my palate sway to the vegetarian side and appreciate it.

Located being Camac Street Pantaloons, this place is not hard to spot. The inner decor is simple and the seating arrangements comfortable. Nothing too fancy there to spot.

We ordered the following-|
Nachos- Now I had heard a lot about the nachos served here so it was the first item I ordered. I have to say I was not as impressed as I thought I'd be with it. It was a standard plate of Nachos you get at most cafes without anything unique to it. Regardless, it was tasty. 
Spinach Canelloni- I had always wanted to try stuffed pasta and didn't waste time deciding which one I wanted to get from the choices. The taste itself was good and there was a very generous amount of cheese. My only issue would be with the portioning of the dish. I would have liked smaller but a bit larger in number stuffed pasta rolls instead of a huge one which was difficult to divide among the people.
Mexican rice- Cooking rice in gravy is always risky cause there is an issue about texture. But this did not disappoint. The gravy was delicious and the vegetables in the¬† dish were generous and so was the texture of the rice. No complains with this one. 
Cheese Fondue- What can go wrong with dipping breads in melted cheese sauce and having it. It was absolutely delicious and nothing could go wrong with this. 
Garlic Bread- Perhaps the best garlic bread I have ever had. Baked to perfection in cheesy goodness. Nothing can go wrong with this recipe. Definitely the dish of the day for me. 

Unfortunately we had no room for desserts after this. Will definitely visit again.

Recently visited this Mexican food joint with some kids who were keen on digging into the cheesy jalape√±o nachos and cheese fondue . We were seriously disappointed by the serving portions and a average taste of the nacho platter. The service was prompt and diligent but the food here is nothing to write home about . The quesadillas are fried and not grilled as they traditionally should be. Located in a prime spot ,they need to rework some magic in their menu to keep it going

After a lot of good reviews from trustable sources, finally visited this place yesterday with a friend of mine. Had a bit of difficulty in finding the exact area though. It's near camac street Pantaloons. The food over here is delicious. People who love to eat nonveg should at least visit here once and I can vouche they will choose to come here time and again. We ordered garlic bread and baked Mexican rice. Loved both the dishes to bits. The staff were courteous and cordial. A must visit place for all foodies.

Ambience: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5
Affordability: 3.5/5

The ambience was decent, nothing so special about it, though the crowd here does give a college vibe. The service was a bit sloppy.
Cuisines that i personally liked were
1) Jalapeno broth is a must try.
2) Garlic Bread was good too.
3) You could skip their nachos recommendation, doesnt taste up to the expectation. (See what i did there? :P )
4) Quesidilas were decent, so was the baked mexican rice/risotto.
Overall the food was above average, decent to hangout with friends after college.
Although this place serves vegetarian Mexican cuisine only, so people looking to dig into non-veg, you could rather give this a skip.

I didn't find such flavors in any of the restaurants in Bangalore. 

I love their 
Family Garlic bread
Veg Risotto

This is like one of those street food cart that do not have branches.

When I crave for Italian, there is no other place in the City that comes to my mind other than Jalape√±os. 
This place is the best for Italian and Sizzlers.
Though I kind off have a fixed menu whenever I am at this place because a lot of times when I am hungry, I can't risk my tounge taste. 
So it goes like this-
Starters- Supreme Nachos(probably the best Nachos)
Pasta- Pasta Al Fungi (perfectly boiled and tossed in White Sauce)
Sizzler- Italian Sizzler(This place has many other varieties, you may choose as per your taste)
Garlic Bread- *FAMILY GARLIC BREAD* Yes. read that again. Its not the normal 3 piece Garlic Bread that we get everywhere. It's overloaded with cheese. The best~est Garlic Bread ever I had and I think I will ever have.

This place deserves a 5star because it has never disappointed my taste. Thank You jalape√±os:)

I've never understood the concept behind vegetarianism and I don't think I ever will. Don't get me wrong, I love my vegetables and I live for well made salads, but I've always thought that there's nothing that meat couldn't make better.

Jalapenos on Camac Street is where I met my match. I've had a few amazing pastas in my time, and no amount of cheese has ever made me go "too much". Here, at Jalapenos, the wholesomeness of good vegetarian food meets the sensibilities of good cooking. The restaurant looks very nice, perfect for lunch. The waiters are polite and fast and you'll never have a problem. The seating isn't consistent, but comfortable nevertheless. Well decorated, well made.

The food is surprising. I expected very little, and perhaps is the reason why I loved this place so much. Their pastas are alright, I've had better. What made my meal was the Family Garlic Bread. Nothing is better, nothing will ever be greater. I could quite readily substitute a good steak with this bread for dinner. Garlic, butter, herbs and bread are a winning combination, wherever you're from. All in all, great food and great service.

Jalapenos is just mind blowing. The Italian and Mexican dishes leave you craving for more. My personal favorites are the Pasta N pasta, Roesti in white sauce, Ravioli, Mexican rice, crepes corn carnae, mushrooms and I could go on and on (the list isn't exhaustive). The garlic bread is the best, and the only place it loses points are the pizzas, and the chocolate brownie shake (which best be cut off from the menu if they can't improve it). That said, try this place out yourself. You'll probably want another visit.

Jalapenos is a small eatery located in wood street in the building bang opposite to Pizza Hut in the westside/pantaloons compound. I've been visiting this eatery for years now and have been so frequent here that the servers now know me by face and I don't even have to order food, they know what to get and get it as soon as I enter.I'll list down my regular order here:

Supreme Nachos - These Nachos have a great taste and feel, they're cheesy and the salsa and toppings are just perfect.

Raviolli in butter herb sauce - Trust me, this has been the absolute best raviolli for me in this city, I absolutely adore the taste and how its made in Jalapenos.

Roesti in Creme herb sauce - The roesti is perfectly made and is crispy on the outside while being soft on the inside, the creme herb sauce is creamy and cheesy just as it is intended to be.¬†

I know you're wondering how the famous family garlic bread didn't make it into my regulars, but, at the risk of being ostracized, I would say I find it too greasy for my taste.

The service is great and I've never faced any issues on that front.

I went there with my friends for dinner. The ambience there was good but the food quality there has gone down to a great extent. The only thing that was good was the garlic bread as usual. Mexican sizzler was actually not a Mexican sizzler but something different  which we couldn't identify. I would expect the qualtiy of food to get better and not worse.

Well I was planning to visit this eatery from a longtime and at last I end up visiting last week. Located near the back end of Pantaloons Camac street this place won't give you a great feeling through its appearance as I find it less spacious and little dull decor. I ordered garlic bread ( apparently the best dish) , Italian sizzler and a cold coffee with brownie. The garlic bread is a 5 star plus  dish and if you are a cheese lover you might end up eating the whole plate of garlic bread as it is filled and stuffed with cheese. The sizzler was very filling and it had a base of potato which made it more interesting though I dint find the coffee that great. I would recommend everyone to visit this outlet just for that garlic bread and trust me guys if you don't like garlic bread then you would fall in love with it.

For those who are familiar with Jalape√±os know that this restaurant doesn't really need a review. A paradise for Vegetarians, Jalape√±os has never disappointed me. I've tried a lot of dishes on their menu and these dishes remain my all time favourite:
1. Stuffed mushrooms - if youre a mushroom lover trust me it doesn't get better than this. 
2. Supreme Nachos always a classic. 
3. Mexican Rice with curry or with potato bake! 
4. Family Garlic Bread or even the one with the mushroom sauce is to die for. 
5. Pita pockets 

I've given them a 4.5 because I don't like their pizzas. I wouldn't recommend it. Recently I tried the Rice with Sauteed vegetables and a sauce it was yummy! 
The service is great and the staff is also very friendly. 
I live quite close by and they used to do free home delivery even before swiggy. Their pastas are also quite good. Jalape√±os will always remain one of my top 10 go to places in Kolkata. They never disappoint!

Some old places are still the same there has been slight deteoration in the food quality but still its hands licking food. The worst thing in a restuarant I find is when the cleaning staff do not bother about the left overs and throw all of the stuff on floor while cleaning the table making resturant look more like a fish market.Probably I would have rated this resturant 4 for the food or probably 4.5 but throwing left overs like this  makes it nasty.

Have been coming to this place since time immemorial!this place was the first to introduce kolkata to Mexican food and still lives up to its name.  They have never compromised on their quality and every time you visit you get top notch taste and friendly service.  My personal favourites are
 Garlic breads, supreme nachos(handmade nachos), enchiladas, Mexican rice. Their newly introduced platters are also worth a try. For the non veg lovers the only drawback I can imagine is that it's a pure veg restaurant.  Apart from that it is second home to me!

The supreme Nachos, thai curry, satellite sizzler, basil drink, ravioli in two sauces are standard and can be tried with out getting disappointed. 
The servers make excellent reccommendations ...listen to them as they know what is most fresh and best is they listen to you and make food just how u like it!

But the let down for me was chimichanga....the mexican rice had nothing to do with the dips or the tacos served alomg with it. Except for the pretty plating of the food, there was nothing that would attract me to. The green apple martini was good except for that excessive use of flavoured jelly put into the drink. Overall an ok experience

Located just opposite of the pantaloons mall and beside aqua java.
Well no complains at all about the food. One should definitely be trying out the family garlic bread and cheese balls.
Well surely coming back to this place soon.üëçüëç

From the very first sight the place is not very big...but the service is quick...it is a veg restaurants....u have to visit this place more than once to try all their dishes...we ordered cheese fondue which was nice...then we ordered family garlic bread (8 pieces) which was served cold instead of hot...but the item which we liked was the italian sizzler(pasta prefered over rice)...then we had mojito which was good...and at last we had sizzling brownie as dessert which was very good...the ambience was nice...we were a bunch of four so we got the seat quickly...overall a big plus for this outlet!

Located at camac street , this place is a little hard to locate. If you aren't good with roads here's a small tip. Get down at pantaloons, if you get down at the front entrance walk to the other side of the mall, cross the road you'd find wow momo. Beside that is a white buildings, move into it you'd find jalapenos. This isn't a very fancy restaurant, just a basic restaurant. The interiors are very basic and the place is too small and stuffy. A tip would be to avoid it on weekends because of the rush. I remember waiting for an hour. The service is slow and tardy. 
Coming to the food, the restaurant serves Italian, Mexican and a little amount of Lebanese and continental.

You can try
Nachos supreme- lip smacking, you'd love the dips

Stuffed mushrooms - Tasted okay, is a very popular choice though.

Garlic bread - try the family garlic bread if you love strong flavours
If not go for the regular 3 PC garlic bread

Bruschetta- Tasted just right.

Pizza- Give it a miss.

Tri colour pasta - was served cold, disappointing.

Pasta and pasta is a must try.

The various rice and Mexican curries - only recommended to people who love their curries spicy .

Lasagne - Very regular, nothing special. Go for it if you can't decide on anything else

Enchiladas - Had the right flavours and is a must try 

Fondue- Just like the regular fondue. Is a must try for people who are trying it for the first time.

Brownie - Filled with rich flavours. Brownie lovers rejoice

Mexican and Italian sizzlers - sizzling hot and totally worth a try.

You can also try the khowsuey, roesti and chimichanga.

Jalape√±os has been my go to place for over a decade whenever the slumbering cheesy vegeterian in me would rise and shine. The flavours continue to be consistent and the variety, impressive. Dig into the stuffed mushrooms, potato rosti, garlic bread for starters. For Main course, give the pizza and pasta a miss and try the combos of curries with Mexican rice. Recently the potato rosti with mushroom sauce, an all time favourite was a bit of a let down. To cater to an always waiting audience, they are in a bit of a hurry, so dishes tend to get a bit greasy, soups a bit salty, perhaps a bit too spicy to impress? A little more attention and care to detail and I would be going back to jalape√±os more often. Look and feel of the place is quite basic, but the food will compensate. Till then, say cheese at jalape√±os!

JALAPENOS- The name brings back memories from high school days. They started with a really small joint in the lane where Jyoti vihar is located in 2001 or 2002( circa) . They were a 8-10 seater back then. Now of course they are much bigger in terms of size & operation having counters at CSC & COSMOPOLITAN Club too. Their current address is backside of Westside on camac st which should be a 70-80 seater and runs almost packed even on weekdays.

If you are looking for an authentic Mexican joint then avoid this place. Their menu has myriad options from different cuisines and its mainly the non-mexican dishes which are more popular.

A list of items to try:

1.	Nachos:  Their salsa dip and kidney beans dip are always good. However the cheese used on the nacho chips clearly are of the industrial variety and taste synthetic and rubbery. Ask them not to put cheese. 

2.	Jalapeno broth:  nice, tangy, spicy , light soup, if you are a soup lover.

3.	Ginger basil Mojito: A very well made drink, must try.

4.	Roesti : you can try, but its oily most of the time. Again avoid the white sauce.

5.	Garlic bread: they have 3-4 kinds, try family if you like heavy,greasy stuff otherwise opt for a regular (3pcs). 

6.	Sizzlers: Mexican, Italian &  satellite ‚Äì All 3 are very good with different preparations. Take your pick.

7.	Stuffed mushrooms:  crisp, deep fried, stuffed mushrooms. Decent.

8.	Khow suey-  its very good. A must try.

9.	Pizzas- are not that great, you can skip.

10.	 Rice dishes: you can ask the waiter to surprise you, quite a few items not on the menu but made to order.

11.	 Tutti fruitti- they make it very well with fresh fruits.

12.	 Sizzling brownie- I am over saturated with this dessert but for brownie lovers please go ahead.

Billing- They are reasonably priced, 4- 500 per head even if you eat like a glutton.

Conclusion- this is a very good family restaurant with some great food. Their d√©cor and ambience is pleasing and comfortable. Their menu is more of a fusion and people going with an authentic Mexican food mindset will be disappointed. The main problem is their use of industrial /synthetic variety of cheese in almost all their white sauce /cheese based dishes which is quite disappointing for a joint of their stature. They dishes are not cheap, then why compromise on quality?  Strangely people regularly eating there do not realize it either. Copious use of oil is another problem. These issues can be addressed by asking the waiter beforehand to be careful and asking him to put processed AMUL cheese only . Other than that its still a favourite haunt for people of all age groups. The pure vegetarian tag helps further.

p.s ¬†Avoid their CSC counter, food quality is quite inferior.

Situated beside wow momo in wood Street, opposite of pizza hut, this vegetarian restaurant is pleasure to visit. Nice and comfortable ambience, it's a place if you want to satisfy your vegetarian appetite. Their family garlic bread is a must try! Exotic satay is also a very good dish with large portion of rice and cajun saut√©ed vegetables. Even though been a hardcore non vegetarian, I would recommend this place if you wanna give a chance to veggies. Try it out. You won't be disappointed.

The family garlic bread is a must try, but make sure that there are enough people to dig in, because that's a very filling dish. Speaking of the interiors, all very basically done, gives you a rustic feel, on an all, its fine, but when you order 3-4 dishes, say lasagna, you will start feeling that everything has more or less the same filling, only the presentation being different, so thats a turn off. Coz the lasagna that we ordered had no pasta sheets and all kinds of veggies simply baked with cheese.

Was here on a friendly date last night, with someone who is an even bigger foodie than me.
Took us a while to locate this place, it's in a corner behind Pantaloons, near Wow Momo.

I must say the place took me by surprise. Ambiance, superb. Service, fast. AND the best part, the Italian and Continental food!!

I pat myself on the back for choosing this place, and my friend for ordering the right dishes. We ordered a Chimichanga (chef recommendations) and a Enchiladas (mushroom and cheese). Enchiladas was out of this world. It had Michelin class written all over it.
The place is perfect for a date, for friendly get togethers, for family time and even for a business dinner! You would really impress any business client here, maybe not with the ambiance but definitely with the Enchiladas.

We only tried these two and we were almost full. The value for money is spot on. Realistic cost for two people would be 800-1000.¬† I am 100% sure I will be there again to try out other dishes on the menu.!!

I generally avoid pure vegetarian restaurants (I'm a chicken lover), but after hearing so much about it, I had to check this one out! The result is I am quite impressed and I would love a re-visit.¬†
Food - 4.5/5 We tried the family garlic bread and the nachos and loved every single piece!¬†

Service - 4/5 The service was decent.

Ambiance - 3.5/5 It was over-crowded when I visited, which served as a little bit of a dampener.¬†

Overall, I would give it a 7.5/10.

Visited the place very recently. The d√©cor is very pleasing to the eyes, the staff is courteous. We ordered a Supreme Nachos and the heard-so-much-about Family Garlic Bread. The nachos were good, served with salsa, kidney beans and a dip. They're enough for two people. The garlic bread is extremely buttery and the garlic is overwhelming; the bread was very soggy and honestly, I'm not a fan of that. Only if your taste buds are strong enough for that kind of food, you may give it a try. I'm a little skeptical on another visit to try other items on the menu.
I would also say it's a little overpriced for the quality of food they're serving, especially given that it's all vegetarian.
A thumbs up for the effort :)

Anyways, I went there to get it parcelled just that item...they place looked fine...it was a weekend so the place was packed...would like to dine there someday soon...
Well, coming back to the garlic, it was worth all the hype...its not like any normal garlic bread...u get the whole thing wrapped in a foil paper...when u open it u'd find cheese ozing out of it....it was too cheesy and too delicious...
Definitely going there again to try out more stuff...

I was there for dinner last night with a bunch of friends. Being a non vegetarian, it was the first time I was visiting this place although its been around forever. They only serve vegetarian food only.¬†

We called for a lot of dishes most of which were quite average. I thought the mediterranean rice was good and the cheese fondue was average. However, the pizza and stuffed mushrooms were an absolute disaster. The pizza tasted of bread and cheese with no sauce and the stuffed mushrooms and oil inside which filled my mouth when I took my first bite. The sizzling brownie was decent but then you can get the same thing at cafe coffee day at a lesser price.¬†

Our fondue bread got over and we called for a second helping. However the second helping of the bread was burnt. What was surprising was that its so visible when you burn bread but the chefs never took note of that and served it nonetheless. All in all a dissapointing experience. There is better and similar food on offer at quite a few outlets around town.

Went there after hearing about the place for 8 months from my wife (ex-fiancee). Ordered a family garlic bread which she said is the speciality. Along with a Virgin mohito and one watermelon mohito. The garlic bread was close to being perfect - if only they had toasted the bread a little more - coz it felt a bit soggy and not so crispy. The mohitos were nicely done, although would appreciate of they had used fresh watermelon juice instead of the essence/canned juice.

The onion rings however were quite the dampener, nowhere close to good.

The place is neatly decorated giving a comfortable and bright feel.

Would go here to try more dishes as the menu is quite comprehensive. Taking away 2 stars for the onion ring and not so crispy bread.

Revisited Jalapenos after a really really long time...the decor is slightly changed. But the food remains the same as good as before. They serve an excellent variety of delicious vegetarian food. I was happy with my experience here though there were some glitches. The service too was very good. We were a group of 8 so we ordered the family garlic bread and it was just awesome.(the best garlic bread I've had )But the soup which I had was lacking and not up to the mark (minestrone soup). Though the other soups ordered by my friends were good. They ordered jalape√±o broth and cream of mushroom...both were good.(warm and comforting). We also had Nachos,Tacos and Mexican rice. Nachos and Tacos were both exceptional....cheesy,great salsa,sour cream and fresh veggies in the Tacos. Lovely. But the Mexican rice was way too salty and would have spoilt our experience here but for the waiter who on being informed  about the excess salt immediately offered to replace it. Kudos to the management who give importance to the customers' complaints and act to salvage the situation. The replacement Mexican rice was perfect and very tasty. We had a good experience here and in spite of the glitches we all left the restaurant with smiles on our faces. :)

The menu is vegetarian but is an interesting mix of Italian and Mexican- you will always find something new being added every so often.¬†
The decor is tastefully done using balanced, calming colors that resembles a Tuscan cafe with waiters and a kitchen that are super fast.¬†
Rates here are reasonable and there is something for all budgets, with card payment too
What I would recommend is the mushroom pasta, Californian confettti pizza and the cheese corn puffs. The Mexican baked rice is spicy and designed for those who can handle it!!!!
You will have to reserve seats ahead if you're visiting this place on weekends.

A veggie lover's Shangri-La; a meat gobbler's adventureland.As a meat afficionado, eating out at this olace was a refreshing change for my tastebuds.Onramented with wooden furniture, this place has an earthly aura. Waiters are prompt, service is quick.Ordered Baked Supreme and Mexican Sizzler.The Baked Supreme tasted precisely like a vegan version of Mocambo's Chicken Supreme.The mushy combination of gooey cheese, sweetcorn and spinach tasted delightful.Next up, the Mexican Sizzler was very tangy and flavoursome.The fusion of three bean salad,spicy mexican rice, and rich baked potato was dandy; the only glitch was the bland taste of the chimichangs.
All-embracing, this place is worth a visit, specially if you are craving for some ecstatic cheesy dishes.

I don't live in Kolkata anymore but have made it a point to visit Jalapenos even if I visit for only 2 days. This time I was sorely disappointed.  The place was empty and run down when I entered and the staff was extremely unpleasant. Despite most of the tables being unoccupied and the time being past 2.30pm when lunch crowd would've slowed down anyway, the staff insisted that we could only sit on the only table for two that was unoccupied, sandwiched between two already full tables. We said we didn't want to eat like this when clearly so many other better situated albeit larger tables were empty.    They didn't seem to care, so we left, and the staff didn't make any effort to reach an understanding. Never going back there. Sad to see one of my favourites crossed off the list!

Jalapenos is a popular place and known for their pastas. Since for a change 

we had some time left, we decided to come here for lunch. 

Parking - Took a cab, so no clue about parking facilities. 

First Impresion - It was a weekday and the place was more or less full, only 

1-2 tables were empty. 

Ambiance - Decor is nise and cosy with wooden chairs and tables. Though the 

table we had was right besides their mini-kitchen where the make the 

mocktails, so not the best table. 

Service - Friendly and fast. 

Food - What we had - 

Cheese and Herbs Rosti - Simply wow! This is the best Rosti we ever had. 

Simply delicious! 

Mexican Sizzler - Looked promising, but overall turned out to be bland and 

not very good. 

Orange Blossom - More ice-cream and less orange. The ratio was messed up.

Fresh Lime - Good. 

Total Bill - Rs. 952, didnt find worth this cost. 

Unlikely to repeat in general. May be for Rosti alone.

This restaurant serves the best Italian food in town :) I've been here quite a few times now, and every single time they live upto my expectation. I try to order different whenever I'm here. So on my last visit following items were  ordered:
Cheese balls ->Absolutely great. A must try. And the chutney that they give along with it is also nice. 
Lasagne - > nice. Could have been better. 
Supreme Nachos - > Nothing so supreme. Served with rajma, tangy salsa sauce and sweet cheese dip. Tasted fine. 
Garlic bread - > Nothing beats garlic bread stick of Dominos. But I'll recommend all cheese lovers to try it as they add generous amount of cheese making it soooo yummy üôå
Oven roasted Garlic Capsicum Pizza - > topping wasn't that nice. I tried Jalape√±o and californian pizza the other time. They were way better. 
Strawberry shake and apple mojito also tasted good.

3 times. Had to call them thrice in a week to get my order. The first time they outright rejected my order, causing my money to get debited. On all three occasions, the manager kept telling me that he had no staff to deliver, at times as early as 7. I honestly feel like they could be more professional in this aspect. Putting up the 'Order Online on Zomato' isn't just for show, it needs to be backed up the same level of commitment. They need to seriously improve in this department. 
But all my grievances disappeared when the food arrived. The Family Garlic  Bread is a must have, even if you're a sole diner with a small appetite. The Quesidillas were amazing, topped up with their bean and salsa sauce. And the pizza was a refreshing change in comparison to the meaty and doughy Domino's pizza. 
Never once do you end up craving meat, because they pull off amazing food without any meaty supplements. It's a brilliant joint at unbelievably low prices, and a wide variety of amazing food.

Don't underestimate it because of its "serves veg-only" policy. Its an Italian-Mexican fusion restaurant both the cuisines being my favourite. It has always been very crowded which is a good sign. The risotto and ravioli is simply amazing. The stuffed mushrooms is a must try. The ambience is okay (a bit noisy sometimes). The service is good. Do visit it if you love Italian cuisine.

Wanted to visit this place for quite sometime now. Finally paid a visit this Saturday. Place is small yet cozy. We ordered:
* Supreme Nachos
* Potato Wedges with Salsa
* Garlic Bread
* Sizzling Brownie

Food was good especially the brownies and the attending waiter was friendly and helpful.

I personally found the garlic bread a bit dry. But the sizzling chocolate brownie here is just off the charts. This place served the best sizzling chocolate brownie I ever had.

I will not say this place has a niche Italian cuisine... But imagine a day when you would like to visit a nice place and are bored of boring daal roti sabzi and without being harsh  on your pocket... This is the place to be... Since I had gone with a friend who was a regular there (we got some complementary quesidillas) which were really good... The cheese fondue was a bit disappointing... But I really liked the pasta...  I would definitely visit again for trying out some new dishes!!

A small buy comfortable space to enjoy as a couple, with friends or family....  This used to be one of the best outlets with the quality of the food and very pocket friendly prices but sadly on my visit a couple days back they have increased their prices almost 75% which is a bit let down but their food still tops it's off...  My recommendation: family cheese garlic bread, cheese fondue, sizzlers, Italian baked rice, cream of vegetable.

The best of its kind Lebanese and continental food. Its heaven for cheese lovers and vegetarians. I've been there more than 4-5 times and every time I'm there the food gets more cheesier and tastier. I personally loved those family garlic bread, roseti with creme mushroom/creme herb sauce (Personal favourite), supreme nachos which is served with salsa and dips. The cheese fondue is something unique and highly recommended. The Mexican baked rice was the thing which I hated... it had a blank and moist taste. The service is fine, its usually overcrowded on weekends and it has really good food.

Visited about a couple of days back with friends. Liked the ambience very much especially the wall arts. Coming to food we had Supreme Nachos, Risotto Florentine and Veg Lasagne. Risotto was alright but the best were the dips which came with the nachos. Have never tasted better. Also its a delight for the vegan people starting with the lasagne. I have had all sorts of meat filled lasagne, but never knew veg lasagne would taste this good. Its a must go for all. Only one point for the management that the shop location is bit misplaced in the Google Maps, hope its fixed. Hoping to visit again soon.

A nice little place opposite pantaloons camac street. The interiors are done very simply, comfortable seating. I have been going there for quite some time now. My last visit compells me to say that the quality has gone down a little, still, I love this place. Used to love their family cheese garlic bread,however the latest experience was disappointing. We ordered for a lasagna this time, whic was pretty good, though it wasn't baked properly. The presence of too many exotic vegetables sauted in arabiatta sauce made the dish quite exotic. 
The game changer here would be the green apple mojito, it was amazing. So refreshing, chilled and flavorful. Complimented the food so well. Another drink we ordered was an orange based drink which was refreshing as well. However it was a little bitter in taste, because of the orange zest in it. Orange zest is supposed to be used in moderation, once you take care of that, the drink attains next level.
A word for the management- the waiters should be more trained and attentive. While taking the orders, they don't seem interested. We are not some guests who visit your place uninvited, we pay for the food and expect a welcoming attitude. Once we are halfway through our food they kind of wait for us to leave. No offense, please take care of this issue.
Recommended!

Family garlic bread is the dish you should visit the place for. Even the thoughts of it can bring the taste in your mouth. Pasta is even good. Should give more options in drinks. Complete gossip place. A simple sober and homelike ambience. Wanna have garlic bread then go for the place and don't think other place.

Being a hard core non-vegetarian, I can vouch for this place as they serve awesome vegetarian fare. A simple place with a minimalistic decor, it is a good option when you are in the mood for Mexican or Italian food. 

My usual order here is a plate of Supreme Nachos and half a plate of Garlic Bread. The Nachos are light and a bit different. Lots of cheese and jalapenos and the three dips make it lipsmacking. They make the best Garlic Bread in town. Soft and toasted, each piece of bread comes with a generous layer of cheese. Other dishes I have tried here are the Cheese Balls and the Mexican and Italian Sizzlers. The Cheese Balls are good, and the Sizzlers are decent enough.

A good place for catching up with friends over a meal. The only disadvantage of Jalapenos is that they dont have a washroom.

Jalapenos has a friendly ambience. We were a group of around 15 people so had ordered a lot of dishes. I had good expectations from this place because of its rating, review and recommendations but I was highly dissatisfied. Jalapenos is known for its tempting family garlic bread and so it was, no complaints but apart from that there was no single dish which I can recommend. Its pastas(both in red & white sauce)¬†were horrible, so was the Mexican sizzler and risotto. Fondue was okayish, can be tried. For deserts we had ordered sizzling brownie and tutti fruity ,both of which could have been better. The service was also very slow. Overall not so good experience.

Their cheesy family garlic bread is really cheesy..

Food here is above par. Place is having a quite atmosphere and ambiance is even very good. If you ask me what would I like to have here, without a second thought I would say family size chessey garlic bread for starters and choco wrap for the dessert. Do try these they are yummy :p

The food is quite wonderful! The dips that came with the nachos were a delight.

The service however has a lot of scope for improvement. They must take care of basic things like serving water when guests come in; giving a seat to a pregnant woman to sit; coming to the table when they are called, instead of hanging around at a distance and deliberately avoiding eye-contact and giving enough cutlery on the table instead of 2 spoons for 4 people. The drinks too were only average. 

The place is quite clean and well lit. Overall was an enjoyable experience. Will go places if they improve on customer service.

I went to this place to celebrate my birthday. Food was amazing. Interior decoration was even very nice :)
I had bruschetta and italian sizzler. Both were too cheesy and taste was amazing. All who loves mexican food should visit this place.

The place is small so we had to wait for about 45 mins. Well the waiting was worth it. Amazing food :) We ordered a family garlic bread which is just out of the world. One must try pasta also. Overall experience was 9/10.

Went there for a late lunch with 2 friends on a monsoon evening... The roads were badly waterlogged but still my friend insisted on having lunch here only. We ordered 3 items and the food was delivered before the menu card was even taken back. The environment of the place is very cool due to fresh interiors...the feel quite young. The food is mouthwatering and because of quick service it saves a lot of time. Personal fav : nachos and watermelon margarita!

This is one the best restaurants in the city i have been to, rather i would say i used to be a regular customer till i was in that city. The food they serve is really awesome and my favorites are supreme nachos, supreme pasta, Italian sizzler and perfect penne, babycorn...other dishes as jacket potato, garlic bread , green apple mocktail all are good. I would rather say u order anything from the menu and it would taste yumilicious at a reasonable price.

If Italian's on your mind, it's gotta be jalape√±os. The aroma of food served inside will make you crazy just as you enter. Tricolour pasta is the thing one must try here.
You should probably get reservation if you are probably going here on weekend. Popularity of this place is unimaginable considering it's locale.
But still it's the best place for Italian in park street considering the taste and rates.

We heard lots of jalape√±o. So, i went there with my friends at evening around 8.30 there iwas a waiting going on ,the person told us to wait for half an hour. At last we got the table we order food, looking at the food was  tasty but so horrible food we found hair on the food we called the waiter no reply, I think They don't bother us as a customer satisfaction. Sorry what I dream it was wrong we ask for Bill went. I will never go in a unhygienic restaurant where back area staff doesn't have proper uniform, sorry a small pant and a Innerware jangi, it was totally  bad experience I had, sorry I will never recommend any one to go there.I think beside restaurant r far better than jalape√±o.

This place has the best cheese garlic bread I have ever had till date. The thick cheese melts with the strong flavour of garlic in the mouth feels heaven. Nachos served is also amazing. Last had been here a long time back since I do not live in Kolkata. But this is a place on must definitely try out.

Located in camac street inside the lane beside aqua java, a pure veggie eatery. Pretty ordinary entrance, but the decor inside and the sitting arrangement is ideal for a relaxing chat.
Now food, Good! Yess as zomato says , the family garlic bread is meant to die for. Exotic bread lathered in thick cheese and the perfect amount of garlic. Yummy!!
Supreme Nachos is average because it is over priced. Nachos with cheese topping and three kinds of dips.
Though bit overpriced.. A nice evening place for veggies...

The food was good and so was the ambiance. For the food the rating would be 8.5/10. But the reason of giving one is because of their pricing. I had ordered Thumbs up which was of Rs.50 in their menu and they got me a can of Thumbs up which had an mrp of Rs.30.and on receiving the bill I found that the Thumbs up was charged at rs.70+ taxes extra on asking about it the waiters had no clue and the cashier told me that Jo system mein hai wahi lagega.Pricing more than twice for a product is going to do no good to you guys it'll only ruin your Goodwill. Keep that in mind.Every eatary charges extra for cold drinks but more than double is too much.Pathetic!!!

I have been to this place many times..
It my favourite fr italian..I have tasted almost each and every dish..
The mexican baked rice and mix sauce pasta is the best..
I also ordered recently patato wedges which was quiet satisfactory...
They have started a new different menu for drinks which has lots of options in which ibtried green apple mohjito and strawberry marghirita which was quiet refreshing but one thing is dat the quantity is quiet less as it is filled with ice and the glass is too small to satisfy a single drinker..
The service is quiet fine and dey r quiet knowledgeable about their menu.
So it is a must visit for italian lovers..

The food it too costly. I love some of the dishes i have tried, but equally some have gone bad too. Like Burrito is supposed to be sandwich style - they made lasagna style out of it. Cheese lovers will dig in to their garlic bread. Almost all their preps have lots of cheese.
Pure vegetarians have very less choice in Kolkata, so for them this is a must try!

Not that great. We went out for a birthday date and had a tacos as starters. It was very expensive and the taste was not unique as such. (Taco bell is much much better and cheaper) we ordered a rice bowl which had unpolished rice with a gravy. It was not so tasty. Overall, it was a so-so experience.

Went there for lunch today. The place is small but done up well with a woody and asbestos decor and antique furniture. The food there is to die for quite literally coz of the cheese content!! Its absolutely unhealthy but who cares .. Once in a while you are allowed to hogg. First up was the family garlic bread which was a cheesy delight. Very different from any garlic bread i have ever eaten and absolutely lip smacking. We then ordered the jalapeno special pizza which tasted fine and had a nice thin crust. We rounded off with special enchidilas which was served warm full of beans veggies cheese and paneer. Tasted great as well. Overall very happy with the indulgence.

A small place. More of a fast food kind with some great options to choose from. 

Love their garlic bread with cheese in the roll format - a very different and must try dish (if your not conscious about the cheese n butter). 

Some fantastic classic nachos. 

Would have given the place a 5 if it had some lounge music to cut the noise and an air conditioning unit that works. Food - 5 on 5.

Well.. There's nothing much good I can say about the place except maybe the fact that they have a TV over there which is good for viewing the IPL.If you still insist on going then I would suggest you try the fajitas they serve,as they are edible and you won't feel so bad about the meal. Their nachos,the one ray of hope I was clinging to also turned out to be disappointing but I suggest you try them as they're one of the few edible things.If you like living,I suggest that you never ever try the baked tortillas.So the only scenario in which I would recommend this place  would be as a budget-saving 
 lunch/dinner with friends,where you tend to eat light(read:very light)and if so,the fajitas and nachos are the only edible things to order.You may try the Mongolian noodles.[This place works if you are really desperate to watch the IPL and eat some very ordinary food while doing so.]

Heard a lot about the food, tried to order some for home delivery and they managed to really piss me off. 

They refused to tell me what extra amount they will charge for delivery on me asking them multiple times, and in stead asked me to call some third party number to find out. It's only when I demanded to speak to the manager is when he said he'll find out and call me back. It turns out the amount was over 10% of my food bill. 

I don't want to stereotype but this seems such a quintessentially Calcutta style of working, no professionalism whatsoever. Very annoying!

This joint offers a variety of Italian and Mexican cuisine and yes when I say Italian,I mean cheese...lots and lots of cheese.
From what I heard,Cheese Fondue was a "must have"...and I must say I was not disappointed...a tongue pleaser in every aspect. We had crispy chili babycorn and red sauce pasta for starters which were nicely flavoured,but the nachos were a bit bland.Of all the things,my favourite was a simple appetiser,Garlic Bread which was perfectly seasoned and presented in truck load of cheese,will please even the pickiest of eaters.Although the Mexican platter was a big time let down.
Thumbs up-Location,Service,Cheese Fondue, Garlic bread.
Thumbs down-Mexican platter,ambience.
I wouldn't say that the prices are reasonable but they aren't expensive either.A must visit for people who like to cheese-it-up!

The place is great if you know what you are ordering. Definitely try the nachos... They are just great. Avoid family garlic bread if you do not like soggy breads. Order baked garlic bread instead. The sizzlers are great. Do mention to serve food with less spices since they normally put more chilly flakes in their food. Food is as per prices... Economical.

Pure Veg good restaurant which serves Mexican, Italian & Continental food. It's a small restaurant & ambience was also good. They serve tasty foods. My recommendations are Jalape√±o Broth (Soup), it's a bit spicy but yummy soup. Crispy Nachos, Pita Sandwich with Falafel, Pasta Al Fredo with white sauce, Roesti Bar BQ. Cost wise a bit expensive. For 2 people the cost will be around Rs.700 - 900.

Jalape√±os is one of my favourite restaurants which is decently priced and offers a variety of dishes from the Italian and Mexican cuisines!
I love the family garlic bread! Though sadly it comes in a minimum of 6 Portions! :(
The pasta in pink sauce is good too!
However during my last visit i wasn't happy with the pizza where the crust was over baked and spoiled the taste! 
The staff is very warm and can give you correct choices if asked for!
A place I like to visit atleast once in a while for my love for Mexican n Italian cuisine! :)

Its been a while since I've written a review. Having busy with work, and being a foodie translates to - takeaway and office deliveries. Having said that, we ordered lunch from Jalape√±os today. Given a timeline of 40 minutes after I placed an order for 7 people, the person taking the order was kind enough to give me a call when the food was ready at exactly a time after 35 minutes. Service thus is prompt. The Family Garlic Bread should not be given a miss. The flavours truly bring in the best out of you and its not the garlic bread you would have had from a Dominos or Pizza Hut. The Supreme Nachos comes with 3-4 dips of which the salsa and the cheese garlic dips were the best. The Mexican baked rice was also great and cooked properly. I recommend this place for a vegetarian to enjoy Mexican and Italian food. The only reason why I'm rating this place 4.0 is because they do not serve Non-Vegetarian.

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian, I never imagined that vegetarian restaurant can be a good experience for me. But, Jalapenos proved me wrong. I am not only in love with their food, but can also skip a non-veg restaurant to go back to this place. They specialize in Italian and Mexican cuisine. It has a casual d√©cor with sufficient seating arrangement. I have visited this place more than once as it was close to my previous office. 

Every time we would order their family garlic bread. I would recommend this to everyone who visits this place. It‚Äôs soft, cheesy and delicious. The other dish that I love is their lasagne. Apart from this, their risottos and pastas always met expectation. If you wish to have good food with friends, Jalapenos would not disappoint you.

I went Jalape√±os first time last Sunday. Must visit place for ppl loving Italian, Mexican or Thai food. We ordered a Cheese fondue and Jalape√±o broth soup. It was a wholesome meal for 3 of us. On a winter evening, the taste and ambience was just right to make you feel at home.

I have been avoiding this place for ages, simply because it was a pure vegetarian joint. Wrong and how! This place has absolutely the best nachos and salsa so far. Special mention for the salsa: its nothing short of a revelation, you'd get hooked to it. Also ordered the stuffed mushroom, which was another joy, though not great tasting it kept me interested. 
But yea, the pasta ain't good- flat!

GARLIC BREAD :) :D :D
WOW...
the place pretty decent, not at all hard to find.¬†
Ambiance and environment is okayish. Service is pretty decent.
My Order:
1 Family Garlic Bread
1 Satellite Sizzler.
Cheesy Garlic Bread was something that that gave me foodgasm.. :P
Satellite Sizzler was super tasty. Spaghetti with french cutlet and veggies. it was delightful. Though it was more than enough for one person, but somehow i tried finishing it. (Phew)
My verdict:
Food: 4.5/5 (can work on presentation)
service: 4/5
ambiance: 4/5
VFM: 4.5/5

Overall:4.5/5
To Management: keep it up guys :)

It was around four years back when i came here. I cant remember the dishes i had here but i remember having enjoyed the cheesy food here. Anything with oodles of melting or hard or grated cheese is fantastic. Other non-cheese dishes are really not that unique.

A fine place for Italian food ! Service is OK , but then the staff has very weird behavior be it for serving or for taking down orders , food was above average , place doesn't have that good aura , they need improvement on interior and staff! Visit only if you wish to have good food , avoid if better service is required!

I do not share the same experience as my other fellow foodie mates here at Zomato.
Was aiming for Jalapenos for quite a long time now.
Especially after reading all the reviews about their much raved garlic bread.
So, one fine afternoon with the heat beating on us, M (my dear gujju mate) and me hit the road on the quest for some good veggie food.
Gujju was the happiest because he doesn't eat meat. While on the other hand, I was a little perplexed because I am a voracious carnivore.
I had already decided the order from beforehand and so did not waste much time as soon as we entered the joint.
Ambience very casual and minimal decor. Not really spacious.

Order of the day : :

1. Garlic Bread (family size)
2. Pasta AL Fredo
3. Ravioli

Expectations were indeed high and I am disappointed to say that they did not stand up to my expectations. The only thing to write home about was the garlic bread which was very very soft and spongy and has oodles of cheese which made me happy. The taste was spot on and the portions were huge. Damn huge to even carry it back home.

Now, comes the two disappointments.
The pasta when served, looked great. The herbs infused were fine but what it really lacked was proper seasoning. It was bland for my taste and it smelled too much of asafoetida.
That was a big turn off for me. So, we didn't take a second helping.

And the last leaf, was the ravioli that was ordered. It came with a fine gravy and mushrooms which I absolutely loved but one mouthful of the ravioli and I felt like throwing it off my mouth because the spinach inside was so poorly seasoned and felt so raw inside the mouth. All it had were a few chilli flakes that did nothing to change the palate. I could not feel any hint of seasoning inside.

Hence, thoroughly disappointed, I snug closely to my diet coke and garlic bread through this gastronomic journey.

Another heartbreak, the bill was a whooping INR 944/-¬†

I do not see myself coming here again, but if I do, I will only for the garlic bread.

I am non-veg foodie, but I love anything which tastes great, cooked with care and severed with affection. Yes that becomes a Christmas carol kind, anyways you must try their Family Garlic Bread, cheesey heaven, wow! Their pastas and breads are simply done right. Only wish they had a more lavish drink and desert options! And yes its damn cheap, very much value for money!!

A con¬∑nois¬∑seur's delight ¬†for all the veggies who are tired of eating the butter naans and dal makhnis. The USP of this place is the type, quality and quantity of food it offers. The cheese garlic bread is the perfect starter. Rissoto, Mexican baked rice with jacket potato not only expose to beautiful Italian delicacies but allow your taste buds to savoir the joy till the end. The small size sometimes leads to intense queues on Sundays and patience of a hungry stomach is tested. However, calling customer individually on their phones is a nice way to manage crowds. Overall a must go for all veggies of the city of joy

The nachos served was an affront to nachos and the so called garlic bread which is known to be their specialty, is by far the worst garlic bread I have tasted. The place is way too expensive for the quality and quantity of food they serve.

Jalapenos is one of my favourite Italian restaurant. First to make it clear their food is by no means Authentic Italian. Food served here perfectly satisfies Indian Tastes without actually giving up Italian essence. 
Jumping directly to my pick : Family Garlic Bread ???? (don't order any other Garlic Bread it wont have that creamy base) , Mexican Rice, Cheese Balls (the sauce is much tastier) also don't forget Nachos with toppings over it. 
I have been there 20-25times so you can trust my pick !!
Apart, from that the ambiance to be honest not too great !!
Service and all is good .
So I strongly recommend everyone to try this once. Also it surely is kinder to your pockets!

The ambience here is nothing great,  to begin with but the food makes up for it! Jalape√±os is a vegetarian food lover's haven- the family garlic bread, cheese fondue, roesti, falafel and nachos are probably the best in Kolkata. Their service is inconsistent though and getting table on a weekend is grueling!

The place is a nice visit. Though finding it amidst all the tall big buildings may be a bit tough! After successfully locating it you will find the menu to be worth the trouble. The must have on the menu is cheese garlic bread! If you are among the people who have a taste for something hot to give your palette a swirl then you must try the Italian sizzler. Believe me it's pure heaven and the best part is that it's not expensive. This is true for the rest of the items as well. The ambience of the place is not striking and definitely needs some repairing but in terms of food the place is worth a visit.

Though the low "cost for two" seems quite appealing and it's long stay in the brimming competitive market makes this restaurant a numero uno choice to celebrate low budget occasion an apt choice but if you are willing to compensate that for the quality of food, then you are free to take the leap of faith.

Apparently this place says it is specialises in Mexican and and Italian cuisine but to be very candid the Mexican food was way too Indianised and in-digestible. We had placed an order for two of the Mexican dishes but at the end more than 60% was thrown to waste. The garlic bread is oil soaked but tastes good. Luckily the cheese balls were quite palatable and were made in a different style that had considerably less oil and the cheese did not overwhelmed on the overall dish. 

Presentation was crude and the service is not up to the mark. It seemed that the servers were resistant in making any eye contact lest we would ask them for something. But the most amazing and embarrassing thing is that it lacks a washroom. So in case if you have are having abnormal bowel movements then it would do good to skip this place.

Overall the Mexican food is a total fail (I cannot understand why they still have those dishes) but the Italian dishes especially the fondue is worth trying especially at this price. But again I will reiterate that this place lacks a washroom.

Location: Camac Street. 

This place is well-known for its Italian and Mexican cuisine. 
Isn't that big a place, has a seating capacity of around 40 heads. 

Coming to the Fooding, 
Serves great food.¬†The following have been sampled until now: 

- Crispy Chilli Babycorn 
The corns were crisp and the flavours were perfect. 

- Supreme Nachos
Tortilla chips served topped with paprika and olives served alongside with guacamole dip.
Tastes great!
Personal favorite.¬†

- Jalapeno Nachos
Served along with cheese dip.
Good to taste.¬†

- Family Garlic Bread 
This is one of their signature dishes. 
Milk bread slices covered up with garlic, herbs and melted cheese, served wrapped around in foil.
Delicious it is.¬†
Recommended. 

- Pasta Alfredo (white sauce) 
Tossed in a cheesy sauce with a punch of pepper and the right kick of herbs. 
Tastes great! 

- Mexican Tacos
Taco shells with a filling of salsa and refried beans. Tasted decent. A broken shell was served, turn off. Serve a dish as it is supposed to be, and not broken pieces in order to clear your stock. Huge scope of improvement.

- Mexican Rice with Spicy Veg. Curry
The Veg curry had fresh veggies in it tossed in nice flavors but, lacked the spiciness part. The rice was well cooked.

The staff was courteous, efficient and well-informed.¬† 
Moderate Pricing. 

Overall has been an above-average experience. :-) 
- Would revisit in the near future, yet to try the remaining fare. :-)

First experience with the Family garlic bread has been amazing, can forget the taste. Jalapeno broth is best soup.
I like other soups as well. 
Sizzlers, Pastas, hummus and falafel sandwhichs, pizzas, baked dishes all are amazing.

It's hard for a non veg lover like me to eat out only veg but once u ve eaten here, there's no other place u want to eat out in Calcutta . The family garlic bread is simply out of this world . All their dishes are great. Could be a bit heavy but good Italian quality !

Jalapenos is THE place when we are looking for some serious comfort food. It has some of the most delectable mushroom preparations in all of Calcutta, the mushroom ravioli, Mexican rice with mushroom curry, stuffed mushrooms and basically almost all th dishes on their menu. Brilliant service. Not to forget their family garlic bread is the most beautiful and sinful dish ever. For people who haven't been there yet, you are missing out on Some seriously delicious food.

I have been visiting this place for around 10 years now, but lately I observed their quality deteriorating a bit, like the nachos got a little less cheesier and the Mexican rice lacked salt. Despite that the food is quite good, I have tried almost everything on the menu (since 10 years), their family garlic dread, risotto, french onion soup etc are to die for. I like the dips they give along with the nachos and also the various pastas are quite good. The proportions are huge and that has to be kept in mind while ordering and one last thing is this place is pure vegetarian and tends to get very crowded on lunch timings especially on weekends.

One of the finest Italian and Mexican cuisine restaurant  in Kolkata. The best thing about the place is the food quality and taste. We went there for Saturday night dinner and waited for almost 45 minutes as we wanted place for 12 people. So this is one of the drawback as seating capacity is for around 35 people. 

We ordered fresh lime, garlic bread, cheese fondue, Italian sizzler, Mexican sizzler, hummus and falafel. The best among the lot was Mexican sizzler. Rest of the items were tasty. The only disappointment was cheese fondue which was not up to the mark. I would recommend to try chimichanga from the menu as tried it in our previous visit to this place. The cost for two person is around INR 800.

The food of good. But it is cooked in a lot of oil and that heaviness is felt after eating it. You can't really eat a lot out there. But it's a good place for vegetarians. But then again , no restrooms. Overall it's a must try :)

Jalapeno's - Disappointed with it's branch serving at Calcutta Swimming Club. 
======================================================
Intro- I am not going to talk about the ambience because i have had their food which was being served at CSC. However, i had always heard all my vegetarian friends speaking about jalapenos. So, wanted to give it a try as i could see their name serving in clubs.
======================================================
Food- 

I had just ordered Garlic Bread to taste. It was very oily to begin with. I was served in a usual plate with usual oregano and chilli flakes on the side. The bread was not tasting great. It lacked that 'garlic bread taste'. Two pieces of garlic bread for somewhat like 80-85 bucks could not be digestive. However, the horrible presentation of the dish even got me fire in the blood.
======================================================
Conclusion:

I mean how can you just for earning profit serve like this? The health factor was no were in the food. Really disappointed. Sorry for the not so clear pictures. This picture acts as a proof that you guy's have been serving creepy food at CSC.

Been visiting this place for over a decade now..a good vegetarian mexican Italian hangout. Need to improve a bit on quality. Garlic bread too oily.. Jacket potatoes feel as if they have been microwaved and served. Earlier food was one of its kind but somehow over the years quality deteriorated or maybe too much competition.

This restaurant located behind camac street pantaloons is pure vegetarian which I was initially considering a drawback but later was taken completely aback by the awesome Italian Mexican Mediterranean fare. The service is quite fast and there's no service charge!
Ambience 8/10
Nothing special. Wrought iron chairs and glass tables,the regular dining table that is. But i liked the fact that there was oregano and chili flakes kept on the table in stead of the usual salt n pepper.
Food Presentation 9/10
The family garlic bread 8 pieces smothered in cheese comes wrapped in a foil. The fondue of course comes on a live burner. Rest of the items are also properly presented,like the Mexican fajita sizzler on the sizzler plate and the ravioli in normal portions.
Food Quality 10/10
Undoubtedly the best fondue I've had in this city. The family garlic bread is so soft,it's a must try here. The tex mex rice with veggies,the fajita are good from Mexican fare. even their tacos are brilliant. Do try the layered lasagna and ravioli from the Italian section.
Food Quantity 10/10
The family garlic bread is enough for a couple and their kid. The fondue would suffice three adults easily.
Cost effectiveness 9/10
You won't feel the pinch once you taste the food. And don't fear,prices are quite reasonable as per the top notch quality you're assured.
Overall 46/50

A pure veg Italian / Mexican serving family restaurant .
The ambiance is very family type.
Not really a couples space 

We ordered: Family garlic bread, Risotto in white sauce with corn, Baked Jacket potato, Sizzling Brownie

The food in total was very good.

Special mention: The baked jacket potato. It was exquisite to say the least. Amazing starter. 

The Family garlic bread is the most famous dish of the restaurant. Imagine bread oozing celery and garlic hinted cooked cheese.

The risotto and sizzling brownie were very good too, but the commonly available variant. Nevertheless, tasty.

Pocket pinch: 800 max for two

Went back here after nearly 4 years with the family garlic bread firmly etched in memory! A tad bit disappointed. Since there were only 2 of us we ordered the Garlic bread with mushroom. We thought it would be a dry dish but it was unfortunately topped with a creamy mushroom sauce. Having said that, it definitely tasted well. Post that we were looking for some suggestions from the waiter but didn't get any convincing answer so settled for the mushroom risotto & it was very disappointing. It was essentially the same sauce as the garlic bread only far too tasteless. Had the waiter made an effort & told us that both the dishes were of the same sauce and wouldn't go well together we would have had an awesome lunch but unfortunately we ended up feeling highly dissatisfied... The price is pocket friendly though the taste is far from authentic; wish they had more well trained staff!

It's a really good place to have a hearty meal and the prices are reasonable as well. you all should try it out.

Jalapenos, here the staff has an attitude higher than the Eiffel Tower. They are most disrespectful. The ambiance, is very disappointing. The iron chairs give you a backache. The Italian is way too Indianised. The only good thing about the restaurant is the nachos. And remember, the waiters are quick to point out the difference between service tax and service charge!

Well I am sorry to say this but felt quite embarrsed at the restro.

First thing staff does not have the courtsey. I was eating something and the staff took the food from the table without even asking or looking. This is the firsrt time ever happened to me, felt very bad and thought of leaving the place immediately but could not as I was paying for that but eventually I ended up not tipping.

The ambience is not so good sitting arrangemnet is not upto mark so it was not feeling of sitting in good restro.

Well the pricing part was not preportioned to he servings. I ordered Sizzler and it was not able to full me half.

Definately wont recommend and advice to the owner please give staff some training and restro orders.

It is an old joint that serves mexican, italian food located right behind pantaloons ( camac street). The place is not so big and the wrought iron chairs are not the most comfortable ones either. The staff service is a touch not upto the mark. The prices are very reasonable though.

The food is not so authentic and preparations have a bit of Indianized feel to them. But this is one place where you could go and eat your heart out with little drain on your money. The family garlic bread is crazy!!!!!!!!! Nachos are great, risotto i would not recommend ans pastas are good. 

Pros:
1) Good food at very reasonable prices
2) Garlic bread is a must try
3) A great place for people who like a bit indianized version of Italian cuisine
4) One place you would not mind experimenting new dishes

Cons:
1) Sitting is not so comfortable
2) Service is not so uptime
3) Food is not very authentic

Please follow me to read my other reviews.

For the first time in a long time, I had such an amazing Italian. U always find Italian food with Indian mixture, they add spices and sauces without thinking that they are making Italian food but here at Jalape√±os, that's not the case. The proper use of vegetables in the pasta is amazing. Mind blowing cheese fondue and garlic bread. Ambience could be better but the food makes up for that‚Ä¶

Jalapenos is a lovely restaurant if you like Italian and Mexican food . It's a small place but ambiance is very good.
Coming to the food, the food is seriously awesome, specially if you order something with cheese you are simply gonna love it. 
Even if the place is pure vegetarian you are still gonna like the stuff.
The nearest Metro station is Maidan.....


Happy Eating :)

Jalapeno's is not a spectacularly good looking place - its a simple family restaurant tucked behind Pantaloon's. But boy, is the food great! It serves a range of Tex-Mex dishes, and stocks up nicely on the cheese, refried beans and chillis. Its heavy, yes, but I for one find it difficult to resist the charms of nachos, tacos and enchiladas. Its a great place to bring the kids too, as they'll love all the cheesy offerings, and you can ask the staff to tone down the spiciness a notch. And at this price range, its freaking brilliant value for money! Delhi's Rodeo offers worse food for twice the price and still manages to get away with it.

I am a Xaverian and Jalapenos served just the best to me and my friends after an evening of classes.The supreme nachos are to die for!I have tried almost all of the items on menu .The recent addition to my list of jalapenos favourites include the garlic mushroom with herb bread.Its a 3 piece garlic bread dish smothered in cheese and garlic sauce topped with mushrooms and parsley!My mouth waters with just the mention of it!
Jalapenos is my 'go-to' place to be and i simply love the food..

Unlike other reviewers, I did not like this place at all. 
This place is tucked away in Camac street, right behind Pantaloons. The aroma of garlic hits you as you enter into the joint.
We ordered for a bowl of fondue. Now, the fondue had more fillers in it than cheese. It was horrible. It didn't even taste like cheese. 5 of us couldn't finish one serving of fondue.
For the mains, I shared a special enchilada and a Mexican sizzler with another friend. The sizzler was okay, but the enchilada was bad. Really bad. There was gorom moshla in a Mexican Enchilada :O

One of my friends threw up her Lasagna, I am really hoping it was because of a stomach bug, and not the mediocre food.
Not recommended.

This Place serves great food ..... and considering I am a hard core non-veggie its a genuine testimony to their food that I am writing this review !  Their Family Garlic Bread and Original Nachos are simply yummy and I make sure that I order them everytime I go. For your main course order the Italian Sizzler, the Chimmichanga , the Roesti with Mushroom Sauce and the Cheese Fondue. I can assure you that even if your a die-hard non-veg you will walk away completely satisfied with the experience. Two things the ambience and service are a notch below what one would expect which is perhaps the only negative but I am sure that once you are hooked onto the awesome flavours you will keep returning for more.

I was mind-blown by the food they serve here (even at Cosmopolitan Club)... I can return again and again for its nachos and family garlic bread!! The pastas and pizzas are decent, but the starters are really mind-blowing! If you want to have really good and taste-bud and pocket friendly Italian food, the Jalapenos is the best option in Central Kolkata! 

However, the staff can do with a bit of training in soft skills. Try not to take a meal voucher if you go there, for the portions will be lesser...

You like Italian and Mexican, belong to Calcutta and have not been to Jalapenos. I'd say Impossible. Every foodie, big or small, loves this small, cosy and awesome place. 

The ambience can be a little noisy depending on the type of crowd you bump into but the food was, is and will remain delicious and finger licking till this place exists. 

My favorite order would be Supreme Nachos and Family Garlic Bread (no one in the world makes it better) to start with, followed by Tri Colour Pasta/Mexican Pasta and Mushroom Risotto and end with Cheese Fondue. Dishes worth trying would be Mexican Rice with Veg Curry, Cannelloni, and Quesadillas. 

The pricing is value for money and the service is prompt but -0.5 for no restrooms else it's an A-grade restaurant which is on the 'favorites' list of every foodie in Calcutta.

One of the best places for vegetarian food. Highly recommended for Continental and Mexican food lovers. A small outlet located at a very convenient location, it is perfect to visit this place with a small group. Service is great, and they are happy to customize the food based on your preferences. The mushroom toast is something one should not miss while at Jalepenos.

But the decor is not up to the mark as compared to the food. and moreover it does not have a washroom :-( nevermind due to the very convincing camac street (behind pantaloons) location and the delicious food, this point can be somehow neglected!

Jalapenos!..Located opposite Pizza Hut on Camac Street. The decor is pretty ordinary but once you start eating you just ignore the whole place and just dig in.

The best thing about this place is the Family Garlic Bread which is amazing!!. Supreme Nachos is good with delicious toppings. The Sizzlers are pretty decent. Dont try the Lasagna as it fails to fulfill expectations. The Mexican Fajita Sizzler is refreshing. Will try the Fondue on my next visit. The pricing is reasonable considering the quality served. The Staff are well behaved. The big negative about the place is they dont have a washroom(!). Overall a winner in the food dept.

4 Stars from me for Jalapenos.

To start with, this place has a very attractive menu, especially, for vegetarians like me. Somehow the starters which we ordered such as Onion Rings and Baked Jacket Potatoes did not keep up to the reputation, though the sauce served with the rings, was absolutely delicious. On the other hand, the main course (Italian sizzler) turned out to be ravishing and more than filling for two. The dessert was average. Overall not bad but it requires a few adjustments, particularly, the staff who seemed pretty laid back.

It is hard for vegetarians to find good options in the city dedicated solely to veggie food. Jalapenos does not disappoint with its diverse menu, with sumptuous salads and starters and an excellent selection of garlic breads. The pastas are quite nice, and so is the sizzler. Visit Jalapenos for a great taste of the veggie version of Italian cuisine... even the most carnivorous of you won't be disappointed!!

For people who want to indulge in a wide range of yum cheesy items,Jalapenos is a good option for you. Hot creamy cheese bucket with bread strips(Cheese fondue) is a MUST TRY.. Garlic Bread is simply outstanding, you can actually feel the bread melting,its so soft..Nachos with different dips is also worth mentioning.But the biggest problem is service.If that is looked into and taken care of, then it is a perfcet place to hang out with friends.

I suggest the following to all cheese lovers like me :
1.Baked Jacket Potato with their awesome cheese dip
2.Family Garlic Bread - the best garlic bread ever
3.Cheese Fondue (Bread sticks with cheese dip)
4.Risotto Florentine (Rice based)
5.Mint Smoothie (in cocktails)

this place has the best garlic bread far better than the one served at pizza hut or dominos. the garlic bread is a must try. apart from that mixed sauce pasta and special sizzler is also great. its a great place to hangout with friends and mostly crowded with youngsters and college goers.
THE ONLY THING IS THAT THE STAFF SHOULD SHOW MORE COURTESY AND POLITENESS TOWARDS CUSTOMERS WHICH SEEMED TO BE LACKING IN THEM.

A heaven for Vegetarians. 
Jalapenos is an all time favorite and all the items it serves are tasty and fabulous. Be it the garlic bread, pasta, bakes, starters, crepes, sizzlers, potato Rosti or Nachos, just everything is too good. 
The staff is polite and service is also on time. Have ordered for home delivery and eaten in the restaurant as well and don't have any complaints with the place. On weekends the place is packed and full. They do need a rest room. 
Also, they don't have home delivery on weekends.

In the end I cancelled the order!!!..and the waiters were least interested..the staff -were smiling sure as someone had said in a previous review-- but all for wrong reasons-nothing to do with serving the ordered food-- mainly for wasting my 40 minutes--...am really not sure how this place has good reviews..would not recommend it to new people..It was my 1st try at this place and would def be last!!!

i totally disagree with some of the negative reviews of this place. 

Being a foodie critic who always digs deep to find "faults" with the preparation, taste and ingredients used, Jalapenos passed the test with flying colours. Being a non vegetarian who simple loved to gorge on chicken, the preparation at Jalapenos made me forget Chicken tikkas, kebabs and biryanis.

I have tried the following items and each has been superb in taste.
Potato Rosti with Herb Sauce
Cheese Fondue
Mexican Rice with Potato Patties topped with Cheese
Garlic Bread Supreme
Nachos Supreme, etc etc

The most satisfying part is that whom so ever I have recommended to visit this place has always called back to thank me for suggesting this place. 

Would suggest the authorities to look for a bigger place and please retain the present staff. They are simply great. Always serving with a smile.

Terrible service; we were unable to place an order for half an hour after arriving at the restaurant. The staff was uncultured,rude and impolite. My first-time experience was awful. Where the staff is incompetent, I can't say much about the food. A warning to all those who visit the restaurant for the first time. I will not recommend the place to anyone. No question of a second visit as the first was a waste of time.

Probably the only non-Indian restaurant which my dad loves! The family garlic bread is an all time favorite and a MUST have. Cheese fondue is also good to go if there are enough people to finish it! The sizzlers and pastas are sumptuous and offer quite the filling for 2-3 people per single serve. The only sad part is less seating area, so we always end up waiting for 30 mins or  so. Also there is need for a restroom, even a tiny one is good enough. All in all, great value for money, quick service and delicious food! :D

Great food, family garlic bread is OOOSUM, pastas and the mexican rice is swell as well and while you are there do not miss the  hot cheese bucket with bread strips (Cheese Fondue)

 Not the best service in the world, you have to make sure, you have communicated well to the wait staff or else be prepared to get your food exactly the way you dint want it. I had the trouble of receiving my entre's and the mains together. 

I guess the place is not managed well. 

I still go there, i dont know why, i guess its the food
