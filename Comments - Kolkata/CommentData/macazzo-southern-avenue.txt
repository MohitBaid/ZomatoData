It might be very good for "animal lovers", but they don't have nothing to offer to vegetarians other than French Fries and a Margherita Pizza. Please ignore my ratings as I had to provide one.

Located at the end of Rabindra Sarovar lake,this place is definitely a must go for couples as well as students. The decor is at par with the food served. Service is good and the ambience is soothing.We ordered blue lagoon and mojito,alongwith a pizza.Drinks were good but the pizza was okk(only if you don't like thin crust). Overall its a must go cafe to spend a lovely evening.

After a hectic and energy draining examination me and friends decided to visit Macazzo. This place is surely going to lift your mood up. It's got some amazing music playing. The seating area is quite nicely arranged with good amount of moving space. 
We ordered a veg burger, aam panna, french fries with cheese, garlic bread, tomato sauce pasta, chicken buffalo wings and napolitana. All the items were beautifully cooked. The buffalo wings were very spicy delicious. The napolitana was the one I was waiting to have for a long time and it surely lived upto it's reputation. 
The quantities of the items were sufficient and the price perfectly placed. Will be paying another visit asap.

Went to this place on 31st evening. We were surprised to see the place pretty empty. We ordered one brownie shake, one Oreo shake, one fried chicken burger and one crispy sweet chicken burger. The shakes were awesome. They were the best, totally worth the money. You should try the shakes if you go to this place. The burgers were okayish. I felt the burgers could have been better, for the price. But the shakes were really good. One good thing was that the prices on the menu are inclusive of tax and hence we weren't charged any extra tax.

I wish i could give some more points to this restaurant. It is located just near menoka cinema hall. The food is quite cheap. 
Had the best fire on rocks.
The Darjeeling platter (chicken) was just more than expected. Chicken items were soft and juicy and the platter can satisfy at least 3 hungry people.
10/10 for the ambience and the songs they play.

The restaurant may look small but I would recommend you to have a seat & grab your meal, you'll definitely lick your fingers..
Grilled pork with bacon and cheese is a must try...Pork Stroganoff is also very tasty item served with ample amount of rice....

Never plan to get over this place.
Been here uncountable times and each visit ended with an even higher level of satisfaction than the last one.
Celebrated my birthday here so have tried most dishes. Among them, the Pork Lasagna is probably the absolute best in town. It doesn't get better than that.
The Nasi Goreng was good, not their speciality.
The chicken steak in mushroom sauce had a smokey edge to it. Impressive.
The absolute winner was the Buffalo Wings. The most spicy and tangy combination of sauce flavor in wings I've ever tasted. This could've easily been their best dish, uptil last year that is.
The Pork steak was perfect with its ample jus and we'll rested serving.
Followed by the burger,which was really juicy. Pulled pork is a winner. The sandwiches ,each with a different twist and the perfect kind of bread.
The poutine with bacon is the best thing you'll ever taste of you've tasted it anywhere. It is deliciously unhealthy and absolutely worth the calories!
However, following the renovations and the addition of a new ground floor, an even better menu and the lit decor, things seem to have taken a turn for even better. Over my last two visits, I've tried a variety of dishes, both the old ones and some of the new ones.
The Pizza will blow your mind with it'd ample cheese and plentiful toppings. Really appreciate their efforts.
The Chicken Cilantro was juicy, perfectly flavoured chicken and the crust was just aptly brown.
They have a new range of desserts out of which Brownie in Bailey's Irish Cream will win anyone over, the rum infused flavor of the cream coupled with a luke warm brownie will keep you coming back for more.

All in all , favourite cafe in town. Can't wait to go back. Keep it up guys! We love what you do.

All the hype around this place made me visit it. Conveniently located just round the corner of southern avenue, opposite rabindra sarovar stadium, beside icici atm and only a few metres away from the menoka cinema hall. The usp of the place is reasonably priced food and prices which are inclusive of taxes. But coming to the food, it was a big disappointment! Pizzas are better than the rest of the food items. Pasta which was a recommended one here was a disaster. It was extremely sticky as they do not provide a generous helping of the sauces and there were hardly any chicken pieces to be seen. When notified, the owner passed it as their own special recipe that makes the pasta sticky. They are not at all open to suggestions and feedbacks. Last but not the least, the beverages are not upto the mark. They do not serve even a basic mojito with proper ingredients. Definitely not visiting again.

Fried chicken wings were so much in quantity.
I loved it.

We had French fries with cheese-lip smacking, pork ribs in BBQ sauce-the best sauce I had in a while, Romanian Pizza-the bread was soft toppings can improve a little bit, Grilled Chicken in wine juice and last but not the least the awesome Darjeeling platter. For drinks we had mojito and Spanish hot chocolate (bliss in a winter evening). The surprising thing is in this GST driven era we had to spend only 317 bucks per head ( we occupied three tables - 8 monkeys) ‚úåÔ∏èüëç

It was a little cafe on southern avenue,very easy to find on Google the first thing caught our eyes when we entered the place was the old movie posters,used as decors and on lamps,and the vintage advertisement of car wash,the beetles' poster all made us so nostalgic as we are both movie geeks and vintage lovers..now the food.The food we ordered were Spanish hot chocolate cappuccino and hot Buffalo wings.the hot chocolate was yummmm!!! it was thick and purely chocolatey!! it was so good that I couldn't get enough of it and the cappuccino tasted a little blunt after it üòäbut it was good..The server warned us about the last one that it would be really spicy..But we are actually obsessively hot food lovers so we went for it anyway..And it was hot, really hot and spicy..But it tasted amazingly good..But know one thing for sure that it's not for the faint hearted.. the staffs were really well behaved, warm in nature and service was fast.. Only one thing I want to suggest that as it's a cafe they should keep a non-formal place with beanbags and books so that one can enjoy a cup of their awesome hot chocolate while. Reading a good book..Now time for review

A rather small pace with a few tables but serves some amazing food. The shepherd's pie is one of the best I've ever tasted and the Patiala Pizza is something which I can have every single day. The thin crust, the minimal seasoning and the perfect quantity of toppings makes it my all time favourite.

Finally the wait being over , we went to Macazzo today, on christmas and I am really very very impressed about our entire experience there . We opted for the sitting area which is downstairs which was decorated with Christmas trees and stars; christmas songs were playing in the background giving the perfect Christmasy feel . We ordered Spanish hot chocolate , nawabi shake And chicken lasagne. The nawab shake was simply awesome i must say . This is a shake made of kulfi ,pista and kaju . Hot chocolate was better comparable to other places. Chicken lasagne was also very tasty and tummy filling . üòù and more than enough for two persons . Service is very well , staff is well mannered .Ambience has a vintage feel to it . I am eager to visit this place again and try other dishes. Very easy to locate if you take the road opposite to mudiali busstop . can be reached also through lake road .

This is a small quaint place in Southern Avenue close to Menoka Cinema.On entering we were taken to the downstairs seating arrangement using a spiral staircase which is an interesting addition.
The decor is minimalist with cassette lined lights and wooded walls.The retro English songs add to the charm of the place.
Coming to the food we opted for pork nasi goreng.It was sticky rice with pork pieces and mushroom topped with a sunny side egg on top.We were warned that it is a very spicy dish however we found it to be moderately spicy.The pork pieces were succulent and the pork belly melted in the mouth.The egg added a much needed creaminess to the dish.
The prices are easy on the pocket and the price is inclusive of tax which is convenient and a very good place to hangout with friends.The waiters are friendly and co-operative.
The only downside was the very very long waiting time for the dishes to arrive and the place feels a bit cramped when all the tables are full.
Overall a very good place to have some good food, but always make sure you have enough time at hand because you might have to wait long for your food to arrive.

The ambience is really good and the staff out there are really courteous...
We ordered blue lagoon.. chicken stroganoff with parsley rice and chicken lasagna.. for dessert there was affogato...
Blue lagoon is a beauty... I personally liked lasagna more than the stroganoff but yeah its good too... Affogato was a great dessert with a flavour of coffee..
Overall its a Great place to hangout and its even pocket friendly.. so its a must try... Happy tummies!!! üòã

Located near the rabindra sorobar stadium, this place is just pure gem. The ambiance of the basement is just awesome. It has an amazing retro feeling with the innovative ideas of using gramaphone records as tissue paper holders and much more.
Now lets come to the food. We had the "pork nasi goreng". When the food arrived it seemed pretty small and we really didn't think it was enough. But with the pork and egg it was more than sufficient. The pork belly adds more to the finger licking good food.

pocket pinch: 600 for 2

in short: must visit for foodies.

Very small place tables crammed together. Had to wait for 30 min even with prior reservation. Classic decor with music CD and old movie posters as lanterns.The¬† British Hot Chocolate was lain Bournvita. The Chicken wings in Hot Buffalo Sauce was indeed too hot. The waiter waned beforehand but it was fun to try. Margarita Pizza with extra cheese was thin crust and extremely tasty. The over hyped Darjeeling Platter was not up to the mark. 2/4 dishes ticked the boxes.

On a quiet evening we decided to visit this place. I would rate the ambience 4/5

Coming to the food and beverage, our order was as follows :-
PINACOLADA ( well made, perfect temperature, sufficient amount)
MOCHA SHAKE ( well made, right balance of coffee and chocolate)
ROAST CHILLY PORK ( tasted quite good but the lard to meat ratio was 2:1 which was a huge dissapointment)
PORK LASAGNA ( tasted very very poor. The lasagna sheet was overcooked and the dish was not very appealing to the eye as well as the tongue)

Food 2/5
What could be improved?
The food quality for sure.
Thank you!

Somehow this place seems to be a bit over rated because expectations versus reality has a lot of deviation.
I ordered for a Nasi Goreng and Chicken Stroganoff with Parsley Rice. Both these classical dishes were not at all up to the mark.

First thing is that the Rice in both the dishes was of cheap quality, too fat and starchy. Getting the Rice right is just basics and nothing more than that.

The Nasi Goreng was a mixture of tomato and chilli sauce which is not the actual recipe. Being a Chef I know the ingredients that you should use in Nasi Goreng. When I asked the owner he said that was the most authentic one and proudly said that‚Äôs their way. 

Too Rude.

I recently had a visit to this brewing cafe in southern evenue along with three of my friends. 

Ambience - This cafe is kind of small yet cozy. The ground floor was not open so we had to sit on the 1st floor. The cafe has partly woody and slightly Hollywood decor with bright lights.

Food - We ordered 
            1. Bacon and cheese loaded french fries - 
                 French fries topped with cheese and bacon
                 served nicely. There was nothing wow in it's 
                 taste but it was good.
           2. Bourbon Glazed BBQ wings -
                And this was something unquie i got in this
                place. This will be a treat to your taste buds.
                If you visit this place, do try out this dish.
           3. Pork lasagne - This dish was worth a try too.
                The lasagne was quite soft and cheesy. This 
                 dish was worth a try.

Now talking about the pocket pinch, it was too less compared to the taste and quality of food. 
If you are thinking of giving a treat to your taste buds and try out something different at a pocket friendly rate, this is the destination for you.

We visited Macazzo for a birthday party. The owned helped set it up and were very gracious. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. If you like spicy stuff then buffalo wings is a great starter for you. I've had the pizzas and the BBQ chicken pizza was my favourite. The coolers and shakes are value for money with great size. Music is good too. Service takes a little bit of time so get your order out all in one go if you're in a hurry. Overall, 5/5. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great non vegetarian place.

Macazzo is one of the most talked about places among the youngsters in Kolkata. Situated near Rabindra Sarovar Lake,this place is definitely worth a try. They have an underground seating arrangement as well and do opt for this option if you are in a group and want to have Adda. Entering the place the posters of Pink Floyd and many more will attract your attention. Atmosphere has been made more perfect by the old English songs playing all the time. We ordered Bacon Wrapped Pork Sausages, Borboun Glazed BBQ Chicken Wings,Manhattan Pizza and Chicken Tikka Pizza. Each and everything was great. Bacon Wrapped Pork Sausages was the showstopper- it just melted in the mouth. Chicken wings were tasty as well. And the Pizzas were so cheesy and delicious. Prices are inclusive of taxes and quite reasonable. Service is good and staffs are very friendly.

Located on Southern Avenue very close by to Menoka Cinema. A quaint little place with the finest decor. Posters from classic English movies adorn the walls with famous dialogues and quotes. The sitting chairs were quite comfortable.
We ordered Americano, Capuccino, British hot chocolate, Mojito and BBQ glazed chicken wings. The coffee were quite good. The hot chocolate was amazing, so smooth and perfect. The BBQ chicken wings was not that good. The chicken had too much of that smoky flavour, the BBQ sauce was also upto the mark. The mojito was a disaster. The taste was a bit peculiar. It had the taste of only sprite with lemon in it. Could not even finish it. Was very dissapionted with the mojito.
The staffs were good and prompt in serving.

Quantity wise a bit heavy for two people. Ordered a pinacolada and a blue lagoon, which were perfectly made. As main course we ordered their famous pork Darjeeling Platter and chicken steak. Both were very good and quantity wise more than sufficient.

I will definitely come back for more.

Heard a lot about this cafe so thought of giving it a try but wasn't very impressed. Tried the pork lasagna, chicken wings and chocolate shake here. The chicken wings was too dry and not at all juicy. The lasagna wasn't good either. Only the chocolate shake was good. The ambience is good though.

A nice cafe near Menoka Cinema hall on Souther Avenue...went there by seeing reviews in Zomato. 

Decor is simplistic... Small wooden tables & wrought iron chairs...
Friendly courteous staffs...
We ordered a Chicken Lasagna & Garlic bread... 
Lasagna was quite tasty...with good quantity.

Will definitely visit this place again to try out other dishes & drinks.

This is one of those few restaurants in Kolkata that serve comfort food. Hidden amidst the tree lined streets of southern Avenue, this small place hits it out of the park with their food and service.

We ordered a Pulled Pork Cheese Loaded Fries and a Bacon Wrapped Sausage. While these two items are what their name suggests, it was the implementation of these items that left us amazed. The pork was lean and yet melt-in-mouth. The sausages were heavenly.

The pulled pork was just how I wanted pork to taste like. The French fries were golden and seasoned perfectly. These provided an otherwise juicy bite to the overwhelming flavours of the pork and the cheese.

Over-all, it was an amazing experience. They don't take taxes and the food quantity they provide is ample.

Would I go again? Absolutely yes!!

Located very near to Menoka cinema hall, Macazzo has been on my wish list for long.On entering,the decor failed to impress,but later we noticed there was a seating available downstairs as well,the staircase itself looked very interesting!After a lot of discussion me and my friend with the help of the staff decided to go for their Chicken and Bacon Carbonara, which is a pasta dish in cream sauce!!!!The dish took quite some time to arrive but guess all good things take time.The dish was simply amazing!!!!The bits of bacon simply bursting with flavour!Served with a side of garlic bread nicely buttered and toasted... would definitely visit again for trying other dishes too.
HappyEating!

Good food at reasonable prices and tasty. Though they took too long to serve but since it was during the Durga Puja rush it didn't bother us we were okay to wait. We ordered the Darjeeling platter it was pretty decent . The Oreo cookie shake is also good.

After going through lot of reviews we went there to have some yummy foods. Being too excited we also ordered several items. Most of which we couldn't finish there. So had to pack them. The hospitality was great. They even suggested what would be best for us. The kiwi mojito nd nawabi shake both were too tasty. But the nawabi shake was bit heavy, it made me almost full. The fried chicken wings were good. But could have been better. The Darjeeling platter as we all know is one of the greatest attraction of this place. It lives up to the expectation. The brownie was bit hard. I expected it to be more soft. But it tastes good. All in all a nice place to pamper your taste buds.

This small cafe located near Menoka cinema hall in southern avenue and within a walking distance from both Rashbehari more and Rabindra Sarovar metro impressed me so much! Right from the polite staff who always greeted us with smiles, to the vintage decor to the ambience and of course to the food, everything was top notch.
What we had:
~Brownie shake- thick and tastes real good but nothing unusual.

~Kiwi mojito- we tasted this for the 1st time and all of us loved it. The taste grew on me and it was sooo refreshing and instantly took away all exhaustion.Recommended.

~cheese and chicken pasta- this is honestly one of the best pasta I've had in the city. It's all creamy and cheesy and delicious, just how we love and my friends are back in town after months and they relished the pasta since they couldn't have it for months. Recommended.

~Darjeeling pork platter- we decided to ditch chicken this time and we've never had so much pork before! All of the varieties tasted unique in their own way and what's even better it comes with a poached egg and buttered toasts! Recommended.

~cheese and bacon wrapped french fries- bowl full of classic french fries with a twist and the whole ensemble was mouth wateringly delicious. The fries were hot and crisp and the mayo dip along with it was yumm! Recommended.

~blue lagoon- it had been a filling meal and after all the meat and adda we needed another cooler and ordering their blue lagoon was indeed the best decision. It soothed our souls from the first sip itself! Recommended.

The pocket pinch is totally reasonable and there is no added tax and as I'm always on the lookout for student friendly cafes, this is one such.
Lastly, it was a friends reunion and meeting after months, we made a lot of noise and it wasn't very nice of us I guess but the food and the cooperation we received made our reunion even more enjoyable and memorable!

I'd gone in expecting a lot,but came out sorely disappointed.
Ordered bacon wrapped sausages. The bacon was not crispy nor fried and the sausage was bland as well.
The pork ribs we ordered as mains was a huge rib of pork with barely any meat. The meagre amount of meat actually present was hard,dry and overcooked.I couldn't eat it.
The nasi goreng was good,and that is the only redeemable quality which made me rate it 3.0,because I liked the smokiness the bacon brought to it. Be warned,though,that the nasi goreng is very heavy on the palate. I had to order a fresh lime soda( which was mercifully standard) to take a breather.

I had many expectations regarding this place. 
Macazzo, located in southern avenue just nearby menoka cinema hall, is a small cafe as well as a pocket friendly one. 

Going there, we ordered two oreo shakes. They were admirable. The perfect blend of oreo chunks and chocolates wer delightful. 4.5/5.
Coming on to the food we ordered Pork lasagna, and chicken burger. 
Pork lasagna was too much saucy. It could have been good but the extra sauce (red) ruined the dish completely. 
Coming to the burger, it was fine and good. 

Overall, macazzo can be better.

It is hard to segregate dainty caf√©s from one another in South Kolkata, and Macazzo falls under that category. Honestly, the ambience didn't steal our gaze for one second as the dimly lit place with Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd posters hanging on the wall doesn't boast of anything quirky anymore. However, what stands out for Macazzo are extremely courteous staff and owner alongwith delectable dishes.

Started off with the much hyped Sweet Chilli wings, and now we understand the buzz surrounding it. Adhering to its name, it was prepared beautifully and enough for two as a starter. Next up was the bourbon glazed wings and well we have mixed feelings about it. A tad too smokey, but crunchier than its counterpart. For mains, we had Fried Chicken Burger with extra bacon and Grilled Chicken Burger. The former was delicious and filling as well. The Grilled one was dry and we had to ask for mayonnaise dip to spread it on the meat. The Chicken Cilantro Kiev with Mash was an absolute delight, although the pieces looked weird, this one was the juiciest Kiev we have had for a long time. Our previous visit saw us order Chicken Cheese sauce, and rest assured they do not compromise on the quantity of cheese at all. The Manhattan Pizza was decked up with succulent chicken pieces and the usual thin crust has fared well so far for us. To call it a day, there is nothing better than the clich√©d Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream. However, they do add dry fruits to it making it even more irresistible.

The hype surrounding Macazzo is understandable and some of their signature dishes are alluring. They have a standard menu with affordable beverages to order from. Overall, a decent place to go out whenever you want to and as we mentioned earlier the courteousness of the owner and the handful of staff is remarkable.

Pretty cheap cafe. Staff were friendly but took a long time in serving. Interiors are good, a spiral staircase lead us to an underground area which was dimly lit.
Now coming to the food, all the drinks like mohito,kiwi mohito, strawberry shake, oreo shake,latte were quite good.
Chicken lasagna was average, I have had better lasagna elsewhere.
Chicken stroganoff was tasty but the rice wasn't given separately. The garlic bread was too crunchy.
Pork Tokyo pizza was the best of all, though I found the crust a bit hard.
Overall, pretty good place with affordable prices.

Found this place on zomato and visited yesterday.. a nice cozy place to chill out with friends over some hot chocolate.
We ordered a Spanish hot chocolate which was basically molten chocolate in a glass.. this definitely satisfied my taste buds.
The Chicken lasagna which was the best I has till date.. it had sufficient amount of chicken in creamy cheesy tangy sauce.
The Manhattan Chicken pizza was a little bit of a let down because by the time the pizza arrived we had already set our expectations sky high.. it had a bit excess of tangy sauce than we would have liked.
So overall experience was good.. will be visiting again to try the rest of the menu.

Located just a few steps away from Southern Avenue main road, this eating joint is quite easy to find... The interior had a retro look to it with the posters of Led Zeppelin , The Beatles and many other and some famous retro songs taking us back to the 60s... We had visited during the Durga Puja (which was a very bad idea) and they had just opened up their basement dining space...
We were offered the PUJA Special menu(which was our bad luck as many of the authentic dishes were removed) but anyways had to move on with it..
We ordered Oreo Shake( it was normal, nothing special about it) , Bourbon Glazed BBQ wings( ooh boy, that first bite of wings had already taken me heaven. Had tried chicken wings in many joints before but by far this was the best. A must try for the newbies) , Grilled chicken & cheese burger ( had expected for melted cheese but the taste had covered for it), Hog lovers reloaded( if you are a thin crust lover then u better avoid this dish but what made it up was the hell lot of toppings starting from salamies to bacon, pulled, juicy veggies etc.) , Darjeeling pork platter( if you order the standard plate then its sufficient for one person) and Affogato for our dessert( cold coffee served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips , perfect to complement your taste buds after the starters and main course)...
What I felt a bit down about them was their service... Even if the person taking the orders who also happens to be the owner of the joint was very well mannered but they served almost after 40 mins... Maybe it was because of the PUJA rush or because they were not accustomed due to the new basement dinning space... But surely the taste of dishes will keep me eagerly waiting for a 2nd visit üòäüòä

The ambience, the decorations, their service, the food, behaviour of the staffs - everything is up to the mark. This was the second time I had visited the place. We ordered Spanish hot chocolate, British hot chocolate, kiwi mojito , grilled chicken & cheese burger, chicken lasagna (pasta) & bourbon glazed BBQ chicken wings. While the hot chocolate couldn't get any better,the mojito was very refreshing. All the other dishes were equally awesome in taste, quality & quantity. Though my favorite was chicken lasagna. It was just way too yummy.

Ambiance : 3.5
The ambiance is nice but a little hyped. Now they have a set up in the basement too which is larger than the old ground floor.

Service : 4
The service is good and prompt. Waiters welcome nicely.

Food : 2.5
We ordered Chicken Fried Wings, Chicken Patiala Pizza, Chicken Manhattan Pizza and Chickem Stronganoff with Parsley Rice.

Among these only Chicken Patiala is the only dish which I can recommend. It was really tasty.

Chicken Fried Wings were not upto the mark ans didn't make us happy.

Chicken Manhattan Pizza was different in terms of taste but we did not like it. And the thin crust base of pizza was not really good

Comparing to the previous two dishes Chicken Stronganoff with Parsley Rice was better for tastebuds. Thought it was little stale...

I cannot recomment the last three dishes.. but anyone can try the first one.

Situated nearby Menoka Cinema on the Southern Avenue, Mocazzo offers a lot given its small comfortable arrangements, minimal soothing decor and good-to-satiate-your-hunger food. This cafe therefore becomes a go-to place to hangout with your friends or maybe even family. The waiters are very friendly and helpful, serving is good. Food is satisfactory in taste, although I wouldn't say its something extraordinary. The shakes are nice with adequately balanced ingredients. The patiala pizza was yum. The masala fries were tasty. However the pasta tasted quiet bland along with the pork burger. The best thing about this place is that the prices are inclusive taxes so it doesn't feel like paying any extra; cost is affordable too. The place plays good music to add more to the charm. So if you are planning to visit this place, do take a table at their basement sitting area because it has a charismatic ambience.

Another new addition to the foodies paradise! Situated off the Southern Avenue, Macazzo offers a delicious spread. We ordered Spanish Hot Chocolate, Latte, Cappuccino, Americano, Lemon Iced Tea, Pulled Pork loaded French Fries, Bourbon Glazed BBQ Wings, Manhattan Pizza and Penne Pork Bolognese. Everything tasted so good. A special mention of the Spanish Hot Chocolate, it's a cup molten chocolate that you would never want to finish. The service is impeccable. The lampshades made of cassettes, vinyl records in the form of coasters and paper napkin holders and posters add to the decor. Next time I would love to explore the basement seating area.

Excellent place for an evening hangout. The place has two levels - one in the basement and the decor is great. They have a playlist of English classics for you to enjoy. We ordered some coffee.. Latte and Mocha, chicken strips and a pizza.
The strips were fried to the just right amount. The large sized pizza was delicious, although some more cheese would have been welcome.
The Affogato with a milk and coffee Base is a good choice for dessert.
They don't charge taxes making the prices affordable. The friendly gestures of the owner and staff is what would make want to visit the place often.

If You Are A Meat Lover, if you like to try out different dishes, if you are Foodie. Then this place is for you.

And they don't charge any Extra tax..So you are spared of that tax dilemma

Its a small restaurant located in Southern Avenue that serves heavenly food at prices totally worth it.....We, a group of 6 people went there to try out their dishes and Oh My God....Weren't they just totally worth it. The Staff were excellent in their service and the ambience was also good. Now coming to the food, we tried the Pulled Pork and Cheese Fries which was topped with loads of cheese and the pork was good too.....Then came the Buffalo Wings !!. Dragon breath guaranteed. The wings were fried to perfection and were succulent...And the sauce was heavenly though we went numb for some time out the heat.
The Chicken Nepolitana was good too which came loaded with fries. The Chicken Stroganoff was cheesy and warm and full of gravy...It was excellent. But to me, the hero were the Pork Platter and the Pork Lasagna.......Cheesy...Meaty...And Excellent !!. The platter gives you sausages, salami, Meatloaf, Bacon and fried egg...Which is enough for two people.
Lastly the Sundae and Brownie and British hot chocolate, A perfect ending to a Perfect meal !!

What we ordered : Chicken Manhattan pizza with extra cheese, Pork Nasi Goreng and Oreo Shake.
The pizza was really good and base of the pizza was a bit different from the pizzas we eat at Domino's or Pizza Hut. Pork Nasi Goreng had rice mixed with pieces of pork and bacon and also on top there was fried egg. This is an Indonesian cuisine and was extremely spicy but tasted beautiful. The spice was neutralized by a sip of the creamy cold Oreo Shake.
The ambience was good and decorations are great. Behavior of the staff was friendly. Their prices are as written on the menu,no extra taxes. Our bill came at around 700 which was very reasonable.
Overall it was a very nice experience and would love to come back here sometimes.

Simple and homely food and a nice decor. A comfortable neighborhood cafe where you can have nice conversations over some good food. We went with the kids there and didn't intend to have a full dinner. Ordered a mushroom, olive pizza which was a well made thin crust one, unlike the ones you get in the bigger chains! Loved it. The kids gorged on the French fries. What I loved the most was the hot chocolate! Reminded me of the hills.. and yes there is something called a "Darjeeling platter" on the menu.. already shortlisted it for the next visit!!

Macazzo is located off Southern Avenue, pretty near Menoka Cinema Hall. The place is small, but they have skilfully managed to create a basement sort of arrangement to accommodate additional diners. There‚Äôs nothing artsy about the decor; it‚Äôs plain jane to say the least. But what matters the most is a good and Macazzo delivers high on that count. 
The menu is exhaustive. The pizzas are a speciality. I have previously got pizzas delivered from them (when they used to deliver via Zomato). I have tried their Brooklyn pizza and another chicken pizza. Trust me, these guys make seriously good pizzas. The large 12‚Äù comes in at less than INR 500 and is packed to goodness with cheese and toppings. The crust is way thinner than what you get at popular pizza joints and I remember the crust being my really crunchy. 
On a recent visit, I tried their British Hot Chocolate and Chicken Lasagne. The hot chocolate was an absolute winner. I had a preference for the hot chocolate served at an upscale coffee shop near Hindustan Park, but this one is comparable to the one served there. It was pure chocolate temptation; warm and mushy...the lasagne was appropriately tangy and cheesy. One portion was more than enough for two medium eaters. The accompanying garlic bread was a tad bit dry, but that‚Äôs really a bit of nitpicking. 
I packed a portion of Satay Chicken with rice for home. The satay chicken didn‚Äôt come with satay sticks; it was more of a hybrid between a yellow and a massaman curries...but it tasted great. 
I hope they start the delivery again, coz their pizzas and pastas are seriously good.

Had been to this place a month ago n had forgotten to review it. I've to admit that they serve really good food. We had french fries topped with baked cheese. Was just melt in the mouth. Also, hot buffalo wings. Wasn't as hot as I expected but was very tasty.

Anticipated fete with breads!

Well, you always pay your dues. Thus, I had mine and those were mellow to cherish it. Therefore, paid it and the moments we're totally worth it. On this account, plumped for Macazzo to tip those with lovely company of intelligent ladies. 

There we commanded for one Kiwi Mojito, which was extremely piquant and arresting to gulp it down. With that we decreed for one pulled pork, fried egg, bacon, onion and cheese sandwich; one grilled pork burger and one pork lasagna. And believe me all of them took me to heaven. On my God, first time tasted cheese in a different way. Man pork lasagna was prepared with shredded pork and had topped of baked cheese. It was unbelievable. Sandwich was humongous, and total delish. Both of the latter dishes were bit spicy but there were inordinate. Last but not the least, burgers are always my love, however, this one I just craved like a baby to get a bite of it. Indeed this due was perfectly worth it. 

Go for it. You will love the ambience and will cherish the food they serve.

Are you a meat lover? A coffee lover? A foodie? Then please drop in. This place near manoca cinema is a true hidden gem in southern Avenue. It's just a few minutes walk from my home. My entire family loves this place. It may seem small but it has nice d√©cor. Service may seem slow during rush hour but the food is worth the wait. And the owner is so warm, everytime I visited he welcomed me with a warm smile, helped me decide on what to eat ( looking at the menu I wanted to eat everything) and his gestures are really sweet and welcoming. But the food yes that pulled pork fries and those pizzas and what not. Sorry but I'm hungry already. I just wish they would add some more desserts like crapes or caramel custard or cakes.

Well this was my 1st visit to this place.The location is convenient and easy to reach.This place is not very large but the space utilisation has been done thoughtfully and the decor is top notch which blends perfectly with the classics of english retro music.The people serving the guests are softspoken and polite.overall one can easily settle down and feel acquianted with this place.we had 2 coolers namely the Oreo shake and The Pinacolada.The oreo shake was below our expectations but the Pinacolada was quite good and perfect for guys having the sweet tooth.Among the food items we had the Manhattan pizza.The pizza was both looked and tasted delicious.anyways Macazzo is place apt to spend your evening leisure time be it with frnds or just by urself.

The food is just great, writing about it makes me feel hungry. The chicken Stroganoff is oh so good with a very generous portion indeed. 

Special mention of their chili hot chocolate. :D

Evening hunger pangs..had around an hour in hand before proceeding to my next chore. Dropped in at Macazzo in Southern Avenue (next to Medinova). Interesting menu, reasonably priced, great portions. I had  mushroom sandwich loaded with mushroom, veggies,a generous spread of mayonnaise and cheese. Simply yum  and filling.  My son went for a crispy pork burger topped off with bacon and cheese. He couldn't resist licking his fingers. This place should be on the must try out list of all food lovers.

Well i finally dropped in here. Heared a lot and finally made it here.
Stationed at southern avenue this joint serves pretty good dishes.
Had a lot expectations so we had.
Pulled pork loaded french fries, Bourbon glazed bbq wings, Darjeeling platter chicken and kiwi mojito.
Well for me the chicken platter was an amazing experience i could relate to my darjeeling memories.
The other items were good too. The pork loaded french fries were just to amazing to have. The food here is just so good.
Apart from the food the decor is very appealing and thematically good.
I loved the ambience all around.
For me the star performer here is the Darjeeling platter.
This places does not charge any kind of tax so you spare out your bucks for tax.
If you have a great platter loving bunch you gotta visit this place.
This place definetly gets a 'Must try' tag from me.

One of the best thing that happened to Southern Avenue :D
Food is lip-smacking tasty
We ordered Buffalo Wings inspite of being warned of the hotness level but all the pain and tears were worth it. Blue Lagoon calmed us down. Manhattan Pizza was cheesy but I would personally recommend a softer crust.

I am writing the review almost after 3 months and I am sure they have improved a lot by now !
Decor and service is hands down commendable.¬†
Everybody should visit once and see for themselves.
It won't even burn a big hole in your pocket !

I have been to this place with my friends quite a number of times and this restaurant never fails to amaze me. Staff here is very friendly. Decor is amazing. They keep on playing retro rock music at low and the ambience is top knotch. Coming to the food,it is of the very best quality at cheap rates. I've had fries wrapped with bacon and cheese which was very tasty,chicken wings with bbq sauce was good too and so are all the burgers available in the menu itself.Masala french fries are also worth a try.This place is also famous for the wonderful desserts which it serves.The chocolate brownie served with vanilla ice cream,resins and nuts is delicious.One thing which i did not like about this place was the waiting time for the food to be served.

This is a small cafe located in Southern avenue. Simple and decent decor with a retro look. We ordered for Brownie shake, Manhattan pizza and Chicken satay curry with rice.
Brownie shake is my all time favourite and it tasted yummy. Manhattan pizza is a thin crust pizza filled with loads of chicken , sweet corn and onions.
Chicken satay curry with rice was a good choice as well. The chicken and vegetables are cooked in Indonesian sauce and served with white rice. Staff is very friendly and the owner helps you out with any confusion regarding the food. Perfect place to hangout with friends . Pocket pinch is less. Will be coming back again to try out other dishes.

This is a small place at the entrance of a lane in Southern Avenue. The ambience of the place was pleasing. Songs were played at a soothing volume. The waiters were very nice and warm and were always eager to help.
Coming to the food, it was great value for money. We ordered a Pina Colada, Oreo Shake, Cordon Bleu with mash and a Milanesa Napolitana with French Fries. The food could not be faulted. And the quantities were pretty good too.
Visit here for some great food at amazing prices.

Well i also had a chocolate sundae with oreo,kitkat,nuts and raisins in it. It's a Hollywood themed restaurant i guess . The decoration is nice and subtle. Must go for an evening date.

Visited during Durga pujo. Had to wait for about 45 mins never knowing that the wait will be soo much worth it=!
Was made to sit in the underground section the entire ambience giving a mysterious kind of a feeling!!
Had the best mojitos possibly ..Liked it soo much that ended up placing a 2nd order. The aam panna was equally refreshing in taste.
The best chicken stragnogg in town .Hands down without any doubt. That rich smell of cheese the chunks of chicken and rice ...Worthy of all the 45 minutes of wait...The  quantity was way too much for even 3 people when you know another plate of food is arriving! The Alabama grilled chicken (if I am not wrong) with veggies and mash tasted nice but once you eat the Stragnoff nothing tastes that food-gasm-ish .
The manager was really helpful and  so were the other staffs.
Had a worthy evening with friends .Hoping for a future visit soon !

Wow! Wow and wow... I have my only words to describe the place and the food. Situated at a quaint corner of southern avenue, macazzo is both a treat for your eyes and your pallette. The place has a retro look with the lights and coasters build out of old cassettes and CDs. The place gives you an instant happy feeling. As for the food, my friend and I had ordered Oreo shake, pina colada, BBQ sandwich and chicken satay with rice. I LOVED my pina colada! It tasted so good! The sandwich and the satay were lipsmacking. And the quantity was more than enough to satiate your hunger. This is one of those places which is worth visiting again and again!

This is one gem of a place. Situated right next to the Medinova. Google map will be the right option to figure out this restaurant.
The place is brightly lit and is beautifully decorated with posters. The BEATLES is my favourite! This place can house a maximum of 10-13 people at a time. 
Had opted for Fried Chicken Wings and Patiyala Pizza. It took quite sometime for the dishes to reach our table, but it was totally worth it! The pizza was cheesy and filled with big chunks of Chicken! It tasted Heavenly! The fried chicken was juicy and soft on the inside and super crispy on the outside. 
The staffs are well versed with the menu and are very generous.
The bill comes up with no surprises. Would love to visit this place again!

Great decor, lovely lighting, and friendly staff...Macazzo surely has that youth connect. The British Hot Chocolate is so rich and good that it leaves you wanting more. The Bourbon Glazed BBQ Wings is sinfully delicious. The crisp and that bittersweet taste makes it a must try. The Brooklyn Pizza is tasty...goes easy on the palate. The Alabama Grilled Chicken Steak makes a wholesome meal....the chicken was a bit tough and that is the only thing that can be faulted about this dish.

Located near Menoka Cinema hall,have heard a lot about this joint and it was on my hit list from a long time....
Coming to the decor it is decently decorated...there we ordered British hot chocolate,Oreo shake n brownie shake and fish finger in starters...must say the shakes were heavenly...the finger was decent too...then we ordered BBQ chicken cheese n onion sandwich n grilled chicken burger...the quantity was pretty sufficient for 2...the burger tasted really good but i was little disappointed with the sandwich as it tasted too sour. But the main complain is about the service. The staffs are very cordial but when coming to their service it was really sloth. We had to wait too long for the second round of orders...
Yet i will definitely visit it again to taste some pork and their pasta....

So, I have been planning to review this place for a while and hete it finally is. Right off the bat, I give this place a 4.5 out of 5 cause this place deserves every bit of that. 

It's a fairly small place but located very conveniently. So, we went it with empty tummys and ordered ourselves a Extra Cheese Margharita, Oreo Shake and a Nawabi shake(one of the most innovative shakes I have ever had). The place is really well decorated and places some nice music too, btw. We were kind of confused about what to order, until the owner stepped in and suggested that we get a Pizza and a the Nawabi shake(which was his brainchild, btw). So, we crossed our fingers and ordered it, still a bit skeptic about the 'Nawabi shake'. 

There's something about 'Nawabi' and 'shake' that doesn't go well together, or at least I thought, before I took my firdt sip and it was pure bliss. It was a biriyani in the form of a Shake. My life was complete. Every sip of it was lovely. That's not to say the pizza wasn't good enough. The Pizza was also one of the best I have tasted for the price, if not the best. You will surely get your money's worth over here. The Oreo shake was also good but for me 'Nawabi shake' outshafowded everything else. Looking forward to another visit really soon.

After an underwhelming experience at another place, we headed to Macazzo to satisfy our remaining hunger with some good quality food. This place seemed to the perfect destination, with good ratings and a lot of good things said about it. Located on a main road itself with no need to go wandering through the bylanes, this place is very subtle with the decoration. A distinct music theme runs throughout, with posters of Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and Pink Floyd hung on the walls. There's a spiral staircase that leads downstairs into a basement now fashioned into a seating space. Well thought-out architecture in terms of space saving and a good looking one too. There are napkin holders made from vinyls and light shades made from cassettes, which up the quirk quotient up a notch.

Onto the food then, we ordered a pepperoni pizza, chicken stroganoff with parsley rice and an Oreo shake. The pizza was a thin crust one, with just the right delicate balance between crunchy crust and soft mozzarella. It tasted very good, albeit with a sprinkling of oregano. The chicken stroganoff was another winner, the portion is a bit of a mix, with too much for one person and too little for two, so order according to your hunger. Very well spiced, this comes in a delicious cheese sauce with almost minced chicken with mushrooms thrown in for good measure.
And the Oreo shake... well that's a winner. Well made and very smooth but also very cold. üòÇ

Overall it was a great experience, good food that was also light on the pocket. Will come back to try the steaks and the burgers.

Jst 1 minute walk from Menoka Cinema, this place is easily accessible through Rabindro Sarabor metro or by Gariahat route. 
The interior is cozy and comforting and has (probably as far as my experience goes) the best staff very cordial. 
I was there with 2 of my frnds and we ordered 3 different dishes 
Chicken lasagna
Alabama Grilled Chicken
Chicken Stroganoff with parsley rice
Brownie with ice cream for desert. 
All the food were mouth watering absolutely delicious both quality and quantity was good and more than enough for a person. 
Coming to the price it  is very much affordable and reasonable.

When we heard about this new eatery in Southern Avenue, we just had to visit there. When we entered the place, it was already filled with customers. They had spaces downstairs as well as upstairs with the downstairs constructed very recently. The interior is beautifully decorated with photo frames and hanging canvasses of James Bond and other popular movie characters. The staff were courteous enough as they quickly arranged for a table for us. We ordered Blue Lagoon, Masala Cold Drinks and Fresh Soda Lime for coolers. For the Starters, we had ordered Bourbon Glazed BBQ Chicken Wings and Masala french fries. And for the mains, we ordered Manhattan Pizza, Patiala Pizza and Chicken Nasi Goreng for the Mains. The coolers were beautifully served in decorated jars and in sufficient quantities. The BBQ wings were tender with the Bourbon sauce being the winner. The Pizzas were what one wants Pizzas to be. The crust was on the thinner side and full of toppings and chicken. The Manhattan pizza had Barbeque chicken toppings and the Patiala Pizza had Tandoori Chicken as toppings. The Chicken Nasi Goreng was fried rice cooked Indonesian style with Chicken and sausages in it with egg toppings. It was spicy and well seasoned and a bowl of it is enough to satisfy a hungry appetite. This new eatery with no GST gives us more than many reasons to visit again. The menu has a lot of options and this is a must visit place for foodies.

Macazzo opened it's doors to hungry diners last year but we managed to squeeze in just yesterday! The food scene in Kolkata has been so dynamic in the past few years, that restaurants open with great fanfare and very soon, get lost in the cacophony around. The standalone ones often can't bear the red balance sheet, shutting down soon after and a few which are backed by deep pockets manage to stick around for a while. Thus, it's not a bad idea to visit a restaurant after few months of it's opening, to see whether it has lived up to the hype and more importantly, whether it has been able to hold the diner's interest after the hullabaloo about the launch dies down.


Macazzo is not such. There are many places ot could have opened up, but, it choose to open it's doors in the shadowy lanes of south Kolkata. The decision to open up at a place and most importantly, go beyond the "typical" Bengali comfort zone is a huge plus point. The way they managed to squeeze space out in an already blink and miss place, it's highly unexpected. Kudos to the team! To put it simply - the food and decor of Macazzo celebrates the urban youth. It takes local ingredients and builds them up into fine dishes, served with a characteristic touch. 


The interiors are a pleasure to our eyes. Wooden walls, cassette taped above lights, jazz music in the background and an urban hip vibe are sure to put one in the mood. Whether you decide to drop in for lunch or dinner, this cute lil place is always buzzing and is alive with enthusiastic diners and staff serving with a smile. 


The menu is eclectic and a pleasure to skim through. We decided upon instantly to go for Darjeeling Pork Platter (standard). Accompanied with Hot Moccachino and a jar of fresh lime juice for my friend. Moccachino was a serious disappointment. Thankfully, it was the only thing that let us down here. Coming to the pork platter, it's nothing short of amazing. The much sought-after dish would leave you spoilt for choice. Sausages, meat loaf, salami, bacon, fried egg and buttered toast. Though I personally felt, bacon strips could have been prepared better. Other than that, everything taste  delicious! Fresh lime juice was refreshing as always. Now if you've been salivating all along this review, let me remind you that we hadn't even mentioned the star-of-the-day yet! It's Hot Buffalo Wings. The undoubtedly hidden gem! Deciding what to order to wrap up our meal, I (mistakenly) went for this fiery dish. Though it was burn-through-your-body hot, yet, it was a great pleasure to nibble around with it. Cooked to perfection, this dish is highly recommended to those who dine on the wild side. 


In the crowded dining scene these days, restaurants come and go in a blink. Few manage to stand the test of time and even lesser manage to create a space in the hearts of diners. Macazzo is not about uber luxury and fancy dinning. It is about celebrating the food is the most desirable way and serving it with characteristic warmth that makes us going back for the second or the third time. A great place for a meal with your pals, family or even for some time alone with your dear one!

Located in a bit of an odd place, Macazzo is packing a wallop of a surprise behind its doors. We walked down the spiral staircase to find ourselves in a wooden-planks and old-casettes adorned cozy place.  A fusion of a dine-in with caf√© styled food in the canvas of a jazz dive-bar atmosphere was all and more than what we expected.

We ordered a Mochaccino, two Fresh Lime Sodas(Sweet), the Darjeeling Pork Platter(Standard) with an extra fried egg and to cap it off with a blast, the Hot Buffalo Wings.

The mochaccino was a tad sweeter than expected but the fresh lime soda was with the perfect balance of sweetness and citrus flavour.

Now coming to the food-

1. Darjeeling Pork Platter - The standard platter had meatloaves, salamis, sausages, bacons, two fried eggs and butter toast. The platter sounds intriguing and starting to take the lucrative bites do give a hearty feel but one can't miss the overall monotony of the dish. The bacon pieces could have been crisped up more and the fat rendered a bit more so that it was less chewy. The usual saltiness of bacon was quite missing. The meatloaves and the salamis were perfectly cooked but the sausages felt like little nuggets! The sausages tasted okay, though. However, we did enjoy the dish as a whole.

2. Hot Buffalo Wings - Dragon breath indeed. This was the show-stealer. Chicken wings coated with fiery sauce tested us to the extreme...well, me! I'm not much a person to eat food that packs such heat. A little warning to everyone who can't handle such food and yet wants to challenge themselves, do consider taking it at the end and not as an appetizer. This will numb your palette and you might not be able to fully appreciate the flavour of the main course or even the dessert. I chugged water and the sweet lime soda relentlessly, all the while taking deep breaths and going back to the devilish wings! This is a must try for those who are up for the challenge...

The service was a bit slow but the staff was cordial and attentive. They listened to our wishes and also to some suggestions carefully. Unique setup with soul food created a memorable experience.

The menu is really unique and impressive. We ordered chilli hot chocolate first. This is a unique combination of chilli flakes and hot chocolate. Then we tried bacon wrapped sausages for the starters. It was a bit disappointing as that food could be easily prepared at home. Then we had Pork Nasi Goreng. It had Indonesian fried rice, which was a bit spicy but delicious, roasted pork and bacon and a fried egg. We also tried Cordon Bleu with mash. It was 2 pieces of deep fried chicken, stuffed with pork ham and cheese. It also had 2 pieces of bread and mashed potato. Overall the food was good, but the quantity was less.

I generally avoid giving full 5 stars to places unless they are perfect. And trust me when I say this, this place is perfect. The first thing that blew my mind off were the loaded fries with mozzarella and bacon bits. I was waiting for the next mindblowing experience as we had ordered pork ribs. I had never tasted such perfect slow-cooked pork ribs that actually melts in your mouth. The ambience, location, service and needless to say..the food was on point. Thank you Macazzo. I will come back to you again.

A food joint where you'll find some continental delights. Was on my checklist for a long time and man, it didn't disappoint even a tiny bit....for starters i tried some French Fries with cheese and bacon and also some pork chops, and I guarantee that this is one of the best Pork Chops i tried in a long time. The decor was good overall with superb service and it is also pocket friendly. The location of the restaurant is excellent too. In short, it is a must try if u r a continental junkie

This place happened just by chance.Tried this place with a friend who owns another restaurant.Honestly I wouldn't have tried this place had i not been suggested.From the looks of it from outside and that name,it seemed like it was trying too hard to be a swanky.But I was wrong in judging the place.
Its a small little place that has recently added a few more tables in the brilliantly utilized basement.The metal spiral staircase,the wood panels on the wall,the old cassettes used in the lights,retro posters and simple yet comfortable seating makes up for a very cozy and comfortable space to spend time.
we started off with the buffalo wings which as the guy who takes the order suggested was quite spicy.But what a perfect blend of spiciness,crispiness,meat and batter.The buffalo sauce added the spiciness but kept the outer layer crispy which makes this a must try.Then we ordered Pork Chops with Mustard mash and veggies.The chops were finely made.Meat was so tender that it fell off the bone clean!Loved the caramelized onion and the sauce it was dipped in.The veggies were well cooked too.However the mustard mash was not to my liking.It had an overpowering pungent smell and the mashed potato was the packaged variety which has its own weird and artificial texture.The last dish was the pulled pork and bacon burger.After absolutely loving the first two dishes,our expectations were set high.But we had to return the first burger as the pulled pork didn't seem fresh.the texture was imperfect and very dry.It had an overpowering charred flavor to it.The chef very kindly got us a new burger.However this burger too had the same charred flavor to it.More like burnt flavor.Ordered fresh lime juice twice and was happy to find consistency in it. Didn't try any mocktail or desserts.Overall the experience was very nice.I will come back soon.Good place for peaceful eating experience. Its Pocket Friendly too.The service was quick,staff were very friendly too.Good job guys!

Had a horrible experience. Whatever I ordered from the menu card was unavailable. So the choices were limited. Ordered French fries. After waiting for 30 minutes for that to be served, I decided to quit. Thankfully they did not charge me for the unserved food. That‚Äôs why I decided on 1.5 rating.

This place totally rocks. The food blows ur mind away. It's very clean which is v. Imp for me.  Cozy, comfortable ambience. Coming to the main thing the yummy food.  The food is great. Mock tails ar fab, meat is juicy tender melt in your mouth.  I went there with my two friends. We ordered a sandwich a rice dish called Nasi goreng and a pork steak. The quantity I tell u is huge.  We were struggling to finish them. And the kiwi mocktl was super. And it's not very expensive. Plz try the food there.  The staffs are very well mannered.  It's a must go.

A small cafe with nice interiors located close to Rabindra Sarovar Stadium . We ordered a Pina colada , which was very tasty and so refreshing that we were immediately energised after the hectic day.
Also we ordered a hot chocolate, french fries and garlic bread. Both the hot chocolate and garlic bread were really yum. The fries somehow coukd have been better.
 The staff is great and very helpful. 
Prices on menu inclusive of all taxes.

It is a small but cosy cafe located just beside menoka cinema. The location is a prime one. We orfered kiwi mojito n blue lagoon. They were as per standard. For starters we had sweet chilli wings. They were good enough. For main course,we ordered chicken stroganoff. I have tasted better strogannofs. So nothing special. Chicken lasagna was very good,freshly baked, tasty, loaded with cheese. Must try. We ordered a chicken manhattan pizza. It was a thin crust one with lot of toppings. However, service is a bit slow. Otherwise, everything is great

Since, I don't go out much. This is one of the best pocket friendly place I've ever been. Firstly, the ambience is overwhelming. We been there on one rainy day. Secondly, we had Hot Buffalo Wings, which comes with eight generous pieces of wings tossed with rich spicy buffalo sauce and it's too spicy and amazing. We also had Chicken pasta with creamy pesto. It was also good. Yet. I have other types to taste as well and this urge will definitely get me to that place again someday. :'D

Right on the Southern Avenue, this place is easy to locate. 
As fancy as the name sounds, this place is equally fancy in its interior decorations. Starting from the posters of your favourite bands on the walls to the mini postered lanterns hanging from the ceilings, the vintage feels, wooden decors, the napkin holders and even the wonderful music playing in the background. 

Coming to the food- it's amazing as well. We ordered British hot chocolate from the hot beverages and Oreo shake from the coolers. While the hot chocolate tasted usual, the Oreo shake was a bang on 10! Chilled, frothy, yummy, just the right amount of sugar.
For starters, we ordered french fries and chicken strips with sweet chilly dip. They were very good but nothing extraordinary.

From the mains, we had prawn and fish Thermidor. It was very creamy and cheesy. Loved it!@

And finally for the desserts, we had brownie with vanilla ice cream because why not? It's a classic! And we were not disappointed at all :)

At times, a name creates a tingling in the brain and I get curious, to know more about it, to get to the place.
Arriving at this place was a result of that impulse. The name kinda appealed to me with its Italian grace, and we actually waited more than a week till it was re-opened after maintenance.
Lucky, I got a treat here.
But hey, some water was surely poured on my hype as I realised how less spacious the joint is. The pictures got me fooled.
Inevitably had to wait a few mins before getting the call.
However the place has woody vibes and amazing posters of my fav bands. The napkin holders have the impression of discs. The lamps bore the indicia as well.

About the main story.
Shakes to shake us, Nawabi and Oreo shake, the latter being more suited to my tastebuds. Totally dug it. Chilled, frothy, thick and yummy. Nawabi was a tad bit sweet for me. Nevertheless tasted good.
Had a rather off-start with main course tho. The highly anticipated Pork Chops with Mustard Mash was a major let down, if not more. It was smelly, chewy, had a leathery texture and quite resistant to forks. Definitely not my kind. The mustard mash had the pungency which, instead of mellowing out the dish, made it more rich. Totally not an 'espirit de corps' of a dish.
Evidently, played safe for the next dish.
Bourbon Glazed BBQ Wings being the saving grace, proved yet again the master-race that chicken is. A heap of grilled dark wings, sprinkled with seasame seeds and glazed with Bourbon had a pique taste and a beautiful glisten. A winner.
Thanks to that, mustered a bit of courage to go for another. Chicken Cilantro Kiev with Mash. Ah thankfully the mash complemented the dish this time, instead of being the highlight. Ham wrapped with chicken was a delight. Neither very impinging, nor did it chicken out. A very satisfying package.
Idk if it's me, or the places always seem to run out of the desserts that I want.
Reluctantly turning my eyes away from Brownie with Bailey's Irish Cream, ordered the Chocolate Sundae with Oreo, KitKat, raisins and nuts. It was a deliciously happy and chocolaty glass. Topped with those crunchy treats, and dark creamy chocolate drizzling over the top, it was true solace.
My rating would have definitely gone higher, had the pork been cooked properly. I'd definitely revisit some other time to confirm my belief; they can do better.

Might be small in size, but it has really big things on offer. Ordered French Fries, Fish Finger, Nawabi Shake & Vanilla Shake. Minimum serving time, all the items tasted fantastic but special mention for the full jar Nawabi Shake. I had it at 6pm and surprisingly stomach was still see so full that wasnt able to take my dinner. But yes, one thing i like to point out that the Tartar sauce is not going too well with the Fish Fingers, so please try to offer some other sauce. Even simple tomato sauce will do great.

Stepped into Macazzo after wanting to be here fr quite some time now.. And i am already looking forward to my next visit.. The place is cozy and laid back where u can relax to good music with a Hollywood theme around you.. I couldnt help but notice the unique way the decor has been done.. Coming to food.. It was great value for money.. We had ordered chicken a la kiev and bacon wrapped pork sausages.. There were a whopping 15 sausages on that plate.. And the bacon was pink n fresh.. Loved it. The chicken a la kiev was different n subtle..on a bed of mashed potatoes doused with butter..
The bill was just 580 and that is yayyy.. üòÇ
But i felt bad coz i had no change to tip them üòïüòïüòï coz the staff were very polite n helpful... My bad..üò™

After hearing a lot from many of my common friends, went to visit this place during Durga Puja. I must say it was very easy to locate. To start with the decor, we sat at the underground part of the restaurant and it was still getting the final touches. Apart from the noise, rest everything was fine.
Coming to the food, We ordered one Manhattan Pizza large with some coolers.
People should definitely try the Aam Panna, it will refresh your soul (amazing). Also had cold coffee which was nice also.
The patron of the place was really friendly and was superbly earnest of the fact that they were redecorating and it might be of some inconvenience to us.

Food- 4/5
Value for money- 4/5

Have heard a lot about this restro & decided to visit with my friend in one of the durga puja days. Sadly, they made a special menu for the puja.. which was less alluring. The pasta was good..the chicken alabama was not awesome..but okish. No complains with the strawberry shake..but definitely with the Oreo shake. We never had such yukiee Oreo shakes in our lives. I felt so pukish that couldn't even drank the full. We generally find Oreo chunks in an Oreo shake..but the manager said that's not how they make it..they mix the whole thing.. with all the ingredients.. which again may be their style..but didn't intrigue us. The staff & manager was courteous. We scare to go there & spend on their food .

If you are looking for a tiny eatery to fill you stomach and save you from burning a hole in your wallet 
This is the place 
Located on the lines of lake road and sarat Bose road crossing
This place is a must try for all foodies 
Went there with a couple of friends 
We settled for brownie smoothie, one 6 " nawabi chicken pizza and bourbon glazed BBQ wings 
The bourbon glazed chicken wings were absolutely mouth watering .. 
The quantity and quality are both satisfactory 
Did miss on having the monster burgers 
Next time for sure 
I would still feel a better ambience and space would be great for this amazing place 
Still has this college canteen vibe  .

I heard a lot about macazzo from friends and family so was on high hopes when I visited this place during the pujo. And I was unfortunately disappointed. Maybe it's because of the high demand and over crowd due to the occasion but it surely didn't get me interested enough to go there again.
Food we ordered- fresh lime soda, French fries loaded with cheese and bacon, narsi goren fried rice, chicken pasta with cheese sauce. 
I only liked the starter ,rest are questionable. 
First they took like 50 mins to bring the first order and I am not even going to start with timing the rest. Narci goren rice felt more like fried rice filled with tomato sauce . And the pasta was undercooked with very little site of cheese sauce. 
The menu looked tempting and a lot of my close friends have braged about it. Maybe they just had a bad day.
Overall I am disappointed.

LOCATION: located very close to Deshapriya park, this is one very busy cafe during the pujas.

We went to this place during ‚ÄúSaptami‚Äù and found a long queue waiting outside. We had to wait for more than 30 mins to get a vacant table for two. Also their menu chart was customised due to high order rates and we found very limited items on the list that was handed over to us. The food took more than 40 mins to arrive and we were hungry as hell. The only thing that kept us patient was the friendly management system there.

Now coming to the food we ordered:

1. OREO SHAKE‚Äî probably the best oreo shake in town and we were surprised to find that they could maintain the quality of this drink even during the busy hours. It was very tasty and creamy and full of oreo cookies.

2. AMERICANO‚Äî pretty much served as a refreshment after the tiresome journey from the far end of the city to here and then the long queues everywhere. They served the americano with brown sugar.

3. PORK MONSTER BURGER‚Äî as the name suggests it had double patty of pork and double cheese. I am pretty sure it must have a delightful dish to try on other less busy days, but the quality dwindled that day plus few others could detect a strong smell in it.

4. PORK LASAGNA‚Äî we were in a hurry to get back home so we had to pack the lasagna back home. It tasted pretty well and both the pork and lasagna was cooked well and was filled with cheese and mozzarella. A must try here.

Pretty sure will visit here during the off seasons.
Now regarding the ambience the cafe is pretty small with a basement seating as well, but well it is puja and you are bound to have loud and noisy puja hangout groups sitting in cafes. So yes the noise destroyed our mood a bit.
Refer to my account for pictures.

Service are pretty good though there is only one person serving and he is pretty fast and very friendly... 16 people at once can be sitted...
Ambience is pretty good....
Coming to the food We ordered 

1ST Aam Panna --- This has nothing new to it though its good...

2ND Sweet chilli Chicken wings --- which was just mouth watering and had amazing taste...

3RD Pork chops served with Mustard mash and veggies --- which was the show stealer, the taste of this dish had my mouth and mind blown, it is just amazing, one of the most well done pork dishes i have ever eaten....

4TH Chocolate pizza --- For desert its a good dish allthough it could have been better...

Overall experience I am sure going to visit again for that pork dish alone...

Great food, cozy ambiance. The quantity was more than enough. Getting quality continental food on such price is a great thing for any foodie. It is a must visit place. Though less place and during peak time you might have to wait and the service can be delayed. But the food is worth waiting. üòá Even the behaviour of the manager will make you feel good. Ordered chicken lasagna and Darjeeling platter üëåüëç

It is located near kalighat metro at southern avenue...
Service are pretty good though there is only one person serving and he is pretty fast and very friendly... 16 people at once can be sitted...
Ambience is pretty good....
Coming to the food We ordered 

1ST Aam Panna --- This has nothing new to it though its good...

2ND Sweet chilli Chicken wings --- which was just mouth watering and had amazing taste...

3RD Pork chops served with Mustard mash and veggies --- which was the show stealer, the taste of this dish had my mouth and mind blown, it is just amazing, one of the most well done pork dishes i have ever eaten....

4TH Chocolate pizza --- For desert its a good dish allthough it could have been better...

Overall experience I am sure going to visit again for that pork dish alone...

Service was little late but the weather was ambient nd environment was comfy. Cozy place in the underground perfect for hangout. Will recommend. Special thing was their soft drinks service mug and bill without any GST taxes. Perfect place to stop by while u r near Lake Road.

This is actually a surprise package, I walked in with decent expectations. Not only did the ratings on Zomato add to it but also the word of mouth. I went on Saptami, couldn't find a place, returned on Ashtami, got in thankfully.

So we ordered a Brooklyn Pizza, a Strawberry shake and a sweet lime soda. 

The pizza was REALLY good. I actually liked this way more than Domino's or anything. The shake was a bit thick and sweet but no complaints. I can't say I didn't enjoy sipping.

But the best part was definitely the behavior of the people who run this place. You will love the way they serve you. Very personal.

And yeah! Very reasonable pricing. All that costed 410.

So please please go. You all will love this place.

At first the food is really great, specially the burgers and hot chocolate. I will also recommend the chicken cordon bleu and pork chops. The presentation of foods and beverages are simple yet attractive. The ambience and decorations are loosely based on retro pop culture references. I am also a fan of their friendly service.

Verrrrrrrrrryyyyyy slow service. 
And,the wait isn't even worth it. 
We ordered a pizza and it was so sour. Literally.  The crust was like a biscuit. 
Then,we ordered the chicken darjeeling platter from the main course. Omg. The salami,the sausage,everything was so weird. They were basically tasteless. 
The sodas we ordered,were sour as hell.

We went there after seeing such high review on zomato. But,hugely disappointed. 
NOT RECOMMENDED.

This place came highly recommended and for the most parts,it delivered. We had lasagna and friends chicken burger with french fries and it was good value for money. The ambience is beautiful, the decoration is nice and petite and the place is located at a very prominent spot. The service was a bit late but that is understandable given that it is the festive season. Would love to be back here soon!

We visited Macazzo this evening. It was a bit crowded since it's puja time in Calcutta. The place is a ground plus underground level restaurant. The decor is quite quirky with old cassettes as lampshades and Stereos as napkin holders. The food here is really good. All the items sounded mouth watering but since we were only 2 of us we couldn't try many dishes. We had the bacon and cheese fries which was amazing. Chicken cordon bleu was quite alright..And the Darjeeling pork platter brought back some wonderful memories of sitting at kaventers in the cold. Will definitely be going back for more and also to try other stuff.. it's a relief to find so many pork items on the menu as opposed to places with no beef and no pork..

There are very few restaurants that I have a given a full rating and this place fulfils every criteria and I couldn't hold back. Located beside the Southern Avenue, this small cafe is famous for its Italian and continental dishes. One can get lots of varieties in meat(specifically pork)and preparation over here. Chilly pork and glazed BBQ wings are my favourites. Pizzas are filled with toppings and made thin on the crust. Staff behaviour is awesome and a special thanks to the team for making our visit worth remembering (in a good way) :p

This was my third visit to Macazzo today. It's already become one of my favourite eateries. The bacon and cheese loaded french fries is to die for ! Was super happy to see they've expanded. It's also particularly impressive how tirelessly the owner greets every customer with immense courtesy and takes care of the orders and makes it a point to go about asking how the food is, every single time. Needless to say, I'm coming back again very very soon !

Had a terrible experience with macazzo. We had ordered a plate of buffalo wings, after taking a bite into the wings my friend and I got a disgusting smell from the chicken, it smelt like the inside of a bathroom, it was extremely bad, my appetite died and I felt like throwing up. Sadly the owner of the restaurant knew about spoilt chicken being served however didn't bother to rectify the mistake or even speak to the guest. The waiting time on the food was 45 mins. Even the chicken tenders were terrible , they were soggy and soft, the restaurant was thigh piece instead of breast. The BBQ sauce was exactly like soy sauce. Idk wat the owner was thinking.

Went in there with 3 friends on the eve of Shasti 17'. Had to wait for 10 mins as they didn't had any table of 4 ready. After that ordered two starters - Buffalo chicken wings and Roasted sweet chilly pork. Both of them was quite good. Ordered Chicken Steak, chicken cordon bleu which had pork ham stuffed inside chicken and Chicken Stronganoff with parsley rice which to me was the best dish of the day.

Ambience wise good. A very good place to hangout with friends or families both.

That's all folks, until next time.. :)

Located at the crossing of southern avenue and the road towards menoka cinema, just opposite rabindra sarovar stadium, this place should fall among the cheapest cafes in south kolkata, serving a great deal of tasty food. Even though the place is small with seating for about 15-16 people, it's well setup like a proper decent cafe. The staff are very courteous and the best part about this place is they wont hurry you with serving food and you can spend a lot of time here. The most attractive part is the way they serve the coolers and shakes, in glass bottle jars with handle. It looks really sweet. Coming to the food and drinks, their oreo shake tastes really good with the perfect amount of chocolaty taste and optimum coldness. The chicken wings starters are 8 in number and taste really good with proper crispiness and good texture. We also had chicken stroganoff which simply tasted out of the world. Th amount of chicken, the cheesy gravy, the texture,the amount of serving..its a heaven for cheese lovers. The pizzas are also great, with thin crust, a lot of cheese and toppings. Overall this is a great cafe and i must specially mention, that its cheap, specially when you see the prices in the menu, it's all inclusive of taxes!! 
Staff-4.5/5
Ambience-4/5(theres always room for improvement)
Food-4.5/5

I am surely going to visit this place again sometime soon, to taste their other dishes like the chicken nasi goreng and cordon bleu that i have heard a lot about.

We ordered British Hot Chocolate, Sweet Chilly Chiken Wings and Chicken Nasi Goreng. The quality of the food was really appreciable, a complete pleasure to a foodie. Chiken Nasi Goring and Sweet Chilly Chiken Wings went beyond my expectation.

Cozy setup but the ambiance was decent. They treat us like their friend, I just loved their hospitality. Price was reasonable. The food here is worth every penny.
I would love to visit this cafe again and again .

Macazzo was suggested by a friend's friend and I decided to stop by and that is one of the best suggestions I got. The cafe is an absolute gem.its situated in southern Avenue at menoka cinema crossing.
Ambience- I do like there effort considering the small space. The music is spot on but only thing I don't like about this place is the sitting arrangement and cramped spaces. It's a gem in waiting but it definitely needs to expand.
Food- one of the best to offer in this city. The pork is awesome, actually everything I tried was just simply tasty.highly recommended-cheese and bacon loaded french fries,chicken fillet with cheese,bacon n fries,cheese loaded pasta.
Service- they were corteus and warm but one more area that needs work is they have to hire more ppl
Cost- very reasonable. Actually dirt cheap considering the food on offer. Total hit with cash strapped college crowd.
Overall an amazing joint. Highly recommended.

Their menu is very different from what you generally see.¬†The place is homely and one suitable for a date with a book or person.¬†Start off with their chilli hot chocolate, such an amazing preparation. I'm still drooling over it.¬†I also took an oreo shake which was goof too.For main course, took their pork platter(Darjeeling) next. And not that I haven't had better platter ever, but not in Kolkata and not at that price. We then took another chicken steak with mushroom sauce which was also very nicely prepared.¬†I was so filled that I didn't have the chance to try out their desserts.¬†All in all, what I love about this place is that they exactly know what amount of which ingredients to use and serve authentic continental food.¬†Would love to visit again.

The food is quite good and tasty as well. Passing through the cafeteria we entered for having some coffee and shakes.Though we ordered beyond shakes and coffee....üòÇüòÇ
1.roasted sweet chilli pork
2.oreo shake
3.chicken nasi goreng (indonesian rice)[totally a new thing for us but the experience was quite good]
4.chicken pasta with tomato sauce..and a pleasing aam panna/masala cold drink at the end..

Service was quite good with a reasonable price....and the behaviour of the staff and the owner was descent...they know well how to satisfy their customers..

One disadvantage i would say...they need to expand their place so that they can accomodate more people....
Otherwise a must visit cafeteria.....

Situated near Menoka cinema mall, this cafe though very small but its a perfect place for getting your evenings sorted. We ordered a cold coffee‚Äã, a cafe latte, an oreo shake and a darjeeling pork platter. The cold coffee i must say was a bit disappointing because it was thinned down mostly by water than milk. But the disappointing cold coffee was made up by the pork platter. It was one of the best platter i have had in a while. Nothing that i can complain of. The other two drinks were good nothing extraordinary. The platter certainly makes it a place worth visiting again.

Went there with a friend with the sole purpose of hogging.. So let's come straight to what we ordered
1. Rose mint iced tea
2. Chicken stroganoff
3. Chocolate sundae

1. Personally I didn't like the flavor of rose mint so had to finish it off without actually enjoying it. 

2. Chicken Stroganoff was out of the world. The quantity was generous with ample amount of chicken mushroom corn. It was bliss to say the least. 

3. Chocolate sundae was good. I wanted to order the brownie desserts but they didn't have brownie so had to go for this. I felt oreo was an alien in the sundae coz I don't really like oreo in chocolate ice cream specially when u have kitkat chunks in them too. 

Would like to visit again to try out other cheesy creamy dishes.

This place is a paradise for meat lovers.
The space is ingeniously utilised, with Bob Dylan and Elvis decors. The band posters add to the ambience. 
80s music sets the groove. 
The French Fries with bacon and pulled pork is a must try. The chicken steak with mushroom sauce, sausages, Veggies and Pesto mash is heaven on a plate. If you want a fatty heaven, try the Pork Chops.

For days I had been wanting to visit this place...and to my respite,it lived up to all the expectations I had. To start with my jargon...first up...do not go by their quaint little ambience. The decor gives you the feel of some sassy, retro-american food joint. When it comes to their repertoire, this place is really insane and for pork-loving people like me...Guys,this is a complete paradise...!!! I was baffled with the choices I had from their ensemble and to my delight...each and every dish I had ordered were totally lip smacking. I would love to visit this place over and over again, coz for me,this is one of my top comfort food havens...!!!

I was very much interested after hearing about this place... it's a small corner type restaurant in rabindra sadonar area.. ambience is pretty good and spanish songs added a little bit of continent atmosphere.. staffs are really good and they are really descent...Food quality is too good and price us also reasonable..we ordered chicken nasi goreng..though I was totally blindfolded about this item but the cover of egg omelette added a mouthwatering taste...specially the blue lagoon and oreo shake was fantastic...we have decided to visit here once again

Definitely a pocket friendly place. I would recommend the pulled pork with loaded cheese French fries, and the bbq chicken wings. Also the double burgers, which has two chicken/pork patties. We even got the drinks on the house (don't really know why though).

Had the hog lover's reloaded pizza. The craziest pizza I've had in a while (read: ever). The Pork Pasi Noreng was good too. (A tad too vinegary for my liking, though). The retro ambience with napkin holders and lampshades made out of VHS tapes and cassettes adds to a very Southern Avenue-ish experience. 
Will visit once again for the Darjeeling pork platter.

Found this place while taking a stroll down the Southern Avenue. 
The ambience is amazing here.
The place is warm and cozy perfect for the heavy pouring afternoon i went there. The staff was courteous and treated us with great care.
We had ordered a plate of chicken wings and a chicken Stroganoff with parsley rice.

The chicken wings were one of the best that I've tasted across many caf√©'s. Not the best. But surely top 5. The quantity too I AMAZING for the  price we pay. They're served hot with what seemed like a honey glazed sauce, nonetheless tasty and food worthy of soul not stomach. 

The Chicken Stroganoff was nothing extraordinary but it was okay. But given the rainy day and us being a bit drenched. The super hot and steamy bowl of goodness did help us. The sauce was creamy and was just oozing out through our taste-buds. 
Again quantity wise with the price tag is amazing!

The playlist over here is the one to visit for all those who love the classic rock'n roll phase of music.

Definitely a place to visit again and again!

After taking a couple of home deliveries finally visited the joint on a rainy afternoon for a lunch. Macazzo is one of the trending cafes in the city right now as it has an extensive menu at an affordable price. 

It is situated just at the turning point while going from Southern Avenue towards Menoka cinema hall.  The decor is simple with posters of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles adorning the walls and tissue holders made out of records. It accomodates around 15-20 people max. 
We had ordered fish fingers, Veggie Pizza, Chicken Cilantro Kiev and Kiwi mojito. Fish fingers served with tartar sauce tasted nice with the coating made of some kind of flour instead of the usual bread crumbs.  Veggie Pizza was loaded with fresh veggies and cheese and was delicious. I found the crust to a little chewy. Chicken Cilantro Kiev had a nice twist to it as the freshness of cilantro was a welcome contrast against the rich buttery chicken. Had the chicken been a bit softer it would have been perfect. My favourite though has to be hands down the mashed potatoes that was served with it... I could eat a bowl of that. Lastly, the kiwi mojito was the star of the meal with its fresh fruity flavour. 

All in all it was a pleasant experience. The staff was courteous and service was efficient. Nice place to hangout with friends and have a pocket friendly meal.

I went here after college for a get-together with 4 friends.
We ordered the hot chocolate, chicken wings(3 plates) , chicken cordon blue and pasta, along with virgin mojito and another drink.
The place wasn't crowded at all, and that was a nice thing as we made quite a noise :D¬†The decor is amazing. The ambiance is very placating and mellow. The staff is courteous. However, they can be faster.
The drinks were good. The hot chocolate took forever to arrive, but it didn't disappoint. Not the best hot chocolate in town, though.
The chicken wings were simply amazzziiiiing !!!!! Yeah, definitely among the best chicken wings in town ! ¬† The sauce is perfect, the taste is mind blowing and the quantity is satisfactory.
The pasta and chicken cordon blue weren't bad either, and the portions served were impressive.
I plan to go back to this place soon and try more dishes, along with chicken wings :D

Awesome teeny, tiny cafe with beautiful beautiful interior. When we got there, there was hardly any staff, only the guy at the counter was serving and taking orders, felt pity for the bloke as he had a broken arm. He was a very friendly guy and made sure we were comfortable throughout our time there.¬†

We had taken Peach Iced tea, Lemon Iced tea and they were made just great! Precise sourness needed with tea flavours, nice and refreshing they were.¬†

¬†Next, we jumped straight to mains; Veg Stroganoff with Parsley Rice. It was heavenly. the first bite was enough to get the taste buds feast for the day. It was just too good.¬†

So, excellent ambiance, perfect music, great staff (only a single person was there though) and palatable food, a perfect combination for an idea of a well spent evening.¬†

Deducting .5 as the menu seemed a little limited.

The walls adorned with pictures of legends  (the Rat pack being my personal favourite) and the good quality food we had, I had to choose this as one of my favourites. The bourborne glazed BBQ wings were excellent. The Darjeeling chicken platter (enough for 2) was amazing. The kiwi mojito was really refreshing. The nawabi shake was good but I would personally prefer the kiwi mojito.
Overall experience was great, looking forward to visit again.

I have been dreaming for a long time to go there. 

The place is for extact pure rock lovers. 

Its quite far away from rabindra sarobar main gate. 

I have reached there after losing a lot of calories to gain a lot of. The ambience was quite impressive. 
It was a small cafe. Hardly 15-20 people can be there. 


The staffs are so cool and moderate. 


We have ordered a brownie shake.
A plate of pork Nasi goreng. And pasta chicken lasagna. ! 


All food was awesome. 

But a bad point was cockroach would eat with you. I have complained. 

More than that i have requested them to play " wish you were here ". 

Low music. Great food. Good friends. I wish i would stay there for a long time.   .. But forever. 

Wishes are wishes only. ! 

Have a look on the food. 

You will definately get a good long memorable evening there with your favourite old 70's band.üòò

This place is located in Southern Avenue.

Ambience - This is a small outlet with approximately 15-20 seating arrangements. The decor is really appealing with vibrant colours. It has posters of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and so on. The music that's been played is great. Sets the mood ! üòç

Food - Ordered British Hot Chocolate, Oreo shake, Rose & Mint Iced Tea, Chicken Strips and Bong Fish Fry & Chips.
British Hot Chocolate is worth mentioning. It tasted superb. üòç Chicken Strips were satisfactory. Fish Fry was not good. It had a thick layer and the it was hard, which should not be. So Fish Fry was a disappointment. üòí

Service - The guy who was serving us was so courteous. The hospitality is commendable. His smiling face every time he served us, is an add on to this outlet. That's how one must greet ! ‚ò∫

So guys, if you wanna hangout with your peeps and looking for a good cafe, This place is a Must Try üòç

This place was on my wish list for a long time. Finally visited it and it did not disappoint. Decor is basic and comfortable, nothing too commendable about it.
Order- We ordered the brownie shake, bourbon glazed chicken BBQ wings and the chicken cordon bleu.
Food- loved the brownie shake! It was creamy, flavorful and had the right texture. Chicken wings were big in size and there were 8-10 pieces, difficult for two persons to finish! Taste was unique specially due to the bourbon.
Chicken cordon bleu is basically pork covered with chicken which is deep fried along with cheese and butter and served with mashed potato and bread. Quantity really impressed me again. Can easily be shared by 3 people.
Pocket pinch- 700 INR
Overall- this place is a gem and a haven for meat lovers. The friendly behavior of the staff and the owner is an added bonus!

After a long time got a chance of giving a good review to this place situated near lake kalibari. Its easy to locate and all in all had a good experience. Coming to the food we ordered one hot chocolate, one garlic bread, one black coffee, one veg burger and one chicken fried wings. The hot chocolate was the best among among the lot. Loved every sip of it. Garlic bread was pretty decent along with the black coffee. The burger was served with fries which tasted good as well. The staff here is extremely courteous and well behaved carrying a smile on their face and making you feel warm as if in home. The quantity served was pretty good and really unexpected comparing to other cafes in the town. Though it wasnt upto the 5 rating mark coz the chicken fries were waayyy too oily to be consumed. Thats one area which can be looked upon.. apart from these, the pricing is pretty good when compared with the taste and quantity of the food. Would love to explore it more and definitely hoping to visit it again, soon.

This place is absolutely amazing. I have been there atleast 5 times by now and every single it was actually very good. Think about a Virgin mojito or kiwi mojito on a summer evening or a cup of hot chocolate on a rainy day this place is just perfect. Do try their chicken wings of different flavours although my personal favourite one is sweet chilli chicken wings. The pizza .. the pasta.. the burgers all are extremely good. Worth going again .

Although a tad bit overpriced, Macazzo serves delicious food. We had ordered masala French fries, Darjeeling Chicken Platter (standard size) and Chicken Steak with Mushroom sauce and veggies. Like is said, the food was excellent, although quantity would be just enough for a person with medium appetite. 
I would have given 4 stars but for the tiny strand of hair that we came across halfway into the steak. The staff was pretty courteous as they served us another fresh plate of steak to compensate.

There are some restaurants which met my expectation when I visited there having heard about some positive feedbacks about them. And there is Macazoo .. As of now, I visited this place thrice & every time it was sheer happiness of meting expectation (sometimes exceeding it..) , set by my previous visits. Located in Southern avenue (on the same lane where Menoka Cinema is situated), this is one of my favorite place to have food with a group. And you love Pork, this is your Heaven on Earth. 

This is a nice cozy place with cool ambience. The innovative d√©cor and other settings immediately put you on the adda mode. The staffs are helpful & courteous. They, along with the owner himself generously make you feel comfortable. The waiting time is a tad bit higher though. But hey; as they say, all good things take time.     

Coming to food, here‚Äôs my pick from all the items I tasted here.

‚Ä¢	Darjeeling Pork Platter: It‚Äôs a must you are a Pork Lover & a fan of the Pork Platter, served at the famous Kaventers (Darjeeling).  But, do opt for it if you are in group.

‚Ä¢	Pulled Pork Sandwiches: The 2nd most loved item here. It‚Äôs salivating to say the least. 

‚Ä¢	Pork Nasi Goreng: Another marvelous stuff . The classic Nasi Goreng with a Porkish touch. 

‚Ä¢	The French fry items: The French Fry lovers can opt for this. The Bacon one tasted better than the Pulled Pork one. 

‚Ä¢	Hot & Cool Beverages: They serve pretty good coolers.  Kiwi Mojito & Oreo shake are decent enough with Nawabi Shake being my favorite. In Hot Beverage section, Chili Hot Chocolate is something new & an awesome item to opt for.  For safer / more authentic option, they do serve very decent Cappuccino.  

However, every time I went, I stick to the Pork items only so, can‚Äôt comment on the chicken dishes. I will be going back for sure. The Sweet Chili Pork & Pork chops are still in my wish list after all.

Macazzo should be every meat lover's den! 
Situated conveniently in southern avenue. Take the left turn in southern avenue that leads to menoka cinema and Macazzo falls just on the right at the turning point.
The menu is quite impressive with a lot of chicken, fish and pork items both for starters and main course. 
I have tried the Chicken Steak, Pork chops and the Darjeeling Chicken Platter. The quantity is so good that even each of the main-course can be enjoyed by 2 people whole heartedly. 
Loved the Platters specially. The beverages are also refreshing. Overall this place serves really good food for its reasonable pricing. I am going to visit it very often. 
Highly recommended.

Location: southern Avenue, it's in the lane where Menoka cinema is located, drive from Menoka towards lake road and it's on Ur left

This is a small yet cool and well decorated place essentially for evening coffee or a friends' catch up.
It has small tables and can house 20-25 people at a time, decorated with cool posters of pink Floyd and Linkin Park, lights made of olden days cassettes.

We ordered chicken strips, and fish fries with Oreo shake, hot chocolate and rose iced tea. The chicken strips were good and succulent, fish fry had unnecessary layers of coating which is a turn off, Oreo shake was heavenly and so was the hot chocolate whereas the iced tea also pitched well.

I think a little more work on their menu should help them specially with the starters section.

A special mention for the staff who come down with a smile on every call.

Taste of food was overall good and so was the ambience and service.

And it's quite good with the bud

I came to know about this place a while back from a friend and after checking it out on zomato I had made up my mind that I absolutely had to visit this place based mainly on the lure of their chicken and pork platters as I am a bit of a sucker for sausages,salamis and stuff. So I finally got to visit it today accompanied by a friend. Since it was quite early in the day ,we were the 1st ones there and got to choose our own seats. Now reading the zomato reviews I had become of the opinion that the place wasn't really big but personally I felt it was spacious enough...Any bigger,and the ambience which I'll be coming to next would have been lost on the fact that it wouldn't have been cozy enough for the type of decor that this place has. 
Now coming to the ambience,it was one of the better ambience experienced by me at any food joint. Personally,i really loved it! What with Pink Floyd playing in the background,pictures of bob marley,jimi Hendrix,elvis Presley adorning the walls,the napkin holders made either from actual vinyl records or in the shape of the same and the lighting just about done right,it somehow managed to give me a pleasant feel-good vibe about the place. So 5/5 from me for the ambience.
Now coming to the food,we had ordered rose and mint iced tea,brownie shake and the darjeeling chicken platter initially and later on the pulled pork,jalape√±o and cheese sandwich. In the platter,i loved the salami and meat loaf,the toast and egg was decent and the sausages I've had better but not bad either. The brownie shake was lovely too and it served as our beverage as well as dessert as we were too full by the end of the meal to order dessert! :D  The sandwich and chips were really good too. They used garlic bread for the sandwich which just added to the taste. Now am coming to the rose and mint iced tea last because I really don't feel like mentioning anything bad about this place based on the fact that I really really liked this place but staying true to the review,i must give the whole story, mentioning the one bad thing in the very end if I must. Thing is,we really didn't like the drink...It's like something about the flavour of the drink just didn't seat right with us and so after trying to drink it a few times hoping that the taste would grow on us,we decided to abandon it completely and concentrate on the foods that we did like. So 4/5 for the food.
Now coming to the staff,they were really courteous in general like coming and asking whether we needed ketchup or mayo with our food,asking whether we liked the food after each serving and so on and so forth...But the real surprise was when the guy behind the counter who was probably the owner or manager of the place came and asked what was wrong with the rose and mint tea seeing as we had hardly finished 1/3rd of the drink and on saying that the taste wasn't really sitting well with us,he even offered to replace it with something else and though he didn't mention it in clear words but I got the feeling that he was offering the replacement on the house but since we were almost done by that time,we politely declined the offer . Now the cherry on the cake was,when the bill came,I found the amount to be lower than I expected, so on a closer scrutiny I saw that they actually hadn't charged us for the rose and mint tea. I had a feeling that it wasn't a mistake and they had done it on purpose but to be polite I called the owner and told him that they hadn't charged us for the iced tea to which he said and I quote "you don't like it,you don't pay for it!" BAM! That just knocked us out of the park! If I was gonna rate it 4.5 based on the other things,this thing alone begged 5+ but I will have to suffice with 5/5.
We came out of the place grinning ear to ear and a little embarrassed to be honest because we are made to learn that "your decisions,your consequences" and then this guy doesn't charge us for something we Chose to order just because we didn't like it made us feel a bit like we cheated by not paying for the labour that went into making the drink. 
Needless to say that am definitely going back to this place least of all because I didn't get to try any of their dessert and as for suggesting this place to friends and fellow foodies, that will be done in the most glowing of terms! :)

P.s.- pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side if it's considered for college students like us but that doesn't matter cause it's totally worth it for experiencing this place! :)

Overall good ambience and tasty food. Tried Pork Lasagna and chicken strips with hot Buffalo sauce as starters. Ordered main course items - Pork Satay curry with rice, Alabama Grilled Chicken with sausages, Chicken steak with mushroom sauce and Milanesa Nepolitana which is noted as 'Messi's Fav' with other beverage. But the caf√® should work on their serve time. It was too long even if it wasn't a crowded hour. And one reason we couldn't find out that if there is any issue with preparing any ordered item they are coming with an excuse like we may not be able to digest so many items at a time. So we should not go for it. The first time we faced an innovative diplomacy. Nevertheless nice place to hangout.

The experience was bittersweet.  After all the buzz about this place the expectations were high but unfortunately didn't meet our expectations whatsoever.  The quantity of the food is great but the quality is average. We ordered chicken steak which was tough and not upto the mark.

Ordered a lot of things, stroganof, satay, lasagna, steak, chkn strips, wings bla bla.. food was niceee and the amount were enough. One main item is enough for one. Overloaded ourselves and it was very much pocket friendly. No service charge, no gst, everything is included in the price shown in menu!! thumbs up

This is a must visit for all people with a good sense of Western music and classic movies. The ambience is amazing, especially due to Pink Floyd playing in the background. The manager was really polite and friendly with us and made us feel comfortable.

 We had Brownie shake, Oreo Shake, Blue Lagoon, and Fire on the rocks for drinks. We also had Chicken Nasi Goreng and Alabama Grilled Chicken Steak. The proportions are really good and worth the price. The only letdown was the slow service. But this is a place that I'd visit again surely.

The restaurant is located in southern avenue. It's a small place with a nice movie themed decor. The one thing that I love about this place is that it serves good food and is pocket friendly which is the most attracting feature for a college goer like me.
I order their British Hot Chocolate which was perfect. It was chocolaty and warm and was an absolute delight to my palatte.
Then I ordered their Bacon and cheese loaded fries as it was so popular on zomato. Well it's certainly worth the popularity. It was a sinful dish and a must order whenever someone visits this eatery.
Afterwards I ordered their BBQ Chicken Onion and Cheese sandwich. It was decent in taste and was served with chips. I had better sandwiches, so won't recommend this particular dish.
Overall my experience was nice and I would love to visit again.

Food: well this is one place where I can assure you that anything that you order will be brilliant. Personal favourites: Kiwi mojito, BURGERS!!!, lasgane, Darjeeling meat platter. Have to have their burgers though, they're filled with meat and cheese and fries. Dishes range from 200-450. One burger should be more than enough for one person as they are really generous with their quantity. Brownie points for the quirky decor. Definitely recommended :)

Located near Menoka Cinema Hall,Macazzo is one of those small joint where you would get really delicious food at decent price,accompanied by simple but appealing decor & soothing ambience.The service is really quick and prompt,great behaviour and the manager(or owner) takes personal care of your comfort.But yes, it's pretty small and at times can feel claustrophobic too though not that much.
Now coming to the food. We ordered 2 dishes - 

1.Chicken and Cheese Pasta - Was quite different from the normal pastas we have in other places but I really relished it's unusual sensation on the taste buds.
2.Chicken Nasi Goreng - A splendid dish.Never had something like this before.It's tangy taste mixed with small pieces of sausage and poached omlette are a sure delight to the mouth.Do give it a try(Warning:It's really, really, really spicy so beware)

This small eatery is located beside Menoka Cinema (towards the left). It's a cozy diner with courteous staff. We ordered pork chops with mustard mash, bong fish fry and chips, chicken steak with sausages and pesto mash and pork Nasi Goreng. Now, what pissed us off, was the serving time. It took them almost 45 mins to serve the food! Understandable, because they don't have sufficient staff it seemed. Anyway, coming to the food, it's worth the wait. The pork Nasi goreng (Indonesian sticky rice with bacon and roasted pork) was spicy yet not over the top. If you have tried the same at ASIA HOUSE (considered to serve the best Nasi Goreng in town) you may find this one even better. Chicken steak with pesto mash was moderately tasty as I found the pesto sauce a bit pungent. Bong Fish Fry and chips is the quintessential fish fry (with good amount of fish stuffing, thankfully!) served with tartar sauce. Now, the chart topper, is of course, the pork chops with mustard mash. The chops were well made, succulent, not too saucy and the mustard mash is something I have not had before. The flavor of mustard was absolutely subtle which is quite rare as that particular flavor overpowers every other spice, generally. The quantity is satisfying too. So this place is highly recommended and for a change, it doesn't make a hole in your pocket.

Food - Amazing and lip-smacking. Service - You won't find a better service. Makes you feel at home. Ambiance - Comfortable, relaxing, good music, American music and arts history. The place is one of its kind. Arguably, the best place to have pocket-friendly American cuisines. Would love to visit again. One of the best places I have been in Kolkata. A lot of variety to choose from and would satisfy your taste buds to the optimum level.

Recommended : Brownie Shake, Chicken Hot Buffalo Wings, Hog Lovers Reloaded Pizza, Darjeeling Pork Platter.

Me and my boyfriend had just been here. We found it in Facebook, saw the pics, searched zomato and voil√†!! We got there today. We had Darjeeling Pork Platter and Hog Lover's Pizza(reloaded) and both the dishes are savoury and yummy and it's like a burst of deliciousness in mouth. We are definitely gonna come back here and with larger group. Loved it.

The ambience is good, with Elvis and Bob and history all around, but the chairs don't match the rest of the picture, though the sort-of-sofas do.
The serving time is rather long, inspite of taking into consideration baking preparation timings.
Taste was really good.
Quality of meat was good too.
I recommend:
# Darjeeling Meat Platter (loved the sausages the most)
# Penne Pasta in Bolognese.
I wanted to try the pesto sauce too. Maybe I will do that the next time I visit. I will.

This was a pretty good experience. 
We order Mocha shakes for ourselves and for mains, we opted for Alabama Grilled Chicken Steak.
The service was excellent. 
The ambience, good. 
The food, quite nice and different. 

If you want to keep it simple and tasty, order the Mocha shakes. They're pretty good.
Other than that, the food is a great experience.

A Must Go Pop-Rock Cafe and Restaurant with great food which does not make a hole in your pocket !
The Best Part: The prices on Menu is it all. No Extra Taxes or VAT!


*FOOD: 4/5
*AMBIENCE: 4.5/5
*PRICE: Pocket friendly. (850/- for two pork platters and a hot spanish chocolate drink)
*service: 4/5

The pop-rock filmy ambience would not fail to charm you. This cool place has that instant aura of happiness as one enters. Specifically for music and film freaks! ;)

*FOOD:
1. The Darjiling pork platter is a complete package of everything pork! Satisfying both quality and quantity wise. Specifically the Salami was really yuum!

2. The pork nasi goreng is spicy.. a bit tangy but tasted too sweet. :3 it contained shredded pork, though the pork was hard to find. Bit disappointing.

3.The Hot Spanish dark chocolate is cocoa lovers' heaven! Hot, thick, dark yet not bitter chocolate is perfect for a rainy evening or winter morning.

I am seriously in love with this place recently. They serve some non-frill meat in various forms- LOL. The portion size is pretty good and the pricing is reasonable. The pulled pork with cheese and fries is good, but I'd rather suggest their bacon with cheese and fries- it's seriously sinful. The pulled pork sandwich is damn good. The darjeeling meat platter is huge in size, but frankly, quite monotonous in taste and after a point of time, felt boring (but if it's a group, definitely recommended). The nasi goreng was slightly spicy, but good nonetheless. Surprisingly, they serve one of the best cappuccinos in town (with perfect layer) and chilly hot chocolate (whatever is the name). Overall, definitely recommended.

Macazzo - Satiate your taste buds with some lipsmacking food.¬†
=====
Location and Intro:

Macazzo is located right ahead of Menoka Cinema (5 minutes walk) on the left side (if you are heading from Menoka cinema). It is a small place with around 6-7 table for seating arrangement.¬†

I had been here with a friend of mine. We had been hearing a lot of good reviews about this place so thought of going and trying it. The owner is quite courteous and as i took my seat, i observed that he kept on visiting table's helping customers with the order. This kind of hospitality is not seen these days in the city of joy.¬†

However, i would also like to make a point that whenever the place is crowded with a lot of people, it becomes very noisy and the echo is too much. ¬†(its a small place)
=====
What i ordered:

‚Ä¢ Peace Ice Tea - The ice tea was good. It was great to beat the heat. My friend ordered for a Rose and Mint Ice Tea. She found it to be just fine.¬†

‚Ä¢ Bourbon glazed BBQ wings - It was not the best wings i have had before. However, i would say they make really good wings!! I totally relished it.¬†

‚Ä¢ Darjeeling Platter (Chicken) - It was really lovely. I totally loved on this one. The platter was heavy, satiating and filled my stomach as well as impressed the palate pretty well. It had sunny side up fried egg, sausage, meat loaf and salami. Buttered toast bread was served as an accompaniment.¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Reasonably priced.

‚Ä¢ Ambiance is fine. 

‚Ä¢ Quantity of food is good.¬†

‚Ä¢ Good hospitality.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Place becomes too noisy when full with customers.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 300-900 approximate (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4/5

Food Quantity 4.1/5

Taste 4.1/5
Presentation 4.1/5

Ambiance 3.9/5

Hygiene 4/5

VFM 4/5
=====
Conclusion:

This place is nicely decorated and the food is quite good. Not the best i would say but yeah, good quality food. If you are looking to spend some bucks looking for quality food, this might be the best place for you. ¬†:)¬†

Fine ambience along with good quality of food. The service was remarkable as well. We had 'Bourbon Glazed BBQ Wings' and 'Chicken Steak and Mushroom Sauce with Sausages, Veggies and Pesto Mash'. The sesame seeds and the sauce over the chicken wings will drag your taste bud to a whole different level. The platter was good enough but expected much from that 'steak' one. Just swing by once with your friends to enjoy the ambience. You'll be loving it for sure ;)

Located near rabindra sarobor lake. A small caf√© with a beautiful decor. Low light and music makes the ambiance so special. Now coming to the food part. We took Oreo shake and mojito as coolers. Then we ordered chicken sweet chilli Wings . For the main course we ordered chicken nasi goreng and chicken stroganoff with parsley rice. The food quality and quantity both were more than perfect. Specially the chicken wings were finger licking good. And the service is also too good. I would like to visit this caf√© again.

This place is a small, well maintained cafe with great service and good food. We ordered
One sweet lime soda and a pina colada drink which was nice as always
Then for starters we ordered bourbon glazed BBQ wings which was far away from being any spicy. Didn't taste great either.
Then creamy pasta in pesto..Good in quantity but have enough room for improvement.

Visited this place with family
This is a well maintained casual diner with decent crowd and good lighted ambience.
The staff is polite and they serve with a smile.
Coming to food

We ordered French fries, cheese mushroom toast,  Nawabi Shake, Veg Burger, Creamy pesto Veg Pasta and Chocolate Sundae.

French fries were okayish
Cheese mushroom toast was flavourful
Nawabi Shake was something very different and really tasty, giving the shake a twist of Indian flavours. One of the must try because it's not a regular chocolate or Oreo shake.
Veg Burger was a regular veg burger
Creamy pesto veg pasta had some things that can be improved on.
Chocolate Sundae was totally worth it.

Overall food was well prepared and served at the right temperature and quick as well

Quality 3.5/5
Service 4/5
Cleanliness 4.5/5
Overall 4/5

Cheers team Macazzo, you are doing a great job.
This place is totally worth it for a casual reunion or a quick date
Will visit again on my next Kolkata visit.

Tried this place for the first time. We ordered (with respect to pictures):
1) Cordon Bleu
2) Pulled Pork loaded with Cheese and French Fries
3) Chicken Strips with Mayo Dip
4) Peach Iced Tea and Lemon Iced Tea (not in picture)

The portions were generous and we really enjoyed the food. It was reasonable too since the bill was around 1000. The staff  politely and checked in a couple of times to see if we were enjoying the food. The decor was neat and whoever set the playlist had a really good taste in music, with country rock and all that. The experience was very good overall. Will definitely go back. Recommended!

Though, my personal favorite is the Stroganoff. If you visit this place you must try these dishes. The staff are very cordial. I highly recommend this place. Looking forward to visit again.

I had visited this place as a get together for a friend who came in town after a while .
The place is very accessible and the decor of the place is very basic and classic themed .I love their little detailing of the place but the place is pretty small for a good no. Of people and the quality of ambience thus detoriates.

The service however is warm .
It is a pretty affordable restaurant if you want to hog much and not pay too much.

In starter we ordered Bourbon glazed BBQ wings and though it looked nice it came out to be too much salty and I really couldn't enjoy it thereafter.

We had ordered Pork chops which as heard is one of their best but we had been disappointed because there was very less meat and more of fat .

We also ordered chicken steak in mushroom sauce with Sausages and veggies.I liked it but I really wanted the veggies part more.

Alabama grilled chicken steak with sausages and veggies was okaish because the southern BBQ mustard sauce did not just seem right .

Overall this place is good for foodies who do not mind some extra calories but it might be disssapointing to fitness enthusiasts .
Improvement in the steak menu will do wonders for this place .You may give it a visit with your friends

We've been to this place about 3/4 times till date so its about time i paid homage to it.
This small cafe cum eatery is located right next to Rabindra Sarobar stadium; a few paces from Menoka Cinema Hall, right next to the ICICI Atm on Southern Avenue.
The first time i walked into this what stole my attention was a piece of decor hanging from the ceiling. While one side had a cut out of a scene from The Good, The Bad & The Ugly with Clint Eastwood and that big Colt Revolver of his, the other side had a cut out of a scene from Antony & Cleopatra.
Other than that the walls are made up of Jimmy Hendrix and The Beatles posters. Though the place is a bit crammed up it more than makes up for it with their courteous staff and the very well mannered gentleman(the owner) who is always there to attend you with an everlasting smile.
The one item which is a must try has coincidentally managed to evade me every time i have visited that place. This item is an Indonesian dish called Nasi Goreng which has both a Chicken and a Pork version.
Few items that we had tried out at different visits are :
Chicken Neapolitana which is a well done chicken steak served with french fries and a mouth watering piece of rarely done bacon served with ketchup and a nice portion of sour cream. Needless to say the food is very good and extremely well cooked.
Pork Sandwiches which have a heartwarming filing made of molten cheese, pulled pork, pork fat, mayo, veggies and it is served with chips and ketchup. The sandwich is a melt in the mouth recipe and sandwiches have never tasted better.
For the beverage section we would like to recommend the Kiwi Mojito from the cold section and Mochacino and Chilly Hot Chocolate from the hot section.
Do keep some time in hand while visiting this place as in all likelihood you'll have to wait a while for your turn!

Heard a lot about this place from friends. So tried visiting this on Sunday evening. The interior is well decorated with old English songs playing in the background. Ordered Iced coffee. I've visited several cafes but never tasted something this bad. The coffee was not at all thick with awful taste. It felt like some spoons of milk and sugar was mixed in a glass of cold water. Even lost the will to try something else over there.

Tell me doesn't your mouth water immediately? The food is amazing and I have never seen more people ask me where the place is within one day! The darjeeling meat platter can make any bangali nostalgic when he or she is missing Darjeeling. The place is a little small but the ambience is great. The music they play is 90s rock like led Zepp and pink Floyd. The service is also up to the mark! No complaints.

Go and hog your food there!

1. Chicken Stroganoff
2. Penne Bacon Carbonara
3. Prawn n Fish Thermidor
All the food were lip smacking. I can't express the perfect taste of the food. I would suggest to try these 3 dishes. Specially Chicken Stroganoff and Prawn n Fish Thermidor.
Here tax is included. Lastly the staffs were very cooperating. Looking forward to our next visit.

The best thing about this place is their hospitality! The staff members always serve with a smile on their which makes the place quite endearing. Interior is decent and likeable. Now if you come to food, this place really serves some unique dishes, most of them successfully made! I wont say that all of these unique preperations taste delicious, but yeah some of them are really worth giving your taste buds a try! I have visited this joint more than twice and tried different dishes on my every visit. Out of the 6 unique dishes i have tasted, the most cherishing were the : Pulled pork Loaded french fries and Bourbon Glazed BBQ Wings. Both of them perfectly cooked and still excites my taste organs when though about! Their pizza items are also very good. Pizza lovers do give them a try! Chicken Nasi Goreng and Chicken Stroganoff were the other two dishes which we ordered. According to the menu, Nasi Goreng is an indonesian dish which taste much like Bengali "khichuri", but this one too much spicy. Stroganoff was decent, nothing extraordinary! Brownie shake over here is something to die for. Special mention to the quantity of the food- which is very good, and can easily satisfy two people's apetite. And right now they are not including any extra tax with the bill.
Well to be honest from my side, this food joint gets a big thumbs up for their efforts and vision. Keep going . All the best!

Must tell you the pizza tasted delicious. It was a thin crust pizza that really was crispy and the meat was perfectly cooked. The stroganoff was also good. Pocket pinch was very reasonable. They do not charge extra taxes :)
Will visit again to taste the other mouth watering items they have !!

What a lil gem of a place dis is. Went to da place after checking out all da positive reviews from here, abt da place... It's a small but comfortable place to sit n talk to ur partner or friends, over great food n nice music. Da staff is very friendly and  cheerful, da service is quiet prompt n da food is excellent...
We ordered a kiwi mojito nd a pineapple mojito along with bacon n cheese loaded French friesüçüit was very cheesy full of pcs of bacon n of course topped with golden fried French fries... totally distinct from da regular starter items we've tried out n pretty tasty n innovative ... totally absolutely worth it.

We then ordered pork lasagne for main course and as expected it was topped with cheese but da stuff under da melted cheese was also pretty impressive. Da pork though tasted more like beef but then who's complaining. All da ingredients right, from da spices, to da minced pork to all da otr items used in it were nicely mixed n done together to leave a wonderful n a rich taste in da mouth. Another item which was delectable n stodgy nd totally worth digging onto... totally satisfied till now.
Now for da desert n da best was left for da end. We ordered chocolate pizza n it was out of dis world. A regular sized pizza, dripping with hot chocolate nd loads of nuts to top it all. It was totally mouth watering nd toothsome but again sinfully delicious... very much recommended..
All in all a very satisfying n fulfilling place to eat out n relax after a hard day's grind nd da best part, da prices are inclusive of taxes.. wat more could anybody (at least us) ask for?? 
A wonderful experience totally satisfied nd very much recommended ... üëçüëçüëç... keep up da great work guys... definitely going back...

Had the privilege of ordering Chicken Stroganoff and Parsley rice clubbed with Chicken & Mayo sandwich. The tastes were enhanced by the sweet behaviour of the service guys. The special day was made even more special by the aesthetical interiors and value for money meal!!

My friend and I had gone to this place , we had ordered the Darjeeling platter . Believe me I had never had such tasty sausages . We had ordered extra large , later we were struggling to complete it . Then we had ordered Spanish hot chocolate , how do you enjoy rain like heavy downpour -with a hot chocolate that is made straight from heaven.

After the recent bloom in cafe culture in Kolkata, I was hearing a buzz about this place for a while before I decided to check it out two weeks ago. 
Located on Southern Avenue, a couple of blocks away from Rabindra Sarovar Lake this place was easy to find. 
It's not very big and doesn't have the greatest of interiors but all of this gets forgotten as soon as you take a bite into your meal. 
Wide variety of options in the menu but the continental and Italian cuisine stands out the most. I'd recommend to try the pork dishes as the pork here is very smooth and processed. 

We ordered cold coffee, oreo shakes, lime soda, French fries as appetizers followed by chicken and pork nasi goren, chicken pasta, chicken stroganoff, chicken cordon bleu. 

Special mention to the Cordon bleu which was simply out of the world :D

The staff especially the manager is very cordial. 
 
The pocket pinch is unbelievably low for the dishes they serve. 
Food - 5  Service - 4
Interior - 3.5 Value for money - 5

First of all the ambience was great! It has a seating capacity of not more than 20. This small restaurant is decorated pretty well with pictures of retro musicians of the western world. The owner is friendly he literally does everything from serving to taking orders to taking feedbacks. The service is pretty good. 
As far as drinks are concerned, we tried out the kiwi mojito which was very refreshing and oreo shake. In the food department, we went for bacon wrapped pork sausages, chicken nasi goreng, chicken stroganoff with parsley rice and hog lover's pork pizza. Amongst these, the pizza and nasi goreng were really delicious! The pizza was full of toppings. The pork blended with the spices beautifully on top of the thin crust. I wish it never ended! Chicken nasi goreng was equally tasty, being sweet and hot at the same time! I personally didn't like the Stroganoff much, though it tasted pretty good with the toasts it came with. It was very creamy and one of my friends liked the stroganoff very much. As far as the sausages are concerned, it was OK. It was my first time with sausages, it was chewy and had a peculiar flavour. The owner said that the sausages used in this dish were stored, while fresh sausages were used in the platter, so may be next time I will go for the platter. Also, the bacon which was wrapped around the sausage, I felt, could have been a bit more cooked.

OK...so dis was our 2nd visit to dis awesome place.Though the waiting time was a bit longer bt it's worth every bit.
1.Pulled pork fried egg bacon onion and cheese sandwich-to much surprise it was based on a garlic bread rather Dan d normal ones.
2.Pulled pork burger with bacon and cheese - simply wonderful burger with a soft bun and delicious patty.
3.Pork nasi goreng-tangy spicy sticky rice wid generous number of pork pieces and a perfect poached egg on the top.
4.fresh lime soda-dey personally ask you if u want it salty or sweet...Nd even an option for mixed flavour.
5.mojito-refreshing in its own way.
Interiors were excellent bt wud be even better if dey add some more tables... behaviour of the staffs were appreciable.
The food was more Dan enough to feed 3 hungry stomachs and d bill amounting to Rs.900 ( only üòÇ)
Will definitely step into dis place to try their other delicacies. With Soumya Rochere Gayen Tanmoy Patra

Macazzo was on my list for a very very long time. I visited this place last week and the experience was delightful!
Macazzo is a small cafe with limited seating facilities. Their staff service is really good and they're all very polite.
Now coming to the food! We ordered
1: fish fingers with tartar sauce - 8pieces of amazing fish fried and their tartar sauce was also good. It perfectly complemented the fish.

2: bourbon glazed BBQ chicken wings- these had a very different taste. The chicken had crispy skin and it was soft and tender on the inside. It might get a little bit overwhelming after two pieces for a person. Nevertheless, liked it.

3: kiwi mojito & fresh lime mojito - the kiwi mojito is amazing and very refreshing! Do try that. It has a very interesting taste. The fresh lime mojito was the usual fresh one.

4: BBQ chicken onion and cheese sandwich: it was amazing. It came with lays potato chips. Loved the taste of the sandwich. Very filling.

Would definitely visit this place again. They not only serve amazing food but also their politeness and service deserves credit. They are a bit slow to serve , I guess because they're always packed with people with so many orders but that is no issue.

I've been here 3 times before. The location is pretty convinient, right next to Sarobar, and very near the Sarobar metro, railway bridge gate.

Now, coming to the ambience. It's a really small and cozy place, so much so I was afraid we wouldnt get seats, but they even accomodated my group of 10. The wall has posters of some of my most favourite bands, including Zeppelin, Floyd, Beatles, and even Johnny Cash, Hendrix and Elvis. So these were a pleasant delight. They even have some amazing classical music playing, with Comfortably Numb featuring very often, surprisingly.

Now the food. Before I begin, let me add how their quantity is really good and their prices very reasonable.
This place specialises in pork dishes. The pork lasagna is a must, the meat is tender and shredded perfectly. The sauce is layered well with both the pasta sheets and the pulled pork, the cheese is grilled perfect, and unlike most places who screw up their lasagnas real bad(including Hyatt) their's is bang on, and very cheap too.
The wings is a must. Their sauces are well glazed over a crispy but thin coating and properly cooked chicken. If you are into ranch, then the Buffallo wings is your weapon of choice, for as they say, 'dragon breath'. We also tried the Bourbon glazed BBQ wings which again was really well made, with the sauce being spot on.
We also had a pork Satay, which was a great dish but the lasagna stands unbeaten.

Coming to the let downs, I'd say it's their jumbo burger which wasn't so big, and their coolers, which, to be honest, aren't really good. I wouldnt recommend them.

As for their service, the man standing there has been really courteous and always looks in on us for every dish, and appreciates feedback. This place is a well sorted one for me, and I'd highly recommend this to food lovers who want a bang for a very small buck.

The food was damn delicious with decent pricings. They don't add up extra tax (visited post July 1), as the listings on menu are incluvisve of taxes. Definitley visiting again (for the food!)

One of the best cafes if not the best, you can find at that price. The pork chop was excellently cooked, and the meat was so tender. My friend who ordered crispy chicken burger with cheese, bacon and egg really loved it. Quality wise is excellent at that price range and they don't charge taxes. Quantity wise is the best. Seriously one with low appetite should not visit this place. Ambience is very simple and there is a crunch of space but if you are served with such delicious food it really doesn't matter. The service is also very good.

With so many cafes and restaurants all around Kolkata, Macazzo definitely gave me a different hint of feeling the moment I stepped inside it. Starting from the well decorated interiors, to such well mannered people serving us and not to forget the food. The food is something which will instigate me to visit it once again. I ordered Darjeeling Platter(Chicken) and Bourbon glazed BBQ Chicken - they totally lived up to my expectations specially the Darjeeling platter.It had chicken sausages,salamis, meat loaf , buttered toast. The meat was well cooked and it was soft and tender. The Bourbon glazed BBQ Chicken too was nice but the platter just swept me off my feet.

Other than the food, the place will give a Hollywood cinematic vibe to it's customers; which is very different from any other cafes in the city.Those wall hangings, lights portrays some of the iconic Hollywood movies are a treat for all movie lovers.
The place is not so spacious and the tables are a bit too small.customers have to wait for their turn at the time of peak hours but it's worth it coz the food is delicious. This is a perfect place to hang out and is very affordable. The average cost for two people is 500 and one added advantage is that they don't charge extra tax. 

So , here if you r reading this review and if you haven't visited MACAZZO , I recommend you to go to.the place at least once.üòä

The Milanesa Napolitana was out of the world. Great value for money. The main dish was both wholesome and sumptuous, not to mention the plateful of french fries that came with it.

On the ambience front, Macazzo doesn't disappoint either. Posters of universally revered bands like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc flank the walls, and the music features tracks from the same.

All in all, a great experience. Hopefully they'll continue to provide top quality stuff at fairly reasonable rates. Cheers. :)

I have to give a detailed review about this place and it should be coming within a span of two days. I need to go to this place once more to check out few items from the menu in order to give a proper rating and a review. Although I liked the simple decor of this place. But the service and the food couldn't impress me much. I had a talk with the manager/ owner/co-owner of this place who is a nice gentleman but that doesn't change the fact that they need to work on their menu as told by him. I didn't like the food much to ne honest. The drinks which were offered to me was not upto the mark according to what I've tasted in other outlets. This place needs to buck up real fast.

Although I found the place to be well decorated with English movie scenes and musical band posters with tracks from Pink Floyd, Green day and other popular bands being played in a comfortable volume, but it should have been a more spacious as the tables are place close enough to hear other people's conversations.
Coming to the food, me & my friend ordered Bacon & Cheese wrapped French Fries for starters. Chicken Stroganoff & Penne Pork Carbonara. It took quite some time for the food to be delivered but the quality was excellent and quantity was enough. It was actually more than enough for the two of us. + No extra taxes. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The Bacon n Cheese loaded French fries and Hog Lover's Reloaded pizza for starters were filling and delicious. So, we settled for the Chicken steak with Mushroom sauce for mains and had the chocolate sundae for dessert. The food was really good. The only downer was, all the items on the menu weren't available, like the mushroom fritters and most of the desserts. Otherwise another gem in Southern Avenue really!

A quaint little place with quirky decor, a homage to US pop/rock music and movies. One must take a note of those lampshades made of cassettes. Full marks to the innovation. Coming to the food, this place is a meat lovers' paradise, that too at pretty reasonable prices. Read great things about the chicken wings, though unfortunately it wasn't available. So settled for roasted sweet chilli pork. Succulent and cooked to perfection it was a beginning to a great meal. For the mains we ordered Alabama Grilled Chicken Steak, Pork Chop with Mustard Mash and Milanesa Napolitana. Not really familiar names but none of them disappointed even a bit. The meat was grilled well, had great flavours. Only complain not everything was available in the menu that day, and they took a bit too long to serve, we didn't have time for desserts.
Good food, decor and music. This place is a winner. Definitely recommended.

Tried their standard darjeeling platter (chicken) and grilled paneer, veggies and cheese sandwich. The dishes were too good both in quality and quantity.
The music and the american decor was also very impressive. Greatly satisfied and pleased by hospitality and service.
It is definitely one of the best cafes in town and is worth visiting again.

A really nice cafe! With a warm welcoming owner! Really satisfied with the service! And its a must visit place. The price does not burn a hole in your pocket,and the prices you see on the menu are the final ones, that is no tax is charged over the prices. The tables are a bit small, but anyways they have made a fair usage of the place they got, the music played was good, and the american decor was really good, the Elvis Presley poster, the lights made out of old cassetes, and the tissue holders made from old records cant be missed. Coming to the food we ordered a manhattan pizza with added chicken sausage, an albama grilled chicken steak, both of them tasted extremely good, and i would recommend these to my fellow foodie friends :) we also ordered a pineapple mojito, which wasnt good, but when the owner came to ask me about the food and i gave my review he instantly changed the mojito and served me cold drink as per my request, which was a rare thing, and he offered that within a blink of his eyes, so i was extremely satisfied with the food as well as the service, will surely visit again to try the rest of the tasty food on the menu.

This place is definitely one of our best finds. All thanks to Zomato. It is located in Southern Avenue, opposite to lake stadium. A small cafe with delicious food, great service and chilling ambience. 
We planned to try this place long before and must say it was worth a shot. We had to wait fr 20 minutes as it ws completely full and we wre 4 ppl. So it ws hrd fr dem to arrange a table. We stared with Blue Lagoon and Fresh lime soda along with regular french fries. Thn in main course we ordered Alabama chicken steak, Broolkyn pizza, Sweet chilli wings, tandoori chicken sandwitch. Food was delicious and quantity wise, 1 plate is enough fr 1 person. Best part is this place is very pocket friendly. All these cost us 1100 bucks only.

This is a small cafe located in the Southern Avenue in the lane of Menoka cinema and you can spot it from the main road beside the ICICI bank atm. We had to wait for half an hour on a  Friday evening. The ambience is very charming with loud music and the decor is very attractive and refreshing. We started with refreshing Mojito and Blue lagoon followed by Brownie shake with French fries. These were good. Then came the Chicken Manhattan pizza. It was just awesome. Thin crust pizza studded with barbecued chunks of chicken and plenty of sweet corn and onions. Loved it really. Then we ordered their Bourbon glazed BBQ chicken wings-Crispy chicken wings, very tempting and tasty. We had a desire to taste their Darjeeling platter but our tummy didn't permit.  The guy taking care of us was really very nice always carrying a sweet smile. The bill was very much pocket friendly and the menu card showing the amount was inclusive of taxes. A rainy evening spent worth remembering.

Retro caf√© with good shakes and desserts only.

Food: Located at the junction of Southern avenue and the Rabindra sarobar stadium entrance, this caf√© has gained a lot of reputation for its retro ambience and good food. We dropped on a cloudy evening and tried their Bourbon Glazed BBQ Chicken, Roasted Sweet Chili Pork and a Brownie Shake. The BBQ Chicken was a bit tangy in taste and was filling. However, there was too much sauce in this dish but we expected it to be a little drier. The roasted sweet Chili Pork was a total disappointment. The small pork pieces floated along with boiled vegetables in a bowl of black gravy. 
I absolutely didn‚Äôt understand why would a caf√© which doesn‚Äôt serve any roti or rice kind of item, offer so much gravy in a dish!! And they also didn‚Äôt inform about the excess gravy during placing of the order. However, the Brownie Shake was awesome though. The quantity was also filling. My suggestion would be, just have mocktails and shakes and desserts only here. Other dishes might disappoint you.

Ambience: The ambience is very retro containing posters of some of the classic movies and some of the timeless bands. While we entered, a song form the Elvis Priestley album was being played which was followed by Pink Floyd and then Denver. The choice of songs and the d√©cor is very very impressive. 

Service: The service is also very prompt with the owner and his son themselves serving the food and taking orders. Cash and Card accepted. However, parking needs to be done a little away in a bylane. 

Overall: Might visit again if in the area. However, there are a lot of caf√© in that area now. So, they r up for a strong competition.

A small, cosy place with decent decor, good food and very courteous staff. This place is located in Southern Avenue near Rabindra Sarobar Lake. The retro ambience is definitely worth cherishing. Pictures of vintage cars and musicians of the yesteryears enhances the look and feel of this place. Old school music keeps on playing which prevents you from getting bored while you are waiting for the food to be served. We had ordered Grilled Chicken and Cheese Burger, Chicago Pizza, Kiwi Mojito, Oreo Shake, Chocolate Pizza.

Grilled Chicken and Cheese Burger(4.5/5): The burger was served with French Fries. The burger was extremely tasty; the buns were soft and the patty was really tasty and juicy. The proportion of cheese too was perfect. The French Fries were very well prepared and tasted so good. Recommended.

Chicago Pizza(3/5): This item was recommended to us by the owner of this cafe. However, it had failed to impress us. The barbecue sauce did not complement the pizza at all. Hence, the portions, which were devoid of barbecue sauce, tasted good. The chicken pieces were ample and had the barbecue sauce not been there, it could have been one of the best items Macazzo serves. The crust too was very thin, just the way I like. However, the barbecue sauce was a big turn off.

Kiwi Mojito(4/5): A regular kiwi drink. Chilled and refreshing. A mocktail is a must while having the burgers and pizzas; this would be a very good drink. Recommended.

Oreo Shake(3.5/5): This drink was also a simple milk-shake with pieces of Oreo floating on the surface. Nothing special about this drink worth mentioning. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Chocolate Pizza(4.5/5): Since, our pizza experience was not good, we decided to try pizza in a dessert form. Extremely thin crust with chocolate chips, chocolate sauce toppings. It tastes really good. Don't miss out on this if you visit this place. Recommended!

A good cafe serving a few amazing dishes at pocket-friendly prices. The prices of the items are inclusive of all taxes too. I would like to visit this place once again to try a few of the other items. A good place to visit and enjoy impressive food items.

A small place with some intresting decor and good food with satisfactory service. 
We had quite a few dishes like
Chicken with pesto pasta - the pasta was a bit dry to my liking. There could had been a few more chicken pieces for the given price. 
Veg Augratin - It didnt tasted like augratin at all. I guess its there rendition to the classic. But it tasted fine. Was topped with grilled cheese. 
Chocolate pizza - was quite ordinary but chocolate can never go wrong. 
Oreo Shake and Brownie shake - Both were made well with good amount of chocolate n kinda right sweetness. Though would had liked some chunks of oreo n brownie. 
Kiwi mojito - The best of the lot. It was tangy, sweet, citrus with an appealing colour.  Cheers.

Retro looking small joint located in the lanes of Rabindra Sarobar, from the outside it has a quiet look.The inside decor is with vintage cars and posters from the 70's bands.
Among the starters we had Bacon and cheese loaded French Fries and Bourbon  glazed Bbq wings.
The bourbon glazed Bbq wings were crunchy with a decent amount of homemade Bbq sauce.
The bacon and cheese French Fries were a mixture of cheese along with bacon and French Fries, however it would have been perfection had the bacon was a bit of more in amount.

In the main dishes ee had Cordon bleu with mash ,Alabama grilled chicken  steak with veggies and Milanesa Napolitana with French Fries.
Milanesa Napolitana with French Fries was just too good with crispy bacon,chicken and cheese with French Fries .
Cordon bleu tasted okayish, I felt it was too dry.woukd have been better if it was served with mayo or any dip.
The chicken steak was good
Among the drinks we had Nawabi shake, Ore shake and mocha shake.
The Nawabi shake was a bit turndown with it tasted more so biriyanish and the rest two were decent.

The best part was no tax was added.
Courteous ever smiling waiters was the plus point however had the service been a bit more fast I would have given the full points.
Anyway...a grand place to treat, enjoy and have an awesome gastronomic experience.
Planning to visit soon again to try out the new dishes!!!

I had passed through Macazzo a couple of times but never noticed it..i don't know why it doesn't catch your glance at once! After going through the positive reviews, decided to drop in! They don't have huge space but ya they do have taste.. Interior walls were well done and played excellent music! 

We ordered Aam Panna(Spices added more than needed), brownie shake( good one), Hot buffalo wings (quantity was huge compared to price..it tasted good but I got a typical chilli sauce taste), Roasted sweet Chilly Pork (extremely sweet, after 3-4 spoons one would forget the taste of chilli forever) !!

Failed to meet expectations!! But would revisit the place to try other dishes since its pocket friendly!!

A very modern cafe which is built brilliantly in a small space. The Cafe is filled with posters of Elvis Presley, Route 66 and very unique lighting which gives it an amazing ambience. The manager and his staff are very friendly and polite. All the shakes and dishes that are served are very reasonable and have a good quantity. Would suggest anyone who goes to Macazzo to try the
1. Oreo Shake
2. Barbecue Wings

Ambience 4/5
Taste 4.5/5
Value for Money 5/5

Retro looking small joint in the southern avenue. Nice interior decoration with vintage cars and pics from bands of 70s with background music. We ordered roasted sweet chilli pork , Chicago pizza , blue lagoon, and masala tea and one darjiling tea. Foods were awsome specially the pork. Good place to hangout with friends. Service was good. And staff s are well behaved. Hoping to visit soon.

Heard a lot about this place,finally visited yesterday with my favourite one. The cafe is located at southern avenue. Location is quite good you don't need to search. A small  well decorated cafe is the new attraction of the city.when we entered it was full only a table left. Coming to the food, we ordered for
#chicken_Hawaiaan pizza which was really super delicious with a unique taste. It comes with pineapple and roasted chicken.one of best tasted pizza till date. Go give it a try you'll surely gonna love it.
#Darjeeling_platter(pork) though i don't like pork but the dish was quite decent.
#BBQ_chicken_bacon_friedegg_cheese sandwich- it's too heavy and taste was very good though the taste of sauce was not good.otherwise it's a good dish.
Coming to the shake
#orio_shake was too good in shake.
#mango_shake was ok type not so extraordinary.
Overall a nice experience.Service is not fast you need to wait quite for a long time to get your order served.our total bill was around 1070. There are no extra charges. Go give a try to this new italian cafe.

This amazing little place is located just next to Medinova opposite Rabindra Sarobar Stadium. It accommodates around 18 people. But don't go by the size of the place. It's a perfect example of chhota packet bada dhamaka. The place has a lovely decor. Now coming to food. The fish finger with tartare dip was quite good. Alabama Grilled Chicken with veggies and mash was excellent. It has a hint of curry taste and the mash potato has pesto mixed with it. I have become a fan of this dish. Milanesa Nepolitana- it's fried chicken covered with bacon and cheese(famous for being Messi's favourite) was excellent too. The food comes in a huge proportion. We have ordered two soft drinks one starter dish and two main course. Still the bill was around 900 bucks. So quite a pocket friendly place. I got the opportunity to speak with the owner. A very warm and friendly person. Though the restaurant was extremely busy. Still he gave attention to everyone who visited the restaurant for dinner.

This joint is a brilliant getaway to delicious continental cuisine in Kolkata! The food served here satisfies your taste buds in every manner. The pork chops is a wonderful delicacy served here with juicy pork meat and the chicken nasi goreng is an equally good delicacy. The burgers served here are pretty nice too. And the quantity along with extremely hospitable staff are the icing to your cake :D

This small but unique food joint is located near Rabindra Sarobar Stadium in Southern Avenue.
You will get a retro like fell after entering the restaurant with the posters of Elvis Presley, ford mustang & others. They made some innovative lighting done with the old cassettes.

Food Ordered : Mango Milkshake, Oreo Shake, Chicken wings in sweet chilli sauce and Darjeeling platter(Small).

# Mango Shake was mind-blowing and had to be one of the best Mango Milkshakes in town. The Shake was very thick with right amount of sweetness.
# Basic Oreo Shake with crushed Oreo cookies. Tasted good nothing extraordinary and was little runny for my friend.
# Chicken wings was 8 pieces of crispy fried wings coated with a sticky honey glazed chilli sauce sprinkled with saseme seeds. This is must try dish and the sticky glazed sauce deserves a special mention.
# All though I wanted the pork platter but my girlfriend wanted Chicken platter :). We opted for the small one which consisted 10 small pieces of chicken sausages, 6 pieces of meat loaf, 6 pieces of chicken salami and one sunny side up egg.
Sausages and salami tasted nice but that meat loaf was little bit smelly according me and my girlfriend. Other than that it was decent. 

The waiter who advised us on our item selection and served the food was very friendly and courteous. Service was little on the slower side. Prices were also reasonable as they don't charge any extra taxes. Overall a decent place to hang out with friends. 
Looking forward to visit real soon for their pork dishes......

Located near Menoca cinema, it's a small cafe serving American and Italian dishes, an apt place for hangout. Sometimes you have to wait to get seats, because of its small place.
Tastefully decorated with beautiful innovative ideas and Beatles and plink Floyd playing in the background gives a cozy feeling.
We ordered three coolers- Mocha shake, Oreo Shake and Nawabi Shake. All were good,but the Nawabi Shake is worth a special mention. For starters we took Bacon and Cheese loaded French Fries and Bourbon Glazed BBQ wings. The BBQ sauce was awesome. For the mains,we took Pork Lasagna, Chicken Nasi Goreng- an Indonesian dish and Chicken Stroganoff with Parsley Rice- this was full of cheese!!! All the dishes were yum!
The staff were very helpful and so courteous, asking for feedback of food after every dish.
Will definitely hop in here with friends again.

Visited on 28th of June..
Loved the ambience.. plays good music... the staffs were very courteous... a bit slow service as they cook fresh.. though that shouldn't be an issue...

Coming to the food.. we actually had no intention of having any food that day.. so we ordered for the coffee ... but ended up ordering a bowl of  "pulled pork fries" (i don't remember the name exactly) ... it was the heavenly.... ‚ù§‚ù§ .. and it was more than enough for the two of us... so if you're going to have it.. i would recommend "DO NOT" order coffee or anything heavy before that... we almost died finishing the whole bowl... it was too much food... üòÖ

Would definitely visit again later.... to actually try out the dishes...

I was planning to visit this place for a long time.
I had much more expectation, and wasn't at all impressed from our first visit. 
We ordered :
‚òÖ Kiwi Mojito, Blue Lagoon & Aam Panna - They were average, nothing special. 
‚òÖ Pulled Pork loaded with French Fries - It was nice. Loved the baked cheese and the pork was good.
‚òÖ Pork Lasagna - It was horrible! The entire dish was loaded with Barbeque Sauce which made it awful. It was so bad, we couldn't finish the dish! And I don't recall, when I had to leave a dish like this in any restaurant before. I had tried Lasagna in other places so I know what it should taste like.
‚òÖ Cordon Bleu with Mash : It was good, but nothing extraordinary. 
Maybe that Lasagna just spoilt our mood. 
Decor is nice, though service was late.

Recently, there has been a sudden outburst in the cafe scene here in Kolkata. Cafes, big or small, economic or expensive have been coming up in any possible bylane of our city. And, that's an exciting news for gourmets like us. I walked into one such called Macazzo on a Wednesday afternoon. Its easy to locate; located right at the beginning of the lane which leads upto Menoka. This cafe is small like many a cafe that has come up recently. But the small space didn't affect their‚Äã will to make this cafe reach out to the food fraternity of Kol in a short time. Opened last year just before the Puja, this 'young' cafe climbed up the popularity charts with its good food and hospitality‚Äã. Also, worth mentioning is their decor. How crafty and smartly they have done it! One of the owners had a knack for interior designing and he set up this place with all things American; be it the posters or tissue-holding containers made out of yesteryear records or the lampshades made out of cassettes.
Food is basically what cafes usually offer, nothing innovative (though would really love to see them produce some fusions of the cuisines). We ordered Pork Pulled French Fries, which came with a thick layer of cheese hiding beneath which were not-so-crunchy fries and shredded pieces of pork. The Fish and Prawn Thermidor was really good though.The Buffalo Chicken Wings had me turn red.Its too damn hot and spicy! We unnecessarily spiced up our life in spite of the waiter's warning :P The Kiwi Cooler compensated for the fiery wings, found it a bit too sweet though. I have to come back to try out their burgers and pizzas.

Situated near Menoka Cinema, southern avenue. The interior of popular old band posters on the wall, hanging lights is pretty impressive.
This place will not burn a huge hole in the pocket as they don't charge any taxes. The owner is very friendly and even staffs are courteous with prompt service. Can be visited multiple times without hesitation.

Macazzo covers 3 most important things that I generally look for in any restaurant or cafe i.e the ambience, the service and obviously the food. I went here yesterday with my best friend since I heard a lot of good stuff regarding their service and food. And honestly, I was totally impressed... We ordered the Bacon wrapped up sausages and a Chocolate Sundae and it was amazing. I would recommend it to all. Plus it is pocket friendly so looking forward to visit the cafe again.

Macazzo is the newest kid in the block invading the American/Italian cuisine space. Conveniently located beside Medinova in the Southern Avenue area, I headed to this place on a Friday for a late lunch along with 3 of my friends.

I was quite surprised to find it full on a Friday during off peak hours especially after incessant rains had lashed the city. We had to wait for about 10 minutes before we were assigned a table.¬†
Ambiance is chilled out and casual. Walls are embellished with various movie/music posters depicting the American Pop-Rock culture. Music is just right to go with the ambiance. Lighting is sufficient and not over done.¬†

We were hosted by the owner himself and suggested the dishes based on our preferences.¬†

We started our meal by ordering a Cheese and Bacon loaded french fries. Truly loaded with bacon and cheese, my friends loved the preparation. Since I am not a big fan of bacon, I hardly had a few pieces of french fries and it did taste good.¬†

Next, we ordered a portion of pork chops and Chicken Steak & mushroom sauce. The pork chop was good. I tasted a bit and really liked the flavour. The chicken steak was really really heavy however the disappointing part was that the sauce was very salty. Also the chicken should have been tender and we had to put in quite an amount of effort to cut through. Also the mashed potato that came with both the dishes did not pair well with the respective dishes.¬†

We had also ordered Virgin mojitos and an Oreo shake to wash it down. The mojito was average however the Oreo shake was outstanding !¬†

Service was good and pocket pinch was around Rs 1200 for all that we ate and drank. Quantity is very good but I was a bit disappointed with steak due to reasons mentioned above. Otherwise a good place to hang out with your friends over food and gossip :)

Ordered bacon-wrapped sausages and bacon and cheese loaded french fries. The whole cheesy affair was so good - with each bite, my mind was screaming "Don't do this! Shame on you!", but I've absolutely no regrets!
Also I have to mention the ambiance. Kudos to whoever did the interior decoration. Seriously, where did you guys get that Beatles clock?!
Definitely gonna visit again.

So he didn't let me and my friend out. Said us to sit until the rain stops. Offered us water. While we went out my friend fell down and wasn't feeling well. The owner took us inside and even brought medicine for her. One of a kind, this place. Will visit thousand more times.

Had too much of high expectations after seeing such high rating of this place. But I actually found it to be very basic and average. Located in Southern Avenue, came here one day to grab some quick snack. The place is small, very basic. Ambience is decent. Really liked the innovation in their lamps and the tissue paper holders. Food tried - 
Pulled Pork Loaded French Fries - Topped with Pulled Pork and Cheese, the bowl consisted of French Fries. The pork was there only in top and the rest of the bowl contained the mundane bland French Fries. Disappointing! 
Thai Sweet Chilli Wings - Better than the previous one. Four wings in one portion. The sauce was good, loved the sea same bits but there was nothing extraordinary to it. 
Service was a bit slow. The owner who was also helping his staffs, was a bit snobbish to the clients, at least to us. 
Overall experience wasn't very good. It's okay for visiting once but not at all worthy repeating. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

Heard a lot of good things about this place, so went there with my girlfriend. The ambience of this cafe is good with music playing in the background and the cafe is well decorated with photos, lamp sheds etc representing American pop culture.

The owner was himself present there and was attending customers and helping staffs. He was polite, well behaved and was attending us with each and everything we needed with a smile on his face. In my opinion that is one of the plus points of this cafe which many other cafes in town lack.

Coming to the food, we ordered Blue Lagoon, Oreo Shake, Pork Darjeeling platter, Chocolate Pizza. We wanted to try the Pork Chops and Lasagna but we were already stuffed. Blue Lagoon and Oreo shake was good. Darjeeling Platter had lots of things on the plate along side 2 slices of butter toast. It was plane and simple DELICIOUS. Chocolate Pizza good have been better but that's my personal opinion as I would have liked a bit more crunchy base. 

The prices are reasonable and best part is no extra taxes are to be paid. We will surely visit this place again.

We have been eating outside a lot, only to visit and savour the popular dishes of the upcoming cafes and joints in Kolkata. Maccazzo was in my list for a very long time. I found the place to be cosy. We ordered steak (i forgot the variant) and the Darjeeling Pork Platter as main course.There was some kind of kitchen maintenance work going on that day. So food took almost an hour to come (that's ok, some days can be grey) .However the food was yummy. The host was exceptionally well behaved. I came to know The Joint in santoshpur belonged to them. Missed that and wish they reopen. 
Repeating my visit for sure üôÇüëçüèª

Read a lot about this place here and got the chance to visit the place today with a friend. A tiny place with very limited seating arrangement, so it was quite crowded. Two groups of four were even waiting outside. Anyway, once inside we were asked if we would like regular or mineral water but it never arrived. Moving on. We ordered the standard darjeeling pork platter and a 6" pepperoni pizza with two mojitos. The drinks came a good 25 minutes after we placed the order and the food some 45 minutes. Now, coming to the food. The pepperoni pizza was above average though not extraordinary, still worth a shot. But my friend did complain about the pork platter. The sausages were overcooked and had turned crispy. The meatloaf was ordinary and so was the salami. At 400 rupees, it was quite a plateful but a disappointment. Overall, the place has a good vibe but needs to seriously work on service when so many foodies are there to enjoy their fare.

A quaint little cafe on one of the lanes in southern avenue ,this place is all about having a good time with loads of good food.Special mention --Its a pork lovers heaven.The decor is well thought of having pictures of musicians on the walls and on the lamp shades hanging right above our head. The menu has a lot of options ranging from burgers, pizzas and pastas to bacon wrapped prawns , main courses and desserts that will take your heart away instantly. After a lot of discussion we settled for

1.Pull pork french fries
2.Chicken in cheese sauce pasta
3.Hog lovers pizza

The french fries were crispy covered with generous amount of pork and cheese . The pasta was below average and tasted very much like home made macaroni. They could work on that section.But the Hog lovers pizza made up for all of it. Meaty and cheesy with a thin crispy base this pizza is a pork lovers dream.

The owner takes personal care to come and visit every table putting in suggestions for orders. Great ambience ,warm hospitality and good food are all that one should look out for in this place. It was a pleasure visiting team Macazzo.

Well to me the place is perfect where your pocket money is limited and you have all the apetite to eat! Infact your appetite is totally not going to affect the food's taste....We ordered a Manhattan pizza and a pork platter! Both were awesome! They served the food a little late compared to what I've seen in the other reviews though the decency and the courteseoness of the manager is appreciable! A 5 could have given if the service was a little bit prompt! 
Overall excellent!

Went there a few days back. It's a small cafe with really cool interiors. We ordered the baked Alfredo pasta and the chicken platter along with a few drinks. The food was to die for. The workers/owners were very polite. They cared enough to ask every customer if they like the food and portions. The prices are inclusive of taxes which is great. Streaming of the India-Bangladesh match sort of made it more special for the friend visiting with me. Lovely experience. Would love to visit again.

Located at a nice place in Southern Avenue this place serves quality food.

At first we ordered Mojito and Masala Cold Drink. They served those in trendy mugs. The Mojito is a bit more on the sweeter side where as the Masala Cold Drink was really good.

Secondly, we ordered Fried Chicken wings in hot buffalo sauce which is enough spicy to bring your tears but We enjoyed the flavour of the dish. The wings were a little over Fried.

Lastly, we ordered a 6inch Manhattan pizza which was perfect. Perfectly cooked. The cheese, chicken and the sweet corns were properly cooked. The flavour and taste was amazing.

Overall 4.5/5...

Located near Rabindra Sarobar stadium, the place is quite small and uniquely decorated.
We ordered
1. Mojito - It was tad sweeter than my liking
2. Tandoori Chicken, Veggies and Cheese Sandwich- totally loved it.
3. Bbq Chicken, bacon, fried egg and Cheese sandwich- a delight for bacon lovers.
And above all the friendliness and politeness of the staff.
And not to forget the place is extremely pocket friendly!
As they take a bit longer to serve, it is a good place to catch up on all the gossip with your friends ;)
Definitely going to visit again !

Located just beside medinova in southern avenue this joint will not be missed easily.
Accommodating average amount of people this place will give you a retro feel with posters of elvis presly & others.
But their food had a urban touch to it, so we settled for
üç∏Kiwi Mojito: a refreshing drink to beat this heat, whose main usp is its price.
üçóHot Buffalo Wings: as the name suggests its not for weak heart, fried chicken wings tossed in hot buffalo sauce enough to bring tears in your eyes.
üå≠Pulled Pork Sandwich: very tender meat inside with caramelised onions and egg sided with potato chips.
üçïHog Lovers Pizza: the show stopper which was loaded with all kind of meat starting with pork pepperoni, sausages, salami & bacon, with the right amount of cheese and served over thin crust dough. Highly recommended.
This place will not burn a huge hole in the pockets as they don't charge any taxes yet. The owner is very friendly and even staffs are courteous with prompt service. Can be visited multiple times without hesitation.
P.S.: points cut for decor and ambience, it could have been made better.

Went there after an hectic day of work for some refreshments.. Though the place is too small but is nicely decorated.. We ordered Brownie shake,, Kiwi Mojito and Iced coffee,,, Pulled Pork loaded French Fries and BBQ Chicken, Onion and cheese.. Both the brownie shake and Iced coffee were too sweet to taste and if they were a little bit cooler then they will taste better.. Apart from that the sandwich was too good.. I loved it but sadly I couldn't finish it fully.. The kiwi Mojito was refreshing enough and the pork item was good too.. Overall had a nice experience there.. And yes last but not the least the service is quite slow.. Hoping to get a fast service when I visit next time.. ‚ò∫‚úå

Reccommened by one friend..so visited this place few days back.
Situated near Menoka cinema, Southern Avenue.
A small joint, though the interior of popular old band posters on the wall, hanging lights is pretty impressive.

Ordered one kiwi mojito, oreo shake as mocktails..Chicken Cilantro Kiev with mash, Chicken Nasi Goreng. And for dessert brownie with ice cream.¬†

The mocktails were served fast,in big mason jars. ..kiwi mojito was refreshing, with mint leaves in it..Though I really wished they had used original kiwi for making the shake..it was flavored only.
Oreo one was better for me..I found oreo chunks in it,with chocolate sauce and oreo flavor it was really nice.

Next comes chicken cilantro kiev..they have modified the dish according to their choice, and there was two big chicken breast pieces, marinated and flavored with spices and cilantro,served with a generous amount of tasty mashed potato at the bottom,and garlic bread..Taste wise a thumbs up, only complain is that I found the chicken a bit stiff and not juicy inside..maybe due to a bit overcooking.¬†

Chicken Nasi Goreng is one Indonesian version of chicken rice as they said..the rice was really spicy,kind of gravy rice it was..cooked with sausages and lots of chicken chunks..had a very different taste, which was good obviously..and topped with a sunny side up egg. Perfect for a spicy food lover like me.¬†

Lastly we had the brownie with ice cream..the quality of the brownie could have been better I think. Though it was served in generous amount, with ice cream and dry fruits on top.

I wanna revisit this place to try few more of their other items from the menu, overall a good experiance.

I would have given it 5 but didn't because

1. There is only one A.C. and after gorging on chicken and cheese you actually start feeling very hot. The A.C. that too is situated at one wall, and the opposite side that is the place nearby the gate gets heated up due to always opening the door.

2. I have heard previously that the service is prompt. However they gave us the coolers very promptly just after the order was given and took another 20 minutes to deliver the main items.

The person in charge of the place is friendly and the food was good.

I've been here a couple of times and I absolutely adore the place. My personal favourite is the Chicken,fried egg, bacon and mayo sandwich. The burgers are a meal in themselves and the service is top notch. Waiters are super friendly. It won't burn a hole in your pocket and has an array of dishes and drinks that you can choose from. A must try!

Located in Southern Avenue, a little difficult to locate, but is a place worth visiting. It's a cute little place with nice ambience n music. We ordered Mojito, Pulled Pork loaded French Fries, and Fungi Pizza. Tge food was great. The pulled pork loaded French fries was nothing like I had tasted before. Thr pizza was also decent, though the mojito was a little more sweeter than required. Overall, this is a great place to try.

A new entrant in the Southern Avenue block,this place is perfect for a dine. The restaurant had American band posters spread all over the walls which made it look cool.
Despite of always being packed with people,this offers you fast service.
First I started with a cooler named Mojito.
For the starters, I tried my hands for Bacon Wrapped Sausages and Mushroom Fritters which were brilliant.
Their Patiala Pizza is awesome too.
But I was a bit disappointed with the Darjeeling Chicken Platter.
But still I have become a big fan of them and m gonna come back soon to this joint for another lovely evening.

One of the best food joints in kolkata right now. There is not much American Mexican style food joints in Kolkata and Macazzo can fulfil all the needs with their small one room, decorated with 80's and 90's souvenirs and complemented with great care and hospitality, located just opposite to Rabindra Sarobar stadium.
I have had the best fresh lime soda at Rs 40 in Kolkata. The amount is more than enough for one person.
Pulled pork loaded with French fries! Oh! My! God! I am a pork lover and I have never tasted anything more delicious than this. Anyone reading this review, you should go to Macazzo just for trying out this particular dish. And it is at Rs 220/- No extra vat or tax. All inclusive.
Next the darjeeling platter (pork). Sausage, Salami, meat loaf, bacon, egg poach, bread toast. Enough to fill 2 tummies at Rs 400/-
This food joint just made me a great fan of them. I will go again and again and again there.
P.S. - They are that kind of food joint who don't force you to pay service tax, rather earn it by giving exceptional hospitality and constant care.

This new destination has been a favourite in the lists of the foodies of Kolkata these days. The ambience is pretty good with music in the background to add to your dining experience. Coming to the food , it is pretty good. I must say the dishes are very reasonably priced. I happened to visit the place on a weekday afternoon and had ordered Hot Buffalo wings, ¬†Manhattan (Pizza) and a Blue Lagoon to quench my thirst. The Manhattan Pizza was very nice indeed and can be considered one of the best pizzas available in Cafe s like Macazzo. The Hot buffalo wings as the name suggests is very hot and is better if avoided by people who are not very fond of "hot" dishes. The Blue Lagoon was refreshing enough on a hot summer afternoon. Overall Macazzo is a place worth visiting if you want to spend time with your friends or colleagues having good food at a reasonable price. Pay a visit and your evening is sorted .

P.S. Unfortunately I clicked only one photo of the Blue Lagoon

Located at a strategic location near Menoka Cinema, this cafe has a nice decor with posters of Elvis Presley and brings back a lot of nostalgia.

Me and my sister could finally pay a visit to the place people have been raving about. We ordered blue lagoon, pulled pork french fries, sweet chilli chicken wings and barbeque cheese and onion sandwich and loved every bit of the food. The staff were very pleasant and made us feel at home. The prices don't burn a hole in your pocket and every dish is reasonably priced.

Looking forward to go back and try the tempting pork platter.

This is a fair sized cafe in Southern Avenue, near Rabindra Shorobor lake. The decor is really nice. And the small space management is commendable. We dined in one afternoon and seat was available readily.  Ordered fires with pulled pork for starters. This was really awesome. Shredded pork coveres the fries and the cheesy topping added the cherry to the cake. On the mains we ordered a chicken with a fancy name, which was cooked in mushroom sauce and was served with rice. Although this didn't taste as fancy as its name. A bit short of salt but it was okay when salt was added. The cutlery was clean and beautiful. The manager/owner (confused) was very amicable and well behaved. A thumbs up for this cafe. Would recommend to friends and relatives. Oh. And yes. The prices are fairly reasonable and doesn't burn your pocket. For two people it was apporximately 400. 
P. S. The Elvis Presley poster was awesome.

Brainchild of the previously renowned "The joint" of ajoynagar which was worked upon further & to a more customer attracting location, thus Macazzo was born being run & managed by Bitan da.

Macazzo's location is at southern avenue just at stones throw from menoka cinema hall. The space is of the outlet is smaller compared to joint but more attractive in terms of decor & design. Posters & frames of bands, hanging lights prepared out of old cassettes would make you feel nostalgic. So big props to that.

Now coming to the food we decided to not order their signature burgers/pizzas, so we took the following out of their continental items:-

1. Sweet chilli wings - 8 pcs of crunchy coated wings glazed in sticky honey sauce with a tinge of chilli sprinkled with sesame seeds. With every bite the wings did our tastebuds do the talking. So distinctively unique. The sticky glazed sauce deserves a special mention. Recommended item!!

2. Oreo shake - Basic cold oreo shake in milk & crushed oreos. Tastewise it was good but for me it was too runny, a tad bit thick could have been better for my personal liking. None the less a soothing & refreshing shake!!

3. Brownie shake - This was availed by my friend.

4. Cordon bleau - A thick bed of crusty chicken fillet with ham pork in between cut into 2 served with melted cheese slice in over the crusty fillet served with 2 crunchy garlic bread beneath mashed potato. The presentation was certainly different as compared to other continental places as per my friend. This dish was disappointing due to the fact that the cordon bleau was too dry to eat due to overcooking. We also told the same to bitan da who was courteous to accept the fact ‚úå.

5. Chicken alabama steak - The name itself aroused a sense of curiosity within me, so i ordered this for myself. The dish took a bit of time as told to us in advance that it would take time to prepare this. Then came a plate of tantalising colourful plate of a thick juicy chicken steak charred & marinated in indian style spiced which gave a hint of kebab. With the steak 2 small crunchy garlic bread were provided along with spiced mashed potato, 2 chicken sausages & a veg salsa as condiment. The garlic breads were tasty so were the delightful soft chicken sausages which literally melted in the mouth & the mashed potato was also unique in taste. The chicken was moist,tender & oh so juicy. Recommended dish!!

The service was decent & very prompt. They dont charge extra taxes in the menu, all the menu prices are final which makes this place pocket friendly. Bitan da was very communicative regarding the food which was very encouraging to see. Would be happily back to try their godly burgers!!

Those once in a blue moon times when I am completely satisfied with a cafe, and this is one such example. We had no idea about this place till me and my friend searched cafes on zomato  for a normal day outing using rating filter and this was on top. The place is amazing and yes for its food. I absolutely loved the food. Really finger licking food at such low budget is rare. Service was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. We had ordered for Fresh Lime Soda, Sweet Chilli Wings, Crispy Sweet Chilli Chicken Burger and Nawabi Pizza 6". We were literally full. The food was so great and so worth it. Planning to visit again soon. Keep up with the good work.

Located near of Rabindra Sarovar lake, Macazzo happens to be an ultimate stop for great comfort food at super reasonable rates. 
 There's really not much to mention about the ambiance except some innovative lightings done with old cassettes,used to make up hanging lamps. Then there's tissue paper holders made up of old record CDs. The walls are composed of false wood linings, and portraits of Hollywood stars and laminated Hollywood movie posters. 
The menu offers a wide range of varieties, sandwiches to pasta and tea to mojito! And all at reasonable prices. 
I sipped on an peach ice tea and munched on sweet chilly chicken wings. Amazed by the taste I decided to grab on a sandwich. I was recommended to try their BBQ chicken sandwich. I also tried their lemon ice tea. 

Lemon ice tea- 3.5/5 there's more space for improving. It was way too sweet and the flavour of lemon was not that intense. 

Peach ice tea- 4/5 this one was still a better one, however it could have been served with some ice and a bit less sugar. 

Sweet chilly wings- 4/5 the only problem with this was that there should have been a bit more seasoning. And the sauce could have been a bit more flavourful. The chicken had a crispy outside and a soft tender inside. Topped with sesame seeds for that extra crisp. 

BBQ chicken sandwich- 4.5/5 huge, chicken loaded sandwich with fried onion crisps and cheese. However there should have been a bit more cheese and the chicken chunks could have been a bit more or larger. 

Overall rating would be a 4.5/5. 
I had an amazing experience at macazzo. And it's highly recommended to meat lovers out there. And the owner is a complete sweet heart, he's very friendly and sweet. Otherwise the staff is also very friendly and courteous. The sweetest part id that they give chloromint candies as refreshment. Sweet indeed! 

Thank you. 
All the very best!

Great food, courteous service and value for money is how I would describe the place. Only wish it had more seating capacity.

It is a small place in Southern Avenue. We had to wait for sometime to get a table.

We ordered two shakes- brownie shake and mango shake. The brownie shake was decent. The mango shake didn't taste very well. The quantity is great for the price though.

For food, we ordered Chinese Nasi Goreng and Chicken Stroganoff. Both were very tasty and earned marks for both quality and quantity.

I hope they maintain their standards for the next time I am here.

Now coming to the food....we ordered a pork lasagna which was delicious,a pork nasi goreng which was a bit too spicy,a bacon carbonara pasta which was the best among everything we ordered,a veg cheese cream pasta which was tasty too and French fries.
They took some time to deliver the orders but the food was amazing.The quantity was more than enough and the price was pretty reasonable.
I am definitely going to this place again. :D

So I went to this new and cozy cafe in Kolkata called Macazzo which is near Menoka Cinema Hall.
The ambience is on point and the hospitality of the host was overwhelming. He personally asked us about the food and checked on our comfort.
They even allowed us to hang out there an extra hour after we finished our meals.
The service is a bit slow but once the food touches your mouth, the wait will become worth it. The music playlist today was mostly old school English classics which elevated the ambience further. The decor has an old Hollywood charm to it which fuses perfectly with street view of the city.

Drinks: Chilled Kiwi Mojito and Desi Masala Cola
Main Course: Cheesy Hog Lover's thin crust Pizza and Cheese Overloaded Pork Lasagna.

Maximum Rs. 800 for two, inclusive of all taxes.

This place was in my mind for the last few months. On Wednesday evening, we decided to pay a random visit to Macazzo. Ordered Darjeeling platter (which was sufficient for two), and two fresh lime soda as well as one aam paana. Platter tasted heavenly. Fresh lime soda were just too perfect. Aam pana was just out of the world. Highly recommended place. Staffs were just too nice. The manager was greeting us, and even enquired if the food was okay enough. Will definitely visit a thousand times. Thumbs up.

This pretty little cafe is pretty close to the stadium . Enchanting our minds with real good music and a classy decor , we could grab a seat after a little quench . Hearing a lot about their chicken wings , we ordered sweet chilli wings along with fresh lime soda and kiwi mojito. The chicken dish had a strong aroma of its own and it really swayed us away , both the drinks were really refreshing , specially mentioning about the amount they serve in that price ! Next we ordered the Manhattan pizza which just blew our mind , perfectly done , couldn't opt for something better. This was certainly the best pizza I have ever tasted. The staffs were really friendly. And the biggest plus point is their pocket pinch , all of these cost us 540 only ! Definitely looking forward to visit this place again to try their Darjeeling platter ! ‚ù§

The interesting thing about the place is the songs that are played goes with the old classic theme decor and the lighting arrangement.All of em' goes hand in hand.It is definitely not a clumsy place.
Now, moving to food!
We ordered-
1.Oreo Shake- It was nicely served in a mason jar,layerd with Oreo.The texture was nice and tasted very good.
2.Brownie Shake- Nicely served, innovative and taste was good.
3.FISH FINGER with Home made tartar dip- I give this dish a 200/100. The quality of the fish was very good,the coating was perfect and tasted heavenly with the dip.If you love fish you should definitely try it out and if you don't you'll definitely fall in love with the dish
4. Chicken Wings-After having the other three dishes this was a turn off,it looked yummy but didn't taste good at all,the coating was too much and the chicken was a bit burnt and was too sweet.
To sum it up!
Quantity- 4.5/5
Food- 4/5

Was searching for good place for brunch when came across this place in Southern Avenue beside Rabindar Sarovar stadium, Macazzo! Interior decor is eye catching with posters of bands and movie stars. Comming to the food we took Kiwi Mojito and Pineapple Mojito for drinks, Kiwi Mojito was best to beat the heat where I found Pineapple one little too sweet as I am not do fond of sweets in drinks. Next we took Pulled pork sandwich with onions and jalepenos which was very tasty and was served with chips, that is a must try. Next we ordered Bourbon glazed BBQ chicken which had a quite attractive serving,although I found the chicken was little overfried for which it tasted slight bitter. Overall quite a good place, friendly behaviour of all the service person and Vat and tax included menu for which you can estimate the bill in advance,we came to know while paying. If you are a calm place lover must visit this place.

A small and quiet food joint in the bylanes of southern avenue which is very easy to locate. Being a vegetarian the menu offers nothing much. We had our clich√©d picks.

Kiwi mojito was nice, chilled but no mint leaves in a mojito is disappointing.
Mocha shake was okay.
Oreo Shake was a disaster. The shake was so watery and a layer of fat was floating on it, seems like the milk was churned excessively to make it frothy, but failed.
12" Veggie pizza was amazing. Soft and chewy crust, perfectly topped with veggies and cheese. Flavour ful and cheesy.
Creamy pesto pasta was overpowered with the taste of basil and somehow I didn't find it much creamy. Just Average.
Prices are fair but the food needs attention.
The overall experience was okay. Extra points only for the man who manages the place as he was remarkably humble and amiable.

Went here with two other friends on a Sunday evening.
We weren't particularly hungry, just wanted to quench our thirst.
We ordered a mojito, one masala cold drink and a mango shake. We also ordered fish fingers.
The drinks were AMAZING. Specially the milk shake was just out of this world. The mojito was refreshing too. There's nothing to write about masala cold drink. It's what it is.
The fish fingers were WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH for three people. The fish was soft and flaky, though the exterior could have been better. It tasted like a besan crust whereas I would have liked it to be breaded.
Thumbs up for the service though. Really personalised and warm.

The best part though?
No taxes :)

It's a small cosy cafe with an old classic theme decor. The music playing in the background was much to my liking. Oh yes the food, it's delicious. We ordered Chicago Pizza which was super loaded and the price is pocket friendly too. The staff specially The Owner was extremely courteous.
Keep up the great work guys, hope to visit soon!!! üëçüëçüëç

I heard a lot about this place so finally dropped in..to start with its a good cosy place located at a perfect location..food was quite good..we had a darjiling pork platter and a Patiala pizza with 2 drinks..I liked all of them..specially the pizza
But I guess 2 things could have made it to a perfect 5..
1. They should think for a bigger space as mostly its full on weekends and people have to wait
2. The lights are bit bright..it can be bit soft and less in number

Overall: Another visit is on the cards.

A 5-8 minutes walk from the lake Kali bari area,the road leading to rashbehari. You cross the signal of lake Kali bari and just the first lane going towards the left and there it is. It is way smaller than I thought it would be. Nevertheless I liked the decor with cool music playing in the background. Specially I liked the lampshades kind off thing which were made of cassettes. It's unique! 

We ordered hog lovers pizza and brownie shakes. First came the shake. It had a very good taste. Like I could actually had the taste of brownie which is not the case in some of the other cafes. The quantity is more than enough. Then came the pizza after some waiting. The look of it won our hearts immediately! And when we tasted it,it was just awesome! I loved the taste!! They gave sufficient amount of meats that were supposed to be there and the crust was thin. Pizza was the showstopper to me although the brownie shake deserves equal thumbs up!! 

Overall I had a really great experience. I would love to visit this place again. The quantity is worth the price and the prices are pocket friendly. Plus it's inclusive of taxes. 

Keep up the good work!!

Not a very big place, can accommodate 10-15 people at a time. Located at the Southern Avenue .
Ordered mojito and pulled pork with bacon and cheese burger. 
Didn't like the burger. The meat was over fried and just too crispy and also they put ketchup in your burger and that's a big no-no for me. 
They should mention it in the menu or while taking the order if they should or not because not every prefers ketchup inside their burger. 
If you leave out the bacon nothing really was great about the burger. 
The mojito was good though.
They don't charges any taxes so it's easier on the pocket.

Thanks to my friends for suggesting me this place. A small place adjacent to Rabindra Sarobar will amaze you with mouth watering dishes and remarkable hospitality. We had ordered Patiala Pizza, Darjeeling Pork Platter, Blue Lagoon and Masala Coldrinks. The dishes taste unique and relishing. Simple yet classy d√©cor paired with good old rock music. Aah! A perfect hangout. The only issue is the place, it's not spacious so you might have to wait to get a table! I really wish they have some more outlets in the city soon!

Strongly recommend to every foodie. üëçüëç

Heard a lot about this place. So had to try it out. Comfy seatings. Service is quite good. Yes small crowded place. So getting a seat might require some waiting.
We had pulled pork with loaded French fries which was amazing. However the Darjeeling pork platter was a turn off. Too dry and salty. Coffee drinks are really good.
Quite pocket friendly. Will definitely recommend the place if you are a pork meat lover.

This is a cute place tucked away in Southern Avenue. The food is fresh and quite tasty. The sitting area is not that large and it is crowded mostly in the evenings. But this can be the perfect place to catch up with your friends over some good food. The service was very sluggish the day I visited the place. But they had apologized for the matter. Everything was nice excepting for the drink (iced tea) which was almost tasteless.
And the best part is the prices are inclusive of taxes.
So overall a good job done.üëç

okay so day by day we're becoming daily customer of Macazzo. So when it comes to relishing good food and variations in flavours, Macazzo comes first. Today we ordered Oreo Shake, kiwi mojito, Chicken Stroganoff with Parsley rice and Chicken pasta in pesto sauce. Served nicely with authentic flavours ‚ù§ 
Thank you Macazzo for serving such food which makes us more foodie ‚ò∫

This review is a bit late in coming, considering that I visited Macazzo almost a month ago. Still, better late than never ! :-) On-topic: it's a tiny but cozy joint right on Southern Avenue. We went on a weekday evening, but the place was packed. In fact we just managed to grab the only empty table, & another group of patrons who arrived barely a minute later had to wait in line to get in. And it's not hard to see why they were willing to wait! We ordered pork Darjeeling platters, Kiwi Mojito & Oreo Shake; & each item was great. My friend & I both have hearty appetites but the platter filled us up. Plus the gentleman who advised us on our item selection & served the food, was very friendly & courteous.
Highly recommended !

woh...what a cool place...nice songs...nice decor...its the best place for chilling with your friends... doesn't pinch a big hole in your pocket...the service just awesome...the behavior of the stuffs just way too nice...masala french fries was the best part...what a quality and quantity...hot chocolate was okayish and the sweet chilli Chicken burger was okay as well...my friend loved his veg and cheese burger..they do serve french fries with the burger as well...and the french fries were really to die for...i couldn't finish the burger had to waste a lil bit (which I hated and the stuff insisted on packing...so nice) as I was so full with the french fries...the kiwi mojito was very refreshing...altogether I'm gonna visit again with my friends for sure.

I am here to brag and nothing else. After a long search for a good cafe which serves delicious meals at affordable rates and good portions. This is your stoppage. Anything you order on the menu is lip smacking. Their service and food has made this a favourite joint for me. Their burgers and pizzas will make you forget your diet plans. And a added twinkle is their music. Only cafe that plays lovely music and proper rock and roll. Not pop in the name of music. Visited the place quite a number of times and returned every time craving for more...

A small cafe in southern avenue. It was a bit difficult to find since i went along rabindra sarobar side road to menoka. It is much more convenient from the southern avenue side.
Ambience is very unique. An american cafe kind of feel with the songs playing and the photo frames adding to the theme. Simple and sober.
Their food is what i had heard the most about. About how unique a menu they have. So we ordered pretty much the popular things. First we had a nawabi shake and british hot chocolate. The nawabi shake had a beautiful subtle n mild flavour to it. The hot chocolate was very authentic. I was there with my gf. She is a fan of hot chocolate n she loved it. Then we had bourbon glazed barbeque wings which were so crispy n juicy at the same time and the bourbon glaze was like a cherry on it.
Then we had a pulled pork sandwich which was pretty much like a normal sandwich with jalapenos n all. Wasn't bad. We were already pretty much full but even then we ordered a cilantro kiev. This dish was the most awesome dish i had that day. Chicken fillets stuffed with butter n with a crumble coating. The butter was oozing out on cutting the chicken. The mashed potato with it had a beatiful mixed flavour of origano. It complenent the chicken so well. The garlic bread added charm to the dish.
Service was very nice. They asked about the food and always had a smile on their face. And the owner greeted us wid a lovely thank you when we left. Loved every bit of it n will be visiting soon.

Great experience!!!!
Awesome food, cosy place, fine classy interior. 
A bit crunched up, but who cares when you get the best sitting! :-P
We ordered,
Oreo shake: tasty, refreshing. 
British hot chocolate: smooth, rich!
Sweet chilli chicken wings: lot of flavours, crunchy fried.
Darjeeling platter (pork): lots of meat, heaven for hard-core non vegs (like me). Standard platter sufficient for two!
Overall, I couldn't find a single flaw!!

Went on a Sunday evening with my cousins. We had Oreo shake,brownie shake, sweet chilli chicken.wings, BBQ chicken sandwich,tandoori chicken sandwich,brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sundae. The chicken wings were juicy and yummy, the sandwiches were good too. I personally liked the BBQ chicken sandwich more, the brownie with vanilla ice cream was drool worthy along with the chocolate sundae. The best part about this cafe is that the price is absolutely reasonable and the food here is great too‚ò∫

The place is a lot more tiny than it seems in the pictures! A maximum of 10-12 people can be seated at a time. We had ordered 4 dishes and 4 drinks. The dishes were a little disappointing as they were a little oily. Also, we had to wait pretty long to get our order. Otherwise, a good place to try out with your friends. There was only one man managing the place, and he was pretty friendly. Overall, had a nice time.

Simply amazing. From the easy to find location to the retro-American decor, Macazzo has a charm of its own.

We ordered pork lasagna, Milanesa Napolitana with French fries, lemon iced tea and fresh lime soda.

The lasagna was top-notch. From the fine hints of Italian spices, the right amount of cheese, to the perfectly cooked pasta and the amazingly fine-cut pork seasoned and cooked to perfection.

The Milanesa had some fat pieces along with the bacon, but everything tasted very good. The pork pieces were perfectly cooked, crunchy and the french fries were very crispy.

The lemon iced tea caught my attention, as they actually *make* the iced tea, not just stir readymade ice tea mix with some sugar. You could actually taste the slight bitterness of the tea leaves. The fresh lime soda was as good as a simple soda can get.

The price was reasonable, the portions quite filling. The two of us had a hard time finishing the dishes.

The staff is very courteous and the owner is very passionate about his restaurant.

I'd definitely recommend the pork lasagna.
Will surely visit again.

Tucked at one corner of Southern Avenue, Macazzo is one of the latest quaint cafe-style restaurants which have propped up in South Kolkata.

We visited on a Sunday evening and as expected, the place was completely packed. We were given an approximate waiting time of twenty minutes and got our table soon enough.

The ambience impressed us straight away. With little room to play and just 18-22 seats, the decor (with a theme of American bands and movie stars) was interesting.

After browsing through the menu, we, a party of four decided to order Thai Spicy Chilly Chicken Wings, a 6" Manhattan pizza, Chicken pasta in creamy pesto sauce and Blue Lagoon, Mojito, Masala Cold Drinks and a Mocha Shake.

The drinks (except for the Mocha Shake) arrived pretty quickly, while the food took some time. Considering the fact that there were just a couple of hands on deck and a complete full house, the lag time in the service was understandable. The crowd, mostly comprising of young 20-somethings, did not complain either.

The food was impeccable. The wings were just the right amount of crispy and doused in a well-balanced sauce which hit all the right spots.

I am not a pasta-lover by any means, but the Chicken Pasta in Pesto Sauce did satiate my taste-buds. Not only did it have enough amount of chunky chicken, but was creamy as well.

The Manhattan pizza was most definitely the winner among the dishes. With a thin crust and toppings of barbecue chicken, corn and onions, each slice was a mouthful.

We finished with Chocolate Pizza for dessert and it is a must try. A hot slice of pizza, dripping with Chocolate sauce was the perfect end to the meal.

A few words about the drinks - although the flavours were spot on, the drinks can be served at a little bit more chilled temperature.

The food is most definitely value for money and the person who runs the place is pretty cool himself. I, for one, will definitely be going back to try the mains on their menu.

Very cozy and small cafe near Menoka Cinema is a great pit stop for quick bites. We came across this accidentally while passing by. The owner is a through gentleman and very sweet in nature. We ordered Sweet Chilli Wings and Pulled Pork Loaded French Fries.¬†

Sweet Chilli Wings: This is the best chicken wings I have ever tasted. Right crunchiness and juiciness with special flavour sauce made the difference. We wiped off the plate in few seconds, True finger licking good, a must try.
Pulled Pork Loaded French Fries: This is a also a very popular dish of the cafe but to my taste the texture between two layers of cheese/pork is not going with simple dry crispy french fries. This dish may go excellent with beer but the cafe doesn't serve alcohol hence this dish needs more innovation.

The cafe being in top of the list of near by college goers hence its very noisy inside. No able to relish few more of their dishes as was in hurry but will come back soon.

Its a small quaint cafe with quirky decorations..the lampshades are made of cassettes and the walls had posters of the beatles band.The staffs were courteous and always always asking for our feedback  on each dish.We had :
Kiwi mojito-Though my brother liked it i didnt like it much.. to me it was medicine-like in taste.
pulled pork loaded french fries-french fries covered with a layer of pork and cheese which was heavenly.We kept on fighting for the last portion of cheese and pork.
hot buffalo chicken wings-it was supposed to be fiercely spicy which guarantees dragon breath.Since we love our food a little spicy we loved the sauce.B ut we did tell them to make it a little mild.
Prawn and fish thermidor-Now this was the show stealer...literally we had foodgasm while having it and left us craving for more.Highly recommended.
P.s.they dont charge any extra tax..prices mentioned in the menu are inclusive of taxes.

Thumbs up : Their Platters ! The staff is very responsive as well. Very pocket friendly !

Thumbs down : Considering this to be a hotspot right now, it is difficult to get seats during the peak hours. Also the cafe is really small which is why big groups are a nightmare. 

Food :

Mocktails -
-> Virgin Mojito - Perfect !

Starters -
-> Sweet Chili Wings - This is one of the best wings I've had in a long long time. Beautiful sauce !

Mains -
-> Chicken Darjeeling Platter - Pretty big portion for one person. Sausages were perfectly cooked. Beautiful dish. 
-> Crispy Sweet Chili Chicken Burger - Same sauce az the wings. However, beautiful burger. Juicy & Delicious !

Desserts -
-> Chocolate Pizza - Nothing great about it. The bread, the chocolate sauce just didn't add up.

Awesome.. Just awesome.. Amazing food and Amazing Service. The quality and quantity is too good and their hospitality is really worth it. A must visit for all foodies. I loved it. Decor is decent and simple. Small place so you might have to wait incase it is full. We had the following dishes- Chilli Hot Chocolate, Mocha Shake, Oreo Shake, Manhattan Chicken Pizza, Darjeeling Platter (Chicken) and another one called the Bourbon Chicken Wings( forgot to click the picture as we all were busy eating :P). Please do check in to this Chhota packet Bada Dhamaka called "Macazzo" ;)

I was there at last week, place was cozy but deco and ambiance was good.
Ordered elaichi milk tea and mocha shake. Tasted good both of them.

Then I tried bacon wrapped sausages. It was also pretty good. Then there comea the disaster named "Chicken Strips".
It had around 98% overfried coating and 2% chicken, price was pretty high. I was disappointed. I packed the item because it was totally not eatable. Went to home and throw it later.... My brother also not liked that.

Time: 6.00 PM

Intro:  After our walk in the southern Avenue lake in a sultry summer evening, we were scheduled to meet up with our friends in here. We had to check out the newest kid in the block who was making some great noise!!

Location: from southern Avenue end it's located at the start of the lane of the menoka cinema , just beside the ICICI atm.

Ambience: this is a new place, decorated with posters of american rock bands , movies from the past , it has a maximum seating capacity of 15-16 people. A note of caution, being so high in rating this place is always trending and filled with people.

Service: the 1st to arrive at this place was my missus and I, our friends joined a bit later. But the owner/ manager of this place allowed us to hold on to seats for them , insipte of it being a rush hour. I must thank him for that!! Service is fast and the servers have knowledge about dishes. 

Food: coming to the best part; at 1st we ordered a plate of sweet chilli roasted pork, with a glass of iced coffee for the missus n aam panna mojito for me.
Soon we were joined by our friends.
A steaming bowl of sweet chilli roasted pork was served before us along with the coolers. Aam panna was okayish so was the coffee.
The pork I must say is one of the most delicious pork dishes I've ever tasted. Soft juicy chunks pork cooked in honey based gravy with touch of chilli and roasted to perfect smoky flavour was absolute bliss.  These are the times that I miss a pair of cold one, which go best with bowl of pork!!!
Alas, It was finished in no time.
Next, we wanted to order a plate hot buffalo wings, but upon hearing that our bottoms might get turned into fire breathing monsters the next day (lol), we settled for chicken wings in barbeque sauce and a plate of bacon wrapped sausages.
The chicken wings was nicely cooked n fried and served in barbeque sauce with seasame seeds. It was juicy and perfect.
The sausages on the other hand was another piece of heaven! The thin strips of bacon, fried and adding a smoky flavour to the sausages was on another level when dipped in the sauce served with it and consumed.

Cost: 600 bux for 2 ppl.

Conclusion: its just an awesome place, even a person like me who isn't much in favour of pork just loved every bit of the dishes served here. Thru out the dining, I was thinking this place would have been perfect if they served some beers with em porks!! But , as they say ,you can't get em all!! Loved the place it's brilliant.

The best part about this place is the fantastic list of items that they offer. 
Unlike many places in the city, it doesn't thrive to provide the same old sandwiches and burgers. 
The food here is delicious and the quantity is a justice to the price as well. 
I loved the visit here and would definitely visit Macazzo in the near future. 
Service is way beyond satisfactory .
Kolkata needs more places like this, where the management , under no circumstances allows  cramping up the place with extra chairs.
'already in ' people can atleast enjoy a good meal without strangers invading their personal space. 
Good thing. Loved Macazzo.

Try out their French fry loaded with bacon and cheese,  sweet chilly chicken wings and Oreo, strawberry and mango shakes.

Highly impressed with this eatery ! The little joint ( total capacity of 18-20 heads at max ) with well-lit admirable decor (hangings of some classic American movie-scenes/posters depicting the then American pop culture etc) and all time favourite Bob Dylan tracks in the background uplifted our mood. Then the courteous staffs and their dedications should get special mention. I requested them to serve completely ice-free coolers ( I know it's pretty unusual but was compelled, owing to my cough n cold attack) , & they were sweet enough to keep my request .. and this friendly gesture from their part made two of us to order 4 coolers and 2 plates of French fries along with a darjeeling standard chicken platter ! Phew we are real foodie :p .. from coolers we had kiwi mojito, normal mojito , aam panna (not so good) & oreo shake. Both masala & normal French fries were served with ketchup , which I would have loved to replace with mayonnaise :D .. the platter was wholesome , specially the sausages were rightly cooked and tasty!
Lastly the prices on the menu are inclusive of tax (as of now) and thus this joint is highly recommended for all my foodie friends . Will visit soon to try the other dishes !! :)

I followed Zomato ratings and decided to give this place a try. I was slightly disappointed.
Don't get me wrong, the place is good. Location wise it's pretty great on a relatively quiet part of Southern Avenue, cuisine-wise it's just right if you have a moderately adventurous tongue, and most importantly items are decently priced. It's one of the more pocket friendly restaurants of its kind. And the prices on the menu are inclusive of taxes.

It's just that I was slightly disappointed because I went in with greater expectations. We ordered a Kiwi Mojito, which was rather good, and a brownie shake which was good enough.
We tried the oxymoronic Hot Buffalo Wings (whichever way you decide to take it apart, a 'hot' buffalo, or buffalo wings!) and were warned the dish would be very spicy. The menu promised 'dragonbreath' and the staff kept repeating the warnings but we went ahead anyway. I found it faintly spicy, and it's true I have a greater tolerance for spicy food, but it was nowhere close to 'dragonbreath' inducing. But credit where it's due, one plate was a generous 8 pieces of chicken wings.
We followed this up with a Nasi Goreng, the Indonesian version of fried rice, served with a poached egg on top. The dish was disappointing, primarily rice heavy with sauces. For me the dish got boring after a few bites, the taste of sauce was overbearing.

The service was good, the staff polite and courteous, and the interior modern and nicely done with posters of musicians and vinyl record shaped tissue paper holders.¬†

This place is recommended for it's pork dishes, and I definitely mean to try that out once. The Darjeeling platter excites me (especially with all the Keventer's nostalgia), and I mean to hit the place again with a fellow pork lover.

Located off Rabindra Sarobar on the corner as we turn left from Southern Avenue towards the stadium.

A well lit up place with simple taste of decor. You'll find frames of automobiles etc etc.

We ordered for a BBQ Chicken, Onion and Cheese sandwich, Chicken Stroganoff, Double Decker Chicken Burger, Napolitana Chicken, Mango Shake, Chicken Steak and a Chocolate Sundae.

The sandwich was out of the blue. The combination of a Garlic bread with BBQ chicken stuffed inside was a first and awesome.

The Stroganoff had a lovely flavour and the quantity was a wholesome. 
The burger was a bit on the dry side. That patty was not juicy which made it difficult to finish.
Napolitana chicken topped with sausages was a treat in itself.
The steak had a lovely sauce. Worth a try over here.
The Sundae was just the way expected. Nothing fancy. But it served the purpose.

A mention for the great hospitality as well.

This caf√© is the quintessential throwback to the 50s and 60s with posters of movies from that era. I had the pulled pork loaded with fries which was a big bowl filled with French fries mixed with pulled pork and topped with a layer of cheese. The sweet chilli wings were on the right side of tangy crispy goodness while the Oreo shake was cold and not cloying.

As far the location goes it is easy to spot .The very first store of the lane that goes to Menoka cinema hall.
Its spacious enough for a close group of friends.The best part of this joint is that it takes no taxes .Just pay for what you eat. The owner happens to be very polite and well mannered unlike other places. Now coming to food, it takes time for them to serve .But you wont be disappointed since all their foods are fresh and hot and prepared instantly. We had Chicago pizza , Pulled pork french fries and Bong fish and chips.
Delicious is too short to describe. The only thing i would want them to know is to make the quantity of fish more .Its worth going to this place.

Truly warm welcoming and service. Nice little place to hangout with quite elaborate menu. Though I could try only one dish, the place sure made a mark. We had pork satay curry: nice with extra curry and little rice, kiwi mojito: amazing, Oreo shake: slightly thin in consistency, could have been better and mango shake: had hints of small crushed nuts though I felt the flavour was slightly unnatural.

The place is too small and the ambiance is okay. They had wallpapers of Pink Flyod, Led Zeppelin, Elvis Presley. Even they were playing " Pink Flyod - Comfortably numb " so that's a better choice of music they play. I ordered their special dish Darjeeling pork platter. Well to be honest what i had seen the picture of the dish in the photos and what i got was very different. In picture i expected that the dish would be enough to fill up one persons appetite but it was not so. Although the dish was Very Very tasty .
Score:
Taste - 8/10
Quantity - 6/10
Ambience - 7/10
Price - 6/10.
Well it is a good hangout joint for teenagers too. College goers must surely visit here .

Oh..how I wish 0 stars were possible 
Truly.. offended with this place. Firstly, the ambience was very suffocating nd stuffy. And then food was just awful..we ordered for cheesy fries which was not upto the mark and at the end it was so dry that anybody would choke up. After that we were served a completely raw continental dish which was charred black from outside and with it the mashed potato was nothing more than aloo chokha. And the fish and chips was horrendous ..it was mashed potato all over couldn't find fish. Couldn't differentiate between fish fry nd fish and chips. I have never had a worse dining experience than this. I think itz time for the owner to get off his high horse. I wouldnot recommend this place to anybody.

A quaint new place with excellent service, this place is located just on Southern Avenue. With the manager being extremely friendly and service being done by him alone, no customer was left waiting or disappointed. 
The food matches up to the service as well. The pulled pork loaded french fries were amazing and the wings were much more than we expected. 
The pizza did not disappoint either. The kiwi mojito and blue lagoon served in jar added to the experience as well.
All of this combined with reasonable prices makes this place a must visit.

Macazzo is a small joint located in Southern Avenue. It has an interesting decor. And the bright lights with movie themed lamp shades and amazing playlist almost have a mood elevating effect.
Coming to the food. We ordered 2 shakes, the strawberry shake and Oreo Shake. Both were amazing. Though I feel they could use a lil less sweetening in the strawberry one. We also has a pulled pork sandwich and a chicken cheese burger. Both of which were lovely ... But huuge. We were struggling to finish them off. I surrendered after eating half of my sandwich at which point the owner offered to pack it up. The only server we came across seemed like a nice and helpful guy.
Overall a great experience. Would definitely recommend to everyone :) 
Also, I forgot to click the photos of the sandwich and burget. :/

Have found it in zomato. And yes quite interested while going through the menu and as I do keep it as a bookmark also. But yes thought that would have visit it one day. And yes I thought it will be done in a year atleast as there is plenty there in bookmark. And a surprise to me, a sudden plan and we were there.

Location: 
______________
it is in southern avenue, 7 mins by car from golpark. Just follow the Google map. It's just near the menoka cinema hall.

Decoration:
_______________
A very small joint with a sitting arrangement of 15 to 18 people at one go. And it's totally decorated with American falvour, the display of the music , pics and lot more.

Food and beverage
______________________

That is the main USP. Trust me we were damn hungry when we reached there, and thought we will pull a lot of their items. But all the items were just heavy to fill the stomach. Let's go by the review and you will understand my grievance.

‚úì cappachino: very well presented and damn good in taste.
‚úì pineapple mojito: it's ok type. Refreshing but not that good.
‚úì Pulled Pork loaded french fries : french fries baked with cheese and shredded pork. It's heavenly in taste. Owssum.
‚úì Pulled Pork Becon fried Egg sandwich: owsum one. The sandwich is just too good.

We were intended to order another item, but the owner came and told- 1st have this one, it's heavy. Then you can order if you feel. And rightly so, we were stomach full.

They disappointment was all the food items were that tastey we wanted to eat more, but we were full.

So, lots of dish pending to taste, so more visit is just compulsory.

I thought of given it a 4.5 but but the taste of pork item hold me to do so. Undoubtedly one of d best pork items in town.

It's cost : 650 INR for 2 person.

To management: 
____________________
your food quality and hospitality is just superb. Keep it on. And yes if not visited again to your outlet is a crime for sure. And I couldn't afford to do that :D

To all : give a visit there, it's one of d best cafe in the city for some reason :)

Heard about Macazzo from few of my friends so decided to give it a try!
Finding the place was a breeze.

When I entered, the first thing that I loved about the place was the ambience. The decors, the posters of stars of yesteryears was really impressive! (The record shaped tissue holder was a nice touch!) There was no unnecessary clutter anywhere.

Coming to the food. Me and my friend ordered a Mango shake and Kiwi Mojito and  two sandwiches ; one was Veg Sandwich with mushrooms,cheese,veggies and olive and the other one was Pulled pork sandwich.

The drinks were served in small jars which was something new! The were quite refreshing!
The sandwiches were served quite fast. The presentation was on point. Was skeptical about the size of the sandwich as that was my lunch :P 
But I was stuffed by the time I was done with it!
The taste was good but I felt it was a bit too salty for me. There was ample pork in them!

The guy who served us was very helpful. He also enquired about how the food was and if anything was off. I feel this attitude is important for any place to grow! 

Really had a great time! Keep up the good work! :)

We ordered a BBQ Chicken Onion Cheese Sandwich and Hot Buffalo Chicken Wings with a Fresh Lime soda and Masala Cold drinks. All of them were top notch and very reasonably priced. Though the place is not a huge one, but the decor and ambience hugely makes up for that. If you are looking to have a good time with your small group of friends without having to worry too much about the pocket pinch, this is the place you are looking for.

It is a very well decorated place situated in Southern Avenue. We had gone to this place after reading a review in Zomato. For starters we had the roasted Chili pork. Then we ordered for the Manhattan and the Nawabi pizza and the pork Lasagna. All the items were very tasty. For drinks we took an Oreo shake, a brownie shake and fresh lime soda. The prices are comparatively cheap and all the prices were inclusive of taxes. The decor was very beautiful and exquisite. The playlist was just perfect. The waiters were very courteous and the food was served on time.

Visited Macazzo today with my parents on the occasion of Mother's day. The sole purpose of the visit was to try out their chicken and pork platters. Both the platters were sumptuous. Although I found the pork sausages and salami a tad more saltier than how I prefer it. Had also tried their Brazilian hot chocolate which is equally good. All in all , the place has a lovely old school vibe and the chef takes personal care of every customer to make sure the food is fine. Will definitely visit another time to try other items.

Update from 11/6/17 : 

Couldn't help but visit macazzo again for their chicken and pork platters. This time I didn't find the pork platter salty. It was just right. Everything was melt in your mouth tasty. The bacon and chicken sausages were lipsmaking good and the skin on the pork sausages was crispy , the way I like it. For such good platters, their rating deserves to be raised. Im adding 1more point to my rating for the lovely experience.

A beautiful little place with a good comforting ambience and ofcourse good food! It has a "feel good" quotient. Well being quiet a busy place,it dint fail to serve me with those delicious food.
MOJITO,OREO SHAKE,BARBEQ CHEESE ONION SANDWICH,FRENCH FRIES and last but not the least DARJEELING CHICKEN PLATTER dint fail to satisfy my taste buds. Its well proportionate and adequate for me and my two friends. I found the platter a bit salty in taste but may be I prefer less salt in food but the meat was perfectly cooked. French fries are common everywhere but I felt its taste is something that has hold me forever. Oreo shake was a bliss in this hot summer. Mojito was fine enough and the sandwich dint lift me up that much but ofcourse it was aint that bad. Its worthy of its price. üòä
And well its tax free üòÇ.
Well if you ask me it will be 4.5 out of 5.

Macazzo is a Pork lover's haven. I went there with a big bunch of college friends and we ordered a wide array of things. 
Firstly the iced coffee and Oreo shake tasted good. Chilled to perfection with sumptuous amount of Oreo cookie made it amazing.
The mojito was one of the best I have had. The mint and lemon blended amazingly and had a supremely refreshing vibe about it.
We ordered the Pork Lasagna, Pork Narsi Goreng, Buffalo wings, Cheese and Bacon loaded fries. Pork Lasagna was beyond perfection. The way the Pork was cooked, it left me craving for more. Layering it up with cheese, this was a delight.
The Narsi Goreng did complete justice to this authentic dish and fries are love, anyday.
The staff is courteous, the owner takes personal care to your needs. The music is amazing and the decor peps your mood up. Decorated with posters of music maestro like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis Presley and cult classics like My Darling Clementine, this is your go to place for Pork in Southern Avenue.

This is such a lovely little place ticking all the right boxes with its classy cool decor,tasteful music,neat indoors and super cool host and staff,making this the BEST cafe joint I have visited till date.The food is so good that you would surely come again and again.I had ordered a Chicago Pizza,which is a hot favourite here and found it to be a real pleasure,though a tad overpriced.A 6" pizza is sufficient for two people of medium appetite if u are ordering other things.The French Fries which we had taken as Starters proved to be a fitting start to the meal. It's taste was just right and the quantity was way too much,so much so that we went on eating the fries till the end of the meal.We had also ordered an Oreo Shake which was served in a jar(which I found innovative) was delicious and filling at the same time.The great plus is they dont charge any extra taxes and you can go on enjoying the awesome of the cafe long after your meal has ended.In all,it was one worthy visit and I look forward to go here again and again.


On a second visit,I felt the charm slightly diminished but the service was as good as the previous time.We ordered a BarBQue Pizza and Masala French Fries and I found the quality of the pizza to be not up to the mark.The crust was crunchy and I had to leave bits of the pizza on the plate as leftovers because they couldn't be chewed properly.Also the Masala French Fries were no surprise with a bit of chilli flakes smattered on the ordinary french fries and bcz of this meagre addition,the price of the dish became costlier.The food quality needs to improve a lil bit and the place would again be on my good books again.

Decor and Ambience awesome. Staff are extremely humble and friendly. Went for Tandoori Chicken Veggies & Cheese Sandwich and Chicken Nasi Goreng.
Chicken Nasi Goreng is an Indonesian dish which I had it in Indonesia as well, this item was at par with that one for sure. 
Tandoori Chicken Veggies & Cheese Sandwich was yummy and excellent as well.
Overall a great experience.

A small but an attractive cafe that plays some real good song all day long.
Loved their interior decor simple yet has a cool quotient in it.
Coming to the food, their sweet chilli chicken wings is perfect.
Chicken Nasi Goreng is a great combination of smoky, spicy and slight tangy flovours.
Chicken Chicago Pizza was okayish.
But I didn't like their Shepherd's Pie at all.

This place is worth visiting at least once.

Macazzo- there's a uniqueness in the name, ol'boy, innit? Well, that's how you should speak at Macazzo because the whole place is filled with lampshades illuminating frames from Searchers, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, My darling Clementine and many more Hollywood classics. Long story short, if you share the love for classic American culture, then this is your place to go.

Coming to the food, I must say this is heaven for pork lovers. The juiciest bacon and sausages, cooked to perfection along with the most spicy chicken wings in town, Macazzo has made me visit this quaint little restaurant multiple times for more than one reasons. Try anything, they are just too good with meat! 

Recommended dishes- Buffalo sauce Chicken wings ( a delight for those who love super hot chicken wings), Bacon and cheese French fries, Hog lovers' pizza and bacon wrapped sausages. But I would ask you to go ahead and order anything from the menu. 

I have been waiting for ages now for a restaurant that serves cheap meat. Macazzo has done just that! Cheers to the owners!

The first thing that struck me when I entered Macazzo is how small it is! The pictures online were quite deceptive. However, what it lacks in space,it makes up with its beautiful d√©cor. The posters on the walls are from the yesteryears of Western popular culture and the music that was playing was retro. There was only one gentleman manning the restaurant during lunchtime on a holiday but since there's not much seating area, it isn't too much of an inconvenience.
We ordered Blue Lagoon, Fresh Lime Soda, Oreo Milkshake, Iced Tea, Cordon Bleu, Chicken Lasagna, Pork Nasi Goreng and Greenwich Pizza. The drinks were lovely and were generous in quantity. The food,however, wasn't the greatest. The mashed potatoes in the cordon bleu was runny, the pork nasi Goreng was too oily and the pizza was too bland. The lasagna was the only flawless dish of the day.
Our waiter was an extremely pleasant person and served us with a smile.
It was a good experience overall but Macazzo does have area where they can improve a lot.

This Retro-Woodstock themed cafe-restro serves up quite an exhaustive menu....

Recommended for -

Roasted Sweet Chilli Pork (marked as a starter but can easily go as a main accompaniment; juicy and very well marinated with a touch of honey)
Cordon Bleu with Mash (the quintessential old world charm; very delectable and easily at par with the Mocambos of the world)

Pork Chops with Mustard Mash & Veggies (My pick... absolutely brilliant with Pork being supple; the mustard mash adds zing to the prep; one of the best that we've had in a long while)
Brownie with Nuts & Cream

Recommended heavily for the taste, value for money and lovely portions

If you want to eat Pork, go to Macazzo ! Not anywhere else ! May sound weird :D but yes ! Macazzo's the only place which I trust when it comes to Pork. Great ambience and great taste at a reasonable price. If you have a big belly try the Darjeeling Pork Platter (Large) with Nawabi Shake ! These are my personal recommendations and don't forget to try those pizzas, burgers and hot chocolates too !

Today we were a witness to a one man show, the place was run by a single person which is why the service was late, but it was efficient.  The food is great except the browny with vanilla ice cream. The rest of the food was great. The ambiance was great so was the music. I am defiantly coming back to this place again & again till I get tired of good food.

Visited this after going through lot of positive reviews on zomato. I really wanted to try the darjeeling platter, all this years i wished Calcutta had an outlet like Keventers, Darjeeling.

The crispy chilli wings were amazing, prawn and fish Thermidor was too salty, but tasted heavenly good.

The Darjeeling platter was amazing.

All the mocktails were average but extremely pocket friendly.

PS: 9.30 PM is the closing time.

What are the things that you need to satiate 5 post-university ravenous appetites in this Kolkata heat? Well not much- an A.C, some water, good music, a huge Elvis Presley poster and ofcourse good food. So to say it in short Macazzo has it all :P
Located on the beginning of the street leading to  Menoka Cinema from the golpark side, this cafe is a really nice place to hang out with your friends on a hot summer day!! 
The walls are done in a lovely brickish red colour with posters of Jimmy Hendrix, Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin up on them. The lamp shades are covered with pictures of scenes from iconic movies and the entire ambience of the place gives out a very chilled vibe. So now coming to what we ordered.
Fresh lime soda 
Lemon iced tea
Both the drinks were made to perfection and the iced tea had actual tea and not some instant iced tea mix that other places give.
Sweet chilli wings. Crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside, cooked in a honey chilli sauce. You'll keep on licking your fingers üôà
Hog lovers pizza. Bacon, pepperoni and chicken. Need I say more? :P
Patiala chicken pizza. The classic Indian pizza in all its glory.
Both the pizza's were thin crust, super light and super tasty!!
Chicken nasi goreng. It's an Indonesian rice dish. The rice is cooked in what tasted like a schezwan sauce and served with a fried egg on top. Something I tried for the first time and really liked.
Chicken pasta in cheese sauce. The comfort food of all time. The pasta had a really light base sauce which made it taste a bit different in a good way. 
So the food was absolutely‚Äã spot on. Didn't have any room left to try their desserts. So that's in stock for the next visit. The owners were very friendly and helped us in choosing what we wanted. The service is a bit slow so I deducted half points for that, but I don't think that would bother you if you are not food hoggers like us and are actually sitting down and talking unlike us xD 
Giving this place an absolute thumbs up. Please visit this place. Gorge on their food. Till then. Happy Dining Peeps :)

1. Brownie Shake
2. Bourbon Glazed Bbq Chicken Wings.
3. Tandoori Chicken, Veggies and Cheese Sandwich.
4. Pulled Pork Loaded With Cheese and French Fries.

The owner is a good natured person. Coming to the food, we ordered a pizza along with a chocolate shake and a mango shake, which were really good. All in all this place deserves a 5/5.

It's been on my list for a long time.. Finally went there with Saikat Mondal ..A very small cafe just a few metres away from Menoka cinema hall..We were lucky enough to get a table as it was already full..Lovely ambiance along with soothing retro music and unique beautiful decor..We ordered Lemon iced tea (‚Çπ50), Rose and mint iced tea (‚Çπ70), Chicken & mayo sandwich (‚Çπ180) and Chocolate pizza (‚Çπ90).. The quantity and the quality of the food was great (except the chocolate pizza was too sweet for my taste) and the beverages were very refreshing..the owner (who was serving with one broken arm although he was very enthusiastic and always greeting people with a big smile) and the staff were very courteous..They made sure we liked the food..No added taxes which makes things all great together..Overall a perfect place for chit chat and munching food..Last but not least they gave us chlormints as complimentary at the time of payment of the bill.. Surely going back for more..

After hearing a lot about this place and after going through all the positive reviews, we visited this place today! This restaurant is located a few buildings away from medinova, close to menoka cinema hall..
The interior is quite creative There were handmade lanterns and movie posters hung on the dark walls and the playlist here is to die for.. I was having high expectations from them after going through the reviews and these people were successful in satisfying my cravings..
Well, now coming to the food.
We ordered
1) BROWNIE SHAKE
2) PULLED PORK LOADED FRENCH FRIED and
3) CHICKEN STROGANOFF IN PARSLEY BUTTER RICE..

The brownie shake was just delicious, the crumbled brownies made it taste heaven.
One of my main purpose of visit was their pulled pork loaded french fries.. This dish altogether was a level apart. Crunchy fries loaded with cheese and pork. U guys absolutely justified the name of the dish This dish will be heaven for the ardent pork lovers! The stroganoff was also yummy. The thick, creamy sauce was beautifully made and overall it was a treat to the mouth.. The staff and the owner both were very warm and courteous. The quantity was more than enough for both of us..
Overall, i had a great experience and i am definitely visiting this place again for their darjeeling platter.

At first sight the place comes across like a petite cafe, ensuring a very homely atmosphere. Interiors are interesting with famous personalities staring at you from above your head, catchy frames adorning the walls.
Extremely pocket friendly, a good variety of dishes coupled with a sizeable portion delivered on the plate ensured we left with our stomachs full. All pork lovers, this place is a must try to satisfy your palate.

Well after two awesome experiences this review was long overdue. With so many eateries springing up the the southern Avenue side this place is a star. From serving delicious food to the friendly smiles of the staff and owner its surely to stand out. 
I've visited this place twice and have had the pulled pork fried egg and bacon sandwich which was great, the pork tasted great with the right spicing and crisp as well as goey egg and bacon oozing that pork fat. Also the roasted pork sandwich which was nothing less. 
The kiwi Mojito is the most refreshing drink you can have this summer.
The chilli hot chocolate is really hot with the hotness from the chilli heating up the right places after a sip or two. Perfectly served in the right temperature and hotness of the chilli. 
The mochaccino is also a great for that caffeine kick in your meal 
Love going back to the place 
P. S You might have to wait a couple of minutes to get a place in the evenings.

Want to hangout with the close ones' and have a chat while you eat ? Well I guess macazzo has an answer for you.
Nice food and quiet neighborhood to begin with.
The interior was setting quite a right mood for retro songs in low volume. Posters and the style of lighting was impressive. This is a cozy little place which you should try once atleast.
I was there with Shalmoli Ghosh .. ordered sweet chilli wings and pulled pork loaded fries..
and drank mango shake and brownie shake.
The wings were so good to have. They made the wings with a crispy yet saucy layer, which is awesome in its way. Topped with sesame seeds and drenched in tangy sauce.
The shakes were good too. After having something strong like the chilli wings, the fries felt quite normal.
We enjoyed our 2 hours of eat and chat pretty much.
Verdict :
Food : 9.5/10
People : 10/10
Ambiance : 8.5/10
Value for money : 9/10

Undoubtedly a 5/5 for Macazzo. Food and only food is enough to melt your soul. I ordered Brownie Shake, Lemon tea, Chicken Pasta in white sauce and the best of the lot - Milanesa Napolitana. Milanesa Napolitano just stole the show. üíñüíñ The food were lip smacking. I always order Lemon tea wherever I go but this time I actually got the flavour of tea in my Lemon 'Tea'.
So thumbs up. üëç

After Three visits, it will be a crime not to review this place. The restro opened last year but for foodies, you will recognize it to be a shifted restro from Garia area, most probably the name was 'The Joint'!
Awesome food, perfectly thin crust pizza, beautiful portion sizes, amazing Rock-Star decor and super fantastic playlist make this place one of my favs. The Brownie shake is delectable. They also have the typical Keventer's Breakfast Platter, which tastes good but certainly missing the Kanchenjunga View.
Only downside for me is the desserts section which needs a lot of work.
There is a shortage of staffing so make sure you have time in hand when you hit this place to chill on some good food nd good music.
A must visit from my side.

I was here this weekend - to catch up with a friend after years! And trust me when I say, Southern Avenue needed a place like this for way too long! This is a tiny caf√© on Southern Avenue, right opposite to the Lake Stadium, a few minutes walk from Menoka. The place fits in 15-16 people at max and has a nice playlist - but it gets really loud when it's full. The owners are warm, and they often double up as managers and waiters. 
Since we both were almost full, we decided to keep it light. So here it goes :

üî∏Kiwi Mojito : You can not ask for something more refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. The chopped basil leaves made it even more better.

üî∏ British Hot Chocolate : I didn't try it, but it definitely smelt delicious. Honestly. :3

üî∏ Friend Chicken Wings : This is basically crumb fried chicken wings and drumsticks, served with ketchup. The chicken was soft moist and delish.

Oh, the one who was serving us had a short arm cast, and yet he was working! It's nice to see people with such high spirits! Get well soon Dada!

Located at one end of Southern Avenue, opposite the lake, this is a pretty new caf√©. 

To start off the place is really small, and if you're there on a weekend, in the evening, then good luck getting a place to sit. The owners double up as managers and often as waiters. Their service is extremely friendly and warm and they leave you asking for nothing more. 

The only downside would be that they take some time in getting the food, which is worth it since they serve it hot, and it tastes like heaven. 

We ordered a fresh lime soda, sweet and a cup of Darjeeling tea. This is one of those rare places that actually do give you Darjeeling tea, and don't just pass off anything they can. The lime soda was served in a mason jar, and it tasted perfect. It was a good way to while away the time waiting for the food. 

We had ordered Pulled Pork With Fries. The fries were topped with a thick layer of brilliant, tender pulled pork cooked to perfection with a covering of thick cheese that made the dish heaven. I would go back to this place again and again just for their cooking and their prices. 

I want to try their fried chicken wings which I've only heard great things about. A place to visit after an evening at the lake.

The main reason I wanted to try this place for a long time is because f their Darjeeling platter which was enticing beyond belief.¬†This place is located ¬†on Southern Avenue. The greatest plus point this place gets is the decor. It's nothing extravagant but it adds a homely feel to it. And the staff makes your visit a very pleasant one by being actively interested in your experience. The place is decorated with music posters of 70s bands and they also play music accordingly. This is another huge plus ¬†for ¬†music lovers.Coming to the food, ¬†we ordered Darjeeling Platter (Pork), Chicago Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza.Honestly the platter was a little disappointing. The taste was ¬†bland. ¬†I personally did not like the taste of it. But it was a filling dish and worth the money. But they can improve on it.¬†The pizza here are to die for. ¬†Chicago pizza is topped with a lot roasted chicken and sausages and it plays with your taste buds. The pepperoni pizza is what a classic pepperoni pizza should be like, with a lot a of cheese. The pizza here are a class apart if you compare it to places like Dominos or Pizza Hut.¬†Will visit again.

Great music. Good food. Feels like home. 

Looking for these three things in a Cafe? Don't miss out on this place. Had a great evening here. The British hot chocolate, kiwi mojito and chicken wings were truly extraordinary. Back to back pink Floyd songs will make your evening perfect. The place, though small (and gets loud if it's full), is full of a sophistication which you can expect in a cafe in Mumbai or Pune. 

Last but not the least, waiter had an injured wrist/forearm. Thanks for the awesome service regardless of that,and I wish you a speedy recovery.

This amazing little cafe is located a few metres away from Nazrul Mancha. The interiors are very much like a typical feel good cafe ,with posters from the worlds of music and movies , and warm lighting that are shaped like handmade lanterns with pictures on them . The sofa seats are located on the two sides , while the middle area has small tables for two . The staff are very courteous , and the music is just perfect for adda , as you don't have to strain your ears to listen to what the person sitting next to you is saying ! The bacon wrapped pork sausages we ordered tasted heavenly , with soft melt in the mouth pork sausages lying wrapped in fatty dollops of bacon goodness . The brownie shake and Oreo shake tasted awesome , with an extra spoon being served with the brownie shake just so you don't miss  the last few crumbs of brownie inside!!! Overall an amazing place that could make your weekend worth the madness of the rest of your weekdays !

Located exactly beside sarobar stadium.  Lovely ambiance,  friendly and very soft spoken well mannered stuff. We ordered lemon iced tea, masala cold drink, fried chicken wings, chocolate pizza. Everything tasted so good. Had chocolate pizza for first time and we loved it. Prices are also pocket friendly. Nice place to hang out with friends and family.

Would have given a perfect 5 if they had all the food on the menu available. But everything thing they had was quite innovative and interesting. Had the hot buffalo wings, pulled pork loaded French fries,  Spanish hot chocolate and British hot chocolate. Pulled pork loaded French fries was something totally new to me. Filled with cheese and can easily be a favourite to any pork lover! The hot chocolates were my personal favourite. Specially the Spanish one as it was made only with chocolate and not milk. Was eager to try their pasta and pizza but sadly it wasn't available. Hopefully will get it next time. No vat and quite easy on the pocket. Your taste buds will be satisfied :P

Ordered the pulled pork loaded fries and the hog lovers pizza. Absolutely yum. The hospitality really sealed the deal. A place that should be visited (specially if you like pork).

It's right by southern avenue on the road leading up to Menoka cinema hall so we had no trouble in finding it. The first thing which hit us was the decor, pretty innovative i must say.
We ordered a whole lot of things, the ones we really loved was
1. Kiwi Mojito( we had one each at the beginning and the end)
2. Pineapple Mojito
3. Pork Lasagna
4. Chicken Nasi Goreng
We also had the Cilantro Kiev( it was ok) and the bourbon glazed chicken ( which was a bit too salty for my taste)
A pretty good place of you're looking for something a bit different.

This place was on my list for quite some time. And finally it came true with a bang. 
It has a soothing interior with lovely music playing. Hollywood retro decor. Limited space, but I wouldn't complain about it. They serve amazing food. 
We ordered for chicken wings (sweet chilli and barbeque style) , mozarella and tomato pizza, virgin mojito, brownie shake , chicken and cheese burger, pork curry and rice, and HOT CHOCOLATE! 
It's pretty clear that the last one was my favorite.
It is dark chocolate served melted and warm. Sinful in every sip. 
Wings were crisp and tasty. Loved the curry. 
Burger was pretty heavy. 
The portions served are great! 
Coming back soon. 

Also, the owner is an amiable person, helping you out with any problems you have and suggesting the specials.
Great job :D

I wouldn't elaborate much on this review except that, I have been here 4 times in a row and I still wanted to come back again.
They have launched a brand new menu and I'm looking forward to visit there again.
Service is very polite and they attend to each customer in a very courteous manner.
The ambience is of a classic American pop cafe and the lighting ideas are creative on a small scale.
The food, all of the food looks scrumptious, is served in good portions and when you pay the bill you are so happy cuz hey! this wasn't so expensive..
Conclusion: Just go visit the place. '_^@

It's a small place near Southern Avenue. The ambience is lovely with all retro music playing and the walls are also done beautifully. The man who attended us gave us a very warm welcome and the atmosphere is very comfortable. It's all slow and calm and poised out there and gives a soothing effect. The food is was nice and overall I'd say that this place is good to hang out with your friends. Oh btw people, no tax so rush maybe? üë£ üòÇ

It's Nobo Borsho, so I'll give this place the benefit of doubt for the few shortcomings. As I went for the first time, I'm not sure what happens on other days but today there was one person handling most of the service and two people working busily in the kitchen. Given the large crowd they had to handle on a day like this, their efforts were appreciable.

FOOD:
Bourbon glazed BBQ chicken wings: This was very different from the chicken wings I've tried before this. I absolutely loved the flavor. The quantity is good too.  (4.5/5)
Chicken Stroganoff: The flavors were totally on point and this is another must have. (5/5)
Chicken Steak: This was a bit of a disappointment. The chicken was undercooked and some sort of a sauce would have made it taste much better. It felt a tad bit dry. The veggies and the mashed potatoes with it were pretty good. (3/5)
Pork Lasagna: Okay, I'm not the biggest fan of tomatoes so I felt there was too much marinara sauce in the lasagna. The pork was beautifully cooked though. (4/5)

AMBIENCE
Like most other caf√©s, there are many posters from old Hollywood movies, etc. The seating is pretty comfy but the place is a little small. I loved the music. I heard so many tracks from the 60s and 70s that I haven't heard in a while.

SERVICE
Service was suuuuuper slow. It took us forever to get our food and we spent almost an hour and a half between the first dish and the last. However, the person serving us was extremely high on energy and kept smiling through the crazy workload.

All in all, really enjoyed the food. It's pretty affordable too. 5 of us shelled out a 1050 bucks in all.
Do pay this place a visit.

This is a small cafe in southern avenue. Ambience was good. The place has very nice decorations with nice music.  The staffs are very friendly and helpful too as they guide with the order.  We ordered 

‚óº Hot buffalo wings - crispy layered fried chicken tossed in spicy buffalo sauce. If you a spicy food lover then you definitely tried their üî•hot buffalo chicken wings. Just love it üòç
‚óº Manhattan pizza - the taste of pizza really very good.  It's thin crust with nice toppings. 
‚óº British hot chocolate -  it's dark and just pure chocolate.  Just love it and it's lip smacking good .üòã one of the best hot chocolate I have tasted. 
During we tuck in the owner came up and spoke to us personally asking about the food.  That I really liked his gesture towards his customers. Highly recommend it to everyone.

Its nice to see reinvention from time to time. What used to be an Internet Cafe at one point has now been converted into a quaint 20-25 seater restaurant serving up classic food which Kolkata seems to have forgotten! Whether its the menu composition which offers classics like Au-Gratin, Chicken Ala Kiev, and Stroganoff, or the eclectic decor - the highlight of which is the napkin holders made of broken 45 rpm records; it all takes you back in time to the good ol' days of rock music and comfort food. 

Being vegetarian, I sampled the Pasta in Pesto and the traditional Au-gratin. Sometimes its best to try out the most simple stuff to check if the food has stuck to tradition or not, and Macazzo did not disappoint! The pesto sauce was just right without being overbearing and the au-gratin had just the right amount of cheese and veggies, baked to perfection with a golden brown crust and melt-in-your-mouth inside. The portion size is apt for a single meal and one feels dually satisfied after the meal because its filling and it doesn't get wasted as well! The simple flavoured lemon iced tea served in a maison jar was refreshing and perfect (its strange how so many places mess up a simple iced tea). The only minor critique would be for the au-gratin which was just a tad bit salty but not so much as to not be able to eat it altogether.

Pricing of the items is reasonable so as to not scare the potential customers and a hearty vegetarian meal for two with soft beverages will not cost a lot. The minimal staff includes the two partners who run the place as well which gives it a personal touch. Well spoken and articulate, they both instil a lot of confidence in their customers.

Location of the restaurant could not be better. It is smack in the middle of a residential area with nothing around for at least 1km which serves the kind of food they do. 

All in all, I am of the opinion that Macazzo is the best thing which could have happened to Southern Avenue in a long while and I hope it stays the same. I rate it as - Must Eat.

Wanted to try this new place so opted today before our movie üçøüé¨
Nice small cafe corner which is easy to locate in Southern Ave, just few steps ahead from Menoka at the joint of Southern Avenue.
Ambience is something retro style, ceiling lights are designed with Hollywood star's photos, room is very bright due to good lighting decoration. Interior was okay with iron and wooden chairs along with sofas to be comfortable on.

Foods we availed here are as follows üòã
Mango shake (cooler) (‚Çπ90) Which was great in quantity and good in test. Shake liquid was quite thick and we liked it.
Garlic bread (‚Çπ80) Which came with 8 pieces of garlic breads. It tested good and crunchy. 
Chicken nasi goreng (‚Çπ200) It was enough for only 1 person . It tested delicious. I couldn't believe it would be that testy but a bit oily. 
Chocolate pizza üçïüç´ (‚Çπ90) It was okay type! Very thin layer of bread topped with a thin chocolate layer and choco chips type toppings. I found the test quite average.

Service was good, helpful and courteous.

Our bill was of ‚Çπ460
No VAT or Tax! All inclusive üòÄüòÄ

Overall satisfaction ||
Foods : 4/5
Service : 4/5
Ambience : 3.5/5
Hope you find it helpful!

Situated at the lane of southern avenue.. 2 mins distance from menoca cinema hall. Nice decor and ambience with soft music on the background. Behaviour of the staff was very friendly and always smilling. A little suggestion is to keep the spices on the table instead of providing them on asking. Service is a bit slow. Had ordered two spanish hot chocolate (pure chocolate only), one small chicken platter and brownie. Hot chocolate was two good. The platter was also good with 5 sausages cut in half, 6 meat loaf, 5 salami, 2 buttered toast and an poached egg. But it would have been much better with mayonnaise or some sauce. Now the brownie was a huge disaster. I am a brownie lover. But this brownie have made me start hate it. It was extremely bitter in taste with pinch of chocolate sauce. The only thing edible was the ice cream scoop. We had to leave half of the dish. Every other thing is good in a so called new restaurant. Please change the brownie. We will love to come again to taste pizza and burgers but i really want to taste a better brownie. Sawandeep Majhi

Ambiance ¬†was nice, just that it is quite a small place, more of a food joint.
Beverages were also good, ¬†specially the Kiwi mojito.
Behavior of the staff was very friendly and always with a smile under his handlebar moustache. :P

As soon as u enter you some things will stand out.. the vibe of this place is very positive. Then u start to notice the decor- be it the hanging lampshade made with cassettes or photographs of old movies or the napkin stands made from LPs. The music they play is also very nice.. coming to the food we ordere lemon Mojitos where were refreshing the bourbon chicken wings were delicious. For the main course we ordered chicken steak which was prepared differently but was tasty. The only disappointment was the cordon bleu which was like a burger patty the ham inside cut into 2 and then some melted cheese on top. The patty was very dry and I had to leave half the patty. This was the only disappointment hence would like to believe that this is an aberration. Will definitely visit again and hope to increase the rating post my next visit

I had visited this place two months back. Located just beside Menoka cinema hall near rabindra sarobar, this place is ideal for a hangout with friends. 
The food is absolutely fantastic and the prices are extremely pocket-friendly.
The d√©cor will give u a retro feel with all the posters and pictures of artistes and albums used in lampshades, interestingly the napkin holder is made of old record. You can enjoy English songs while having your food and feel cosy in this small but amazing cafe.
We had ordered a lot many items of which I personally liked the kiwi mojito,sweet chilli chicken wings,manhattan pizza,fish finger and chocolate sundae.

Well my best friend brought me here a month back on my birthday . And since then this joint has become my fav hangout.
Ambience- simple but classy decor with enough‚Äã seating arrangements.the music is upbeat and compliments the decor.
Food-
Quality- They provide what they promise. Once you had the taste of their food , you'll definitely go back again. Must tries are darjeeling platter. Chicken wings.oreo shake, buffalo wings.
And plz do try the alabama grilled chicken .its the best in town.
Quantity.- Enough for 2.
Staff- the joint is run by the owners and i have not seen more cordial hosts than them.
What i like most is that the prices mentioned are inclusive of taxes.
And yes, they give u chlormints as complimentary at the time of bill payment.

Loved the overall experience at macazzo. 
I went there recently with my parents after a very tiring day at office and trust me the very first beverage we ordered was so refreshing that it changed our mood completely. It was lemon iced tea and it was fab. We also ordered  a plate of fish finger and we were impressed again as the quality of fish is always an important factor and they have ensured good quality and great taste. 
We also ordered a plate of chicken(sweet chilly) wings and cheesy bacon French fries which again were lip smacking .We also tried the mango shake and it was great too. Overall the service is really nice and the location is quite convenient too. 
So next time you pass by southern avenue do not miss this cool cafe "Macazzo" .
Enjoy guys üòÑ

We stepped into Macazzo today. I have been meaning to visit this place for some time now.  The walls are covered with posters of music legends of the 60s and the lampshades have scenes from old Hollywood movies on them. Even  the napkin holders are shaped like a cds. The effect is simple yet intresting.
     Coming to the food, we started with pulled pork loaded french fries. The dish has ample amount of meat and fries, all topped with a layer of melted cheesy goodness. Next, we had the 6" Tokyo pizza - soft base, chunks of roasted pork, onions, peppers and again, oodles of cheese. It was perfect to satisfy a pizza-lover like me. I was craving for something sweet at the end of the meal, so I ordered a mocha  shake. It was delicious, and came in a big mason jar. We also had blue lagoon, ice-cold and very refreshing. 
        This is one of the places where you can enjoy quality food without burning a hole in your pocket. The pricing on the menu is tax-inclusive right now.
 Another big highlight for me is the location of this place. It's located bang opposite the rabindra sarovar,  which is one of my favourite hang-out spots in the city. If you are like me, who starts feeling guilt-stricken at the end of every well-enjoyed and sumptuous meal, you can choose to assuage it by a brisk walk around the lake like I did. Over-all I have had a wonderful afternoon and I will be definitely coming back to Macazzo.

Good food. Nice ambiance. Great experience.

Situated in the little corner of Southern Avenue, this is a real nice place. The ambiance is great, the interior is beautiful. We met one of the entrepreneur behind it who seems really nice (even suggested a particular milk shake which was nice). We had Pulled Pork loaded French Fries, Extra Large Darjeeling Pork platter, Pork Chop, Pork Nasi Goreng and Bacon Wrapped pork sausage; along with Browny Milkshake, Nawabi Milkshake, Mojito, Blue Lagoon and Fresh lime soda. All of them were nicely prepared and tasted really good. And the price was not high at all. This was a great experience overall. Will definitely go back to this place.

The pictures of their Darjeeling pork platter was the reason of our visit. A small place with a very laid back atmosphere. The decor is very unique and interesting. The hanging lamp shades are made out of old cassette tapes and stills from various movies. The walls have posters of classic sixties rock bands. Rock music plays in the background but in a volume which does not hinder conversation. 

We had ordered Nawabi milk shake, Brownie shake, pulled pork and cheese french fries, pork nasi goreng, pork chops, vegetable pasta with cheese sauce, crispy fish sandwich and the extra large darjeeling pork platter.

The portions are generous and the cooking is excellent. The pork chop was soft and juicy, the pulled pork fries were excellent. The pasta was not overcooked with a well balanced sauce. The crispy fish sandwich  was nice and crisp and the slab of fish was quite generous.  The shakes were nice. We were sceptical about the nawabi shake but it came highly recommended. 

The pork platter lived up to it's name and was enormous. Eight people just wolfed down everything within minutes. 

A good place for some casual food and conversation.

It is a quite rare occasion that I'm so impressed with a restaurant like this. Excellent atmosphere and wonderfully decorated with some of our favourite old school music. The service was very good and the homely vibe they create is quite appreciable. We had Bacon wrapped sausage, pulled pork loaded French fries, darjeeling platter, pork naki goreng and pork chops with beverages of sweet lime soda, blue lagoon, brownie shake and nawabi shake and all were very tasty to say the least. 
Would recommend this place for any age with a love for pork and Music

4/5- Comfort
Located near Lake Stadium in Southern Avenue ,Macazzo is a cafe for both foodies and music lovers. Looking at the decor, it's a paradise for music lovers who love classics and retro .
On entering the cafe, the posters of Jimmy Hendrix and Elvis Presley does not miss your eye. The seating could definitely be more comfortable although the place isn't very cramped up .

Talking about food, they serve both quality and quantity food at very moderate prices. 
Some of our favorite dishes served here are Bourbon Glazed Barbq wings which can be easily shared by 4-5 people and the taste of the soft ,munching chicken makes you want more. Shakes and mint Coolers are served in mason jars which gives out nice vibes. 
The Chicken Cilantro Kiev with Mash which is their unique form of Alakiev .Unique to its taste, this snack is an interesting twist to the traditional chicken recipes.
The Fish and Chips is also hard to miss.
Our favorites would definitely be the Pulled Pork burger and the Pork Lasagna. If you are an ardent pork lover, this is your place. The burger is big and juicy and cheesy and barbq-y.
The quantity is great, so if you are not used to eating a lot, you would need to pack some, maybe.
The restaurant is the perfect place to indulge yourself in good food and nice music.

Next up on our list are the beverages that include Chilli Hot Chocolate and the likes.

Another hidden gem in the lanes of southern avenue is Macazzo.
Was amazed by its retro decors which contains posters of Elvis,Pink Floyd,Beatles...with retro music playing on....though there is scope of improvisation.

Comming to the food we ordered

Nawabi shake-Aaaahhhh!! the first thing to attract was the quantity they ve served in such a low price...simply amazing, the taste was too good...its one of their signature drink... Good innovative drink with the use of sonpapri and rose syrup.

Hot buffalo wings-Consists of 8 pieces with wings and leg pieces...highly recommended to the spice lovers.

Crispy babycorn fritters-We wanted to have mushroom fritters but since they were out of the stock so we ordered this dish..Its babycorn batter fried...personally it was not my kinda dish!!

Mango shake-Perfect ending to the meal...if you want to beat the hit,go for it!

Lastly the service was good,staffs were cordial too...but the most important thing is the menu is inclusive of taxes..so no added taxes on the bill.
Looking forward to spend another lazy afternoon in this place üòä

Couldn't have been a better place to sit and talk and have mojitos.
The best thing about Macazzo is that it's cosy and comfortable. 
Pizzas are the best ones there so as Mojitos.I loved the ambience and the interior ofcourse.
Old classic english music rolling on ,an amazing place to sit and talk.
Its also pocket friendly.
Probably would be better of they start increasing the space inside. Make it a larger place so that more people could come in and enjoy the place.
Also the people over there serving are very polite.
Hence a good rating is worth it.

Located near the Sarobar lake, this place is surely a hidden gem! Serves appetising food at very reasonable price. 
We had kiwi mojito and blue lagoon. Both the beverages were on point. Served in pretty and color coordinated Mason jars!
The garlic bread was loaded with flavor and cheese. The eight piece dish leaves your taste buds wanting for more. The white sauce pasta cooked to perfection. 
The chocolate pizza was perhaps the only dish that didn't make the cut. It was too sugary to enjoy. 
On the whole, it is a place you must visit if you like trying new places.

Browsing through zomato, me and my two friends wanted to try out some new cafe joint. Came across this one situated in southern avenue. Good location. The first impression we had was that the place is small and can't accommodate large groups. But the decor was nice and laid back with good music. The staff was really friendly. We ordered a cappuccino, rose mint iced tea and aam panna for beverages. The cappuccino was good. 3 layered and served with brown sugar. Then we ordered BBQ chicken wings which was good. Tasted a little dry. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was served with chips and my friends ordered a pesto pasta in white sauce. The sauce should have been a little thicker. Overall the taste was good. Quantity was good too. One thing that the management should look into is the cleanliness of the cafe. Spotted spiders. :(

If you are in quest of good food accompanied with some classic soundtracks of early 60s, then THIS is the place for you!!
A luncheon along with the songs from "Sound of Music" was mesmerizing ‚ò∫
Decor wise it's unique and catchy. Each and every corner of this cafe has been utilised with interesting items.
My favourite was it's [cassette lampshade.]
Have never seen something like this before :)
Well food is good too. Basic and tasty!
Chicken soup wasn't rich at all. It was creamy yet not too thick. Liked it.
Also tried out their "Chicken Nasi Goreng". It's an Indonesian platter with chicken and sausages topped with a fried egg.
Nothing special about it though..
Quantity was excellent!
Staff waa cordial and attentive too.
On a whole I LIKED IT. ‚ò∫

A very brighltly decorated cafe located in Southern Avenue. I don't know how they serve such awesome food in this price. The food is mind-blowing with respect to both quality and quantity. We ordered French fries, chicken wings and Darjeeling pork platter. French fries were perfectly fried. I felt the chicken wings could have been a little more flavourful. The Darjeeling platter tasted heavenly. It was like a pork party in my mouth. The food was enough to feed 2 very hungry people. Please please add some more items in the menu.

More than the grub it is the ambience that might make me want to visit this place again. The quite  sorted music and it's laid back ambience works at its best and brings in more people. So if you want to spend some good time with your friends and enjoy an evening with fancy mocktails and sumptuous food..Macazzo is the place to be..

The successor of one of my all time favourites, the joint, macazzo has beaten itself when it comes to the burgers. The pork burger has a bigger patty and their fries have not lost that mouthgasmic touch. Their oreo shake is a must try too. I somehow like their fried chicken burger more than the pork burger. The pork burger would have been absolutely perfect if they'd have added a bit more mayo, because of which I'm not being able to give them that last .5.

Went on recommendation from few foodies . To start with the decor was subtle and totally goes with the name.. But the true essence came when they served the food.. i donot like pizza that much but still we ordered the manhattan pizza since it was recommended and oh boy it was worth it.. the pizza changed my perception .. awesome food.. the person who took the order and served the food was very helpful.. had the chance to have a chat with owner .. loved the place.. probably one of the best cafes that i have visited so far... planning to revisit soon .. 
P.S - the pocket pinch is also very small..

Great place.
Ambience: old Hollywood themed. Calm and soothing place. Their music choice is very good. Comforting.
Food: couldn't be any better. Ordered strawberry shake, masala cold drink, sweet chilli wings, Patiala pizza. I fell in love with the shake and the wings.
Pizza and masala drink was good too.
Service: the staff behavior was great. They're polite and helpful about the menu. Tax is included in the menu.

So overall the experience couldn't be any better.

This small cafe on Southern Avenue has a lot to boast about, from the decor to the food! Visited this place today afternoon for lunch with two friends. We ordered the Darjeeling platter (pork), a 6" Greenwich pizza, fish fingers a blue lagoon, a pineapple mojito and a kiwi mojito alongside. For those who've had the platter at Keventers Darjeeling, and loved it, please give this place a visit and try this platter. It's delicious! The pizza was thin crust and had generous amount of lip smacking toppings. The fish fingers were good as well! Coming to the coolers, the blue lagoon was a bit too sweet but tasted fine. The mojitos were refreshing too! The staff were very courteous and friendly. Would surely visit again! :)

Macazzo is a quaint little cafe in Southern Avenue. Opened only in late 2016, it is a welcome addition to the growing number of cafes in Kolkata. The place is small but doesn't feel congested at all. The decor is a highlight with wooden panels, hanging classic movie lanterns and Floyd and Elvis posters. Food: We ordered a veggie sandwich (with olives, on request) and honey chicken wings, both of which were amazing. The Kiwi mocktail was not up to the mark, though. A bit too concentrated for our taste. All in all, a nice place to hangout. Staff is courteous.

Located just near Menoka Cinema, this is a cute little cafe MACAZZO.
Open the doors and you are greeted by super friendly and cordial hosts.
Despite the place being small,space was efficiently managed and ambience was good.

Me and my friend took blue lagoon,pineapple and kiwi mohito..
Blue lagoon and all others were very refreshing in this pre-summer.The sweet and chilli chicken wings were so so delicious ..just the right balance of hotness and sweetness..we were also given a hot sauce if required.It was fantastic and left an indelible aftertaste..leaving us craving for more.
The French fries were spiced and crispy and were served in a good quantity.

The Manhattan pizza was very sumptuous..since it had been served earlier..the crust at the sides had become a little hard.But damn tasty!And forgot to click the pizza and kiwi and pineapple mohito.
Service was quick.
A Very happy experience and very easy on the pocket too‚ò∫

This is a small,well organised cafe in Southern Avenue.The decorations are quite minimal but it does not fail to create a perfect ambience for spending hours with your friends and loved ones.

The menu offers a wide variety of starters,pizzas,burgers,sandwiches and beverages at an affordable price.

We ordered :

1. Chicago Pizza - This is one of the best pizzas I have had till now.It is literally overloaded with meat and cheese.Highly recommended !!

2. Cilantro Ala Kiev with Mashed Potatoes : This is a unqiue dish where they serve two chicken pieces with bread and mashed potatoes.A real good dish again!

3. Hot chocolate - Well one of the best hot chocolates that I have tasted.But its temperature was a bit high.Still no complaints about its taste üòò

4. Brownie Shake - A good beverage but it could have been better.

The service was good enough.

Will be visiting again for sure ‚ò∫

A ¬†tiny joint tucked into the lanes of Southern Avenue, Macazzo was opened less than a year ago. The decor is retro, with posters of artists like Sinatra, Elvis, Dylan, Beatles and Hendrix, and the playlist boasts of everything retro ranging from Hollywood musicals and Soul to Classic Country and Rock n Roll. Even the napkin holder is designed like a 45 rpm record. All this was enough to lure in a 50s-60s fanatic like me. Little did I know that it was just the beginning of an amazing experience.

Coming now to the food. We started off with drinks : A masala cold drink, a nawabi shake and a cappuccino. While the masala cold drink was lovely and refreshing, the nawabi shake, rich and creamy with a delicious butterscotch flavour, was even better. The cappuccino looked stunning with its layers and was served on a vinyl record coaster with brown sugar on the side, but it tasted average.

We decided to order only pork and went with the darjeeling pork platter, pulled pork burger and pulled pork sandwich. The platter, based on the popular breakfast platter at Keventer's darjeeling contains sausages, ham, pepperoni and bacon along with two sunny-side-up eggs and 4 pieces of buttered toast : a porkaholic's dream on a plate. The quantity too is breathtaking.

What was amazing was that even this wasn't the high point of our meal. It was the first time I tried pulled pork and the first bite was enough to convert me to a pulled pork devotee. The loosely teased strands of perfectly cooked, tender pork, creating enough space to cradle a delicious, flavour-packed sauce, I could have had a whole bowl of it all by itself, it was beyond good. While the burger, served with fries on the side, was great, the bacon actually make it a tad difficult to eat, although we gladly got our fingers dirty and dug in.¬†

The sandwich, served with potato chips on the side, however, was better, and dare I say, one of the best things I've had in Kolkata so far. They use garlic bread which they grill to perfection, the grill marks creating crunchy parts which add a great deal of texture. The filling comprises the same heavenly pulled pork, the richness of which is cut through by the onion and jalapeno. Add to that a generous, creamy helping of cheese, and you create perfection, sheer perfection.

The servers were very polite, and although the service was a bit slow, it meant I had more time to savour their playlist. The value for money is unbelievable, with all the menu prices inclusive of all taxes. ¬†I will be going back time and time again to savour the pulled pork sandwich with some Dean Martin and Elvis Presley in the background. I would have given it 5 out of 5, but, as they say, there is always scope for improvement. Kudos, team Macazzo.

This cafe is another addition to the 'Cafe hub of Kolkata'; Southern Avenue. Macazzo is easy to locate, the ground floor of a house is turned into a cafe. The place is clear and chairs and tables are well maintained. 

Coming to the food, we had Sweet and Chilli Chicken Wings. I asked the person taking the order to make it more hotter than sweeter and they kept that in mind while preparing the dish! That  surely is lovely! ‚ù§ It had 8 pieces and I was happy with both the taste and quantity of this dish. 

For desserts we had Vanilla Ice-cream with Brownie in Chocolate Sauce. It was served with rasins and cashew on top! Delicious! üíô

The people there was friendly and no service taxes! üòä

The cafe is located near Menoka cinema hall and it's quite cosy inside. You'd expect it to be a little bigger than it is but the service offered along with the food is quite good for the price. Unfortunately chicken popcorn is discontinued however the Darjeeling chicken platter is a dish you wouldn't want to miss out on. The chicken wings are also quite good but I hope they bring back the chicken popcorn as it's not available in most cafes in Kolkata. Would also love to have the option of babycorn in the veg section. All in all, the experience was quite good and would love to visit this place again.

Location is very simple. The decor is can be much better, However the walls are decorated with music giants and also the music played is mostly the old hits. So the ambiance is pretty cool. 
Now coming to the service, the tables and seats are clean and the food is quick to come out. Also the people serving are friendly. 
The main factor , FOOD . Lets say the beverages here are made with absolute care and quite tasty. I have never been disappointed with anything i ordered. However the brownie shake is recommended for the chocolate lovers. 
The pizzas are big and yummy but not as cheesy and soft as one would hope it to be. I recommend the fried chicken wings. Great dish to order and enjoy a good chat with friends. Quantity also gets a thumbs up. 
I also have to mention its been more than 2 times i have been here in only a month so i guess that says a lot. 
What was missing? More food option. Specially appetisers.  
Otherwise a great cafe to enjoy a nice afternoon.  üëçüèº

Food: Okayish.Their Darjeeling Platter was a bit too greasy, unlike what you originally get at Keventer's or Glenary's. Sausages were really bad. Bacon pretty savory. Pineapple Mojito: really good.


Service: Had to ask for salt, pepper, mustard and ketchup separately. Otherwise, the waiters were the non-interfering kind, they way I like them.

Ambience: Awesome decor.Classy background music. Also, it was totally empty except for us, which I liked.

A new place started recently bank opposite lake near Menoka cinema. I was on a holiday at Calcutta and usually who has the time to go to a restaurant with all the street food around!!! But this was a welcome break from all the chaats around, although I had very few dishes to actually review it.
We had a 12 inch veggie pizza which looked and tasty yummy. I also had a mocchiato which was excellent. A special mention for the hot chocolate here which is a speciality here, it's dark and it's just pure chocolate indulgence. A suggestion for the hot chocolate would be to have an option of making it less sweet as I would have preferred a bitter version. 
Also the decor of the place is very contemporary and tastefully done. The staff is very amicable.

Macazzo boasts of a really cool decor with the Dylan and the Rat Pack posters stealing the show. Add to that a good playlist and the expectations rise naturally. But where this place really knocks it out of the park is the food : some of the best pork I've had in a long, long time.
¬†
The large pork platter mimicking the one they serve at Keventers is aptly huge. And damn tasty! Sausages, ham, salami and bacon, served with 4 pcs of buttered toast and a couple of fried eggs, for only 700 bucks, is a steal. The platter is big enough for at least 3 people unless you have a giant at your midst. Must, must try.¬†

Next up was the pulled pork sandwich with onions and jalapenos. Two words : pork heaven. A culinary experience of the highest order, the pulled pork is just perfect. We were so impressed that we ordered a pulled pork burger with bacon as well, and needless to say the burger was great too. The only reason I'd recommend the sandwich over the burger (and that is only if you can't order both) is because the bread in the sandwich is beautiful and along with jalapenos and onion the filling tastes even better.¬†

The masala coke, the nawabi shake ( a pista, butterscotch drink) and the cappuccino were all good and helped us wash down the gargantuan amount of pork we were devouring.¬†¬†

As they say, come for the pork platter, stay for the pulled pork. A full 5 this place.

It excels where it matters the most... Food with an expert touch ! 
Decor is crafty and neat and cool. I know the owner as i was regular to his previous joint named 'The Joint' ;) .. Anyway the blockbuster items previously has been carried forward to the Macazzo like the Grilled chicken wings, bbq sandwiches, pizzas. Pizza like the Hog Lover and Chicago are to die for. 

At this time of review they didnt have their pasta but will soon introduce in macazzo ones it was there @joint. The spaghetti carbonara is my all time fav and one to kill others who would try to sneak a morsel out of your carbonara :p 

Anyway.. Definite visit. Your tastebud is going to be pampered. The owner as we fondly call him Bitan da.. Himself most of the times attends the customers and maintains a very warm reception when u would be eating out at his place. Happy snacking ! ;)

i spotted this place tucked nicely in one of the corners of southern avenue while i visit VP during my weekly corporate matches.... and have been planning to visit since then... its new but when i checked zomato,  they have notched up a good score and i had a make it to the place the next date out wit my wife which is rare these days owing to both our daily schedules.... so finally when we managed some time on valentines day for lunch,  we gave no other thought but to visit Macazzo... i wonder how the name was born and what it means but upon entering,  its a clean,  tidy,  small place which is exactly the way we like.... quaint is the word for it.... touch of creativity in the decor.... simple yet tells a story all around as you roll your eyes... from the hanging lights to the napkin holders in the table,  they are all done with a twist.... not an extensive menu but pretty much everything is touched upon... we were not in an experimental mood and ordered for the sweet and hot wings and ala kiev.... i was fascinated to see that they serve 8 wings for 180 while the standard all around is generally 6....it took time,  around 20-25 mins for the wings to arrive but it was absolutely worth the wait.... the wings well cooked,  drenched in sauce and yet very crispy due to the flour coating.... came in a basket wrapped in silver foil.... and it was a never ending meal for both of us but we loved every bite of it..... once we were done,  we were served it the cilantro ala kiev.... cilantro which is basically coriander is probably added to the chicken which was nicely arranged cutting it into 2 pockets and tucked inside mashed potato and two garlic breads.... a small friendly suggestion to the owner here... the overall food had too much butter,  the garlic bread.  the chicken and the mash... i know that ala kiev is stuffed with parsley butter but still the overall had a lottt of it... the crust of the chicken too was over cooked... mentioned that to the owner who humbly accepted and the feedback as mentioned by him was to be passed on inside the food lab... overall a very pleasant experience.... the usp of this place ought to be the combination of rates and ambience and size of the place which is perfect for dinner dates.... nothing flashy yet classy.... the staff overall was pretty attentive and courteous.... i saw how they handled a scenario where a couple wouldnt let go of a 4 seater upon insistence by the servers and they managed it with a smile.... the challenge for this outlet and for any other restaurant at this age would be how they stay ahead of the competition and how to continue to win back loyal customers.... there are tons of similar restaurants in that stretch and innovation and great customer experience will have to be the pinnacle for success.... i wish them all the best and great success in future...

Visited this place a few weeks ago with my friend and her mother. A cafe with nice ambience and courteous staff. 
We ordered the Darjeeling platter (small), fried chicken burger, Chicago pizza, chocolate sundae and brownie with vanilla ice cream. The food was great. I have no complains, neither with the quantity nor quality of food. Just that the Brownie could have been softer. I mentioned that to the person there. They were poliete enough to explain us the reason and assure us softer brownie next time.
The prices are quite reasonable and the rates mentioned are inclusive of tax which is even better.
I am very happy with my experience at Macazzo.

Located just near Menoka cinema hall, is a great start to go with. The decor n ambience is pretty good with the Hollywood music composers on frame like Beatles n others. Coming to food, we ordered the following:

#cappuccino- layered with milk n black coffee n the froth on top with sprinkled coffee powder...they serve brown sugar n as u stir the entire thing u can see the layers combine...a great coffee deserves a 5star!

#fried chicken wings- crispy layered fried chicken with 8 pieces served, 4 wings n 4 leg pieces...crunchy n munchy with sprinkled masala which is delicious! 

Service is excellent, the waiters r very humble...had a great time n wish to visit once again....

Located at southern avenue. This place falls under my 'must visit' categories. The interior decoration is nice, the slow music does the trick to uplift your mood. When we went there the place was relatively empty so our orders were served fast. We ordered hot chocolate, masala french fries, hot latte, then in main course we had tandoori chicken pizza and finally for the dessert we had brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Every single food item was made with perfection. The price is reasonable.

Starting with the ambience, it was quite cozy. It's a small restaurant but extremely well maintained and the d√©cor is pretty cool. The d√©cor mainly consists of movie and band posters, a few tree-bark textured wooden panels and nice comfortable chairs and sofas along with coasters which look like mini records. Music is constantly being played in the background. Overall, definitely would rate d√©cor 4.5/5.

Moving onto service, it was prompt, efficient and extremely warm and friendly. The two men there were absolutely great and really friendly. We went yesterday around 5-5.30pm and there was no one apart from us. Hence, I haven't experienced service when the restaurant is full. Hopefully I'll get to experience that the next time I go and thus will be able to give you guys a better idea. Overall, service gets a 4.5/5.

Finally, lets talk about the food. Let me assure you, whether you are inclined more towards quality or quantity, you won't be disappointed by either. We had the following items - Big Darjeeling Platter, 12" Chicago Pizza, Chicken and Mayo Sandwich, Brownie Shake, Peach Iced Tea and Hot Chocolate. The platter had 20 odd cocktail sausages, lots of small meatloafs, lots of ham, 2 fried eggs and 4 pieces of buttered toast. Every item was delicious! The pizza was great. It was somewhere in between the Domino's Medium and Large Pizza in terms of size but it probably had more topping and cheese than a Large Pizza. It was lip-smackingly good. The sandwich was cut into two halves (and thank God for that; it was huge) and had some lays to go with it. 1 sandwich could be a meal in itself, depending on the appetite of the person. All the drinks were great. Overall, a 5/5 for the food.

Finally, as far as price is concerned, I think the items are decently priced, especially considering the quantity of food they serve. Also, the price that you see on the menu is what you pay. No taxes or other charges. Thus, value for money would get a 5/5 from my side.

Overall, it's a must visit. It is easy to locate. Great food. Great service. Good ambience. Well priced. A foodies dream. Make sure you check it out asap!

Was in desperate need of a caf√© like this nearby to sit and discuss an assignment with a friend. Came across this cute, little cafe located in the lake area of southern avenue. Good decor,comfortable seating and very hospitable staff. The walls are perfectly decorated with posters of numerous bands. Big posters of Elvis Presley, Dean martin playing golf on the other side. Casettes being wonderfully used to create the lamp shades.
They play some good music too. Jailhouse rock being their favourite i guess ;) they played it almost 3-4 times while i was there. 
Food that i tasted was the classic sweet chilly chicken wings. Quantity was good. I expected the wings to be a little hotter maybe to do justice to the name. But was perfectly crispy and tasted good by itself.
The kiwi mojito was really nice. I loved it. Very refreshing.
The prices are really pocket friendly. No extra tax added. The staff are very responsive and friendly.
Would love to visit again and try something more.

This is my new favourite spot.
Absolutely in love with tbis cute little cosy caf√©,located in southern avenue near menoka cinema.
This place can be located quite easily.
The behavior of the staff is on point.
The guy out there who serves the food is one of the best I have come across in any caf√© or restaurant.
He made sure to politely enquire us whether we liked the items we ordered and if they were properly made or not.

The decor of the caf√© is another thing to look out for.
It's quite innovative with pink floyd,beatles and elvis presley posters among others.

The lamps were quite different with old hollywood movie stills on them.
There were lamps made out of old cassettes,which is very cool.

The music they play,mainly rock n roll and country pop is nice.

Coming to the food.
We had ordered for manhattan pizza and pulled pork burger with bacon which also comes with fries.
And for dessert we had brownie with vanilla icecream with chocolate sause.

All the items are highly recommended,mainly the burger.
It's the BEST burger I have ever had!

The potions are enough for two people and the highlight of this cafe?
They do not charge any extra tax as yet ;)

Overall a great experience,would love to go back,especially for their burger.
They are ones to die for üòç

A cute cozy beautiful caf√© at southern avenue. The ambience is superb. The staffs are great and food is good. The price is reasonable too. Ordered 
1. Kiwi mojito- came in big mason jar. Tasty and refreshing.
2. Sweet chicken wings
3. Chili cheese toast
4. Masala French fries
5. Hot chocolate
6. Fungi (it was a pizza with sweet corns, mushrooms, black olives)
 Everything was very light and tasty. And it's a great place for hangouts .

Read all good stuffs about the place so wat all happened there was not to my surprise. I knew all was going to be great there. Ranging from pizza to sandwich, burger and starters you can treat urself without a hole in the pocket. Coolers are no less. Blue lagoon jar@50 that too in 2017

This is my latest find and I more than love this cute little caf√©!
I loved it so much that within a span of two days I've been here twice.

This is located at the mouth of the lane which houses Menoka cinema hall. Really easy to locate.

Now coming to the place, I absolutely adore the d√©cor. It exudes a very rock and roll vibe with posters of Pink Floyd, Elvis Presley and so on. Love the jazzy feel. The seating arrangement is equally comfortable! It has provisions for both chairs and couches.

Directly coming to the food now.

‚àÜ First visit ‚àÜ

‚Ä¢ Lemon Iced tea - perfect!
‚Ä¢ Cappuccino - this was heavenly. Moreover the presentation killed it.
‚Ä¢ Virgin mojito - perfect yet again.
‚Ä¢ French fries - the quantity is overwhelming, that too, only at 60 bucks.
‚Ä¢ Manhattan pizza - this was the winner of the evening. Immensely yummy, and was loaded with chunks of chicken. 4 slices made up one pizza. Strongly recommended.

Bill - 450

‚àÜ Second visit ‚àÜ

‚Ä¢ Blue lagoon - tasted brilliant! Recommended.
‚Ä¢ Mocha shake - iced coffee minus the ice-cream. Recommended, if you're a caffeine lover.
‚Ä¢ French fries - immense quantity as usual.
‚Ä¢ Crispy fried chicken wings - 8 pieces in a plate. Really filling. Crispy and crunchy chicken fills up your stomach absolutely.
‚Ä¢ Brooklyn pizza - another variety of the Manhattan pizza. This time is was topped with corn, mushrooms and chicken sausages. Tasted good too, but not as good as Manhattan. Still worth a try.

Bill - 570. It is very reasonable. The portions are more than good, and the prices won't make a hole in your pocket! This is good stuff!

The place is warm and the service is swift! The guy who'll serve you is helpful and will always greet you with a smile. This caf√© is definitely going to live up to our cafe standards, and is here to stay! All my love to team Macazzo.

It's a very cute cafe. I was amazed to see how beautifully they decorated such a small place. Coming to food, frankly speaking I was not expecting much after seeing the prices as you know there is an unsaid myth that expensive stuff is always better, but trust me they have definitely busted the myth...Food is amazing that it made me visit this place twice. I've shared the pictures of what we had ordered.
We had Manhattan pizza , iced tea, cappuccino, mojioto and French fries. On our second visit, we had ordered Brooklyn pizza, chicken wings, blue lagoon and mocha shake.
Thank you.

The entire experience was awesome, long wishlisted Macazzo and some good recommendations from fellow reviewers dragged us here couple of days back. A small square place , simple and neatly decorated , great music , warm service and quality food , i could not find any major flaw to restrict myself to a lower rating. Mr saikat , the gentleman in charge is very courteous and takes care of the guests with tons of politeness.

We ordered :

SWEET CHILLI WINGS - not even close to what we call chili but 7-8 crispy wings in a sweet sauce , i liked it a lot . But if doing justice to the name is considered, one would rather expect it to be hotter .

MOJITO was my friend's drink , okayish , could have been better with some more fizz.

MANHATTEN PIZZA topped with loads of chicken and corn , one of the juiciest pizzas i had , the base was freshly made as the owner explained their kitchen procedure and baked to perfection. One small size was enough for two. Recommended.

HOT CHOCOLATE was my ultimate bliss . You need to try this.

The minor faults can be worked on and I am really looking forward to try more from here , with an expectation of not changing my rating for them , keep up the good work , my best wishes to team Macazzo.

We decided to try this musical theme based new cafe on new year's eve which is located near menoka cinema just beside medinova.
A small cafe with musical posters and nice lamp sheds hanging with a sitting arrangement of 20 people and i liked the ambience. What i absolutely loved about this place is the good behaviour of the staff and probably the owner.

Now the food, we ordered 2 hot chocolate and a pizza. I absolutely loved the hot chocolate and i can go on writing about it, it is thick, semi sweet melted chocolate and it is as good as Mrs. magpie if not better. Though i found some real small chocolate chunks at the end of the drink, i would have preferred all melted.

The pizza was good, thin crusted, a bit crispy at the ends. Not overly cheesy. Just the right amount of cheese, pizza sauce and toppings.

I m surely going there a lot. :D i just hope they don't drop the quality over years. Absolutely recommended. :)

We spent a beautiful new year eve in this beautiful musical theme based cafe. I just loved the ambience and very much appreciate the hospitality that we received. The location is also easy to find, just walk straight down the road from Menoka to southern avenue.

Well, coming to the food we ordered "Mochaccino", "Masala French Fries", "Crispy Veg and Cheese Burger" and "Chicken & Mayo". The food was good.. I really loved the burger and the French fries was also up-to the mark. The only thing that disappointed me was the coffee.. I'm too fond of coffees and have tasted "Mochaccino" from many places around the city but this one was bit different, expected something better than this. Apart from the coffee every other food was too good to handle. And I will definitely recommend this to everyone.

I was looking for a cafe type joint to sit and chill out after a movie, and I some how expected this place to be a bit more spacious, from the given pictures. We walked a long path searching the address and finally reached our destination. But I was very dissapointed with the setting. Its a small room with few chairs and tables. No windows. Somehow, may be according to my expectations at that moment, I felt that the pictures given here are quite misleading. I didn't order anything and left the place.

Now coming to food..well that's actually yummilicious..not tried much from their menu but wat ever we ordered was just too tasty nd especially the pizza was so damn tasty nd the topping was cheesy nd the chicken on it was soft nd juicy..!

The mayo nd chicken sandwich was too damn cheesy nd tasty..infct the brownie shake was also awesome nd lemon iced tea deserves a special mention..it was too damn tasty..
Price of each nd every item here is reasonable..definitely want to visit here soon to try the other items here as I truly believe that each nd every item will indeed be worth trying..!

My new favourite spot this shall be.
And shall be an awesome way to spend the Christmas evening there.
Located close to Menoka cinema at Southern Avenue.
Ambience is great. A wall with canvas of Elvis Presley, The Beatles. The lampshades hanging from the ceiling with the posters of James Bond and many other movie scenarios. Que sera sera being played in the background. Such an amazing feel.
We were so warmly welcomed by the staff there. This person who sits at the counter and personally attends to everyone, he has a very nice way of conversing with people. And isn't that how you should be treating your guests?

For the food, as per the suggestion from Karishma Sharma (asoulfoodstory.com) we did try out the hot chocolate. That was simply great. Dark chocolate melted in a cup, served hot. Just the way you'd prefer a drink in the cold weather. I wouldn't mind opting for this over the Magpie one which initially was my favourite.
Also, we had french fries. A basket full of these with dip. That to for Rs. 60 only.
Price: couldn't be better. Very reasonable. Taxes inclusive billed us of Rs. 260.
Even two dishes were enough to rate them a 4.5
Coming back for more of their items.

Macazzo-a new cafe which has opened near Menoka Cinema, just go straight from Menoka towards Southern Avenue. The ambiance is pretty nice, and there are different posters on the wall. Had ordered a Chicken A la Kiev, two pizzas and Chicken wings! Loved the chicken a la Kiev, it was well made and filled with butter. The chicken wings were good too. However they used too much sauce in the pizzas. Decent place. Cheap prices. The service is pretty good. Oh and also free Wi-fi! :)

A small cafe on southern avenue, Macazzo was on my wish list ever since it opened doors back in September. Location is southern avenue, straight from Menoka towards the lake towers ( next to medinova).
On entering the cafe I found it be simply but neatly done. Metal chairs, wooden tables, wooden installation wall, lights hanging with musician photos, the place is cute and cosy!

The menu is small with few drink and food options.
I went for the following-

‚Ä¢ Veg and cheese burger served with fries. The burger was delicious! The patty was made well and it had a small coleslaw layer inside with a herb dressing and cheese! The fries were seasoned well! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Hot chocolate was something which seemed perfect for a lazy winter afternoon! It came in a cute glass and well it was divine! Trust me it was at par with Mrs Magpie! Smooth, chocolatey and warm! It made me feel extremely content and happy! #definitelyrecommended Moreover the drink came with a cute record coaster in sync with their cafe theme!
‚Ä¢ Cold drink was also ordered

The menu has limited food options but I don't mind if they are going to serve such good food!
Prices are reasonable!

Overall, a pretty good experience!

The first thing which I would like to mention about this cafe is their great hospitality towards the customers. We were welcomed with a jovial smile and was asked to choose a seat as per our comfort. This cafe is situated in the lane of menoka cinema hall (just a few minutes walk from there). To be more precise, this is located just beside Medinova. We went there at around 2:30ish and the cafe was almost vacant. The ambiance of this cafe is quite classy and perfect for catching up with an old friend. The coziness adds warmth to the winter-evening-convo-sessions. Coming to food we had ordered kiwi mojito along with hawaiian pizza. Both of them were really good. The pizza was made perfectly. Prices are at par with the quality and quantity maintained. A must visit cafe for all the students. Had a wonderful experience.

Great food at reasonable Price. ¬†Conveniently located at Southern Aveneue, near to Menoka Cinema Hall, beside ICICI atm, this new cafe rightly deserves a thumbs up!

A small room where few tables are placed utilizing the space in the optimum way. Walls and ceilings are decorated thoughtfully.

We ordered :

1. Lemon Tea : It was refreshing and thin bodied.¬†

2. Sweet Chilli Wings : Hot, Crispy chicken wings flavored with honey. Awesome preparation. Recommended!

3. Manhattan Pizza : Another great preparation. Thin crust with adequate toppings. The pizza was delicious. Loved it! Recommended!

Portion : Good enough for 2.

Price : Reasonable. They do not charge taxes till now.

Service : Great.
Recommended! Go have some good food!

The variety on the menu is great and pleasing especially for meat lovers. The Pizzas are amazing. The sauce and cheese perfectly meld with each other. The crust wasn't disappointing. The ambiance of this place is one of the best compared to all the other places I've been, especially for pop culture lovers!
Do give this place a visit!

Located a stone's throw away from the Menoka cinema hall in front of Rabindra Sarobar Lake, this cafe kind of takes you back an era filled with nostalgia of the good 'ol days of yore!

Tastefully decorated, the ambience engulfs you into its folds of an era when the rock n roll music and Hollywood classics ruled the roost. The cafe has amazing posters of music albums, singers, and movie artists of the Golden Oldies on the walls, with the lightshades of movie stills and the paper napkin holders made with half-LP records.

The owners were close to my friend who had accompanied me to the joint, and suggested we try their some of their specialities - the Bacon wrapped sausages & Manhattan Pizza. The pizza was extremely good as well as the sausages, though I would've liked the bacon wrapping to be bit longer so that they cover the sausages fully.¬†

Overall, a decent outlet with good pricing and excellent food. Definitely would drop in again...

Was there for a comedy open mic. And first time I ended up ordering food. The pork burger with bacon was real good. Somebody recommended sausages too. The owners are really friendly people.

Visited macazzo with friends last week. The place automatically transports you to a quaint little cafe in good old Darjeeling with its ambience and menu choices . Smell of fried pork in the air and warm hues of wooden furniture leave you lusting for everything quintessentially Darjeeling. The walls are decorated with Pictures of all the old greats including The King and the Beatles and a small poster of Tom cruise in top gun added for good measure. We slurped on the mohito and pigged away on the pork pizzas and burgers which had humongous helpings of pork meat. If anything the chef and owners are all heart !!! Left with our bellies full and contentment in our hearts. Have plans to visit the place soon for another slice of Darjeeling via their pork and chicken platters route ...

Macazzo is a quiet and cozy restaurant tastefully decorated with Old world American memorabilia and very bright. You feel like settling down comfortably while browsing thru the menu and querying chef on his recommendations. We were a family of 4 and ordered Darjeeling Platter (both Chicken and Pork), Fish and Chips and Grilled Chicken and watering it with Oreo Shakes. ¬†Must say that with each plate raised our expectations and yes Grilled Chicken and and both the Darjeeling Platters trumped our expectations. I would strongly recommend both these dishes and discuss food with the Owners while digging at the plates. Children will love the Oreo Shakes. Looking forward to the Pizzas..

It's a newly opened cafe tucked in a corner at the crossing of southern ave and lake terrace.The owners are the same as that of the  'The Joint' that used to be in santoshpur.Well decorated with posters of Elvis,pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin etc and pretty lights.Kinda takes you back to that era.Amazing playlist. 

Now coming to the food,we had ordered the mojito,blue lagoon, bacon wrapped sausages,chicken wings and pulled pork sandwiches.The wings were delicious with a crisp coating.The sausages were soft,succulent and extremely juicy.The pulled pork sandwich was good but I kinda wished that it had more pork filling in it.But as we were pretty full coz of the appetizers,we did not mind the filling.The drinks were refreshing.

Nice experience.Good food.Cheap prices.No vat.Definitely coming back again.

"Appetizing food at affordable prices" should be the tagline of Macazzo. We visited this beautiful "joint" on Saptami afternoon. The decor is so wonderful that we took a whole bunch of snaps and also they play wonderful tracks. Now coming to the food, we had Brooklyn Pizza and Brownie Shake. The brownie shake tasted great and the quantity was greater. And the pizza is the best as always since no one makes pizza as good as Mr. Mukherjee does. So kudos for that! Really looking forward to try the other items.

Macazzo is one of the latest entrants in Southern Avenue just beside Medinova and has created a great buzz already. It is a quaint coffee shop and food joint with a vintage decor.The ambience is pretty calm and the service is warm and ¬†friendly . Coming to the food .This place offers a wide variety of continental food and non alcoholic beverages.I ordered Fried Chicken Burger with Cappuccino.The quality and taste is simply commendable and the prices are pocket friendly considering the quality and quantity.
 Try once if you haven't tried it all.

So, as we were browsing through the lanes of Southern Avenue to grab a bite at around 9 30 of saptami night we came across this tiny but well organised cafe that still had a lot of seats . Since , we were not in the mood of anything particular we decide to try it out and it was a very pleasant experience . Macazzo is a very new initiative from a guy who seems to bring nothing new to the plate but everything cooked with a lot of heart.  Yes, it is the same burger , sandwiches , fries and pizza but once again this joint aims to specialize in those items and bring something pleasant to the plates . 

¬∞ Location :- Located right at the junction of sarat bose road nd southern avenue . If you are coming from menoka cinema you have to take the left turn towards sarat bose road and you will see the cafe at the junction .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 3 / 5 ) :- Not such an impressive decor to boast but still it's an okay for a small group to spend some time while eating out . The service was not the fastest one but still we considered as it was puja and they were short of personel.

--------------------------
FOOD :- It is not the rarest to find an American styled cafe today across any lane of the city . So, the idea is to be better than the others but at the same time be competitive at the pricing since none of them is cheap.  We found the prices to be a tad cheaper but not that much . As for he quality , we ordered :- 

1. Sweet chilli wings (3.5 / 5 ) :- Awesome quantity , 8 moderate sized wings were served covered in sweet tangy sauce . But , once the upper crust is gone there's not much flavor in the inside , although the meat was tender . Other than that part it was a good dish and can be tried .

2. Fried pork burger ( 4 / 5 ) :- Okay , so what they offered was a big burger with a handsome bread and a huge patty with a little bit of mayo brushed on it . There wasn't any lettuce or veggies inside ,just the patty and the bread accompanied with fries . Once you do that your patty really has to be good and so it was . It was delicious  and went well with the bread .very much recommended .

3. Fried fish burger ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Okay , so we don't have a lot of fish burgers in the city so I grabbed the opportunity to try it out . Once again there was only the patty and the bread accompanied with French fries . To be very honest I don't think the fish patty goes well with the bread becayse only a meat based on meat can overpower the flavor the bread and create a burger type effect . But on the other hand the fish patty was really huge and tasty when you eat standalone . The fish was fresh and I loved it when I ate the patty aside . Still you can try it .

---------------------

¬∞ Verdict :- Yes it is recommended. We missed the opportunity to have the pizza which we will in our next visit . People moving around that region especially after catching a show at menoka can grab a quick bite here. You will not be dissapointed .

Following are the main points :- 

1. Close to menoka .
2. Decent burgers .

All the best to the new team for their efforts and hope you shine more in the coming days and expecting it to be one of the good ones .

A newly opened cozy cafe at the junction of Sarat Chatterjee avenue and Southern Avenue, beside the icici bank ATM. Though small, the place is very nicely decorated. Coming to the food, they offer easy American, continental food as well non-alcoholic beverages. We ordered ham pull sandwich, fish and chips and mushroom veggie sandwich. I must complement the owner for some really delicious food. All the dishes were very good. Special mention of the fish and chips. A good hearty portion. Slight pinch on the pocket, the place gives serious competition to the coffee days of the world. Will visit again.

Macazzo is a rookie with gamut of potential to make it big. Located very near to Menoka Cinema Hall at Southern Avenue, this food joint offers a nice, cozy ambience with classy decor. All the items we tried over there were class apart. The mojito was very good. Special mention to be made about Hog Lovers Pizza. It was damn tasty with thin crust. The warm welcome of the patrons out there was something to cherish upon . The pocket pinch is minimal compared to the food quality and quantity. Overall a joyous first time experience at Macazzo. Hope to get back there soon......

Located just beside Medinova in Southern Avenue, this place serves one of the best thin crust pizzas i ever had. Ambience is good. We ordered Pineapple Mojito, Strawberry Shake, Pulled Pork Sandwich with Bacon and Hog Lover's Pizza. The Mojito was refreshing but personally i liked the strawberry shake more. The sandwich was grilled to perfection. The show stealer of the day was the Hog Lover's Pizza. I am definitely going back to this place for the pizza itself.
The place is highly recommended. More so, as they will be introducing the Darjeeling Pork Platter(same as Keventer's Darjeeling ) after the Puja. 
Good luck to the team.

Have visited it...a lovely ambience...the interior design is fantastic. The food is marvellous...lip-smacking. One will be spoilt for choice as there are plenty of food items to choose from. Had an awesome Barbecue Chicken, Bacon, Fried Eggs and Cheese Sandwich. Will surely visit again.

I had visited this place twice. 
First experience was really good, we had ordered pizza along with oreoshake n all.
But my second experience was utterly horrible. 
We had chicken wings which was quite normal and not upto mark ! And I was really upset to find those similar chicken wings inside the burger. And I had even ordered the brownie shake which was vexatious as they had put some kind of fruit instead of brownie.
