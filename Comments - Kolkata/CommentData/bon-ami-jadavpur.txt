First let me apologize for taking so freaking long to review this. I have been frequenting this place for over 6 years and am proud to say that this hasn't changed. The quality is still the same. To find this hidden gem, from 8B bus stand walk towards the Telephone Exchange (a 2mins walk). On the right side you will see Divine Polyclinic, below that is the hidden gem. So lemme come straight to the point. 
I ordered the following :

Chicken Gravy Chowmin - 1 of the best gravy chowmin I have tasted in a long time. Mind you the low price. This in itself is a wholesome dish coupled by the generous helping of chicken. 

Fish Fry - Now this is a very common and super popular dish, but equally easy to get wrong. But, Bonami hits it out of the park. The thin outer layer (crust) with a thick slab of fish marinated with a paste of coriander and stuff. This is delicious. 

Veg Chowmin - This is was a good dish, but I have had better. Was a bit average and should have had a bit more veggies. 

Final verdict, do visit this place if you are in Jadavpur. One of the best Chinese in town at cheap rate. Pro tip: do call and order in advance to avoid long waiting time and the dreaded voice "shesh hoy geche".

One of the best my favourite restaurant......very good in chinese foods.....very much pocket friendly you can hardly find a restaurant like these in whole city surely....very few can compare with this restaurant in the quantity with quality along pricing. Easily you can have a good stomach packed meal here within 120 rupees each person....only drawback is there is no sitting arrangement..only take away.

About 10 mins walk from my place , this place is a gem  . Having tasted Chinese cuisine from nearly all the restaurants in Jadavpur , I can safely say that this place is THE BEST !!! Some must try dishes include their Spring fried chicken , thai chicken , Chilly chicken , Mixed Noodles and fried rice , fish fry and their momos. I would recommend everyone who visits Jadavpur to give this place a try . You won't be disappointed.

Location-On the Tollygunge auto route,walk from 8b towards Tollygunge,locate the shop at your right hand side just before kasturi.
This place is quite a hidden gem.At first the look of the shop won't be convincing enough for new people who will be visiting,but trust me and give it a try.
Some of the preparations can give competition to many popular restaurants at Jadavpur.
The Pan Fried Momo is really awesome.
Same about the Crispy Chicken.Huge quality compared to the price and it tastes great.These two are must try starters.
Chilly Chicken and schezwan chicken preparations are also good.
Chowmins are huge in quantity.
Overall a great place for take away and absolute value for money.Specially for students.

Have to say, I was a bit apprehensive when my friend suggested this place to order food! But after gulping down the food without sharing with anyone, have to say 'pretty impressed'! Absolute value for money! Pack it and take it home! You will love it!

The pan fried momo and some chicken preparations are far better than any popular chinese restaurants. The taste justifies the price. If you want to taste good Chinese cuisine at a local rate go to this outlet without any hesitation.

I never knew that our good old Moni Da'r canteen was featured here on Zomato. It's a real pleasure for me. I love the white pasta, chicken fried rice and chilli chicken over here. And yes, you have to try the momos too!

The official name of this place may be Bon-Ami but for us, JU students it has always been good ol' Moni Da's canteen.
Have eaten here innumerable times. The exhaustive menu is quite appreciated by the plethora of students with different tastes, and by now the staff knows which students can effortlessly polish off a plate of hot schzewan noodles and who are the ones who survive on the white pasta with melted cheese and fresh basil.

My personal favourite, since my first day in college has been the white pasta and it is most likely that this is what I will order even if I come back here after decades. Another personal favourite is the Chicken Thai noodles. The flavours are really different.
The chinese side dishes come in an array of sauces like chilly, garlic, manchurian, schzewan, lemon etc. with 8 pieces of boneless chicken. Vegetarians, as well as non-vegetarians tired of the age-old chicken side dishes, can try the mushroom or sweet corn variants in the same sauces.

P.S.- This place will always remain special to me for another reason. It's here that I met a 'special someone' for the first time :)
