Ordered a couple of times through swiggy last week when i was in rajarhat. 
The biryani ( mutton ), rara meat, mutton kasha ( though its not really kasha ) are all well cooked - tasty and enjoyable. 
The egg dal tarka was average. 
Nawabi murg tikka was ok. 
Paneer tikka butter masala was also ok to good.
The masala kulcha and laccha paratha were good. The naans - cheese, garlic and butter - left much to be desired - rather poor quality.
Rumali roti was also fine. 
So i would avoid naans here - other items are mostly reasonably nice - really like the biryani.

Awesome food. I ordered Chicken Korma, Garlic Naan and Cheese Naan using Swiggy. The delivery was super fast may be because of the shorter distance.

For the first time my son loved a main course and enjoyed at most. We liked the garlic naan a lot. Cheese naan was OK but nothing extraordinary. Naan were quite lite and one can have 2 with standard appetite. I'm impressed. :)

What to expect : great food, quick service, good menu range. 
What you may miss: ambiance 

A very small place that can hardly accommodate 4 groups.  Ac works fine but decor and everything else is just fine. But the food is very pleasant. Kebabs are actually mouth watering. Try all of them safely. Chicken bharta, chicken tikka masala and kadhai chicken are safe bets although I can sense their preparation will be good for all dishes. Lacha paratha was my favourite. It was not overly oily but very falky. 

Overall a good place to have dinner if you aren't looking for luxury.

We all had hard drinks during the puja and were in the mood for some North Indian food, and a few of us wanted more drinks, so we went to our usual place which is BB's in sector 5. From there we went looking for food nearby. After visiting a few places, we ended up here. It's a small place, not the best in terms of space or decorations. First we ordered the tandoori chicken, which is surprisingly good! It was juicy and tender on the inside and had a perfectly smoky flavour on the crust, a rare treat! Sadly the same cannot be said about the Biryani though, it was tasty but it literally had oil dripping from it, which was a huge turn off.
 I would definitely recommend a plate of their tandoori chicken though.

Kolkata is a foodie's paradise. And this little(well not so little, I guess) paradise is right next to Technopolis.
Coming to the food. Saying that it was really good , is just an understatement. I went to with my friend with the sole objective of having a really​ big plateful of some non-veg dish. We ordered tandoori and it was really well cooked.The meat was juicy and flavourable. It was tandoored (I think I invented a word right there) just perfect.
The ambience is kinda so-so. Which is fine by me, as the sole reason to visit this place should be for the food.
Surely going back there pretty soon.
A little edit:
The service was really quick and good.

Its a small restaurant, placed just opposite to Technopolis in Sector V.
The ambiance is okay types for an evening after the daily office grind for get-together.  

They've got a nice spread of both vegetarian and non vegetarian items.
The quality and taste of food was okay. Should mention, quantity was generous.
 
I love their Tandoori Chicken and Peshawari Chicken. Biryani is just average.
All in all, a good place with okayish ambience, courteous staff and reasonably priced food. 

However, I feel its more suitable for take away / home delivery rather than dine in there itself. Recommended !!

I absolutely love this place. They serve such good food, with great quantity at a very reasonable price. The place may not be the best for dinning per say. But if you order it in you'll be amazed. Although the name suggests Indian mughlai dishes, their Chinese is quite good as well. There mixed fried rice is an absolute must. And biriyani is really well made, as a person who is sceptical about mutton outside home, their mutton biriyani never disappoints.

Decent place located opposite technopolis. The biryani is decently made. Pair it with tandoori chicken and it makes a decent meal. The place is not very big. But the staff are attentive and offer maybe not a 5-Star service but definitely not a 1-Star service as well. Reasonably priced. Good if you are in that area and are super hungry for Indian food.

Food & Quality :

We had ordered Biriyani, Butter naan, plain naan, Chicken kadai. The quantity of chicken was fair enough. Naans were soft & tasty. But the Biriyani was totally tasteless. The worst biriyani around Sector-5.

Princes was not too high, and somewhat appt.

This is a small restaurant in front of the technopolis in sector 5 of salt lake. Its more suitable for take away rather than dine in there itself. Coming on to the food quality , the kababs are alright . Best in there would be Tandoori Chicken and Peshawari Chicken. But in case you are looking for a good plate of biryani , dont get your expectations too high. The cost of chicken and mutton biryani here is less as compared to Arsalan and Aminia but the taste is no where near to the ones served there. The biryani served here at best tastes like a plate of rice that has been enhanced with  some local biryani masala. The aroma and the fragrance that you would expect from a good plate of biryani is missing here. Although the quantity served here is pretty good , it wont be worth it considering the quality....

All in All , this is a decent place for tandoori chicken , peshawari chicken and few other kabab cuisines for take away in case your home is nearby the restaurant....

Review : Food is pretty decent, quantity is adequate, ambience is average ( although we were a big group hence the space inside was comparatively smaller for us. Serving time moderate.

The outlet has takeaway counter and an attached dining area. The dining area is quite small. Net capacity 26. But the area is small.

Coming to the food, the biriyani is good and the side dishes are also quite good. Approximately bills ₹500 for 2 people. 1 plate biriyani can serve 1 adult. But few side dishes have over quantity of food. Please consult before ordering. The double egg double chicken roll is my personal favourite. It's like a trance feeling. The rolls are priced from ₹40 to ₹80. Online order and order by the phone both are available.

Well, Sector 5 Saltlake never stops amusing me, especially with it’s wide array of restaurants and outlets – 

And today, I discovered 1 more such – the Haji Ali. They are based somewhere nearby Technopolis and I ordered a meagre mixed vegetable main course for office delivery. I was glad to see the delivery being made in just half an hour or so! 

Coming to food, the gravy went very well with the home based chapatis. Nice to see huge quantum of seasonal vegetables (peas, beans, cauliflower, carrots etc) instead of too much of modest potatoes in the main course. The texture was so nice and attractive that you can simply keep on staring and adoring the main course for hours. Quantity, along with food presentation as well as packing was superb and I definitely received my full Rs. 150 worth!

Cheers!

I'm writing this review based on the experience of dining here . Mostly bitter :(

Pros:
1) Good location -  opposite Technopolis. Easy to locate.

Cons:
 Food is really bad(it is an understatement). They sometimes serve semi cooked chicken dishes for example: chicken manchurian and chicken tikka butter masala. I got half cooked chicken on 2 occasions. On complaining for chicken manchurian, I got a dull response but they promised to bring me freshly made same dish. Much to my disarray, they brought the semi cooked dish again after 40 mins. On further intimating, the manager arrived and argued that the dish served was okay. He promised to provide another gravy dish in lieu of the former. I waited another hour and received the same dish, this time in almost burnt state. 
By this time(approx 2 hrs waiting), I had lost all patience and time to intimate them again. I ate whatever I could and had to throw away the rest as the food was not edible. I footed the bill and left the place discontented.

I felt cheated after this incident because they did not fulfil any of the commitments they made after my initial complaint. This is how I was treated and ofcourse I did not get any value for money here. I'll not want anyone else to meet the same fate. Please avoid this restaurant.

Advice to the managment: 
Customers are not to be taken for fools. Run the business honestly. Adhere to your promises.

Recommendation:

Friends as my rating suggests,  my advise will be to  avoid visiting this place. On rare occasions however, you may get okay food but will definately get bitter experiences as the management cares less for customer's time and value for money.

This small little biriyani hub is great when the chips are down. The seating area is limited and the price of the food is also less in comparison with the other biriyani hubs. The biriyani is quite tasty and is light and non greasy. The chicken lajawab is rich in flavours and will leave you craving for more. The service is good and is recommended for a biriyani when the pockets are tight :)

The food here is good, have tried the kebabs biryani & chicken bharta. The Bharta was really delicious, so was the biryani, even the quantity was really good. It's a small shop located just opposite Technopolis so maybe for some it'll be difficult to locate. 
The problem I've faced from this shop is with it's delivery. I had once ordered from here through Zomato, they confirmed the order first and then after sometime cancelled the order. This needs to be sorted out by this restaurant, either don't confirm home delivery orders at all or else have the infrastructure in place to fulfill them.

In a bid to try all the restaurant available in my working area, I ordered for Haji Ali via Zomato Online. While the ordering took seconds and hardly did we clinch, the order delivery almost took couple of hours with various hindrances.
We ordered for Peshawari Tandoori Chicken, Special Mutton Biryani, Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice, 2 Soft Drinks and a pair of Hot Gulab Jamun. The order got confirmed instantly showing an estimate of one hour delivery.
After half an hour got over, I got a call from the restaurant asking my address in spite of the full address been written. After one and half hour got passed, I got another call from them asking for directions to which my patience took a toll. On having a verbal spat with him, he ultimately delivered the food in almost 2 hours.
The food as expected had died down, the drinks not so chilled. We started with Chicken which seemed utterly taste. I went forward with Fried Rice and my friend with Biryani. The fried rice tasted devoid of spices and according to my friend the biryani too seemed to suffer from same fate but it has too much colouring content. The Gulab jamuns however tasted good but in no way,were they worthy of ₹20 per piece.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) No. Not at all.

Qs) Why have I rated them 1.5 stars?
Ans) 0.5 star has been awarded only for Gulab Jamun.

I was quite excited to see Haji Ali in Salt Lake as I had heard they make amazing Biriyani. The place is tiny and doesn't look appealing at all. Better option is to go for a take away.  So I got Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Tikka masala packed. Biriyani was a big disappointment I'd say. It was just bland. No taste no flavor, not even a hint of salt. The Chicken in it was just overcooked. The aloo was burnt. Need I say more? The tikka masala wasn't great either. So not going back to this outlet anymore.

The name 'Haji' gives a hint that Mughlai, specially biryani is a speciality in that restaurant. It was a warm afternoon when I stepped in and decided to order simply a plate of chicken biryani. This is basically a 20 seater and the ambience is not worth mentioning. So it's better to go for a takeaway or a home delivery. 

Now coming to the food, the biryani was served quickly and it was piping hot ! It was oily, a bit more than it should have been, but I loved the taste. The biryani was tasty, the chicken and the potato were perfectly boiled. I specially loved the chicken which was marinated very well with spices. Overall, a decent and most importantly, a pocket friendly eatery in and around sector V. Health conscious people can avoid this !

This restaurant is not a big one or not a small one. come to seating section it is good around 20-25 seater, their kitchen section just beside the restaurant. you can see it while entering inside, a lovely view different types of kebabs hanging there, inside eating section very average.
Well i was went there in the afternoon time,it was totally empty. that time i was very, for a quick nite section quickly i ordered mutton biryani along with a side dish chicken bharta.
1. Mutton Biryani -first of all quantity was very good,enough for one person. quality was very average comes with a portion of potato along with a big portion of a mutton, mutton was just ok,a bit hard. Juicy-ness and the soft portion was completely missing,but the flavour of the aroma was excellent.
 2. Chicken bharta - minced with cooked very well with the proper mixture of coriander leaves,chilis,onion,cream and with finely chopped egg portion,taste wise it was good but giving excessive amount of chilis and onions taste almost lost somewhere.
Service was really good i just awaited for 5 min,both the dishes arrived very quickly.
Wish you all the very best everyone i will definitely come back to taste their kebabs,till then happy eating.

Haji Ali... bang opposite the Technopolis building in Sector V Salt Lake happens to be one of my favourite joints for their biriyanis and mellowing kebabs.... melting away to deligtfulness upon being devoured! Not a huge place...but clean and well managed...priced very reasonably and service is good. Recommended for kebabs and biriyanis.

So our bike broke down at technopolis while on our way home (after office), and after getting it fixed, we decided to gorge on some biriyani from Haji ali as the smell got us famished !

Tangri kebab was was good having the right amount of roast. And the Chicken Biriyani was light, though tasty.

Service was a little slow (at 8.30 PM, I cannot really forgive slow service).

The bill came to 305 INR. 

I conclude by stating that this place is okay to visit when in dire need for food.

Yesterday had a last minute get together at one of our friends place in Rajarhat and so my friends picked up Biriyani and Chaanp from this place. And for a wonder the Biriyani was quite ok and the chicken chaanp was so so. Their packing was good as they gave us plates and spoons along with the food.quite satisfying considering the price though they should look into the taste of the Biriyani a little

I had gone there on 9th April in the noon with my friends. We ordered tandoori chicken and roti with took the order away. There were four pieces of tandoori out of which one was rotten. Only because we took the order away, we couldn't go and tell the people on face and so I'm reporting this issue on this forum.

Nice place for times when your maid takes a leave and there's nothing to eat at home. Also for times when your wallets suffer from a liquidity crunch, Haji Ali comes to the rescue.

It's also perfect for home deliveries if you live near New Town, Salt Lake, Keshtopur etc.

Decent food, decent prices.

Haji Ali name seems to be a local low grade Biryani shop but this one is not. This one is an AC Restaurant opposite to Technopolis at Saltlake.

Location : Haji Ali is very easy to find, located beside famous Azad Hind Dhaba opposite to Technopolis at Salt Lake Sec 5.

Decoration : Straight roadside view, Simply decorated, Bright lighted, Neat & clean Dining that you can see from the road. Just beside the dining there is outdoor counter & you can see the grilled kebabs hanging in front of the kitchen too.

Staffs & Management : Young staffs are there. They are very helpful & quite fast to serve.

Foods : They have a lot to offer from Indian Tandoor to Chinese. But as per other reviews we also stuck to the Indian once. So we ordered the following...

Chicken Biryani : Chicken Biryani came in a Handi like the traditional way. It was not too rich & spicy but the spices were mixed together well. The rice quality was good & cooked well. Somehow the Biryani fragrance was missing & the rice felt little oily. Unfortunately the Chicken piece inside was worst of its quality. It was just steamed cooked without spices & absolutely tasteless from inside. Overall the Biryani doesn't came up to the mark.

Tandoori Chicken : Tandoori Chicken was served with sliced salad & green sauce like it should be. Tandoori was rich looking, very nicely grilled to red. It was soft from every angle & it also tasted brilliant. Just like every other review says about this restaurant, their Tandoori is really great & one of the best in its standards.

Chicken Tikka Butter Masala : 6 pieces of Chicken dipped into rich orange spicy gravy, garnished with cream & green leafs on top looked fabulous. Chicken pieces were very soft, very nicely cooked where the taste of the gravy came from inside. Just the right amount of oil & spices were used that made it felt very nice & tasty.

Tandoori Roti : Tandoori Roti came sliced in two parts. It was soft, nicely baked & tasted very good with the side dishes. The size of the Roti was big too.

Pricing : Pricing seems little higher than same kind of restaurants. However they doesn't add any kind of VAT with their bill, so its a huge plus point. You will only pay what it is printed on the menu card. Fortunately quality & quantity both justifies the price point well. All those above mentioned items for 4 people costs us Rs. 705.

Conclusion : Haji Ali at that position is a great option to choose from. Their Tandoori Chicken is a must try. With higher rating than its nearest competitor Azad Hind this one is great for trying Indian dishes.

I usually come home for very few days in a year so prefer eating mostly home cooked food. But dad had so much praises for non veg at Haji Ali that we decided to order some from home one evening. 
The service was extremely slow and it took considerable time and plenty of follow up to get the order delivered. However was impressed with the food quantity and quality. We had chicken tandoori, Afghani and reshmi kebabs. Starters for a perfect evening. The food was really good. Well spiced, flavors sinking within the meat and really succulent. Would really love to try more dishes the next time.

I donot know whether this restaurant has received that much attention it deserves . So it is high time i write a review on it . So are u working in salt lake and hungry for "biryani " ? This is your answer to your burning desire . Trust me this place with satisfy your biryani urge . This is located in nabadigonto of salt lake sector 5 just opposite "Technopolis " building  beside Azad Hind . The biryani is here the exact delicacy the people of Kolkata crave for . It is served hot with delightful pieces of meat . Priced at 160 it includes an egg and can anyday give a huge complex to the samples from Arsalan , Aminia and Alibaba. There are certain dishes I would definitely recommend .

1. Mutton biryani ( must try )
2. Tandoori butter chicken 
3. Mixed fried rice ( awesome )

From the above list you can see that I have included fried rice among mughlai items because they make it we'll . The most important plus point from this joint is that their food is tasty . Today we went there for ala carte . The only con they have is their service . You would not have all the items in the menu delivered to you in time . And in peak hours the service degrades. Another this is if you go for ala carte you will have to pay by cash .

But minus the points it is a good bet to have a nice mughlai lunch or order biryanis . Their food will not let u down .

Located opposite to Technopolis, Haji Ali is one of the best places serving Mughlai dishes. It is very close to my home area. Chicken biriyani , Chicken tikka butter masala, Tangri Lazawab and Murgh Hariyali Tikka are a must try to satisfy your taste buds. Yummy! The Chinese dishes are not that good. Recently I had ordered Chicken biriyani, Chicken tikka butter masala, Egg fried rice and Chilli Chicken in gravy online over Zomato. Their quality and quantity were maintained appropriately. The price is quite reasonable.

Well I have never been to this place physically and all the time I've placed orders over phone.

A fantastic place to order from if you just don't want to get out to grab your food. They make nice biriyani. Also rashili tangri murgh is  a must try. They use perfectly cooked chicken leg pieces in tandoor in a rich and spicy gravy. If you want you can also dine in though the place is a bit small. Oh yes the nawabi murgh tikka. Its yum.

This is one of the best places serving Mughlai and North Indian cuisines which is very close to my workplace. Mostly we would opt for an office delivery, but I had visited this place recently for a dine in. The restaurant is not very spacious and can only accommodate roughly 25 people. Nevertheless, the place is maintained well, is clean and hygienic. The staff is very courteous and the service is quick and prompt.
For the food talk, we had ordered Plain Naan(here they split a Naan into 3 pieces). The Naan served is so soft, that one would never want to order Butter Naan, to get the softness of it. It is sheer delight to have Naan at Haji Ali with other meat accompaniments. So, with the Naan we had ordered Rashili Tangri Murgh, Mutton Korma and Methi Malai Paneer. Rashili Tangri Murgh is the USP of this place. A full plate serving four leg pieces of chicken dipped in a dense spicy Chicken gravy. The taste is heavenly. No matter what we order, this item is always placed by default in our order. The Mutton Korma full is served with four mutton pieces with an egg. This dish is too very delicious. However the Chicken Korma that they serve is on the other hand, sweet to taste. Methi Malai Paneer is delightful, the paneer is so soft that it just melts down the throat.
It is always an excellent dining experience from Haji Ali. And I must say that the prices of the items are very reasonable when compared to the quality and quantity of the food serve. A must try for those working at Sector 5 or Newtown. Thumbs Up!!

Located opposite to Technopolis on the left on the way towards New Town, Haji Ali is a recently opened small joint offering delicious yet reasonably prised preparations.

I've had the opportunity to be here a couple of time and have been ordering food from her since then. Their quality and quantity is balanced very appropriately and the rates are less compared to other joints with similar menu. The Seekh Kebab, Mutton Keenma, Chicken Bharta have been on my list so far and they did a wonderful job with everything.

The place is quite small and doesn't shine out a lot in the area although it's absolutely worth a visit. I hope they maintain this kind of quality and service all the way.

Haji Ali don't need any caption or introduction to the world of food lovers...
The day I went over there was the day when each and every restaurant near my home was closed..! Was confused between which stuffs to have, like chicken soup or normal meal for the lunch.. Finally ordered "Chicken Kassa" with "Fried Rice". Took normal time to be get on my table.. Taste was really good and was happy to have it.. But the thing that made me give 3ratings rather than 3.5 or else 4 was that when they provided me a glass of water, it was a cooled or else chilled one.. That day I was having cough and cold so asked for a normal water or else serve me a bottle of mineral water which is of normal temperature not a chilled one.. I was told that they don't have normal temperature water..! Was really unhappy with that...

A small joint opposite Technolopis might not have any glitter but enough popular among day to day office goers in that region.

In starters we have Murgh Hariyali Tikka, Murgh Cheese Malai Kebab and Nawabi Murgh Tikka. Nawabi Murhg Tikka was the softest tikka I ever had and exquisite taste. Other kebab options I found though and fibrous.

In main course had Mutton Biriyani and Rashili Tangri Murgh. Mutton biriyani if not extraordinary in taste but Rashili Tangri Murgh is a great addition to the menu. This can be tried with Garlic Naan and Kulcha too.

They have very less veg options and many items were not available.

The take away joint turned into a full fledged restaurant with decent ambience located right opposite Technopolis building is giving tough fight to Azad Hind Dhaba next door.

Chicken biryani is tad oily but quantity is good enough for two and doesnot contain egg.
Reshmi chicken butter masala is sweet and spicy goes well with biryani and naan or tandoori.

Prices are reasonable and includes taxes and service is quite fast.

don't be fooled by the appearance at first glance. the quality of food is at par, if not better, with most well known joints. the coolest part is they take orders over whatsapp ..

We have ordered spcl chicken biriyani, veg biriyani, chicken chap and paneer roll. The biriyanis were awesome, spice is upto the mark. The paneer roll could have been better. But overall a good experience .

Situated opposite Technopolis it is the best place for you mughlai cravings. Best place to have haryali and nawabi kebabs(I just loved these). The chicken kadhai and butter chicken were also very good. Chicken rolls are worth the bucks. The only mood spoiler is the constant honking feom the kolkata IT Traffic of sector 5.

Went there for a Friday lunch today and ordered tandoori roti along with kadhai chicken and mutton kima masala. The roti was served hot with the awesome boneless kadhai chicken. The kima masala was spicy but it tasted good too.

Overall a nice place with nice food. Will visit again.

Worst food quality.Do not ever go there even if it  is one and only restaurant near by you.Most of the times they are providing chicken with a rotten smell.

We has ordered for Chicken tikka and chicken tandoori and I am pretty confirm that those were prepared the previous day.After complaining,staff admitted the same and replaced it but again no luck and the quality was even more bad this time.

Don't go by price thinking that it suits more of your budget(there is no additional tax).The food is horrible and you will be lucky if you get good food here.

Pros : quick delivery in less than 45 mins - near to sec v and newtown .good portions of each dish . Tandoori chicken was the best so far in  this area .masala kulcha was huge in size - 1 kulcha is enough if you are not too hungry .

Cons : chicken tikka masala had too much tomato in gravy making it sour - too much floating oil on the curry - well you should not complaining if ordering from outside I guess ;)

Delivery : 8/10
Taste : 7/10
Value for money : 8/10

Recommended : tandoori chicken

This place is located opposite of Technopolis and they deliver food till quite late in the night, so it has become a popular takeaway and online/over phone ordering food joint in the IT hub of Kolkata. We usually order quite often from this counter, when at work.

Best Starter: Tandoori Chicken.
Next Best Starter: Chicken Hariyali Kebab.
Biryani: Good quantity, okayish rice, mutton piece is dry n not so tasty. Chicken biryani is again, okay.
Best Side Dish: Rasili Tangri Murgh. Extremely creamy, very rich, and spicy.
Next Best Side Dish: Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. Yellowish gravy, sweet yet properly spiced up.
Best Veg Side Dish: Paneer Butter Masala. Too good. Try it.

You can order a couple of Naans for any of the side dishes, and they should go well.

The food is reasonably priced, less than any of the nearby restaurants, plus they are inclusive of all taxes.

Overall, a good food counter!

This place is one of the hidden gems of Sector-5, Saltlake. It's a take-away/home delivery joint as of today, with few seating arrangements (stools,etc). But recently they are coming up with one dining area just adjacent to the present outlet, once this dining section is open this place will surely pull even more crowd.

a) Location - - - - Opposite Technopolis building, sector-5, Saltlake Kolkata.

b) Billing - - - - Let's talk about billing first since that is the first thing that takes place once you are here at this joint with your order. It's simple, fast and you are handed over your printed bill in a flash. And yes, as of today only cash is accepted which you need to pay right when the bill gets generated.

c) Service - - - - Once the bill is generated, your waiting time starts. I have tried this joint maybe 6-7 times, but this part is still a mystery to me. Some days they deliver stuffs in a minute or two, and on some occasions they take even 15-20 minutes to hand over the food (maybe with order of a Biriyani which is lying ready in front of them!). So I would say the service is really inconsistent at this place and needs to be improved a lot to build the goodwill. Though I must say the person (at the billing counter) dealing with customers is quite polite and prompt.

d) Food quality/taste - - - - And now comes the best part. The food at this joint is truly amazing and eclipses all other negatives. Try their double egg double chicken roll, it's really delicious and truly soul-satisfying! The paratha is not too deeply fried and is bit on the softer side, the way I like it. I have tried both Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Biriyani at this place, both are simply mouth watering. Infact the Mutton biriyani at Rs.130 is just amazing! It's absolutely stunning with awesome taste and attractive aromas. The mutton piece in there is insanely tender with an equally tasty and well-cooked potato. Only one point, the Mutton Biriyani at 130/- or Chicken Biriyani at 120/- doesn't contain any boiled egg in them.

e) Food quantity - - - - No issues with this part as well. The quantity of the biriyani is huge and should be good enough for one adult. The rolls are also quite filling, more so if it has egg in it.    

f) Hygiene - - - - The take-away joint which is there at present has no ambiance and you can directly view the kitchen. Hygiene can definitely be improved though it is quite okay considering it is (at present) just a street-side joint. Once their dining area is functional we can hope for better ambaince and hygiene at that place for sure.

Overall, this is one nice value for money joint, much better when compared to the other joints present in the vicinity. It's one of my favorite spots very close to my office for  evening snacks or lunch take-aways. Do try out their Biriyanis and Rolls, you surely won't regret.

Cheers!

This is a Mughlai cuisine takeaway joint just in front of technopolis building in sec-5. I am writing this review after having its food more than 5-6 times, so their consistency is assured. If I do a compare between quality vs cost this joint will stand tall in comparison to other famous joints adjacent or nearby. I tried  few of their kababs, all are good in taste. If I need to choose one item from menu then it would be chicken bharta( always asked to make less oily) it's really testy and delicious it goes very well with masala kulcha. Highly recommended for nearby Mughlai food lover.

Good place. Nice and hygienic. The food quality is good. Nothing too great. Price is reasonable. The kebabs here should be given a try. They're delicious.

Quality is quite good as compared to price.. Basically a take away outlet... Biryani here can easily compete with other so called biryani Moghuls.. Kebabs are slightly better than okay type.. Very much pocket friendly and also tinkers your taste buds.

I have tried their mutton biriyani quite a few times and it is really comparable with some of the best in Kolkata. The gravy items are also good. Cost is okay for a takeaway joint. Definitely a must try.
