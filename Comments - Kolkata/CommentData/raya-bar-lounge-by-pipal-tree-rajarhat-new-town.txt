We were looking for a lounge bar to spend some time due to a delayed flight. We stepped into Rays because it is very close to our place. This is a perfect after office hangout place. We ordered a few drinks and a lemon grass flavoured chilli chicken (very good). Service was excellent!

Nice place with decent decor and decent staffs. Billing takes a lot of time but it's okay. A very decent place to visit. Songs can be much better.

Located at the ground floor of pipal tree hotel. Small place with seating of around 15-20 people. Prices are little high as per the place. A hookah costs 650. We had hukka and food like american corn pepper salt, tangri kebab, crispy chiili babycorn and mocktails. A decent place and ideal for people who don't like crowded places.

Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons. you need to be as cool and refreshing like other seasons. the best way to deal with this heat is a glass of non-alcoholic drink. a glass of fresh lime juice or you can try a glass of watermelon juice or any kind of refreshment like fresh mixture of juices. recently ‚ÄúRaya Bar & Lounge by Pipal Tree‚Äù introduced various types of non-alcoholic drink which you can enjoy in this summer season.located in Hatiara,Main Arterial Road,walking distance from cc2. beuatifully decorated place,lovely music playing in the background.ambiance of the place pretty much good.these drinks will definitely cool everyone‚Äôs mind and spirits. i and my fellow foodie friends went there to try out these all new mocktails. these are the below mocktails we tried there,

Located in the ground floor just beside the entrance of Pipal Tree hotel in Rajarhat area.
Raya Bar & Lounge is a very compact place with I think a maximum capacity of 40.
Their service is quick and the most interesting thing i observed ( quite childish though ) was that they serve popcorns as munchies with the drinks - personal favourite üòÉ
We had ordered dahi ke kebab - i would simply define that taste as delicious
Pesto sause penne - yum
Other orders were good too like baby corn American corn, kebab platter
But dahi ke kebab just won my heart.
Will surely return for food.

Located at the junction of chinar park. The place was relatively empty. If you want to enjoy a drink or two quietly,this is the place to be. Minimal decor and small place,with high bar tools clad tables. The food was standard but was served very nicely,though it took relatively long for the snacks to order. Would visit again.

This is a good place inside the Pipal Tree hotel. The place is good not that crowded with light music being placed. I liked the decor which was simple but effective. I ordered from the cocktail menu which was contained some unique drinks. The best being in the menu 'for someone special' and 'straight through the heart'. I liked these two new types of drink.

Can you please upload the food menu? I am planning to visit there but without the food menu, not able to take the final decision. Also is there any discount for corporate sector?

We were here for a quick drink and found the ambiance to be a great one. The capacity is quite small but the interior is great. I particularly liked the ceiling lighting made of empty Carlsberg bottles. Both the drinks and food are of great taste, but one may find them a bit overpriced. We had ordered a 'K for Kolkata', LIIT and 'For Someone Special' along with Crispy Lotus Roots and Tengri Kebab. Vodka based 'K for Kolkata' ¬†was awesome. ¬†The LIIT was quite smooth but strong. Overall, its a good place for a quick hangout.
However, to our amazement, we were the only customer present on a Friday night around 8:30.

Wine Tasting session organized by Sula at Raya, Pipal Tree ¬†

I believe that tasting wine in itself is an adventure that deepens your appreciation both for wines as well as the winemakers. Look, smell, taste - when combined together gives you the strength to go on to judge a wine and to carry on the basic sensory examination. These basic senses enable us to go on to be pro wine tasters. We need to be in the perfect tasting environment and need to keep in mind that we can smell several unique scents, but our taste perception is limited to salty, sweet, sour and bitter only. It is the ultimate combination of smell and taste that allows us to discern a flavor. Now here at this session we tasted four varieties of Sula wine, punctuated by taste breakers and awesome fish fingers along with tarter dip.
