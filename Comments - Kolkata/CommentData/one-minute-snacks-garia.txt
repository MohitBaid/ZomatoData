I visit this place particularly for south Indian dishes. In garia region you won't find a good south Indian restaurant. This is the reason why this joint is popular here. Although they have Chinese dishes but still I recognize this as a south Indian restaurant. Their food is good. You won't be disappointed if you try any of their south Indian dishes particularly sambar vada.

This place is located just beside my house and it's my all time ordering place when it comes to rolls, chowmein (evening snacks mostly). They had started with south Indian food and recently have added other delicacies. South Indian food is good as well. However, the shortcomings are, they take time to serve. And, the rolls have excess oil. The momos are over priced.

This is another decent south-indian "take-way" joint.. cause this place will not give you any fine dinning experience. 
FOOD-„ÄãNow they are offering several dishes except south indian like rice meals, bottled water, ice cream but I never thought of buying anything rather than idli's and dosas. Sambar and chatni is quite average. But idli is soft, like what it should be. Not too hard.
Location-„Äã It is just beside garia Hatari outlet. From garia you can take auto and stop at maha mayatala stopage. Pocket pinch quite affordable. They give decent parcel facility with proper packaging.
Overall, decent place if you are arround this area.

I've had umpteen takeaways from this joint. This joint was at the Garia junction earlier but then they went a little more south. 
Anyway coming to the food, the South Indian here is really good. 
The dosas, vadas and uttapams are really good. My favorite being the paper masala dosa here. 
The sambhar and the chutney is also really good. 

Besides that they also serve rice and all. Even though I've never had that, my mom has and she said it was just about average.
