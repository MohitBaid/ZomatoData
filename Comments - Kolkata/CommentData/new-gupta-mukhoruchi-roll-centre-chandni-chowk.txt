a typical roadside roll and chinese snacks counter on the busy chandni chowk area opposite to ganesh chandra avenue.... you will get variety and the typical taste of kolkata in every bite and super inexpensive rates.... food is pretty decent.....

A very hungry stomach may let your hunger sauce to help you gulp down the food, but otherwise you may not like it at all.
Very oily stuff, which is neither healthy nor tasty!! Specially the rolls are fried in hydrogenated vegetable oil, and not at all good in taste.
A below-average/substandard place to be honest. The only positive thing is the low pocket pinch. That's it!!

New Gupta Mukhoruchi Roll center is located on the Ganesh Chandra Avenue opposite of the Chandni Chowk Metro Gate, near to Supreme The IT Mall. 

In office times you will find this footpath roll counter crowded almost everyday. This gives an idea that daily office going people near to Chandni Chowk loves their food.

However their roll is made of thin average fried parathas. In egg roll you can only expect onion inside of that. Sauces used are of very poor quality. Overall their roll tastes very basic. The prices are very affordable therefore it is an average spot to kill your small hunger.

Its a roll centre located near Broadway Hotel,G.C Avenue.. Here you will get roll of ok OK quality..

There is no seating arrangement,just take and go..Moreover you have to wait most of the times for your oder...

I still believe that the paratha should be more crispier, otherwiise the roll is spicier and attracts your taste buds..

There is always rush in this roll centre between 5 pm to 8 pm,and it suffer lack of menu options too...Mutton,Chicken and Egg roll is their speciality..

I don't consider this roll centre as a hangout place but if you are hungry then come here for your great taste bud experience...

Location and Description: A small outlet near the Chandi Chowk crossing with few but some tasty dishes to offer you on th go. Very busy in the evening so like that in the afternoon during Tiffin time.

Ambience and Staff:  Its  a street food outlet so no ambience. Just take and eat on the footpath which really annoys me when the people passes by watching those things in your hands.. They were quick to serve.

Food : This place offers you very few items but those you can say good Fast Food. They make some very tasty rolls. Last time when i had the Egg chicken roll from here it was really tasty. The Paratha was hot red and folded with egg and some delicious fried chickens. They also offer Rice and chow to have your hunger fulfilled. 

QNQ & Prices:The quality is far better than other street outlets. Gonna try more if get a chance.  Prices are pocket friendly.

Conclusion: Small but good in quality and quantity. They also serve Full as well as half plates. Decision is yours.

The review is based on my personal visit and experience to tis place.

A small street food outlet which used to serve Roll for a long time, now started serving more items like Fried rice, noodles to name a few.. 

This place is located just opposite of Mission Cafe in Chadni Cowk street, which is just a couple of steps away after you make your way out of Chadni Chowk Metro Station. 

Basically a take away corner with no seating arrangements other than a cement slab on the opposide side of this kiosk. This place serves you quality food and does try to keep up in hygenic department also. But fails miserably in keeping the cement slab clean, which is the only place for seating.. Used water will puddle up around the slab and the smell would give you a hard time to enjoy your food.. 

Rolls are always a pleasure at this place but the item which i like most is Mix Fried Rice. Vegetables cut in small pieces will be evenly scattered on all over your plate along with chicken and egg based on your choice.. Nicely prepared with a minimum amount of oil and no added extra colors this place does drag me for a plate of Rice whenever am near or around Chadni Chowk. 
However am not a fan of their Noodles as extra colors and a load amount of oil is used to prepare a single plate.. 
Quantity is enough for a single guy, but for couples a plate is enough.. 

==== TO THE OWNERS ====
Should have a proper place to sit and should give a special attention to keep it clean and wash or wipe away the leftovers after a gap of 30-40 minutes.. It's hard to enjoy heavy and spicy items like Rice and Noodles while standing...

Well well can't wait to taste the food of the city of joy. Thanks to my friend here, I came across by this Mukhoruchi center here.
Don't expect any accommodation here, but still they have there own facilities to facilitate foodies like us. 
Lets come to the points. 
Its a good place.
Food is good in the heart of the city.
And quite fast service. 
The place is not so odd to get noticed.
The directions are all given, when the next time you gizmo freaks are going to get your PC upgraded, try not to miss this delicious food corner. 
The "guy" making "Chow Mein" in front of the shop, just check him out, how skillful he is. Its an attraction. 
Alright no more to add about a mukhorochok food corner here. 
Okay check out my pick. 
And of course, stay tuned..

Located opposite Mission cafe in chandni chowk area, this is one of the most selling roll centres here that serves decent rolls in my opinion. Its a small shop without any seating area so basically is a takeaway outlet as most such roll centres are. Cleanliness and hygiene is the most critical area for such places and this place isn't that bad in this respect and comparatively better than many, not most though. The rolls are well made and customised well as to your liking. I would suggest one to visit between 4-6 pm when the rush is a bit low and quality of food is better.
