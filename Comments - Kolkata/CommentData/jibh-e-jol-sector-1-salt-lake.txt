1st of all d guy on telephone who took d order was pretty rude... den order took one hour and 20 mins to reach home. . I ordered veg chow which was cold but ok in taste... crispy chilli baby corn was nice... lachha parathaa was not so good.. n worst was paneer butter masala... so in total I would not order ever...

We ordered for home delivery from here. It's quite cheap and taste is also not bad as per the price. Chicken pakoda and chicken bharta were good. Alu paratha was Ok type. Crispy chilli babycorn was tasty. Overall good experience.

It is basically for take away. Located a minute away from the pnb bus stop,it is just another roll corner. But their rolls are really good and huge. The fried rice and noodles are also nice. It is good for students as it is pocket friendly. It won't even cost you 400 bucks as mentioned in the info here. Hardly 250would be fine for a proper meal
