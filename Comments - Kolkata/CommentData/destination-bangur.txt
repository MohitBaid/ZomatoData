They don't have more than 5-6 bases. Ambience is very bad. Staff doesn't know how to take care of the customers. No dense. Flavour tastes like soap. They give us old bases. Never visit this place again.

Not very good! A little too spacious and the atmosphere was the worst j had ever been. Surely it was cheap but it wasn't value for money if you ask me!

Though a good spacious place but honestly the place is very very badly maintained. Food was awesome and hookah was also good. Decor is outdated and ambience can be better if they put the wall lights on and switch off the ceiling halogens feels like a office meeting. But better place than many hookah hangout in this area.

Visited it today, had seen the name tag when i last visited the yellow chilli restaurant , its located on the same floor.
Never actually knew this existed, until i saw the board that day.
Ordered - Kolkata Pan (their signature hookah) , garlic bread and a fruit passion mojito.
The hookah was fantabulous , the flavour was diff and the smoke was dense
Garlic bread - a new way of serving by them, i rather call it garlic buns, tasted ok, could be better
The fruit passion mojito - absolutely killer, actually repeated another glass of it, refreshing and tasty.
Super economical and feels like home here.

It is located on the 5th floor of the building which also houses Yellow Chilli and CCD, just opposite Bharat Petroleum.

The interiors and ambience are cheap and rustic. There is an overall darkish lighting with blue neons. Even though they have a nice menu, most items aren't available at all times. The music playing in the background is also ridiculous.
However they do have a good collection of hookahs and offer a wide range of flavours, which is the sole X factor of the place.

We ordered a Chocolate Shake which was decent and a Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream which was better on the upper layers, but burnt as one starts to dig in. We had also ordered a Margarita Pizza, instead of which they provided a different pizza. So we returned it.

The staff is just limited to 1-2 people as most customers check in for shisha only.

In short, this place is worth a visit only if you plan on taking a hookah with couple of friends and nothing else.

A nice place to have sheesha at and food is really nice at reasonable rate. Its a good place to chill with friends. The staff is really friendly and polite and takes good care of the customers demand. You can also organise small parties in the lounge. Overall nice experience.
