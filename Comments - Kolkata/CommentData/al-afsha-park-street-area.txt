Visited here today for lunch. We had a little coupon which includes 2 mutton Biriyani , 2 Firni along with 2 cold drinks. As soon as we got seated, they informed that Firni was out of stock so we had to take gulab jamun Instead of Firni. Coming to the ambiance, it's simple. The service was remarkably quick. We were served within 10 minutes. The Biryani was light in aroma but tasty. It contained one tender piece of mutton and one piece potato. Onion salad was also served with the Biriyani. Amount was perfect for feeding one person. They served 2 pieces of Gulab jamun each to both of us. Overall it's a nice experience. You can give it a try once.

Surprisingly good food. 
Had chicken achari kebab, mutton chaap and butter roti. The mutton tasted brilliant. Perfect blend of spices. The meat was soft and juicy. Delightful chunks of boneless meaty delight. The chicken was also very good. Again a good blend of spices. Soft and juicy. Price too was very reasonable.
Highly recommended.

Tried chicken chilli, chicken manchurian and firni... 
Chicken chilli and Manchurian was good and spicy... Firni was not worth it... But happy with the gravy.

1st order through Zomato, the food that came from the restaurant excellent, fabulous crispy chicken. 2nd order through Swiggys, again for crispy chicken and roasted chicken, roasted chicken was excellent but crispy chicken disgusting, tasted more like honey chicken with loads of honey added to it. Today inspite of all this, i ordered again, but to my surprise the food was worst then ever. The crispy chicken was not at all crisy and sweet again, roasted chicken was not at all good, very much bland. The tandoori roti that i ordered was made of atta and not maida, even a road side small local vender would give you maida tandoori roti. Mixed Fried rice was so so, missing on prawns, chicken and egg for a price of 180 per plate. Chilli chicken was ok. It seems that when you order for the first time they give you best service but with frequent order from the same customer makes them think that they can send any thing and everything to the customer. Prices high for the quality of food offered.Overall would not recommend to order from this restaurant. Disgusting that they can't retain customers. Last but not the least restaurant phn num is always busy so if you are thinking of calling them, hmmm just forget it.

Not good. 
The biryani is not even average with half cooked potatoes and a typical smell. 
Neither the chicken curry. Had a blank taste.
The phirni has artificial flavours. Looks like it has good colouring and not kesar.
The interiors are also not upto the mark.
The only thing good is the staff. They are polite. :)

Never visited this place. But ordered for multiple times through zomato n swiggy. I just love their keema nan. The butter nan z also good. Biriyani z average. Kebabs r relishing. Their firni ll no doubt please u. I tried most of the chicken items in their main course. Among them chicken butter masala n do piyaza r my favourite. Without any hesitation order from here, u wont be disappointed. But, I never visited this place.. N I know nothing about its ambiance n service!! So if u v a plan of dining in, check other reviews before checking in!!!

We just happened to walk by this restaurant in search of some good Halal food. We were pleasantly surprised by Al Afsha. My taste buds were super satisfied by the flavours in the food. We ordered Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Momos, Chicken Tangdi Kabab and some Garlic Naan. Every single item was perfect. The service was also incredible. Our server, Sajid, was very sweet and took good care of us. I would recommend this joint to any foodie. A+.

Lunch on Christmas Eve with every other place in Park Street thronging with people from all over the world.. No worries! This amazing place close to Braganza 's and opposite Mocambo is definitely a hidden gem! A planned trip just to try out the food out here wasn't dissapointing at all . A nice cosy ambience made the place all the more likeable from the beginning. The Chicken Malai Kebab looked absolutely exotic and tasted brilliant. The Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala had soft pieces of chicken and tasted decent too. Excellent service and ease of payment transaction through Paytm made the experience a delightful one..

Went with a friend for dinner at this place after reading the grt reviews in zomato and trust me I am happy that I tried out this place. I tried out veg for the dinner and the experience was so good that I am soon going back for their non-veg items.
The restaurant is on the 1st floor. Basic but nicely done decor .
Had around 20-25 ppl sitting arrangement. 
We ordered 
1. Crispy chilly baby corn : gud could be much better. Was towards the dry side. 
2. Green salad
3. Butter naan and garlic naan:  one naan was enough for me . Garlic naan was very tasty.
4. Sabnamhara payaz : this is basically mushroom makhni type with Hearty containt of mushroom . 
 
Must go for this place !!
Lovely food . 
Will be back with an update of nonveg dishes.

A newly opened place in park street which holds great promises in the future. Serves tasty Indian food at a very cheap rate. 
Roasted chicken is a speciality of this place.  Half Plate contains 4 pieces of chicken (not 2 as were our expectations). It is quite different from the conventional tandoori chicken. Mutton biriyani was also good to taste. But the amount was a little less and not adequate for sharing . Along with biriyani we also ordered murgh tikka lababdar. Everything was delicious. 
Most importantly the prices are very attractive. The total bill came out to be 485. AND THEY DON'T INCLUDE 20% EXTRA TAXES IN THE BILL. 
The interiors are also good. Only a soothing music would have made this place totally perfect. 
Just hurry up to have an 'Al-Afshi'an experience before the prices hike up.

Its just bad extremely horrible. I ordered Dal Al Afsha, Masala Kulcha, Jeera Aloo, Plain rice and Phirni. The Dal was not understandable when you open the container, it looked like some non veg gravy with extreme oil n fat. Half of the container had just oil. Jeera Aloo had weird tangy taste, it was not jeera aloo it was tomato aloo, had tacky flavour. The kulcha was half cooked, only cooked from above and not inside, maybe they were in hurry to make the food. It was gooey and had pudina cutney flavour . I guessed they used leftover chicken tandoori pudina chutney for the kulcha. Plain rice was under cooked. Phirni was ok not that bad. Even the roadside dhaba make far better food then them. I had thrown the food in garbage cant even give to beggars it was soo bad.
