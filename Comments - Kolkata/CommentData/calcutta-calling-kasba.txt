Worth spending time.  Nice restroom and beautifully designed in a small area.  Very innovative dishes and that too in a very reasonable rate.  Will advise everyone to visit with family or with friends and do try Cheese Corn Bhetki as never had that kind of dish.

The place is small but highly recommend. If they can serve such nice quality during festivals am sure they can be more awesome the rest of the year. Try continental. The ambience is also peaceful and nice. They can cook mughlai and south east Asian cuisine with equal efficiency

I visited this place for dinner. It is near Rajdanga, Kasba; visible from the main road. The place is cozy but has a good ambience. It is a calm restaurant with pictures of Tagore and historic places of Calcutta. The interior is done in a nice way. The restaurant has an accommodation of 20 people. Now coming to the food, we ordered a chicken sweet and sour soup and chicken Cantonese noodles. The food was really tasty and the prices here are pretty affordable. The staffs were very polite and cooperative too; but yeah there's some trouble with the AC I guess. Apart from that I didn't find anything wrong. In short, this is a nice place to hang out !

It is not a very big place but the way they have decorated is really something to talk about. Staffs were nice. The service was upto the mark also. 
P.S : The prices shown on the menu are including all  the taxes.

The ambience is okayish, seating was a bit crumped up. 
Food was however decent enough. 
We ordered the usual, chicken clear soup, noodles, fried rice and a chicken and fish preparation according to their suggestion. 
It was served hot and fresh. Tasted pretty good.

The only thing I liked about the restaurant is the decoration.. nicely decorated..There are some pictures .. 

Ambience: nice but not upto the mark. Mostly feels there is no privacy.. 

Food: horrible.I am sorry but they don't know how to cook chicken wanton or butter chicken.. I ordered a lime soda and the juice was normal temperature without ice and so bitter.. as in the lemon has been squeezed alot before serving.. thank God I didn't order any more food .. 

At last the service: The people out there who all are working .. sorry to say please be around when the customers need you rather than watching TV.. sorry but I write what I face in places. 

There is nothing better than being honest.. 

I am not locating this restaurant but since your in Zomato I m sure you would get it...

The only good thing here is food is tasty. But the quantity and time they take to serve food is horrible. I mean if you have too much home deivery orders, why dont u keep a separate section for it? You cant keep your guests waiting for 1.5 - 2 hrs to serve the starter. Even the fresh lime soda took 45 mins to serve. Next comes the food quantity. Its so little compared to the price. Are you serving kids thali or something like that? Starting from noodles, fried rice and chelo kabab...forget about sharing, not even sufficient for 1 adult. Overpriced items. Thoroughly dissapointed. Only good thing, the little amount of food they serve in big plates is tasty.

Last night we had dinner over here.  We had chrispy chicken in starter and in main course we had plain rice with Mutton do paiaza. Chrispy chicken was really good but Mutton do piaza was above average.  Next time I will expect more soft and tender Mutton.  But as a whole food quality and quantity was good.  Although the space available a bit short but still i really liked their interior decoration and ambiance is good too. Services are really good.  So,  the conclusion is that, that i will visit again with more expectations and since its my first visit so i will rate this restaurant "VERY GOOD".

Its truely a hidden gem of South Kolkata. The hospitality is worth a mention. Really easy to locate. The ambience inside the restro is class with a niche bong touch. Coming to the food, we ordered roasted chicken platter which was comprised of 2 pieces of roasted thigh and breast piece with polao, assorted vegetables and French fries and mixed american chop suey. Both of the dishes were really tasty with the chop suey being a bit sweeter than expected. Quantity was wholesome. The place is definitely worth a visit. The prices are quite easy on the pocket.

Energy saver or drainer?

The first thing we were told, theres no AC working and there's no fan. In Calcutta at 1pm, no matter how sunkissed, it is terribly hot. But, they opened the road facing windows. Thank god. Coming to decor, the white couch with comfortable seating, but otherwise very mismatched interior. But, amiable staff behaviour.
Coming to food, stuck to chicken fried rice, which was good in quantity and good in quality, came fresh and hot.
Chicken manchurian, we strictly informed the server to not use garlic and, it was perfectlg customised to our wish. It was not too spicy, small pieces of tender and soft chicken, in sweet and tangy gravy, which didnt have the heavy cornflour taste. Thumbs up for that.
Lastly, we ended our meal with tutti fruity, good number of fruits, chocolate sauce, ice cream. Hard to believe, but one of the best i had in kolkata, so far.
Had ordered brownie with ice cream, but the brownie was stale and the ice cream no where to be seen, so returned back.
The food though was moderate, but the restaurant shows no sign of professionalism, from electricity to proper card payment system, we had faced alot of hassle.

We ordered Pan fried Chicken, Honey Mustard Chicken, KAI PAD PAK & mixed fried rice.They kept number of items limited during puja but quality maintained was absolutely stunning.Pan fried chicken was awesome,Honey Mustard chicken was simply yum. The taste of fried was nice. Special mention for Thai gravy which we liked the most for its authentic taste.

Another addition in Kasba area... Calcutta calling was opened nearly a month ago.

‚óèLocated opposite to the Rajdanga Tribarna sangha club..

‚óèAmbiance and decor was very good... Loved the concept of converted carrom board as a table.

‚óèStaffs were polite and good. Service was fast.

‚óèOrdered Nam Prik Praw Kai which was over burned and too much salty. Pretty disappointed.

‚óèOrdered Butter Garlic chicken with Sechuan Mixed fried rice. Fried rice had enormous quantity. Chicken was good.. 

I would easily gave them 4 star but due to that starter I'm giving 3.5/5

Innovation taken to another level by the team behind this establishment. The nuances of the carrom board tables, the retro telephone set, the aquarium counter, the retro wall fixtures and soothing lighting, not only accentuate the scrumptious food and affable service but give Calcutta Calling a spectrum of uniqueness that the avant garde crowd of today would applaud. Shout out to them.

Tucked away behind a treee, This food joint is a must try for all foodies. Created with lot of passion and thought is clearly evident once one enters the property. The decor is in line with any fine dinning restaurant. The Chef pays attention to your requests and prepares food which is sure to touch your heart. A Non alcohol serving joint where one can easily spend time and the selfie zone is the rightt place to freeze your memory for FB.¬†

Finally all this comes at a very affordable pricing..

Surprisingly amazing food. The thai noodles is a must try. Went there with mediocre expectations. Came out more than satisfied. Reasonable price considering the quality of food they serve. Staff is courteous. Decor is indeed very nice.

Its really have some surprise for you. A cosy place with peaceful ambience. Food is really good in quality and quantity with reasonable price. And most importantly it is prepared by a chef and not some abcd. Spice needs to be toned down in salads for both chick-wantoon and chello kebab, they're hot. ¬†Service is cool. A pleasant feeling that attracts to visit again. Cheers for their effort.

Excellent restaurant with mouth watering multi cuisine delicacies. Uniqueness comes with the Arabian cuisine being served here. Loved the fish recipes, pasta, Arabian cuisine, egg frites, Mocktail and almost everything I tried. Even the peas polao I ate was exceptionally good. Staffs inside are very friendly too. Great ambience inside. Really loved the place and will come back again and again. One of the best place to eat in South Kolkata located around Tribarna Sangha.

D name is very attractive so I wish to go dere.. Nd today is d first visit of mine nd its not too good.. D ambience is awesome specially wen dey greet with the dhakis. Its totally a bengali feeling.. Bt d food is not bengalian.. Dey served chinese north indian arabian nd thai also. For the first tym I ordered chicken meifoon , chicken fried rice nd chicken chilli oyster. D quality is very good , quantity is little low wat I expected .. Overall food is good. Bt only one suggestion dat dey should not serve spicy fried rice.. The rice is bit spicy. Bt overall its good. Am looking forward to try there north indian dishes..
