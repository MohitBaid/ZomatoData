It is a vegetarian restaurant. But there are good number of options. The food served is of good quality and taste. The service is fast. It was quite empty at the lunch hour. The price is on the higher side.

After I crossed a 100 review mark, I received a surprise from Zomato, a 500 meal voucher to this restaurant. Easily located, pure veg, apt for a family dinner. Orderd main course here directly, panner sahi korma was rich and creamy full of cashews, but the vegetable jhalfrezi was top notch, the best part about the dinner.

Was disappointed with bread's though, cheese nan didn't had any cheese and was a bite ripe, same story for Garlic nan couldn't have said to be containing any garlic, the complimentary papad was a delight. Overall an okay experience.

I have made an order for a veg thali form Zomato order no. 20518814 and the food which was received wasn't at all consume able. The dal got mixed with the paneer sabzi and poured through the nan and mix veg mixed with the salad. This is what they provide to their customers and have guts to say that nothing can be done. 
Had a horrible experience ordering form this restaurant.

This restaurant is known to be famous for its thalis but trust us on this, the thalis here are really average! We have had both thalis and ala carte here and hands down the later is much better! 
For thali we tried the special north indian thali and chinese thali! 
North indian thali was good whereas the chinese thali was below average! It was very salty and full of oil!
The ala carte is good and the veggies when ordered separately tastes good!
We also tried the Havanna Punch mocktail which was refreshing but not worth the price they charge for it!
Overall a fairly done restaurant with lots of room for improvement and one can go here for a casual and normal fooding experience! Nothing extraordinary about the place!

Owned by the renowned Ganpati caterers,this place boasts of serving the best north Indian dishes in Park street area. Must try are Sphagetti Cheese rolls, Munchow soup and Ganpati Special. Ambience is nothing to be talked about here. And the service is also good.

Although the ambience and set up is nothing great,  the food quality and taste covers it up. 
From mocktails to starters and the main course, everything is commendable. The service is quick.
Spaghetti cheese balls and the platter deserve a special mention.
Satisfied with the overall experience.

Location-Russel street,opposite teej restaurant.

Om ganpati restaurant is a venture of a very popular caterer "Ganpati caterer".Expectations are ought to be very high and they stood on it quite well.This place serves only vegetarian restaurant with selective cuisines such as north indian,chinese and continental.

Service-The service at this place is quite good.Its reliable and fast.The staff guides you very well in choosing the right dish.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is calm and soothing.The interiors are quite simple and not much decorative but a sense of comfort can be felt at this place.

Food-The food at this place is good but their north indian cuisine is not upto the mark.The presentation is quite regular like any other restaurant.We had-
1:White sauce pasta
2:Vegetable Manchurian balls
3:Noodles
4:Ganpati special platter
5:Chinese bhel
6:Manchow soup
7:Lemon corriander soup
8:Malai kofta
9:Yellow dal tadka
Among them the must try are "Ganpati special platter" and "Manchow soup".

Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-4/5
Food-3.5/5

This place is quite pocket friendly and a good place to visit out with family.üòÅüòÅ

Ganpati Caterers a famous name in Kolkata for Marriage and other social functions...Although the place is very small..Means they cant handle a big customer base in their premises...But the food will make you lick your fingers..Another issue is with the service which is very slow..Now this can add up to customer dissatisfaction..Other than that an awesome destination for foodies.

On my way back from a place nearby came down to this for a quick snack. Located ¬†just on the opposite side of the Gangur sweets this place is just inside ¬†the big gate after crossing that you will get this place in a private premises. '

Tried Pau bhaji and CHola Bhatura as a part of the snack which was made really well. ¬†Serving time was quite swift too. Liked both the dishes and recommended for veg foodies.

I tried this place last week. Its right opposite Gangaur on Russel Street. Very close to the famous puchkawala there. It's located inside a building. Parking is not an issue as there is ample parking space.
Interior wise the place is traditional, and simple. Seating capacity is medium. I had heard about their delivery Thalis and I had particularly gone for checking them out. They are not served at the restaurant though.
I ordered a fresh lime and ordered the Chow Chow Thali and Thali Italiano for the next day. The order could have been placed on phone but since I was already there I ordered in person.

The Thalis arrived on the next day at the designated time.

The Chow Chow thali : It consisted of Hakka Noodles, Fried Rice, Chilli Paneer, Vegetable Manchurian and Ketchup. Quantity wise the thali was sufficient. Taste wise the Chilli Paneer was really good. The Manchurian was slightly saltier than I like, the noodles were really good and the fried rice was nice only it had a strong aroma of butter. The packaging was good.

The Thali Italiano : Penne pasta in mixed sauce, two small slices of garlic bread and a can of soft drink. I chose the mixed sauce Penne . It was so good that I am looking forward to try the other Italian options at the restaurant. The garlic bread was delicious.

I was very happy with the thalis. There is a fixed timing for ordering the Delivery thalis and also a minimum order quantity. So check with them before planning.

The food was really good and value for money. Hope to try the dine in service soon.

I went there with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon after the lunch hours. The place serves north indian cuisine throughout the day. It was quiet and neat. We ordered broccoli pepper soup, American corn pepper salt and a kebab platter for appetizers. The soup was good. American corn pepper salt was again good. The kebab platter had 4 types of kebabs viz dahi kebab, alu kebab, paneer tikka and pudina paneer tikka served with salad and chutney. Kebabs were average, paneer tikka was a bit disappointing. For main course we ordered Tava vegetables, paneer tikka masala, chana masala and malai kofta, all were nice except for paneer tikka masala, that needs mending. The breads were good. Jeera rice was good too. Service was fast. Staff was good. Had a very comfortable dining experience.

Om Ganpati belongs to the stable of Ganpati caterers,who have a great reputation in catering for occasions like weddings and big functions. This restaurant is still not known to many though it has been around for some time now. The ambience isn't anything extraordinary, but  not unpleasant either.The food was quite good. We ordered the starter platter consisting of two types of paneer tikka,dahi kebab and potato kebab. The dahi kebab was very good.For drinks we ordered Mojito and Alphonso Frappe...tastewise both were ok but even in this hot weather they didn't serve the drinks chilled.( We had to ask for ice). The fondue too was average( I've had better elsewhere). In mains the special Rajasthani malai kofta was excellent ( very tasty, flavourful), but the yellow dal was ordinary.The breads were good and I specially loved the pyaj missi roti( this was the hero of the day!!) The service was good.But overall I was a bit disappointed with the food( as I expected much better from the stable of Ganpati Caterers.)

If there is one team, people or entity which knows vegetarian food to the core then it is Om Ganpati from the Ganpati Caterers. They know in and out of all of this and can make the best of all the fooding in vegetarian in Kolkata. They are the number one in catering business here in Kolkata and now here is their own restaurant which gives you a first hand taste of everything good in vegetarian.

From starters to the mains we tried so many things and by the time I write this review I have been here twice already which seldom happens in my case.¬†

The starters were yum, the sizzlers were mind-blowing and the mains north indian food was awesome. Especially the dal makhni and the papad paneer tikka masala in starters were like so good. There was this Potato jacket type starter which is not in the menu but was recommended by the waiter. I do not exactly remember the name but it was beyond words and simply delicious stuff. The food overall is superb and if I did not have any other restaurant to try then I would surely go here again and again.

The service is good. Food takes time but then all good things take time. Even the price is not very expensive. It is a highly recommended eatery by me. A must visit restaurant for all the veggie lovers. Its amazing and it is simply lip-smacking.

Visited here today.
It is one of the best places in town to serve indian food. 
The Ganpati special starter is the most recommended dish. The ambience was as expected and the quality of service they provide is absolutely top notch.

Pure vegetarian restaurant with good north Indian food. We had once ordered sizzler which didn't turn out to be good. Can be visited once. Not a choice for second visit.

Visited the restaurant today for dinner but the experience was awful. Papad normally served by them  as complimentary starters were missing. Ordered 2 vegetables, the food was served with one vegetable. The second one "paneer butter Masala" was rushed when highlighted that 2 vegetables were ordered and the same was Paneer served in milk so watery that it had no signs of properly cooked vegetable. On being highlighted, the same paneer was again cooked and served. 2 Sizzlers did not come with any sizzle either. To add Salt to injury, the credit card machine was not working. Had to go out and search for ATM. Overall a bad experience especially since It was my niece's birthday dinner. My nieces had high expectations but turned out to be a complete dud.

Loved the food, authentication to perfection! Staff are courteous. But the place is a bit dead, when it comes to crowd! No music at all. 
But the name is good just like d food ! :) 
Will be visiting again for satisfactory stomach filling!

Date of visit - 24/02/2016

Location - Just opposite teej/gangaur restaurant at Russell Street

Decor - simple and elegant. Seating arrangement includes both sofas and chairs.

Staff and Service - Staff are well trained and the service is prompt.

Food ordered - 
Brocolli Salt Pepper soup
Om Ganpati kabab platter
Keema vegetable
Shaam savera kofta
Dal makhani
Garlic naan
Masala kulcha
Pudina lacha paratha
Vegetable dum biryani
Fresh lime soda mix

Description- Om ganpati restaurant is a venture of a very popular Caterer in Kolkata. Expectations are ought to be high going there. We were well greeted at entrance and shown the table of our choice. We were then served complimentary roasted papad till the time our orders were getting ready.
Brocolli Salt pepper soup was awesome. Kabab platter which included panner tikka in red and green marination, stuffed aloo and dahi Ke kabab. Dnt like the starter much. Paneer were a bit hard and chewy. Stuffed aloo was not upto the mark. Main course was the hero of the show. Dal makhani, shaam savera kofta and keema vegetables were awesome. Special mention of keema vegetables which were a bit different from regular mix vegetables. The vegetables were sliced in small cuttings. Loved it. Those who love garlic naan, this is the place where u can't miss it. Amazing. Biryani was average. Fresh lime soda was apt. 
Overall an amazing food. Must try place

The Restaurant is located in a small lane opposite to teej. This place is small and ambience also isn't so good but the FOOD makes up for deficiency in all department.
This restaurant serves variety of cuisine - Chinese, Italian, North indian of which following was ordered. 
Appetisers: lemon coriander soup, tomato soup, platter, babycorn. Both the soups were great. I will strongly recommend everyone to order soup and platter. They were mouth watering. Crispy chilli babycorn was very bad.
In main course, dal, corn palak and panner. All the sabjis were equally good . In breads do try rajasthani kulcha and cheese garlic nan.
Overall it was a great experience and I would love to go there again and again :)

Veg only restaurant- around 60 seaters...with nice comfortable seating arrangements...soothing decor & ambience...

Options available from Indian, Continental, Chinese, Mexican...on a-la-carte...

Indian & Chinese Thalis are available on weekdays during lunch between 12-3 PM. 

Tandoori appetisers come with quite a few options - based on Paneer & Aloo mostly...innovations like "Dum Papad Paneer Tikka" & "Ganapati Special Kebab Platter" would be a must try on my next visit üòä

Indian Thali is too filling & suggest you wake up little early the next day to spend an hour extra at the gym to compensate üòâ 
Good that unlike many other eateries, they allow sharing of Thalis...otherwise it's too much for one person with moderate appetite...to have one full thali at one go...

Price point-wise it's moderate considering the location & establishment cost...

Highly recommended...

It is located opposite to Ganguar in Russel Street.
It is a vegeterian Resturant with multi-cusine options however it has more of Indian options. Some starters and baked dishes are there and limited chinese options.
Food is average. Two times I have been and there was a major difference in taste.

Visited this place on 13/04/2016 again.
Most horrible service I have come across!
We were in big group and so there were two tables..one table was ordering food limited to itself other bigger table was ordering for people there. After 30 minutes no soup was served on bigger table. When we called the waiter what was the matter to our shock he says soup was already served and we had it!! What!!! We had our soup and didn't realise it and there were no bowls to prove us that we had. Two waiter started to fight with us and when manager was called he said it might be true. That was one great service! 
Please make this resturant for 4 only if you can't manage the groups.

Located on Russel Street, the place commands a great location. The staff memebers were courtseous. Had ordered a sizzler but was no very impressed. It had a burnt smell and the chips seemed to be the forzen one available. Have however, always enjoyed food by Ganpati on their catering assignments, so hope that they have some good dishes in their menu. The Sizzler was perhaps a bad choice!

A pure veg restaurant in park street area which is very difficult to get. Located opposite to Teej restaurant in Russel Street, One of their biggest plus points is they have a huge parking space so you need not worry about parking. Now coming to food they serve good vegetarian cuisines. You also have the option of ordering food without onion and garlic which is a huge plus point for few vegetarians. The portions are ok nothing to boast about. The only drawback i felt was that whatever items we ordered were on a sweeter side even though we had specifically told the staff that we prefer spicy food. The restaurant is about 30 seater so be prepared to wait for about 30 to 45 minutes on weekends.

Location: Opposite Teej/Gangaur restaurants.

Om Ganapati has been one of the most heard of brands on the lines of catering and has been amongst the best caterers of Kolkata. Having said that, it is presumed that the quality of their offer is top notch and is undoubtedly delicious. Om Ganapati finally opened up a restaurant at Russell Street and since, they are among the best caterers in town, the level of expectations from their restaurant would equally be high amongst the customers. The restaurant had been on my bucket list for a long time and was finally struck off on the ...

The AMBIANCE, is quite simple and non-descript with wallpapers around and sofas/chairs as seating to their cloth-covered tables. The capacity would approximately be around forty heads.

About the FOOD, the menu on offer had widespread options across multiple cuisines (included North Indian, Continental) of which the following was ordered:

‚Ä¢ Ganpati Special Platter
The platter comprised of four components namely, 
- Achari Paneer Tikka: The chewy cottage cheese cubes were well-marinated, tandoored at a high temperature and tasted just about decent.

- Hariyali Paneer Tikka: The paneer (was chewy) as well as the marination failed to impress. Was low on seasoning and the flavors failed to bloom. Needs improvement.

- Bharwan Aloo: Parboiled and scooped potatoes filled with a sweet dry fruit filling, topped with cheese, baked and served. The filling had a weird aftertaste and wasn't as great as expected. Have had much better ones. Needs and has a huge scope of improvement.

- Vegetable Seekh Kebab: The best out of the lot, nicely skewered vegetable mish-mash with spot on seasoning. Tasted great.

The platter, overall just about average, was served along with mint chutney and a seasoned mix of beet root & onions which were good to taste and complimented well.

‚Ä¢ Veg Au Gratin
The gratin was delicious with the right balance of B√©chamel sauce and chopped veggies & pineapple topped with a generous amount of cheese and served with two complimentary garlic breads.
The toasted breads did taste decent along.
Recommended.

‚Ä¢ Cola Float
Generous amount of Vanilla Ice-Cream blitz with Cola and served. Tasted great.
Recommended.

The SERVICE was prompt by the polite and friendly STAFF.
PRICES are slightly inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall was a near average experience.
‚Ä¢ Plus 0.5 for the amazing Gratin.
- Yet to try the remaining fare, comments due.

Pure Veg restaurant with no onion no garlic jain dishes gave an option to us to try here... Small place but perfect for a family gathering..
Starter platter with four different varieties including ¬†paneer tikka, hariyalli paneer, kabab, stuffed potato was a good option.. Veg au gratin was another dish not to miss here.. among curries dal , Dum aloo, palak corn, paneer all were properly prepared and up to the mark along with the breads.. Even thali is also a good option if few ppl wana have diff variety all together...
Yes, malai kofta were not as we liked to have as in a big kofta with stuffings.. here small pakodi types kofta were served which was not at all good....¬†
Hyderabadi Biryani was also delicious..
Quantity and quality wise it can give competition to many other restaurants along with price very much reasonable... Definitely a must try place...

Edit review :-  Not sure why Om Ganpati still doesn't accept credit / Debit cards yet in this era of digitalisation.  I am sure they must have lost a lot of business for this step of theirs. At least from my organisation itself they lose so many orders just because they don't accept cards. And we have to buy from Ganugaur , only because they accept cards ... reducing one mark for this 




I wonder why om ganpati does not have a close to 4 rating. Its too good. The thali they serve is far better than the one u get at gangaur. 
 Overall the food is too good. Ambience is kinda average and location is good.

When we entered the restaurant around 9 pm it was totally empty neways we settled down and ordered for food we ordered for Hot & Sour soup, Sweet corn soup along with that chilly mushroom dry . The soups were average to taste but the Chilli Mushroom was yumm. After that for Dinner we order Veg Hakka Noodles & Manchurian gravy which was again okay okay to taste. Price is not expensive & pocket friendly. over all a ok dinner thats it . But I would like to know if this restaurant is HRAEI affiliated or not ??

Delicious food, superfast service ( the first dish arrived within 4 minutes of ordering), impressive manners- the waiters were always around when you needed them and cosy ambience-all of this at peak hour. I couldn't have been more impressed. It was a good end after a tiring day of pujo. First experience here and I'm sure to come back again. The 15 minute wait was definitely worth it.

Awesome food no doubt, Ganpati shined his name. But the place is too small, not enough place to accommodate many people!!

Om Ganpati is currently one of the best pure-veg restaurants in Kolkata offering very good food at reasonable prices.I had a lot of starters out of which the Ganpat sizzler,gratin,babycorn,schezwan fried rice and pasta.Do not try the corn soup.The service is fast and the quantity is good and it is approximately 300 per head if you only go for starters.

The moment we see this place or talk about it we just can't stop laughing. Reason? Well, mainly it's the nachos they serve. 
It's more like nimki (just more fried & on the verge of being burnt). The moment it arrived we were like... What the f?!
Anyway, the salsa was okayish. 

I packed home the thali for my mom and it was an utter disappointment too. The gulab jamun was as hard as a stone and the rest of the food wasn't up to the mark too. In fact she left the food halfway. 

The ambience and the service: the ambience isn't good. It's just very average. The tables are so closely placed and the waiters aren't courteous too. 
In fact on one of the visit the manager and my dad also had an argument over some trivial matter and the manager wouldn't just own up his fault!

A strict no from me for this place.

There are certain restaurants whose location often goes unnoticed amidst the swarm of its glamorous counterparts. Om Ganpati Restaurant definitely fits the bill. Located within the Queens Mansion compound, Om Ganpati Restaurant is a must-visit for all you vegetarians out there who are looking for a diverse platter of veggie food in a modest amount. Start with a fresh-lime soad that promises to bid adieu to your stress after a scorching summer afternoon. It is garnished with cherry and the quantity will leave you calm and contended. I tried out there malai kofta which exudes a sweet taste and great for trying out masala kulcha. The onion kulcha is feathery soft and goes well when savoured with paneer butter masala and dal makhhni. For desserts I would recommend you to bet on pineapple raita: It‚Äôs healthy and concocted with the right amount of ingredients. However, it‚Äôs not just Indian cuisine; you can also go for Chinese, Mexican and Italian cuisine.
They bestow kada papad as their complimentary food item. Sounds amazing, isn‚Äôt it? My only wish is that they should expand their dessert section.
So next time when you are passing through Park Street with your BFFs, try out the smartly priced, mouth-watering, cornucopia of vegetarian dishes at Om Ganpati Restaurant.

Good veg. food! Don't expect exquisite dishes but yes regular dishes not at all disappointing. Angry birds, Crispy chilli babycorn and Tandoori pyazi missi roti must try. Its weekend!, and you don't want getting harassed in queues at popular restros across city then head to this place. One drawback- staff is not upto the mark though the service is fast.
USP - Reservation over phone also available. Parking facilty at the heart of parkstreet with ample space. :)

Nice ambience. It's catering is really famous for functions and the restaurant maintains the name. Worth the expense. I love the Mongolian out here. Had ordered angry birds which is different and worth the wait for the starter. The presentation and service is good. However the waiters hover too much over the table. Coming to the food. This place is a must try for sizzler lovers. The paneer steak sizzler was well cooked.in north Indian food tawa sabzi is a must try although not mentioned in the menu. Also the pyaaz missi roti was a different try. Adds something's ng new to the regular north Indian food. The best was the Mongolian sauce served along with the sizzler. A place to go with family especially when someone is particular about pure veg restaurants.

To my dismay chinese wasn't available!!!! So I guess the first step made a negative impression!!! Although I ordered Indian, paneer butter masala was good to taste bt black dal.. Yuhhhhh was over salted ... Masala Kulcha uncooked!!! D menu doesn't have a varied range of items...like no variety in desserts!! Averagely priced... Overall avg... Can still work upon n do better!!!

Very very disappointing experience. Food and service was very bad. There was excessive salt in the black dal and the kofta was frozen solid. At the same price I would prefer other restaurants.
