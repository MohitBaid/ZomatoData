Amazing homely food. Must try in Kolkata. Best dishes are mutton thali and fish thali. Hands down one of the best home eateries in the city. Also pocket friendly.

I come to know about curry pot from internet search. Very nice, less spicy and genuine food at an average cost, particularly north indian food. Service also very good.

Curry pot serves real tasty and delicious food with mouthwatering smell. Yesterday I ordered for 1 plate of Veg Indian thali item and a special dish of mutton vindaloo. It was luscious. The most liking part is that they deliver food on time. Thanx curry pot for making my day so special. I would like to order food from curry pot over and again.

We recently had a get together at our place!!! And we all were pretty confused regarding the food coz we had a pretty short budget yet we were hungry as famine afflicted people.... and guess wat who came to our rescue....
CURRY POT....
One of my friend @debojyoti sen suggested me about this home delivery joint...... 
We ordered chinese meal......
And trust me the authentic fresh ingredients... tasty masalas and ofcourse some tastefully made food won all our hearts.... 
Give it a try guys... and i am pretty sure u wont b disappointed for the money value u are about to experience.... 
P.S. TRY OUT THEIR LUNCH MEAL...
I PREFER CHIKEN MEAL COZ ITS SO TASTY AND FILLING.... KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!

Me and my roommate order food from Curry Pot regularly. They serve real good food at an affordable rate. Their service is really good. If you want home cooked food which is equally delicious and affordable go for Curry Pot, Naktala.
