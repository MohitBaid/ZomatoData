Extremely disappointing experience!! My order was delivered after 2 hours!! But, the worst part was that they changed my order without even informing me!! I had ordered for Chocolate Passion (that I have loved for over 10 years), and they delivered some cupcake!! When I called them to complain, the response was "Both are the same"!!!!! Does anybody do such a thing!!! It is the craziest response I have got - in my 52 years of life on earth!!! I have been a Taaja's fan since their small outlet in Ballygunge....But, now, I swear never to order from them!!! Very upsetting!!!

A couple of friends and I had gone for lunch at this place when it had a different location, tucked away in a lane between Dhakuria and Selimpur. We initially ordered apple coolers which were very soothing. For the main course, we decided to choose the Spanish paella (basically a lightly fried rice dish with chicken and prawn); it tasted delectable. We went for Mutton Shepherd’s Pie as a side dish, which consisted of mined mutton and mashed potatoes...it was very filling. During the course of our lunch, we also glimpsed the eponymous hostess Bibi Sarkar herself who had come to the dining area to make arrangements for some programme scheduled later in the day.

Ordered some food from here yesterday for dinner. The expectation was really high as the items mentioned there were very unique and one of a kind. I had ordered the following things -
Paella - The Spanish version of Pulao made with chicken, sausages, bacon and prawn. Quantity was humongous. I had ordered for one portion and that came in two separate foil packs. The quantity of prawn was less. One pack hardly contained any and the second one had only two. This thing must be checked. The rice tasted good along with other components in it.
Chicken in Creole Sauce - Being a Linguistics student, this definitely caught my attention. Even the lady on the phone suggested that this would go really well with the Paella. There were very small ten dices of chicken. The gravy was customised to a mildly spicy version as I requested her to do so. Still I didn't like the flavour of it very much. A foil of a yogurt or raita was served along with. That just didn't taste good at all. I started burping as soon as I had a spoon of it.
Overall experience was average. Firstly, the pricing is very high. These two items charged us 970 bucks with 100 bucks inclusive as delivery charge from Lake Gardens to Ranikuthi. Can you imagine? Packaging was okayish just like five other para shops.
At last, I would like to conclude that this place is okay for trying once. But it is so expensive and the standard of food is just average. Hence it is just not worth the expense. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

Came to know about this home delivery joint though reviews in Zomato.Ordered spanish rice as main course which was very delicious - rice tossed with veggies, bacon, pork and boiled prawns. In the starter ordered seasme fish which tasted good. The portions are good compared to the rates.

A homely place with homely continental food. The finesse is lacking but the dishes are okay. It is now a delivery only place and it is difficult for people staying far away to get delivery from here.

This place initially came up with a restaurant which was shut down and now they  cater to their customers via Home delivery. The price is bit on the higher side, however the quantity of 1 plate can serve 2 hungry souls. My picks from this place are Spicy Tangy Thai soup, chicken Spanish paella,  and Burmese khaw swey.

Love the Spanish Paella with bacon, sausage, chicken and prawn here. The price seems high, but considering the amount is enough for two, it is reasonable. Also the Burmese Khau Swey here is great. Only regret is they have closed down their restaurant and it is now delivery only.

We have never been disappointed by Bibi of Taaja's. Always served with a lot of warmth and awesome food. Undoubtedly one of the best food joints in Kolkata. We miss the restaurant though. Hope to see a new one open soon
