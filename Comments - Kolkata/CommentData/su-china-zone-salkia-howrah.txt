I have ordered food from this place. 
This place is located  just in front of great eastern. 
This is a very small restraunt that sells Chinese  food. 
We ordered Hakka noodles and chilli chicken. 
The food was really tasty but spicy. 
Overall, it is a pocket friendly  place with good food in Salkia.

The place is a regular restaurant little higher than roadside stalls offers some sitting place. The food is ok there are many better restaurants in the area.

Inspite of being a fast food joint...  It definitely matches the level of a proper restaurant...  Best chinese in Salkia.. Pocket friendly as well...

Well this is an average place... Quality wise its ok-ok types.... As far as quantity is concerned,  one plate of fried rice is enough to stuff tummy for two... 
Food looked munchy & promising... but it failed to fulfill the expectations as far as taste is concerned.

Those who are watching this i guess most of them are from salkia, watevr lets come to the business. Its a joint near my house, make some authentic chinese food but cost a bit high, i appreciate the food quality but some more tasty dishes are there in other restaurant cost less than this.. Sitting arrangement is too awefull, i prefer home taking. The dry chilli chicken i tried last time was not upto the mark.

It's a nice restaurant.  Good nominal priceing of food. Quality of food is also good. Every time I walked in to the restaurant there is been a smile on the owners face. The restaurant plays oldies music which all the more make u feel good

Haha! Didn't know this was on Zomato. Very near to my house. Opposite to Great Eastern showroom right on GT road. 
They have improved the interiors over time. Very well behaved staff.
Coming to the food, their Chicken drumstick and chicken pakoda is very good. Go for the Fried rice as they end up making the noodles too oily. Szechwan chicken is not a bad try. In Salkia, there are only 3 options among chinese-this, Janata Jalpan (which is multicuisine) and China Town (which is deteriorating day by day)

Location and Description: At the Salkia road near the Salkia Bazar. A street food outlet on the go. This place keeps some variety to offer you.

Ambiance and staff: Ambience is not too big. Its a small outlet with less space, 3-4 tables for grabs. Ordinary walls paints with no ceiling fan above, They have table fans for you. Place was neat and clean with wash basin too available. Â Staffs are fine and sound.

Food: The food here has some variety for you as they deal in Chineses Items specially. We ordered Gravy chicken chow for our quick bites. in 15 mins the dish arrived in the plate, very hot and the hotness can be felt over the gravy. Chow was moderate in size and carried some taste. The gravy above was quite well made as it increased the taste. Overall the chow was not too bad, was eatable.

QNQ and Prices: Quality was average and quantity was good. One chow can be divided into two people. Prices are fine as per the rates of other outlets.

Conclusion: A very simple outlet with some variety and suggestive dishes according to your needs. An unplanned visit here is fine.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and Experience to this place.
