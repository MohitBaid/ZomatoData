In my childhood days it was one of those resturents my parents took me, after years today I went there with my family and I was really disappointed with the huge degradation of food quality and staffs were not even courteous. We ordered fish finger, it came with French fries on the top and it was not at all good! Next came chilli baby corn and I experienced the worst chilli baby corn there..cheese kulcha was ok but only if it was hot and chiken Bharta was eat able but mutton korma was the worst thing we ever tried! It was not at all a good experience. .and will never visit this place again..NEVER!

Cons. 
Poor hospitality. 
Place looks unhygienic and smells. 
Staff isn't well behaved. 
They don't have desert. 

The only good thing about this place is that you get food at a dirt cheap price. Only Mixed fried rice is good here. Rest is pretty average.

One of the better places in howrah. It was a go to restaurant during my childhood days. Love their fried rice and chilli chicken. Even their biryani and chicken kosha is good. Their paneer butter masala is outstanding. One of the best I've ever had.

This has been my go-to place since I was in high school. It's a humble place best suited for a quick bite. The food is good which is why people flock around the place on weekends. Wish it was a little more spacious and it would be great if the entire restaurant was air-conditioned.

Food is no doubt tasteful. A large variety of foods is available. Often gets crowded and takes 30mins on an average to serve food. Price is reasonable as per quality and quantity. One of the best and oldest restaurants of Howrah. On weekends, you can see long queue of people waiting for their parcels.

One of the most popular restaurants in Howrah. Being a Howrah resident, I'm aware of it's popularity. But the quality of food has deteriorated recently and has disappointed many of its regular customers. The seating is also not very impressive and hasn't been improved since forever inspite of having a regular flow of customers. One of the most famous restaurants of Howrah, losing it's name in recent times.

Used to visit this place often in the year 2014. At least once a week. Nothing has changed much though. Although the restaurant is a bit short on area but the service is good. The American Chopsuey of this place is quite nice. I would also recommend that every one should try the Chinese Chicken Roast of this place. The Mixed fried rice and Special fried rice of this place is also good. However ask them to serve you the mixed fried rice without the chicken liver. Addition of chicken Liver totally spoils the taste of the dish. Another drawback of the place is that they do not have any desert menu. Not even ice creams. They serve soft drinks though. Well it is good to visit this place if your budget is low and you live in the Kadamtala Locality for a casual dinner some days.

I have been eating here since the day it opened in kadamtala either at the restuarant or by taking their food at home. But trust me its not the same anymore it used to be. Nowadays the quality is really very bad, specially whenever I eat the food from here i feel sick sometimes vomit too. I have stop eating their food for past 10 months. Still sometimes my maternal uncle brings their food at home and i don't know why kids love it though they are ill for next two or three days after having their food. Yes their food is pocket friendly but for me hygiene does matters than pocket friendly. Their kitchen is so so dirty that once you get to look inside trust me you will never order here again. I hate their food and will never recommend anyone to try their food. Its still open just because of cheap food available here but I would say health first than cheap food.

Kichukkhan is very reputed restaurant in my area. My family is their customer for many years. In every small home party or get together we generally order food from this restaurant.. We were happy with their food quality. But recently they are serving very bad quality foods.. About 2 months ago I bought mutton korma. It was the worst ever mutton dish I hv tasted yet. But as I stated earlier we are their old customers, we thought it must be a mistake of 1 day. Then 1 month ago I ordered 4 chill chicken when my friends came to my home..  That day their cooking was awful.. Salt was almost missing in that dish.. Cornflour was too much.. We had to waste the whole dishes.. I don't go to that restaurant any more.

Kichukhon is one of the best restaurant we have in Howrah. Pricing is very pocket friendly and food quality is just more than wow. Every dish is very very tasty and quantity of any dish is also good. After having food from this place you will never have any problems with the stomach even so acidity or heavy feelings. Sitting arrangement is very limited only in this section they lacks. It's best for take away. If you want to verify that is this restaurant is really good or not you just need to be there after 8.30pm any day. You will be able to see the crowd.

It is one of the oldest restaurants in this area of the town. Known for its cheap rates and substantial quantity and defined quality, it has stood out to be the favourite of most people dwelling in this area. The taste of food is exceptionally good. However Chinese dishes lack the identical taste. Indian food is what one should try here.
The must tries are : smoked chicken kebab,  prawn pakoda, chicken baby corn, fish roll and fish begum bahar

Restaurant is good, my home is just opposite of this restaurant so occasionally we used to take parcels from there. It was all good but suddenly today I realised a thing that they are not giving bills. As I ordered some foods the amount also more than 500 I asked for bill. They are saying I have to give 14.5% vat then they will give the bill. What the hell is this? Its not like foods are cheap here and everyday they have huge sell but it seems they are not paying proper tax for this they are not giving bills and cheating our goverment and country . Hence I request everyone if you are visiting this restaurant ask for bill and dont help them to cheat our country.

This is a very old Restro in Howrah, in between Kadamtala & Ichapur, Earlier, I like their Food, specially their Chili Chicken, Chowmin, Fish Begam Bahar, Fish Mandarin, but they didn't upgrade themselves, I mean to say they didn't introduced new menu in their list. Now a days their tests(Items) seems monotonous. Quantity wise their Plate is very good in a very reasonable price.

Well,kichukhhon is an old heritage place according to me.It started when I was in primary school and till now they have maintained exact same  wonderful taste  :) and same small place -_- I think they should revamp it a little bit! 
Now come to the food , it's nice.My fav is mixed fried rice and reshmi butter chicken masala which has 6 piece tandoori chicken balls in it.I love their chilli fish and rumali roti.Biriyani too is decent! One thing is bad that they don't have that food delivery system .But,instead of all flaws they are the crowd puller in this area. But revamping a little bit won't hurt them.We'll just feel extra happy :)

They make amazing smoked chicken. Onion kulcha is a must try there. My favourite: chicken thigh fried rice with prawn malaikari.
Go, give a try!

It's a very old and renowned restaurant of Howrah..
since my child I've been hearing of this place, but unfortunately never been before...
a few days ago finally came here for lunch...

the entire area is less specious.. but they managed the space very well..
they arranged 3 different seating area withing the small premises..
one AC, one Non AC and one underground (Non AC)..

the staffs are good and friendly.. but they don't accept Card payment..

food quality is very good..
all items are very tasty..
I specially liked their "Special Fried Rice" very much.. it's combination of Indian & Chinese flavor..
with lots of ingredients.. Chicken - Prawn - Massroom - Egg - Chicken liver chunks etc..

overall it's not that luxurious  but good place for foodies...

Kichhukhon is a restuarant not for the people who love decor or ambience...the food quality is good not great....however there are certain dishes like the chicken reshmi butter masala which will make you want to come back...

The place z a bit outskirt for people from different locations to locate. The local people do have idea & it z one the popular restuarant of a time. Been their quite often cz of Chinese food. The taste z awesome & so the crowd. It z a rush place to visit overflowing with families,friend groups & many more. During Puja one have to stnd quite long for food. It z the best in Howrah circle & has carried off its charm still now. Chilly chicken & chowmein drags the attention cz it is yummilicious & so z the quantity. Apart from that they do serve moghlai dishes from kebabs to biryani. N even veg items. Bengali crowd z more seen here. If some1 mentions this place do try. U will come back for sure

this is located near ichapur water tank(the name of the stopaage)..probably one  of the famous restro in nearby areas..since its near my house my dad always takes rolls,fried rice,chilli paneer from their takeaway outlet..but to b honest i dnt like their food...chilli paneer is ok..but omg the fried rice...i remenber the last time we ordered it was partially cooked... they do have a dine in section but thats too small n wd no good interiors....the prices are on lower side..the quantity they provide is enough..but quality smtimes is not taken care of..

We have being visit kichhukshan from long time...the food tastes fine. But service needs a lot improvement. It the same as it used to be 20yrs ago...no change!!! 
It can be improved a lot and that can pull more customers..

This place is not an ideal restaurant to sit and have food because the interiors are clumsy and and dingy but i would mark it as the best place to get take away food. 
Their masala Khulcha is probably the best in the state. It is a Jumbo khulcha which comes with hearty fillings of kaju and kishmish along with others. Shahi paneer is another recommendable item.
I wouldn't suggest chinese from this place.

I don't have any complaints against the taste of the food, but they surely need to make it more hygienic. Apart from that, the people who sit at the takeaway counter need to improve their public relations. They become really grumpy at times during the rush hours and doesn't respond properly.

A very old restaurant of the town. Food was very good, but slowly the quality has fallen. Chinese items are good. Try fish begam bahar with fried rice.

This is one of the famous restaurant in Howrah. Their one of the famous dish is fish begam bahar. I went there last night, I order one fish begam bahar, chicken Manchurian, chicken bharta and one egg rice and paratha. The quantity and quality is good. One plate is is sufficient for two. I always prefer  parcel.

We cousins went there to celebrate bhaifota. But seeing the overall structure i was really not interested to order anything. In spite of my inner feeling we ordered chicken tandoori. It was just ok. But i seriously dont recommend to go there.

When you want to eat eat n eat a lot, this is a perfect place to drop in. Kichhukshan never fails you with its quantity. Though that does not effect the quality. The kababs are awesome and my personal favorite is their Singapore mixed Fried Rice. The chicken dishes are heavenly for the chicken lovers. The only negative part is the long waiting after you ordered your food. Drop in an eat.

If you reside in Howrah this is a must visit restaurant. Food here is delicious specially Chinese and kababs. Being a regular customer of this restaurant I can say that not even for once I have seen a dip in the quality of food they serve.
