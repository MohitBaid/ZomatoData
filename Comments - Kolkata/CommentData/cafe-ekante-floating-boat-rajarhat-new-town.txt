The ambience itself is a winner. Location and ssurrounding gives you a very romantic and lively feeling. 
This is majorly for the Chinese food in eco park. 
The food was decent. Nothing great. 

We ordered basa fish in black bean sauce, fried chicken fingers with homemade tartare dip, chicken halls noodles , kung pao chicken, and Thai red curry. 

The basa was hard, rubbery, which is very unlikely to happen. Chicken fingers and noodles were fine. 
Thai curry was pretty good. Didn't expect it to be so. 

You must visit once at least for the lively location. It would be worth.

Today I went to this place with a special person. Beautiful setup. Stuffs are very polite. Service is not very quick but trust me, you are not going to feel irritated. Perfect romantic place to spend time with your beloved person. 
Ordered Hot and Sour Chicken soup, Anglo Fish and Chips and Singapore Chicken noodles. Food is decent.

The food is expensive compare to the portion they provide, and also the service is very slow. Won't recommend it to anyone. They serve Chinese inside the boat whereas outside the lawn they serve Indian which is way better.

An amazing place to spend a romantic evening with your partner, hangout with friends and even spend a wonderful evening with your family. The place had a simple homely decor and the food was quite fresh but according to quantity it is a bit costly. I loved the place in whole and I would suggest all the foodies out there to try this place atleast once. :)

lets start with the little good feature of the restaurant.i had coffee(latte) and dub er shorbot from there.coffee was extremely good and the ambiance of the restaurant was pleasing.
dub er shorbot was like chilled water with a bit of sugar syrup and dub flavour..extremely bad in taste
the things there are extremely overpriced and they took 30-35 mintues to make a cup of coffee..
the boat ride go there is in front of gate 2 beside the cafe akante jetty joint and its free....if you go there after 4 pm u will only get coffee,tea,dub er shorbot and a few niramish amish fried dishes like beguni different types o chops.people are waiting for hours for a single plate of fries is unnecessary and monotonous.
i wanted eagerly to go for the continental dishes inside the floating big boat..extremely beautifully decorated but they dnt serve before 6 pm...the first photo in the photo section of zomato is fake i guess or either that boat is not available now.there is no such white and blue huge boat there..
last not the least the restaurant is posh and well decorated with old photographs of few eminent peraonalities like mamata banerjee,manna dey etc

One of the most romantic restaurants in Kolkata. The ambiance is just amazing. It is situated at the island in Eco Park, Kolkata. Cafe Ekante provides free boat rides from its waterside counter to the restaurant. The prices of the food are a bit high. But the ambiance does the make up of the prices. And the service should be more professional. Otherwise, its a very romantic place to spend an afternoon with your valentine ekante. :')

A place to be which is far away from the madding crowd! Just at a glance, its admirable beauty will sooth your heart! Great view, nicely decorated interiors, good ambience and commendable food! Although had a few, in the main course which was a lamb dish,  mutton chops and dessert! The food quantity and and quality is good as per the price, won't pinch your pocket that much, those dishes which I had surely was an eye treat some of the pics are given below. The service has to be improved than what I experienced, it took quite a lot of time for the items to reach the table, might be because of not too many people are engaged in the restaurant!
A nice place to enjoy good times with your family or friends and also to enjoy the scenic beauty out there!

The entire idea of sipping and eating while you sit on a floating boat is amazing! But in order to keep the audience's attention apart from the ambience you must also have some good food to offer. I think these guys need major improvement here. We opted for the conti dishes only to be disappointed. We instead went back to the known bengali and Indian dishes,way better in comparison. The ambience during pujas was amazing!

The ambiance is just awesome. We went for a family dinner and truly the location and the environment may bring me back to this place once again. 

But the food, I think if we call this boat restaurant a continental style restaurant then I am sorry, they should revisit their items that they serve. It was really disappointing to see the food that they server. 

We ordered gandharaj chicken kebab but the gandharaj flavor was completely missing(is this continental ??). 

We ordered Cafe Ekante special platter and as per the menu card, the item looked like a chelo kebab but actually it turned out to be a non veg mean with rice, poached egg, chicken curry, mutton kassa, fish (some roll) with salad and papad. 

We ordered fish fillet stuffed with prawn served with rice and seasonal veggies. All we got is rice, boiled vegetables, a very spicy with gravy fish item(could not identify any flavor of the stuffing).

Lets call this an indian restaurant, my rating would have been 3.5 but for a customer looking for continental food, I am sorry but this was truly not the mark.

However, the nolen gurer ice cream at the end did all the damage control.

Visited this place after hearing about its beautiful ambience. Waterside cafe is a new thing in the city. It's a boat shaped restaurant built on the lake that comprises the Eco Park in Newtown. The restaurant has both indoor air conditioned seating arrangement as well as open air seating on the deck. Dining in the open air deck on a pleasant weather while enjoying the waterside breeze will surely be a lovely experience.
Coming to the food, I feel they should increase their menu size. Having tried most of the major dishes in their menu I see no reason to eat here again. Sitting here with just a cup of coffee would be quite an expensive affair. We ordered fish, chicken and lamb varieties in their menu and were quite impressed with the tenderness of the lamb. Though the chicken preparations seemed a bit under cooked.
Will surely visit this place again if they increase the variety in their menu 😊

The ambience of the place is out of the world. Surrounded by water body one feels charmed and entwined by the moonlight. The food is also good.

Pros - Good food and perfect place for romance.

Cons - Expensive.

Visited this place last saturday with a friend, its location and view are its biggest advantages. The view ,in fact,was so beautiful that we chose to sit on the deck than the airconditioned inner part. Its all wooden ,and shaped like a boat,which gave a 'bojra' like feel.. 
Coming to the food, we ordered lamb stroganoff ,and ekante platter comprising of kasundi chicken,mutton,fish ,poached egg and butter rice!! Lamb stroganoff was also accompanied by herbed rice. Both the platters were equally tasty and then came the mocktails. Though coffee toffee mocktail was bad, the mocktail with pineapple and mango was awesome (apologies forforgetting the name!!).
Service isnt that great though, I had to repeatedly ask them to serve us regular water,which they brought after the main course was served!! Not done!! Jope they do something about it... all in all a different and enthralling experience :-)
