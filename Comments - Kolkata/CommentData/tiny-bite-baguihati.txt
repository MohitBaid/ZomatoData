One of the yummiest melt-in-the-mouth chocolate cakes that I've had! Thanks to Tiny Bite for making our anniversary so special :) The best part is that the cakes are egg-less / vegetarian hence appropriate for parties when you are not sure about your guests' food preferences. They also customise as per order :) #late review

They have amazing cakes and chocolates. Must try place. The best part is that they have so much variety of eggless cake. A must for a lot of vegetarians. Good job.

Hi Rashmi...firstly thanks a million for such a lovely cake on such short notice.
Let me tell u guys, i ordered for a truffle cake at 10pm at night...coz i went searching places for a non creamy cake...finally i came across Tiny Bite
I got the cake at 11am next morning...n unbelievable effort...
Wat im really happy about is this baker is really passionate about her cooking...n it really shows wen a piece of her art (cake) touches ur mouth...pure chocolate in generous amount...and yummyyyyylicious.
Tiny Bite...keep up to ur quality and passion for baking....cheers...u made my day..thanks.
