Sad for review. I never gave such a review to somewhat good persons. Its all about what u deserve and what u think.... the rolls are not in a position to gain serious price . Its all about its market

This is located inside the food court of Mani Square. I found this place quite expensive although the rolls that they served was tasty. They have a wide variety too.

The best way to understand whats the best any restaurant can offer is to order the most simple item on menu. That's what I did. I ordered a basic aloo roll @ Rs 45 / - (Rs 53 thanks to 18% gst)

They roll came up in 5 mins and it was better than I expected. The potatoes had right mix of spices, Pudina chutney, onions, cucumber and capsicum. Nothing unnecessary. No drippy fluorescent sauces, no oil dripped wrapping sheet, no extra dose of super hot chillies. Just right...perfect.Â 

The ingredients were fresh and hygienic. Next time I will go up the ladder. They have rolls ranging to 200/ - Rs plus also.

This is a part of the foodcourt in Mani Square.....Among many Combo options we went for the Chicken-Chicken Combo,which included Chicken Malai Tikka Kabab, Chicken Tikka Gravy and Lachchha Paratha.....It was one of the best meals that we have had in a foodcourt ..... The quality and quantity of the meal was good and the price was also reasonable....
