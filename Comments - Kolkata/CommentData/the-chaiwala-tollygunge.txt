This tiny cosy cafe is situated near the Indrapuri Studio,Tollygunje...about 10 mins walking distance from the metro. It was my first visit for a coffee date.It has a cute and nice decor and not-too-loud music. 
We had a hot chocolate, an oh-oreo mini scooper and a grilled chicken burger. I lovvvedd the hot chocolate!!! It gave a soothing effect on my sore throat üòÇ The oh-oreo scooper was good but at the bottom of the ice-cream  there were some crushed Oreos which did not go well after the yummified ice. The grilled chicken burger was crunchy and fresh. The plating was sober. The price of the burger is overhyped thoughüò£ 
The bill was Rs 420 included tax.

This is a little hidden gem in tollygunge located at just  5min walking distance from the metro station. The wooden decor and its perfect ambience makes it a wonderful cozy place to hangout. This one is different and its a must try.

We ordered vanilla latte, hazelnut latte, chocolate cheese grilled sandwich and ham cheese waffled sandwich. The sandwiches were hot and yumm. The dishes were served well. Even the staff was quite friendly.

Went there on last Sunday.It's a small cafe situated in Tollygaunje and is quite easy to find. The ambience is really nice and so is the decor. The staffs are polite. Coming to the food, We ordered cafe mocha, soy honey chicken wings, cold chicken salad. And for desert we ordered a choco walnut pot cake. The pot cake was really good. Loved the chicken wings too. Overall the food was good and it's a nice place to hangout with your friends.

Its one of those few restaurants where you are served what you see on the menu and the way you see it. Yes it's as good as it looks, they are well made and really very reasonable considering the quantity they serve, unlike few other places. Great to hang out with friends, their taste in music too is amazing. 
Easily one of the best, in their categories. 
One will not be disappointed that easily.

It is a small little place which is situated at about a 5 minute walk from the Tollygunge metro station. It boasts of a variety of flavours of tea and coffee. It's a great hangout place for giving adda for long hours. However we were very hungry and therefore we decided to have something else than beverages. We wanted to have the bacon tornado but where informed that any bacon products where not available that day. So we opted for the double decker chicken burger and with that we had American hot wings. The quantity and quality of the food was up to the mark. And I would definitely recommend this place for a second visit. The waiters are very courteous and the service first prompt. There was also an outdoor seating arrangement but since it was winter, we didn't opt for it.

Visiting this place for quite a few times now and the more I go to this place the more I love it. It's situated in a very quiet and peaceful corner, cut all the jazz of the city have some chat with your gang or with your beloved ones. The food is awesome,have tried Soya honey chicken wings, Oreo frappe, and fries. All of them were proved to be good. The best thing about this place is it won't bite your pocketüòÇ which is very important for a college goer like me. 
The ambience is great, the decor is eye catching (although I'm not quite a person who's admirer of art and craft,but yes the wow factor is there, certainly). The waiters were very friendly making the whole atmosphere very homely.
And did I mention that if your gang are into smoking they have an outdoor sitting as well? But good luck with catching those seats.
The place isn't much big, and getting attention day by day,so if you're going in the weekend you may have to wait for some time,but have my words,the wait is worthy.üòâ

The Chaiwala remains listed as my All time favorite.

Decor - Supercool and fancy. Cosy and comfortable. Dim lights and great music. I've been there more than once  and I'm quite sure now that they go by the saying, "There's always room for improvement." Their nest becomes more fantastic with every visit.

Food - Soy Honey Chicken Wings: Now this is something that I would label as 'Finger lickin' good' instead of KFC. The aroma of garlic sauce took me to a heavenly trance and the honey flavor will never leave me tastebuds alone anymore. The chicken is lick-aliciously amazing. Tender and juicy, sweet and spicy.

Drinks - Well, I've tried Dementer's Kiss and Kiwi Mojito. Both were okayish. I still have to find that perfect beverage of this place.

Dessert - Sinful Nutella Pancakes: Unfortunately, I tried this at home by ordering it via Swiggy. I always like deserts freshly prepared but my brother insisted on ordering this. We had this after the Soy Honey Chicken Wings. The pancakes were soft and I really enjoyed it. However, I expected more Nutella and less syrup. I expect they'd give me more Nutella next time.

P.S. I'm a shameless chocolate lover.

4. Fried Bacon
5. Soy-honey wings
6. Lemon Garlic Shrimp Spagetti 
7. Bacon Tornado burger.

The food is absolutely delicious. (5/5 ) Totally worth it!

I have been there once for their signature chais which had been quite good an experience with some good sandwiches for accompaniment. But recently I had ordered food online via Swiggy and it was disastrous. Ordered for 1 Tomato Corn Sandwich(Rs 110), 1 Cheese Mushroom n Onion sandwich(Rs 140) and one Chilly Cheese Chicken Spaghetti Pasta in Mixed Sauce. The pasta was extremely dry with very little cheese and wasn't properly cooked. The pieces of chicken in it were also quite chewy with very less seasoning. The Cheese Corn Sandwich was okay, nothing great. The Mushroom sandwich was more of onion than Mushroom in it which made the entire experience disappointing. I was chargrd Rs 470 for these 3, out of which the pasta was rs 230, too overpriced for the quality and quantity it entailed. Please work on both quality and quantity to make sure you retain your loyal customers. Expecting better food next time. Thank you.

Visited 'The Chaiwala' today. Tasty food. Decent ambiance. Burgers were good but I still prefer 'My Big Fat Belly' for burgers. The bottles used for water were really cool and looked more like a fruit champagne bottle which made me a bit confused at the start. Overall, a decent visit and I was really starving so I enjoyed the meal.

A very small chai den hidden in a corner of Tollygunge. A chai-lover has all of his/her choices fulfilled. Unlike that, we had Cheese Jalapeno Waffles and Pot Cake with ice-cream. The waffles were nice and warm with the curry. The pot cake was huge, not too sweet but dry since the ice-cream was not proportionate.

Just a few minutes walking distance away from tollygaunge metro.  This place has a great ambience ,but is not so spacious.  The interior of the place is quite pretty. 

We ordered - 1. Bacon tornado 
2. oh oreo ice - cream
1.  Bacon tornado was good  and it's appeal did stay with me for quite long.  It was enough juicy and cheesy for me to crave for more.  
2 Oh oreo ice - It was well presented, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream accompanied chocolate serum and oreo biscuit.  The taste well was satisfactory.

This place is just a few minutes walking distance from the tollygune metro station. Known to be serving amazing food and comparitevly cheap ,this has always been there in my bucket list and finally today(24th December) I could tick this off. Well coming to the food, I ordered one regular cappuccino and one regular latte. The latte was okay for me but the cappuccino in a huge cup was so soothing to have on a wintry evening. Next up on the list was trying their pastas, so I ordered one chicken white sauce penne pasta. This dish looked so colourful with those red and yellow bell pepper pooping out of the white sauce. I enjoyed digging into that. Next to end up my pre Christmas venture, I had to eat something Chocolaty and since I forever swear by brownie so I think the Choco walnut pot cake. Now much to my surprise , it was quite a lot in quantity. The dessert was the best thing for me. The place gives you some good vibes and is quite spacious. Totally worth another visit. üòä

Tucked peacefully in the lanes of Tollygunge at Graham's Land, The Chaiwala offers an extensive array of sumptuous dishes and cozy ambience. The decor is simple yet eye catching with bar counter for shakes , refreshers and nibbles at one end. Waiters are friendly and welcoming. The Chaiwala is also known for hosting small gigs, stand up comedies and musical performances occassionally. The dishes ordered were penne pasta in cheese sauce with chicken, grilled chicken burger and choco walnut potcake with ice cream.

PENNE PASTA IN CHEESE SAUCE: It was a plate full of cheesy goodness. Both the chicken and pasta were cooked perfectly and the veggies in the dish added the right amount of Colour and crunch to the rich cheese sauce.

GRILLED CHICKEN BURGER: The burger was accompanied with french fries and and tomato sauce. The patty of the burger was seared beautifully with a layer of gooey cheese on top and was of appropriate proportion compared to the overall size of the burger. The French fries were also perfect crispy exterior with soft interior.

CHOCO WALNUT CAKE: This cake was the winner among all three. The cake was baked in a huge pot with rich chocolate flavour and bits of walnut in every bite. The cake was topped with two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. The ice cream and the cake together was a match made in heaven.

RATING:
Ambience- 4/5
Staff- 4.5/5
Food- 5/5

The total bill including tax came to INR577.75 for two .

I went to this place for the 2nd time today.
The ambience was great and the staff were quite friendly. 
Coming to the food, we ordered 
Grilled chicken burger, soy honey chicken wings and one dark desire miniscoop.
The soy honey wings were good enough but since I like spicy food it's appeal didn't last long for me. But be ready to become a caveman while eating this.
The burger.... my god! It was the tastiest burger I have had in quite a time. It was juicy, cheesy, the chicken Grilled perfectly. I just really really loved it.
The dessert was fine with chocolate ice cream, choco chips and a but of brownie at bottom.
Loved it.

It is a tiny place located near Tollygunge metro station.  The ambience of the place is good.  This place is ideal for small groups of 4-5 people. The service here is quick.  Coming to the food we ordered Veggie Delight Burger,  Grilled Chicken Burger, Cold Chicken Salad, Nutella Pancake. 
The burgers were good and were served  with French Fries. The chicken salad had a grilled chicken patty later on the top and beneath it was the salad.  
The best part was the Nutella Pancake.  Served with cold ice-cream on the top, the Nutella between the pancake stack was awesome. 
Overall a good place to spend some time with your gang.

A place that is absolutely meant for coffee dates, or typical adda. 
I went to The Chaiwala with a friend of mine, and we had ordered Chicken Nuggets, Double Decker Chicken Burger, Cheese Sauce Chicken Pasta and lastly Chocolate Walnut Pot Cake topped with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream. 
The ambience is beautiful. The wooden furniture attracts a lot. The lighting is a bit dim though, but makes you feel very comfortable. The staff's great and the service time is not very long. The music played here is great. This place is only full of good vibes and home feels. 
Coming back to how amazing the food was. 
The burger. The cheese was oozing out of it and I love that. The chicken patty was cooked really well and the French fries were fried perfectly. 
The nuggets were delicious. Crunchy coating on the outside and absolutely juicy on the inside. 
The pasta was really delicious too. The amount of cream and cheese added to the pasta was generous and you'd want more of it, to be honest. It is that good. 
Lastly, the Pot cake. That stole the show. 
Cold ice cream, hot cake with chocolate sauce all over it, with crunchy walnuts. That is a complete tornado of flavours inside your mouth. 
Great place. Pocket friendly. Lovely location. 
Worth a visit.

The chaiwala grabbed my attention because it is one of those rare cafes in Kolkata which conducts open mic comedy. However I've not yet attented one on friday evening, I attended it during day a few days back. The cafe is located near Tollygunge metro, and one can definitely take help from Google maps to reach there. I and my friends tried some dishes at the place which included the famous pot cake with ice cream and pancakes and the pasta. All the dishes tasted good, and special vibes are there for the ambience. Being a small cafe it provides a very cozy and welcoming vibe.

Nutella burst pancake, which is something I'd never tried before. The soft pancake coated with nutella and chocolate and topped by a scoop of icecream is going to make you fall in love with it and crave for more! #recommended
Next is another recommended dish, the soy honey chicken wings which is a flavourful combination of sweetness and spices. Finger licking good!
Lastly we have cheesy chicken sandwich which is none the less yummy.
Definitely worth the visit!

Ordered chicken burger and chicken wings after hearing a lot about this place but couldn't drop by.

The burger was juicy and the patty had the right amount of moisture. Cheese and vegetables were good. Nothing fancy but huw a burger should be. Fries were also good. Got a bit damp while it was packed, i guess. Missed the mayo with the fries.
The wings were a total hit. Full piece wings coated with yummy sauce. Most places cuts the wing into tro pieces, but this place serves it whole to my delight. So all pieces were equal. A huge thumbs up for that.

Great food and hoping to visit the place soon.

Visited this place last Sunday for dinner. We ordered the double decker chicken burger , bacon tornado burger and the honey bbq wings. The food just made us go crazy. One of the best burgers in town. Totally loved the wings too. Ambience is cost and staff is well mannered too. Will definitely visit again

It's a small cafe not difficult to locate and at a walkable distance from tolly metro stn, usually crowded but my friend was lucky to get a table free for us. Cosy pocket Friendly place (1500 for 3) for a casual hangout, they play good music but was a little loud, however lowered the volume when requested. Coming to food I must say that the portions are good as per price, dessert is a must here- their chocolate walnut pot cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is a blend of a perfectly baked chocolate cake and ice cream. Also liked their soy-honey chicken wings though I felt it would taste better had it been less sweet. We had cheesy chicken sandwich, grilled chicken burger and veg white sauce penne pasta n all of these were good but nothing new or outstanding. Coming to the beverages, we had dementor's kiss (a tangy n spicy drink) although a good invention but I could smell chilli powder so it turned me off :( while I loved their fresh lime soda n non-virgin mojito. Would like to visit again to have their cold salads and other burgers.

It is a really pretty cafe and you can surely go if you need to have a conversation in peace. They don't rush you to order. We ordered Ham and Cheese burger and it was really one of a kind in terms of presentation though the taste was quite ordinary. But the 'chai' was unparalleled and will totally make your winter evening.Will definitely go back for the tea.

Among the best Burgers in town, Chaiwala is a complete package with great coffee, chai (obviously), and some nice desserts as well.
The grilled chicken burger and the bacon tornado are amazing.

The ambience is also nice with a contemporary cafe feel. Service is quick and clean. 

Would love to visit again

An okay place. Easy on the pockets. Food is average. Good for quick get-togethers with friends. The Nutella Burst Pancake was kind of a saving grace. The Soy Honey Wings were overdone and a little bitter, and had a weird sticky, tarry consistency with very little meat on the bones. The burgers were okayish but the ham was a little smelly in one of them. The fries on the side were good, though. Good for a one time visit, maybe.

A really nice Cafe but what really irritated us  was the stand up comedy going on there. The comedians were making lamest of the jokes and they were really offensive. A group of people walked out of the cafe because of the comedians. We were the only customers in the end and we had to forcibly laugh on their sick jokes. A beautiful evening turned into an irritating experience. Btw, the place is nice and so is the food.

I have been going to Chaiwala ever since it first opened. It's the closest cafe to my house and I always end up going here everything I crave for "Cheesy Chicken Pasta", "Chocolate Mini Scooper" and " Butterscotch Brownies" . These are absolutely must haves. I have tried their "Mushroom Sandwich" which is perfect . Their "Cold Chicken Salad" , "Chocolate Pot Cake" and "Grilled Cakes" are so so , but quite filling. Their "Grilled Chicken Burger" and "Buffalo Wings" are also a must have . I don't fancy their shakes or drinks .

This cafe is quite vibrant and is a cute little place high on presentation . This used to be a very pocket friendly joint when they first opened , but ever since their renovation prices have gone up. I feel they should bring down their prices to the previous level to have frequent customers and also work on their shakes. I will be visiting them again to try the new items on their menu .

Other than this their staff is very very friendly . A big plus. No wonder they have happy customers all year round .

Went to this place after going through suggestions in Zomato about this Cafe. Absolutely , Not Worth 4.4 . Had the worst experience in terms of hospitality and food . I cannot even say that the only good thing in here was water , even the glass of water had mosquito in it.
Just wondering ,how did this place managed to get 4 plus rating. This is absolutely misleading. Apart from the sandwich , the pasta and the Burger were all very sore. Though the mojito was good. The return on investment is worst one can think of. It's a nay-nay place for me.

Very close to the Tollygunge metro station (Mahanayak Uttam Kumar metro station), The Chaiwala is located in one of the by lanes. It's a small cozy place with minimalistic decor. I loved the use of space, not too crammed up.
So for food we ordered some french fries, a Double decker grilled chicken burger and a spicy cheese chicken sandwich. Mind you that the burgers come with a side of French fries so we kinda got overloaded with fries :P. The portion sizes are more than enough and so reasonable according to their prices. Me and my friend had decided to order more food later but clearly these three items were more than enough to fill our bellies. The burgers were so amazing that I actually took one of their famous burgers, The bacon tornado, to go. Even though it got a little soggy by the time I came home, it was delicious. I never expected them to be so good that too at this price. Kudos to The Chaiwala team. Will be there soon to try the rest of the menu.

Neither the food nor the service is upto the mark. I visited this place with high expectations after seeing a 4.4 rating but it has really disappointed me. Firstly they poured us a glass of water with a mosquito floating on it and didn't even apologize properly for it. We ordered a chicken sandwich and cheese sauce penne and a grilled chicken burger. I found the sandwich tasty only and the pasta being too bland. The staff wasn't courteous enough therefore I wouldn't visit this place anytime soon.

Was on my bucket list for such a long time to figure out why this is so popular. Located in Graham's Land, this place is conveniently close to Tollygunge metro. It's a nicely decorated cafe with a small area of outdoor seating. It has good lighting and nice wooden benches giving a very classic English eatery vibe. 
We ordered:
A chocolate smoothie- It tasted really good.
A Dementor's Kiss- This is an innovative drink which the HP fanatic in me had to try. It is very unlike the usual mild refreshing beverages that we have. It's base is cranberry juice and was quite spicy. Interesting choice.
A chicken white sauce pasta- This one deserves to be talked about. Loaded with chicken and veggies, this tasted absolutely heavenly. One can return to this place just for this.
A Honey soy sauce chicken wing- This dish is supposed to be their speciality. Undoubtedly it tasted extremely well and was a good contrast to the pasta. Only problem is it took a lot of time to get served. 

Overall the quality of food is very good. Not too heavy on the pocket either. Service is quite gokd as well. Thumbs up.

Whenever I am craving for good food and a place to hangout....Chaiwala is the perfect destination.
Located at a very convenient place in Tollygunge and with cool ambience.¬†
Taste of food is great and reasonable enough to fit in the pocket.
I am not that tea person but please do try their teas....
I have tried only non-veg food there and their sandwiches, salads, burgers and pastas are quite filling.
I loved their Cold Chicken Salad!!!

The loopholes in this place is their sweet content in the food and their service.
Lime soda (sweet and salt) is too much sweet
Choco walnut pot cake is again very sweet and one scoop of vanilla ice cream is not enough to balance the taste
At times, the honey content on Chicken wings is more¬†And they need to work on their service, which is real slow

Its sort of a hidden gem! A small roadside cafe with pretty interiors and really good food! The cold chicken salad is pretty good. The burgers are amazing. The grilled chicken, double decker chicken burger and bacon tornado are my favourites. Also the pasta is very well prepared here and the soy-honey chicken wings made to my goto list for the next time. I have come here already a number of times and would definitely love to hop in again soon. The only problem is it has a bit of space crunch and you might have to wait if you don't drop by early but the food  pretty much makes up for it. I liked their service too.
Overall its certainly a place you would want to visit more than once.

Although a little cramped for room the decor and ambience is nice. Food is also good.  The omlette comes in a bread base which is uniqe. We ordered 3 chicken omlettes,one peperoni omlette and two sunrise burgers with one ginger lemon tea. Pinch was Rs. 1000 odd inclusive of gst. Quantity Sufficient for 4 people. Price, needless to say leans more towards the expensive side.

I honestly like the food here along with the ambiance.It's a cozy place in tollygaunge.This cafe is unique with its sense of decorations and servicing is also good.We ordered tangi chicken burger and chocolate pot cake.Burgers are really very good here than most if the cafes I been to. I think the pot cake was really heavy but if ice cream put into it much larger scale then I hope it will taste better as we wasted half of it cause of it's heavy base.Anyways,a nice cozy hangout place.I hope it could be little larger.Overall a pocket budget place. Try it out if you still haven't. You will not regret it :)

The Chaiwala is probably the best place for a friendly hangout. Located in Graham's Road, Tollygunge this cute cafe has made foodies of our city throng here. 
The cafe has a limited space but it is well utilized. The seating has been well arranged with wooden furniture. The ambiance is very soothing. 

Coming to the food we ordered:

Grilled Chicken Burger - This burger comes with a chicken patty tucked inside two buns. The patty was well seasoned and succulent and was dressed in a barbecue sauce. It came along French Fries but was served with only tomato sauce. No other dip was available. 

Chicken White Sauce Penne- The pasta was well cooked and came along a mixed sauce. The taste of the pasta was authentic and it was cheesy too. The pasta had good chicken chunks. And I love my pasta that way only! 

Soy-Honey Chicken Wings - I was a little disappointed with the chicken wings as it tasted too sweet. Would have improved the taste a little. 

Non-Virgin Mojito- The only drink that we ordered there. It was fresh and very refreshing. 

Staffs are courteous over there. Pocket pinch is not much too. Perfect for hanging out. Also they really have some good and trendy options. 

That's it.

The food is like straight out of heaven, the chicken is perfect, tender and juicy. The wings is a must, so is the iced tea. The staff is friendly and very courteous. The interiors are lovely, especially after they expanded. The double chicken patty burger is something you NEED to have when you go there. 
The place has great quantity and is very affordable. 
They have a table outside, where you can sit and enjoy the calm weather and the peace of the place.
Would definitely recommend it to others.

ordered grilled chicken burger, hotdog burger, chocolate smoothie and oh oreo ice cream (not sure abt the name)
grilled chicken burger was a bit sour for my taste.. due to the grill sauce they use (my friend liked it)..
chocolate smoothie was nothing too great.. won't recommend it to someone.. 
but the oreo ice cream was on the mark...

Kolkata has a dearth of good eateries and the Chaiwala has come as a blessing to it's residents, all credited to the vibe and casual ambience. I recently made a visit to unearth the treasures that this place claims to behold.

I started off with gorging on the Chicken Double Decker Burger and Regular Latte. The former had the tagline, ' Double Patty, Double Cheese, Double Fun' which turned out to be quite true and this was a hit. The Latte was tasty along with a wonderful texture on top making it presentable.

I headed towards Cheese Grilled Sandwich‚Äã which came along with crispy french fries and tomato sauce which made it taste absolutely great!

The Soy Honey Chicken Wings turned out to be a gem of a dish with it's unique and authentic taste. The Chicken was soft and the wings were tasty too which made it one of my favourite dishes over here. The French Fries which I ordered separately was good too.

The Non- Virgin Mojito, the Lemon iced tea and the Berry Float which I went for was fantastic. Rejuvinating and refreshing, this is a stress buster with cooling properties. Really loved the drinks.

The Bacon Spaghetti which I ordered was a dish worth remembrance. It was so awesome that it left me craving for more and more.

The place is your next door cafe and has an inventive menu with a lot of trendy dishes too. Head here for a fun filled casual evening with your friends and folks!

The food is like straight out of heaven, the chicken is perfect, tender and juicy. The wings is a must, so is the iced tea. The staff is friendly and very courteous. The interiors are lovely, especially after they expanded. The double chicken patty burger is something you NEED to have when you go there. 
The place has great quantity and is very affordable. 
They have a table outside, where you can sit and enjoy the calm weather and the peace of the place.
Would definitely recommend it to others.

Nice place but a little small... 
Feels very congested...  
stuffs are very friendly...  
ordered grilled chicken burger, hotdog burger, chocolate smoothie and oh oreo ice cream (not sure abt the name)
grilled chicken burger was a bit sour for my taste.. due to the grill sauce they use (my friend liked it)..
chocolate smoothie was nothing too great.. won't recommend it to someone.. 
but the oreo ice cream was on the mark...

Kolkata has a dearth of good eateries and the Chaiwala has come as a blessing to it's residents, all credited to the vibe and casual ambience. I recently made a visit to unearth the treasures that this place claims to behold.

The Chaiwala- this small cafe has become quite a famous name in the city and why not they certainly living up to the hype and good will.¬†

**Location**
Located at Grahams road. From Tollygaunge metro station take 6 no. route towards the Garia.
Its on the left hand side just near the Grahams Kitchen.

**Experience**
A small cafe with intelligent decor I would say.Using the small space to ¬†the fullest this place has both inside and outside sitting options. We fortunately got a place quickly within 5 mins of arrival otherwise on pick timings mostly it stays full and you need to wait.

Now the most import part.. "Food"..How is the food??
Well I have tried 3 types of dishes here.. and a drink..¬†

Soy Honey Chicken wings: I would say its a must try dish consisting big 4 pieces of juicy chicken wings which is absolutely the best appetizer option according to me. Next was the Burger the famous Bacon Tornado which was big and filled with bacon and juicy ingredients inside.. Loved it!! Only suggestion was with the bread they are using can be upgraded.
¬†Next was the pasta which was served in mixed sauce this was decent. Cheesy but the taste could have been improved. ¬†Tried the lemon ice tea and it was quite refreshing as well.
All in all a good place and extra points added for the pricing which is really a value for money deal.

Very small joint with limited space, however the space is well utilised nd the ambiance turned out to be great. Outside sitting arrangements are also done gracefully. The crowd is young nd one can have a galla time with pals with delicious food. Parking is a bit problematic or else this joint is nice place to venture.  We ordered double decker chicken burger,  chili garlic spaghetti , chocolate walnut potcake with ice cream nd drinks. Every dish was great nd we thoroughly enjoyed our food.

Location : This place is situated at just 4min (walking) away from Tollygunge (Mahanayak Uttam Kumar) metro station. Quite convenient and quite place.

Exterior, Interior & Ambience : From the outside it looks small and little funky/cool.
It's basically a old Kolkata house turned into restaurant/cafe, it reminds me about The Steak Factory a little but the interior and decoration is far more superior here! Quite Nice!
The ambience is which is one of the best things here. Only one downside I'd say it's a bit small place so if there are so many people when you will be here it'll feel a bit congested. When I went it was almost empty, so it felt quite nice.

Food : Ordered ---
Bloody Ocean--> It was quite refreshing, sweet and tasted like blueberry. Really nice.
Dementor's Kiss--> This mocktail is one of the coolest mocktails I've ever had. Unlike anything it was spicey!!! I mean really spicey, kinda some tangy & spicey water! Just amazing! Loved it! **If you don't like spicey food do not order it.
Double Decker Grilled Chicken Burger--> This burger! It looks just out of the world when you'll be served, beautiful! Now if I say about its taste unfortunately it's less nicer to eat than it looks! Nothing bad, the thing is everything was perfect but I felt the chicken patties here were grilled but I felt those were a bit overgrilled. It didn't taste bad to be very honest but a bit more burn-ish taste than normal grill tastes. This is the only minor bug with this particular burger.
Ham, Egg & Chicken Baked burger--> This is the complete opposite of the last burger I mentioned (Double Decker Grilled Chicken). It looks decent. Neither outstanding, nor poor. Just looks like a simple burger bun as whole as its top portion sliced aside and topped with a fried egg and fried onions.When you give it a bite! Lord!!! It's one of a kind! The cheese, egg yolk & Slices of ham slashed into into your mouth which gives an heavenly taste. It's creamy, not spicey and very delicious. Try it if you haven't already.

Service : Servicemen were polite, gentle and nice to help with. Cool.

Concluded Verdict : I was planning from an year to go to this place but finally when did I was a bit Skeptical but it turned out to be really marvelous! Specially in foods. And experienced something new, that is whatever looks good sometimes they aren't as good as something which doesn't look that good. A great experience though. Looking forward to come again! :)

Located in the lane next to Indrapuri Studio, the cafe has a cosy look and feel with wooden benches and chairs. We ordered Smoked Pork and Bacon sandwich, Nutella Burst pancake, Berry Berry Vanilla icecream scooper, hazelnut latte and Caramel Frappe. The items were average in taste. The sandwich was scant in meat stuffing and grilling it with the bread sides made it hard. They take an easy way by serving  it with tomato ketchup in an era when dips are getting interesting day by day. The pancake came in numerous layers and is sufficient for atleast four people. The berry berry vanilla had the lump of strawberry jelly and I believe it could be marginalized somehow. And why jelly? That should be my first question...why not atleast strawberry syrup that would not need cutting  through the lumps. The other two drinks were average. 
Sadly the place they seated us was near a window AC which did not seem to function, and made no difference even after they adjusted the temperature once we made them aware.
All in all not a great experience, it might be just a casual tea sipping joint and rather better to expect not much.

A good place for people craving for different kinds of meat. Bacon tornado burger and the pork pepperoni sandwich was delicious. The French fries with the burger was too tasty and crispy. Fresh lime soda was perfect to wash it down. Though I would say I was a bit let down by the chaiwala special. And also nice decor and good service.

Love the ambience of this place. It's quirky and cozy and has a feel good effect. The Chaiwala can easily be your favorite hangout destination. They offer a huge array of decent beverages at a rather reasonable price and that's one of the better things about this place. 
The menu is pretty lucrative with things like bacon tornado burger and waffle sandwiches. I tried the bacon tornado and rightfully to its fame, it's awesome. The patty is juicy and beautifully seasoned, the bacon greasy and smoky. It was one hella good experience eating that burger. We had also ordered the mixed sauce pasta and this was however, a downer. The sauce was too spicy and the pasta a little soggy. 
Thumbs up to the service team for prompt and friendly service, would definitely come back for the chicken wings and waffle sandwiches!

Though we went during the durga pujas , the place was still crowded and we had to wait, not for long though. 
A perfect destination to spend the evening with your friends. 
It is a small place and large groups might have to wait for sometime. But, not for long. Trust me, the waiting is worth it.
I have been there multiple times and the food is amazing out there. Each and every item. 
Be it any beverage or starters or burgers/sandwiches, everything tastes great.
The prices are pocket friendly too.
Enjoy!

Foods ordered here:
Grilled chicken burger with fries : a succulent patty of grilled chicken was put inside the two halves of bread with barbeque sauce. French fries were served with a ketchup dip. It would have been better if you serve it with mayo or Algerian or frites dip.

Chicken White Sauce Penne : Pasta well cooked in white sauce with good amount of veggies and chunks of chicken. Tastewise it was perfect! Good in quantity and quality too.

Earl Grey Tea : How is it possible to not have a cup of tea in "The Chaiwala" ? Then it would have been injustice to the name given. Once you order any flavour of tea from the Exotic variety , you will be provided with a free refil! 

Must visit !

Recently visited The Chaiwala. The cafe is a 5 minute walk from Tollygunj metro. Though the space is small but it is well organised . It was Pujo time so the embellishments really made the ambience much more attractive. We took a chicken grilled burger and cappuccino. The Burger was quite good and the cappuccino was okayish. On my prior visits I have tried their soy honey chicken wings which is amazing and smoked pork and bacon sandwich which was not upto the mark. It was very dry. I also tried their kiwi mojito which is okayish and their Chaiwala special and Darjeeling tea which is nothing extraordinary.
The service and behaviour of the staff was impressive and that definitely adds to the pros of this cafe. The rates were reasonable. If you are looking for a budget date or a place for adda with your friends then you must not miss this option.

The menu is illustrious and varied and you get some real good food there. Pricing is moderate. I'd highly recommend the desserts and the burgers. Avoid the sandwiches!

Veg items are very less but they are decent. The veg burger was above average, pasta was average,  fresh lime soda was very refreshing, i would not recommend waffles as they were not that good.chaiwala's chai is very expensive and i can make a better tea than that. Grilled sandwiches were very simple and expensive not worth the pirce. All items are not value for money.

A nice place to chill with your friends. Loved their ginger honey tea and soy - honey chicken wings ! 

Located near tollygunje metro station, adjacent to Graham's land ,. The chaiwala can be a stress buster post office/ work for people who would like to enjoy some alone time with a cup of tea / coffee ( ginger honey tea in my case) . The wooden interiors add a special touch to the place. 

Overall a nice place to unwind during weekends.

The old Bengali adage " CHA ER ADDA " totally reflects the ambiance of this place. The best part is the live performances held here by the talented celebrities .Nothing beats the combination of superb music and brewing hot coffee .
 It's a cafe where they offer a vast array of beverages, ice cream, confectioneries, fast food etc. It is located at a 10 minutes walk from tollygunge metro station. Just take road towards Garia and you will find Chaiwala in the second lane to the left of NSC Bose road. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and polite.
The only downer is if  you call a staff they will respond at least after 15 minutes because the number of staff is less compared to the number of customer being catered to. This place is almost crowded all the time. Just a year old this place has already been creating a lot of buzz.

A very famous cafe in tollygunge. This cafe is some what in between the Tolly metro and the Malancha theatre. Enter the Graham's Land lane. You'll get to see the name on a board. It'll fall on your left hand side. It is a small cafe with a decent seating area. Has one table for outdoor seating. Since, it was raining, we decided to go inside.

The decor is lovely, with wooden chairs and tables. The music was peppy. The place was half full. I heard that it's normally jam packed. The crowd was pouring in the later hours. I felt the table we we're provided was too small. Nevertheless, we settled and ordered their lemon ice tea, soy honey chicken wings and the vanilla pot cake.
The staff was quite friendly and was all smiles. The lemon iced tea was nice and refreshing. The soy honey wings came on a plate with four chicken wings. They provided us with small rectangular shaped plates. It was difficult to eat on such small plates. Also, I didn't find the soy honey wings which was their house speciality, impressive. It was just too sweet for me. The chicken was however properly cooked. It was soft and tasted fresh. 
What really impressed me was their vanilla pot cake. It was delicious. They usually make the batter in a bowl and put it in the oven and bake the batter, then they serve it with a dollop of ice cream on top with chocolate sauce for decoration. The cake was fresh and not too sweet. It had walnuts. It was soft, spongy and hot. The ice cream added the sweetness required for it to become a dessert. If you're coming here do try their pot cakes.

Sigh. What a disappointment this place was. It was highly rated on zomato and being a coffee lover I HAD to try this place but almost everything i tried here fell flat. Their "special" chai was way too creamy for my liking and wasnt really special since it was really just a thick cardamom tea. The coffee was, well not worth even talking about. I tried the 'krunchies' as was suggested by the barista, and it was just not great. they flatten an entire burger bread and top it up with chicken/corn. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone. The interiors, however, have been done well and it does look like a nice place to sit into since they offer free wifi. I just wish they took their teas and coffees more seriously.

This was my very first visit to the chaiwala. I'm a bit disappointed with the quality of the food they serve. The choco walnut pot cake that we ordered was very dry and not upto the mark. Apart from that, cheese chicken sandwich and snow white were okayish. 
Coming to the decor, the interior was great. I liked the lighting, sitting arrangements and music. Ambience was soothing. Maybe I'll visit the place again to try other dishes.

A very famous cafe in tollygunge. This cafe is some what in between the Tolly metro and the Malancha theatre. Enter the Graham's Land lane. You'll get to see the name on a board. It'll fall on your left hand side. It is a small cafe with a decent seating area. Has one table for outdoor seating. Since, it was raining, we decided to go inside.

The decor is lovely, with wooden chairs and tables. The music was peppy. The place was half full. I heard that it's normally jam packed. The crowd was pouring in the later hours. I felt the table we we're provided was too small. Nevertheless, we settled and ordered their lemon ice tea, soy honey chicken wings and the vanilla pot cake.
The staff was quite friendly and was all smiles. The lemon iced tea was nice and refreshing. The soy honey wings came on a plate with four chicken wings. They provided us with small rectangular shaped plates. It was difficult to eat on such small plates. Also, I didn't find the soy honey wings which was their house speciality, impressive. It was just too sweet for me. The chicken was however properly cooked. It was soft and tasted fresh. 
What really impressed me was their vanilla pot cake. It was delicious. They usually make the batter in a bowl and put it in the oven and bake the batter, then they serve it with a dollop of ice cream on top with chocolate sauce for decoration. The cake was fresh and not too sweet. It had walnuts. It was soft, spongy and hot. The ice cream added the sweetness required for it to become a dessert. If you're coming here do try their pot cakes.

The best place to hop in if you are in a mood to talk for hours with great food... Amazing ambience.. Very cozy and peaceful... The food is beyond praise... According to me, this Cafe serves the best burger in the city.. The pasta is tasty to its core... The cold coffee is unimaginably good... The French fries over here has an authentic taste... The host is very friendly and might suggest you some of the delicacies which you won't regret...

Been here quite a few times. Good place for adda. A small cafe but quite light on the pocket. Perfect for last minute planned adda sessions.Their mocktails are just wow! Love Dementor's Kiss! Do try their burgers as well the one with Bacon is more than enough to keep your stomach busy for half of the day.

Sigh. What a disappointment this place was. It was highly rated on zomato and being a coffee lover I HAD to try this place but almost everything i tried here fell flat. Their "special" chai was way too creamy for my liking and wasnt really special since it was really just a thick cardamom tea. The coffee was, well not worth even talking about. I tried the 'krunchies' as was suggested by the barista, and it was just not great. they flatten an entire burger bread and top it up with chicken/corn. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone. The interiors, however, have been done well and it does look like a nice place to sit into since they offer free wifi. I just wish they took their teas and coffees more seriously.

This was my very first visit to the chaiwala. I'm a bit disappointed with the quality of the food they serve. The choco walnut pot cake that we ordered was very dry and not upto the mark. Apart from that, cheese chicken sandwich and snow white were okayish. 
Coming to the decor, the interior was great. I liked the lighting, sitting arrangements and music. Ambience was soothing. Maybe I'll visit the place again to try other dishes.

Recently visited the place and had grown a special attachment to its "simplicity at its best" presentation.
The interior is elegantly decorated , one which attracts as well as soothes the eye. We ordered two burgers - Bacon Tornado Burger , Grilled Chicken Burger and a desert to satisfy the sweet tooth urge - Chocolate Walnut Pot Cake. All the dishes were delicious to the taste buds as well as filling enough for a person. The desert might as well serve for two.
The service is reliable. Will definitely be worth another visit.

Located near the tollygounge metro station, the cafe is all set up with a retro look.The wooden furniture and the rock music gave me a relief from my weekday burdens as I visited this on one Saturday, 
Pics- Classic tea in bhaar with biscuit
Chicken burger with cheese slice and veggies
French fries with tomato sauce.
Potato garlic cheese balls
Blueberry and strawberry cold milk shake
Chocolate carmalleo expresso
 Well even the amount they give in one plate is enough for three people, 
Still I felt the price was a bit more.

The name chaiwala just goes with our Indian bong cultural style. A small cafe but I am sure people will enjoy their meal over here. My favorites were stir fried honey chicken and walnut pot cake. They were spellbound in taste,just soooo yummy. The captured pictures of all the Indian small concepts and decor just made me feel I was sitting in a modern Indo style cafe.

In one word, the chaiwala is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Starting from the staffs to the stuffs, everything is exquisite. 
I tried their pot cakes which are like out of the world delicacies and they are just around Rs.150 each.
Then coming to the grilled chicken burger, its one of the best i ever had.
Last but not the least, the people who work over there.
No doubt cordial and the service they provide wont ever let you leave a negative remark.
I will always come back to this place, not once, not twice but over and over again and i recommend everyone to visit this place, so that my words about the description, fall short of , and you can really feel how good are they.
Thank you. :-)

If you are looking for a cosy parlour to spend hours with your family and friends seeping coffee with delicacies, this is certainly your place... The burger served here is perhaps the best...The pasta is also delicious... Cold coffees come with several variations and you may try any of them without hesitation... Since the name is chaiwala the 'chai' has to be authentic... The owner is friendly who will suggest you with their specialties... The cafe is attached with a boutique which will further enamour you... The ambience, the service and most importantly the food are mesmerising... A must try one

Never expected a cafe to be so exciting...with awsome ambience and decoration. The concept is great and nicely executed in such a constricted space. You definitely need to rush to get a seat here cause its definitely a crowd grabber. The staff is also very jolly and adds to the sense of the typical chaiwala feeling. Food is great over here with the continental touch greatly done with all the items. Definitely would prefer the delicious sandwiches... Guyz definitely must visit for one who is in tollygung and want to grab a quick bite on a sandwich with some adda to it.

Non virgin mojito, bloody ocean, cheese and ham sandwich and the all time favourite chocolate walnut pot cake. Each and everyone of them absolutely heavenly.

 As for the chocolate walnut pot cake, I am a man who lacks sweet tooth, but I am in love with it. What ever you buy, eat, sniff  definitely give the potcake a try.

The food tastes really good. Though the number of dishes available (to choose from) was very low, the food quality made up for that.
The chicken wings are a must try and it was very well cooked. The Chaiwala special Chai was very nice. I don't prefer tea a lot yet, it was worth appreciation. The sandwiches are very healthy (people going to the gym could opt for those). The walnut pot cake had the perfect amount of sweetness (one is enough for 2 people)
The ambience and service was great!
The 400 for 2 thing is a myth for those who are there not for just a chit-chat and tea. üòå

The Chaiwala is a pretty lovely cafe near Tollygunge. The place is super chill, the wooden decor, the colourful post-its board and golden lights gives it a very warm and cosy vibe.
We had the Dementor's Kiss, a mocktail which was a pleasant fusion of sweet and spicy. A welcoming surprise as far as drinks are concerned. We also ordered burgers, Bacon Tornado with a side of French fries (no extra cost). The burger was an absolute delight, stacked with chicken patty, fresh lettuce and of course generous servings of bacon. It's tad expensive but the food is amazing!
Staff is great and helpful, WiFi is good, ambience spectacular!
Do check out this place if you haven't already :)

I cannot stop bragging about how amazing this place is. The food is lip smacking. The Double decker Bacon tornado (burger) was so so tasty. We had vanilla pancake which was delicious. The waffles were good. And last but not the least, what made our day was the Choco Walnut Pot Cake which for me was the Chaiwala special. After a long long time, I ate a cake so moist and to the scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top was the cherry on the cake. I give this place just 1 marks extra for its marvellous quality of food. 
The place is small but pretty, quirky and well decorated. The ambience is nice. Service is fast and the waiters are friendly. The prices of the food is reasonable. It has a very small smoking area just outside the main entrance. On the whole it is a nice go-to place with friends and family.

If you ask me for suggesting a really good eatout, that won't burn a hole in your pocket and will satisfy your tastebuds, then THE CHAIWALA it is. No second thoughts.

Very strategically located, just opposite to Charnock City, Tollygunge, where you will find a small lane. Upon entering the lane, to the left, you will find a cosy eat out, beautifully decorated with wooden tables and chairs and vibrantly lit. Yes!! Thats Chaiwala.

The first thing youll notice is the small outdoor seating. Only one or two tables, very congested but really cute. Trust me, youll love it.

Interior is quite good, nothing too fancy. The noticeable thing about this place are its wooden tables and wooden chairs, all lime yellow and white, homely feeling.

The ambience is very casual and the crowd ranges from school to college students predominantly. Family type gathering are a rare sight here. Not beacuse its a casual eat out, but its actually a bit on the smaller side. So dont expect to take your whole family for a treat or brunch. :D

The most important thing about Chaiwala, that stands out and speaks for itself is the FOOD. No doubt about it. Really delicious and served hot. 
Specially the french fries and the sandwiches. The scooper icecreams are really tasty. Go for the Oreo Scooper. Delicious!!

As i said in my previous reviews also, i specially prefer the staff management to be fast, attentive and friendly. Chaiwala serves you good food and good behaviour too. Really polite and super friendly, young people working hard to make our visit memorable and fun. By the way, be prepared for their free wifi service. Haha..and the password game. ;) youll gind it surprisingly good.

This place doesnt burn a hole in your pocket at all. Very good food at real low price. Teamed up with good management and free wifi. Love this place. Thanks Chaiwala!! Will visit you guys quite often.

Oh man!!!! 
I've been in this place so many times and i still  go to this place so many times that you will probably see me again if you come here üòÅ!! 

Ambience- Mind blowing
Food- Mind blowing
Waiters and services- Mind blowing

I just can't say anything bad about them. I still spend 3-4hrs maximum most of the days whenever I get a time off. 
Okay so let's get back to business-
 First of all you should try all of there foods one by one and take time with that üòé it will be a long journey...once you go there and if you are fond of good music, good surrounding, cool waiters, vivid but at the same time low tone culture inside a cafe then my friend you will be here again and again. All of there foods are pretty good, Beverages are great too.
I've seen (in here) how the taste of most of the visitors changes gradually. Like the first time I came here I never used to see other people ordering solid foods on the contrary they are ordering Beverages more and from that time probably still, there best drink is Lemon Iced Tea!!! 
Then I've seen people ordering Pan Cakes and believe me you should try there pancakes it's delicious (ummm...maybe not the one with honey banana, it's comparatively not that good as the other ones).
And now days people are more into there Burgers.
But I will say it's a cafe where the prices were very low and still is reasonable enough so I think this can be your regular relaxing destination and again you should try all of there foods gradually.
I really like there main waiter James (not in that way man!! üòí) he has been in The Chaiwala for so long that now it's like he is the face of The Chaiwala. Very cool guy indeed.
The music they play is very good. Some day they cover the genre Jazz ,some day Blues, some day Rock n Roll, and I'm talking about old school western music. Some day modern Western songs too (but no Justin Bie"v"er shith....I'm sorryüòé!!) 
Every evening the whole place becomes very lively with so many people sitting around having food, talking ,with great music all over...it's just great!! 
For very tight budget of eating I'll suggest you to have the Lemon Iced Tea, Scrambled eggs with mashed potatoes and at last one more of anything,(nothing which costs over 200/-)  it will cost in between 300/- and it's enough for two people to enjoy.
On every Friday they do this event call Friday Night Stand-up, thats pretty fine too.

So in short I will say 
The Chaiwala is a great place!!

So why my rate is 4.5?
Cause "I" think now they should update there menu a little bit also after the GST they have raised the price a small bit upwards than before (don't worry it's a really small amount) which is pretty normal cause after all it's a business.
Please do visit The Chaiwala.

This cafe has some ambience which gives a soothing feel.  The food is great. Their burgers are really something. The only drawbacks are the items are a bit over priced and the cafe is not so spacious.

A pure hangout zone in tollygunge. It is located on the lanes of Grahams Land 10 minutes walk from Tollygunge Metro Station. I like the ambience cozy and creative. There were seating arrangements inside and outside as well. It's beautifully decorated with wooden tables and chairs. There was music being played in the background. Service was prompt and the staffs were courteous. Well foods were good but not enough tempting to justify its price. Burgers and chocolate podcakes were very good. But i didn't like the sandwiches. And pancakes were nice too. Overall nice place to hang out.

In Summary:

It was a late lunch worth the wait!


Getting there:

The Chaiwala is located in "Graham's Land" which is a lane right after you cross Indrapuri Studies while coming from Tollygunge tram depot and going towards the Garia side.


What I ordered:

Since I and my companion both had not gotten the chance to have our lunches due to pending work throughout the day, after sitting down, we both@ decided to fill our empty bellies to the brim before heading out. We ordered 1 Chaiwala Special Chai, 1 Hazelnut Milkshake Smoothie, 1 Masala French Fries, 1 Spicy Cheese Chicken Sandwich and 1 White Sauce Penne Chicken Pasta.


My Experience:

First off, to begin with, the drinks that we had ordered, I absolutely loved the Chaiwala Special Chai. There are very few words to describe the amazing taste of this particular Chai. The Malai of this chai along-with the toast biscuits that accompany it create a fusion of flavors that is absolutely amazing. Now, that is not to say that the Hazelnut Milkshake smoothie was any bit less. The reason why I give the winning title to the Chaiwala Special Chai is that as a drink, it is miles ahead of the curve for the found the smoothie to be a bit too sweet for my liking and that it would much better as a dessert than that of a drink.


Now coming to the appetizers namely the Masala French Fries and the Sandwich, I personally did not like both of them due to the fact that:

(a) the Masala French Fries were a bit burnt and you had to mask the burnt taste of the fries in the provided Mayo or Ketchup dip to be able to palate it. and¬†

(b) the Sandwich was a bit too dry and overpowering to my liking. The bits of chicken in the sandwich was very clumpy and dry while the sandwich itself contained a bit too much of capsicum and bell pepper which was overpowering the entire dish. In my personal opinion had the sandwich had any spicy mayo or any sandwich spread along with the current ingredients, it would've made the sandwich a bit more moist and likable in my opinion.

Finally, coming to the Pasta, it was an absolute delight. After the mixed bag experience I had with the amazing drink and the at best par appetizers, the Pasta really won me over. The combination of the minced veggies and the penne pasta was absolute yum. The texture, the subtle fragrance, the cheesy and yummy taste along-with the colorful presentation won me over. It was an absolute delight having that pasta.


Overall, my visit to The Chaiwala for a late lunch though a mixed bag affair but was well worth it! Also, you absolutely HAVE TO TRY the Chaiwala Special Chai the next time you visit! I know I will!

Ambience was really good.
But the food apparently seemed good in the menu but in taste it was very bad and misleading.
Not a good experience.
The service was not upto the mark either. At first this place was better. But it has deteriorated a lot now. And the quality needs to improve. I took my friends today and neither of us are going to go there again.

A pure hangout zone. I like the ambience alot. It is cozy and creative. Foods are tasty but not enough tempting to justify its price. I deduct one point only for the price!   Service is prompt. Staffs are generous. A better cafeteria indeed. The special chai is awesome. Next time I like to visit this place on Friday only to enjoy  their open mics.

Absolutely fantastic ambience. Beautiful and creative decor which grabs most of the point from my review. Pure adda zone. They also arrenge open mics on fridays.
Now the food and service:-
 Service is promt. Foods are good but Not mouth watering enough to justify its price. Don't get me wrong. They serve pretty generous servings of each item and they are tasty.  I cut 1 point for the price.
And oh yes the special chai is absolutely fantastic. (Far better cafe in comparison to ccd)

Their portions are mammoth so order one item at a time... I love their sandwiches... They burst with the fillings.. And they are super frndly... Good going guys... Just one con.. It hurts to wait outside coz they are nearly always full..

Had heard a lot about this food joint in tollygunge. And finally got to try the place! 
The ambience is nice and calm. I went there on a rainy day. There was a bucket kind of thing kept outside for you to keep your umbrella in. There were seating arrangements inside and outside as well. There was music being played in the background. 
The staff were courteous. Service was quick. We had ordered two dishes. The first one came in no more than five minutes, the other one arrived as we were about to end our 1st dish. 
We had ordered a cheese chicken sandwich and a choco walnut pot cake. The latter was just delicious. It did all the justice to the reviews i had heard about it. The sandwich tasted good but seemed a bit dry. 
We were two people, and were full after having the two dishes. 
A very good place at such price! Day made. :)

An awesome place for burgers. The place is small, but the ambience is very good. The burgers and desserts are delicious. The ham burger is a must try there. Am giving rating 4 because I think prices could have been a little less, I think it's a little overpriced. But the quality is great nonetheless.

This place is a bit to the interior but with the facility of √ºber and GPS we can reach out any place so smooth!
We came here on a Sunday, this place didn't at all fail to amaze with its interior and ambience. Look and feel so good.
Food be the best of all.
We had Choco walnut pot cake which was thoroughly lip smacking. It was a dessert basically,a sliver bowl stuffed with choco cake n topped with vanilla icecream with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. I know this dish sounds quite simple but the one who have tasted it knows it the best I would say. The cake so soft n not at all over sugary the chocolate flavour was balanced well. The cake being warm n the ice cream cold was a perfect blend. 
Thumbs up! To the dessert
Will try out the other dishes too.
Thank you!

Hungry?? Wanna grab some good food? Then this place is a completely right choice for you. Situated near tollygaunj area. We ordered soy honey chicken wings, grilled chicken burger, choco walnut pot cake. 
1)soy honey chicken wings was fabulous and speciality of this cafe. I will rate this 4.5/5 as the wings sizes didn't match the expectations. Although it tasted awesome. 
2)grilled chicken burger was quite good too but could be more juicy. 
3) and lastly with what I fell in love with was that pot cake. Mouthwatering chocolate sauce with vanilla pop up at the top and below which there was walnut filled chocolate cake. I will go to this place for this item again and again. 6/5
Extremely good ambience, music which matches your mood.

So finally I visited this place, I have to say I was overjoyed with their service and the quality food they serve! The rates are pretty affordable, the service is top notch. This place is very good for some quick bites. I tried their grilled cheese sandwich and french fries, the sandwiches had good amount of cheese, and were perfectly made. The french fries were present in pretty decent amount, and tasted good too. The place also has a lovely interior decor. The only drawback that I found was, this place is a bit over crowded. Other than that it's a 9/10 experience from me. Keep up the good work lads.

This cute little place can be reached after a 5 min brisk walk from Tollygunge metro station. The ambience is excellent for an evening adda session and the decor has a Retro Calcutta feel in it. 
We went there on a Monsoon evening and the raindrops crawling down the glass windows beside our table was a perfect setting. The Chai wala special tea is offered in earthenware (bhanr) accompanied by the rusk biscuits. We ordered a cup of Darjeeling tea and a lemon grass ginger tea in a pot. The flavour of the latter I loved. 
The soy honey chicken wings was sweet yet hot although the chicken could be bit tender. 
We also had a Spanish Omelette with carrots and bell pepper was quite filling and we had to leave without any space for dessert. I'm going for the baked stuff next time. The prices are reasonable and the portions are wholesome.
I wish the place had more seating, since we had to wait for about half an hour on a weekend. So reach there early and enjoy a good evening Chai. The Bengali way.

I have ordered one peppermint tea,bacon tornado burger and an apple Snyder. The tea was fine and the aroma was quite refreshing. The burger patty was juicy,soft , the cheese was perfectly placed and there was enough bacon. All over I can say the burger was awesome and delicious as hell. The final drink apple Snyder was also very good.

They make probably the best burger in town. The burgers are tasty and at the same time cheap. 

The place is small so when all the tables are full the place looks congested and crowded. 

Overall the place is nice and if you want to eat good food without spending much money then this is the place.

One of the major drawbacks is their service. They take really long time to bring food to your table since the restaurant staffs is very less.

Hello Foodies! I'm delighted to say this Kolkata is becoming a retro city with great Outlets for gossiping munching and other stuff. This city is going to leave other citites behind within a span of next few years. 

Out of all the other Caf√©s I've visited this one impressed me with their food and presentation. Simple yet powerful. What thinking by this old Gentleman running this beautiful little caf√© in the bylane at the city end. 

Location : Tollygunje Metro Station from there walk 5 minutes towards Garia route there is a FL shop cross it then there is an alley at the left take it and cross three buildings and voila you're there. 

Interiors : The interior pics I've again forgotten to click promise I'll click next time. It's filled with beautiful artistic drawings. Litle handpainted kettles lampshades and books are there. The wind-chimes are made with stylish materials. Simple stylish materials. It's beautifully decorated with wooden tables and chairs. There is another place inside I thought but have no clue as I didn't had time to check. The interior is superbly done. Brilliant! Small yet vibrant. This plave gives you one if those feels with your loved ones.

Food :  
So when coming to order food we always opt for safe options. We rather my better half is always scared to try out new stuff. But still we being foodie from heart out of pure love we dare to try new food items at the menu. Although I'm not a big fan of burgers I loved the burger picture on the menu and thought of having it. But my better half had other things in her mind. She doesn't understand anything beyond her love for Chicken. 
In the beginning I ordered for

¬ª Non Virgin Mojito 
¬ª Cappuccino (as all if a sudden she was feeling cold and needed a cup of hot coffee)
¬ª Chicken Nuggets
¬ª Grilled Spicy Cheese Chicken Sandwich 
¬ª Dementors Kiss
¬ª Chaiwala Special Chai (Tea)
¬ª Dark Desire

Okay now 

Non Virgin Mojito - This was something I never had before. Virgin Mijito I had it a lot of times. But non virgin mojito will it be alcohol I was wondering. When this thing came and my better half had her first sip she was like dude this is pure bliss. The colour The Texture was attractive and when I had my first sip I was in LOVE. I mean pure love. Mint. The flavour the colour this drink omfg its love. 

Cappuccino - Cappuccino us a regular issue everywhere and I found it pretty good as compared to other outlets better than CCD atleast. Period.
I mean this was well made Cappuccino it was made with love and care proportionate amount if coffee and milk with well designed cream on the top. Most importantly it came with two cookies along with it. I loved the cookies. 

Chicken Nuggets - Chicken Nuggets were pretty simple just ordinary. Homemade feel. Simple fry came along with two types of sauce Mayonnaise and Tomato. Spreaded with coriander leaves. It was good too.

Grilled Spicy Cheese Chicken Sandwich - Hum do humare do. For we being two our two sandwiches came. Perfectly well grilled not even burnt in any place. Filled with chopped chicken and cheese spreaded with yellow and red veggies. It was superb. The cheese was not molten though. It was so nicely done I was awestruck. I craved for more but my stomach was full. 

Dementors Kiss - It was some kind of red sweet spicy syrup. I didn't like it much. But was not bad either. I couldn't drink much of it. But I loved this new concept.

Chaiwala Special Tea (Chai)- This chai came in a bhand(clay pot small) 
With two rusk biscuits. Which was nice gesture by The Chaiwala people. I loved their gesture and loved the way of their presentation. While my better half kept rejoicing her love for tea. 

Dark Desire - I used to see people uploading picture of this particular dish very often on social media. I never imagined that a dessert dish can be this delicious. Molten chocolate along with chocolate Icecream. Choco chips with a little cadbury chocolate ball and below the icecream lies chocolate cake. It was pure love and my love for Chocolate continues. This can't be any better but the thing which I didn't like was they had put nuts inside and my better half couldn't have it. She doesn't like nuts. Sadüòû

But Thank you The Chaiwala you people host a very nice dinner treat to us and we loved every moment of our stay. It was lively along with the Green Day music going in the back. I'd like give my gratitude to this old Gentleman who runs this place. Thank you Sir for this wonderful outlet it's a gift for this and for foodies like us. 

Thank you once again. 

Happy Eating :)

Popped into this place for the first time today with a friend. We were the first diners of the day as they had just popped open the shutters at 4pm.
The setting and d√©cor of the place is cozy and nuce, reflecting an urban noir feeling.
After much deliberation and consideration, we ordered an Egg & Cheese Grilled Sandwich and Sinful Nutella Burst Pancakes.
The sandwich arrived first and the ingredients were fresh and it was well prepared and went quite alright with the complimentary tomato ketchup. A satisfying sandwich.
The pancakes were truly very good. They were warm and soft and spongy and the chocolate sauce drizzle along with the chocolate chips made it really sinful. But at the end, it felt kind of dry and I would've liked some complimentary maple syrup. Anyhow the pancakes themselves are very filling and are enough for two persons.
Do check out the place and order as per your own discretion.

Within the intricate routes of the bustling streets in Alipore, Chaiwala sits in peace in one of the immediate turns of these streets. The traffic one has to swim through to reach this place is atrocious but the food Chaiwala greets you with is totally worth the struggle.

Some of my favourites from their menu is the chicken wings (choose among the 3 flavours they have to offer you), the omelette they make out of 3 eggs, cheese and other add ons which will fill your tummy to the core, the happening mocktails, the lightly brewed capuccino with complimentary butter biscuits and the must have desert- we picked devil's desire and this devil gives me these cravings bringing me back to this warm nest.
Though the bacon burger did not really make upto the mark- the bread was too dry. But the chicken burger was a grand compensation.

Above all what is best at Chaiwala is the experience. I felt like I was sitting at the comfort of my home and enjoying the cafeteria delicacies from the polite waiter at my dispense. The team of Chaiwala deserves a loud applause for giving its customers this kind of experience. They have recently expanded. Yet this is a nice warm cozy place for small groups of numbers not more than 3, the peace at this place is what makes this place so beautiful maybe.

I found Chaiwala when I was aimlessly strolling the city in search of a quiet little place to write at. Not to mention, I was famished. Honestly, I could have eaten a whole chicken by myself this afternoon. 

So I found this dimly lit cafe in some forgettable corner on my way home. It had this cute round table with some stools out front, for the decadent smokers like me. And inside, it had an earthly ambience, with one too many tables to serve in a tiny space. Even amidst the congestion of tables and chairs, it was strangely homely. 

I ordered a plate of their Nutella Burst pancakes with ice-cream (because, hell, who can ever say no to Nutella?) and it had come around 15 minutes later. The first few bites, I had honestly gobbled without bothering to actually taste/relish the delicacy. Once the initial blow of hunger was satiated, I found myself giving more time to actually taste the dish. 

The pancakes are beautifully flavoured, the chocolate syrup added generously, and although it felt a little too much chocolatey for a Nutella pancake, who can ever deny chocolate? 
The only problem with the pancakes though is that they lack the softness, the melting sensation, that is supposed to be there in these carby dollops of goodness. Unfortunately, it wasn't "as soft as a baby's butt" as their menu card promised. However, I hope that can be rectified in the future. Also, the vanilla ice cream strangely tasted not like vanilla. 

And soon I had immersed myself in my writing. But when the clock struck 6, a gigantic herd of youngsters came blasting in and soon the tiny cafe shrunk two sizes with the cacophony. For anyone who appreciates a little bit of candor and cacophony, Chaiwala is the perfect place after 6. 
But for the silent souls like me, the ones who like to hide underneath the safe haven of their passions, the quiet afternoons around 1 to 5 is their nest. 

I enjoyed my time at Chaiwala. And I hope to return soon to enjoy more of their goodies, perhaps this time for burgers and their eponymous chai.

The location is a bit tricky but once you enter Graham's Land,just walk past the Graham's kitchen and you'll find The Chaiwala on your left.
         Along with standard pricing and no added tax,the quality of food also tickles the foodie bones.
We ordered a walnut potcake,honey soy chicken wings and a grilled cheesy chicken sandwich.All of them excelled at each possible aspect.
         The ambience is also a 10/10.
Certainly going back to spend some more evenings.

I went to this place twice but I shall say my first experience was far better. The cafe is located at the -Graham's lane and has a boutique attached to it. You can also see a few things there once you place the order. They take a little time to serve the food. To go with the name there are pictures of local chaiwalas hanged on the white walls of the cafe. It is a small joint that can accommodate maximum 20 people.
I ended up ordering the same things on my second visit as I loved them when I visited for the first time. The double decker chicken burger was huge for a single bite. For the second time it was little salty for my taste. We ordered chicken pasta with white sauce which was creamy and delicious and finally the cold coffee tasted fine.
The service is descent and my overall experience was good.

This cafe is located at the Grahams Land, Tollygunge. A very ordinary cafe with a decent outlook. The interiors are average and though it doesn't have too much space it does attract quite alot of crowd I must say.

The food is average..Just good enough to give you company when you hang out with friends. Tea coffees are so so.. We ordered darjeeling Tea, Chaiwala special and Ocean Mojito. Though the Darjeeling tea was average, the other two failed to impress us in any manner.

Coming to the eatable items. Masala French fries are worth a try. Penne Pasta (Red sauce) was very gud, Garlic Bread with cheese was again average nd Choco Walnut pot cake was a huge disappointment.

Verdict - If its just a casual hangout with your friends to catch up on your regular gupshup, u may try this place.

This is my second visit to this cafe. I was already a big fan of this particular cafe by the first visit only because both the food as well as the ambience was amazing. Keeping the good experience in mind, I visited this restaurant once more on a Sunday evening and I was already aware of the fact that it would take me some time and I need to wait outside. The attendant came with a smile and told us to wait for thirty minutes but that was not much of a problem since the weather outside was pretty cool and the outside sitting space was equipped with a fan.
Coming to the location this restaurant is located on the lanes of "Grahams land" , a much primary location, roughly 7 mins walk from the nearest TOLLYGUNJ Metro station. As soon as we enter, I saw that they have changed their interiors a little bit. The tables and the chairs have been placed in such a way that the space can be used effectively. The ambience is nice and soothing and the bar like arrangement looks very much cute though I don't prefer that place to eat on. Coming to the food we ordered their signature dishes 1. Soy honey chicken wings - Chicken Wings is something I personally don't prefer but reading very positive review from that in zomato I decide to gave it a try. And let me inform let alone being disappointed, this is the best chicken wings one can have at such a moderate price. This was the exact less spicy I personally prefer with adequate flavour of honey making it crispy and tender at the same time. (5/5)
2. Choco walnut podcake - The last time when I had with my friends it was the best thing that I had till date. But this time this disappointed me a little because they have reduced their portion as well as the amount of chocolate sauce so much that it even felt a little bit dry when we were having some of the last bites of the brownies. Nevertheless you can never go wrong with suchmind blowing combination of brownies, chocolate sauce and ice cream.

Overall it was a pleasure visiting this cafe as this is one of my personal favorite,definitely recommended and am coming back next month only to try my new favorite of the lot, Soya-honey chicken wings. The service is excellent and the people attending are very polite and jolly. Till then happy dining. üòä‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

Dropped by here on a Friday afternoon. Simple, but tasteful decor with wooden tables and chairs. We chose to sit on the tall bar-stools. Started off with cafe shakerato and dementor's kiss.  Cafe shakerato was an absolute delight - chilled espresso in a martini-glass, the whiff of coffee with a hint of vanilla. The dementor's kiss is a tangy, spicy, very ordinary drink with an intresting name.
Ordered mixed sauce pasta - very tasty, more than enough quantity with exactly the right amount of cheese. My friend went with the hangover burger, which I didn't sample but the quantity was humongous.
 I had gone into this place with a hankering for waffles, which I had never tasted before. The waffles came, absolutely drenched in maple syrup. I liked the consistency of waffles, crunchy but soft inside but the syrup had made it just too sweet for my palate. Finished it with difficulty.
Based on the food they serve for the prices they charge this is easily a 4 place. But our experience was marred by the play list. Edm tracks, played way too loud which kept getting in the way of our conversation. On requesting, they turned down the volume once but we might have been sitting too close to the speakers or something because throughout the evening the music kept annoying us to no end.

This little place of joy is all that you'd want in a caf√©! The interiors are simple yet has a very soothing feel to it. The cafe being in an alley is away from all the cacophony of the traffic. The food is really good. The grilled chicken burger and soy-honey chicken wings are the must grab grub here. If you're taking your special someone then do get her the single scoop with your her favourite choice of flavours as dessert. The staff is friendly too. So do drop by it on a lazy afternoon.

One of the best and pocket friendly places in Kolkata I have come across till date. A very soothing and cozy ambience with extremely courteous and friendly staff. The service is equally good. Coming to the food, the burgers are a must try and so is the soy honey chicken wings.If you are fan of shakes and frappe then nothing can beat their Oreo frappe. Personally one of my very favourite places and a strong recommendation.

This one is one of my favourite most places these days. Efficiently used little space with asthetic decoration. Tiny, cute, innovative touch in everything starting from small fence and plants outside the cafe to bill basket to the swinging half door leading to wash area. It has become very popular these days hence finding a table becomes a little time consuming. But that is nothing if you want to delight your tastebuds with some wonderful dishes.

If there was an option of giving a rating higher than 5, I would given it to this place. Absolutely in love with The Chaiwala (no pun intended)!

In times where consistency is in dearth, The Chaiwala have maintained their impeccable service and quality of food and that too at reasonable prices. Situated at Graham's Road, close to Tollygunge Metro station, this place has become a favourite haunt for college goers and students. The ambience is upbeat, with cosy sitting arrangements and the service is efficient and courteous.I have been a customer since last year but waited to write this review as I would mostly take home deliveries. Today, we ordered Chicken nuggets, Scrambled eggs, Chilli cheese Omelette, Schezwan Pasta, Banana honey pancakes, Lemon iced tea and Chaiwala special tea.

The nuggets were good, served with ketchup and mayo dip. Chilli cheese omelette was a beautifully fried egg stuffed with assorted veggies and cheese tossed in a tangy sauce. The surprise package however was the scrambled eggs served with mashed potatoes. Both were creamy and delicious. The Chicken Schezwan Pasta is loaded with chicken, veggies all in a tangy spicy sauce garnished with cheese shavings on top. The pasta was cooked al dente and was one of the best I've ever had. Honey banana pancakes have been a favourite for sometime now, it still is. Last but not the least, the Iced lemon tea and Chaiwala special ( Masala chai served in an earthen teacup with two pieces of toast) were all upto the standard. All in one, an extremely statisfying meal. Other than this, their burgers, sandwiches and Krunchies which I had ordered online, are also quite good.

I hope that they maintain their service and continue to
serve up some delicious food!

Try their honey soy chicken wings, ham egg and cheese bake burger, waffles and the range of smoothies. Even their sandwiches are amazing. The food is top notch in this place.

The staff is courteous. Would like to visit this place again. They are available on swiggy so you can have amazing food at home..

Been here multiple times, and I love the ambience of the place. The food they serve is very good as well.
However, the last time I visited them around a week back, I was in for a surprise ! The bacon tornado burger was awesome as always, but halfway through the meal, a transgender person came in and started forcing us for money ! The management didn't even do anything about it. I for one have no problem with transgender people having food in the restaurant, but allowing them to come in to forcefully take money while we are having food is something I don't agree with at all. The management should have done something about it.

A well known caf√© in tollygaunge and my second visit to that place today,it became more interesting.Same decore same address but you can find young people performing stand up comedy.So food and entertainment with the company of your loved ones, doesn't it gives a complete feeling?
What we ordered:

1.BLOODY OCEAN(4.5/5)- As per the name says! IT TASTES BLOODY GOOD! The taste reminded me of a candy I frequently used to eat in my childhood days. Don't get scared by the name but try it instead.

2.GARLIC BREAD with CHEESE:(4/5)- Simple but tasty! Ya that's it :)

3.CHICKEN HOTDOG BURGER (4.5/5)- An Innovative combination but very tasty! BURGER's of this place never dissapoints you.

4.BACON TORNADO BURGER ( 10/5)-The name justifies the dish! You cannot go there and not have this dish.It has become my favourite.

5.WHITE CHICKEN PENNE PASTA (4.5/5)- Thick and creamy and my second favorite.

6.SNOW WHITE (5/5)- Amazing one of the lot, walnuts, biscuits,vanilla ice-cream being the core ingredients. All of white go well with the vanilla ice cream. "All of the white goes well with the vanilla ice-cream" were the only words my bestie said after having this :)

Other than this the Choco smoothie and the chicken burger are also good.
If you are a foodie and love to get entertained this place is a "must visit" one.And you won't get disappointed.

If you are hungry and up for a quick bite, grab a metro to tollygunj and drop into this place, you wouldn't be disappointed.  Situated just beside the historical tollygunj studio, this place is one of the hidden gems of South Calcutta. Let's start with the ambiance- il give them a 4.5/5 for it. The music is surprisingly tasteful. Now, about the food, I'd give them a 3.5/5. There is a huge scope for improvement, however special mention to the amount they serve on each plate, compared to the price, it's extremely generous. Service is very good. A 4/5 for the same. Over all quite satisfying an experience.

Visited it a few days back. 
Ordered the following :

1. Cheese sauce penne pasta - Very cheesy and tasty. Not one of the best cheese sauce pastas I've eaten though. However, they serve huge proportions making one plate enough for two. I'd give it a 3/5.

2. Grilled chicken burger - Filled with juicy grilled chicken , it makes a tasty bite. The burger is served with some potato fries making this a wholesome dish more than sufficient for one. I'd give it a 3/5. 

3. Choco walnut pot cake - This one was the real winner. Because it's so chocolatey , it becomes very heavy. It comprises of molten chocolate and chocolate cake with walnuts topped with a scoop of ice cream. It is amazing and very filling . It's a must try here. I'd give it a 4.5/5. 

Overall a pleasant experience. Though I was disappointed with the table given to us in spite of another table being free. Our table had a very uncomfortable sitting arrangement. No place to rest our back . We couldn't lean against anything. 

They should cater to the customers already present properly instead of saving seats for probable customers.

I have been to this place several times because not only the food is good but pocket friendly too.. on my birthday we had order soya honey chicken wings, chicken sausage krunchies, double decker chicken burger, passion fruit ice tea, chicken corn soup and vanilla pot cake and the bill was around 1100 only. The wings , burger, pot cake and the ice tea are my favourite and are recommended. Do ask them for the WiFi password *wink*

This place is located in grahams lane. It's a rather peaceful colony. The chaiwala offers good food at reasonable prices. The cheese pasta is good however the quantity is not that much. I also tried the The Bacon Tornado burger which was better than what I had expected. It's a small place but the interiors are well done. They also serve some good variants of tea and coffee. All in all, you can visit when you're low on money or when you're just looking to catch up with friends along with some good food.

The food was very good ,but today for the first time faced a situation a transgender came in the restaurant and extorted money from each customer and the entire staff of the restaurant stood their silently .This is not acceptable , as every restaurant should have strict law and they can't allow people to extort the money .I would very well support the fact that they can have food with us but harassing the customers while eating is not acceptable .very poor staff management .

Nutella burst pancakes, this is what you have to have here! I don't know why it isn't given in the recommendation section, but as I said, you HAVE to have this dessert. 
Their food, service everything is at par and what makes this place even better is the price of their food. 
We ordered grilled chicken burger, chicken sandwich, cheese sauce pasta, hot wings, Nutella pancakes and cold coffee, and all these cost 1100 bucks only.. 
And I'd recommend to try the cheese sauce pasta too, but don't forget the NUTELLA BURST PANCAKES!

A lot is happening in Kolkata..not only over coffee but also over Chai...The Chaiwala is a new addition to this Chai lovers' list..It's located in Graham's Land-dont worry, its just few minutes walking from Tollygunge metro towards NSC Bose Road on the left hand side-a sign board indicating Graham's Land. A small cafeteria-very well and tastefully decorated with well behaved and courteous staffs. Loud music and a adda ambience- perfect for a lovely evening.
Coming to the food-we ordered Ice Lemon tea, Chicken spicy grilled sandwich, Chicken Double decker Burger, chicken mixed sauce pasta and chicken soy honey wings.Each of them were good but the best part was the Double decker burger and soy honey wings..these are recommended dish.The burger was really sufficient for one.Two patty with double layer of barbeque sauce and cheese-tasty it was.The soy honey wings consisted of 4pieces of chicken wings tossed in a honey soya sauce..type of Teriyaki kind of flavour but with rich flavour of garlic.Loved the taste..the lemon ice tea was really refreshing..next time will definitely try their desserts, this time the hypothalamus din't permit.

Spicy chicken wings - 3.5/5 taste wise very good but not properly served‚Äã, the plate is so small that you can't comfortably eat it, the amount of gravy is much more than required.
Chicken nuggets - 5/5 served with mayonnaise, superb.
All the coffee items are wonderful. 
Service is very good, friendly staff.
Location is good but very small joint,you have to come with time in hand n wait to get a table. 
Ambience is wonderful and creative. 
Must visit for any tea coffee lover.

A cafe that isn't hard to spot. Located at Graham's road just beside Graham's Kitchen, this cafe is a cosy and pretty cafe. Interiors and lighting well done and seating arrangement proper. Now coming to the food we tried their mocktails :Dementors kiss which was Cranberry based with a tinge of spicy and Apple Synder which was light and refreshing. We ordered the Bacon Tornado which was such a delight, a juicy cheesy burger that is so well done with a good amount of bacon in it. Also had the veggie delight and Grilled chicken burger where it was cooked to perfection. For dessert we had the Choco walnut Pot cake which was a sponge cake with Walnuts and ice cream with chocolate sauce. This was so good. The quantity and quality was well worth it. I will go back time and again. Highly recommended.

Small and cosy place with moderate interior and excellent foods. It has a small bar although they don't serve alcohol. I didn't understood what's the point. It was a sunny afternoon and it was scorching hot outside. First we ordered Lemon Iced Tea and Non-Virgin Mojito to get refreshed. It was great. After we tried Cheesy Chicken Sandwich. We didn't expect it would be that huge. Enough to fill one's appetite. Then we ordered the delicious Mixed Sauce Chicken Pasta. What made me fall in love with this place is the quality and quantity. If you are looking for value for money you must visit this place.

The decor, the ambience is pretty good. Went there on recommendation of a friend whose suggestions are generally spot on. However, was a bit disappointed as some of the food items we ordered were  below par.
We had the Chicken Wings in honey bbq sauce. Honestly this was the biggest disappointment. The chicken was hard and quite difficult to tear off of the bones.
The chilli garlic spaghetti was cold and bland.
However, the chilly cheese chicken sandwich and the grilled chicken cheese burger were quite good.
Will give it another try, but this experience was frankly, not too good.

I have gone to this place alot of times..and it used to be one of my favourites. The ambience is really great..and the staff is courteous and helpful. The chicken wings are a must try here cz they are really tasty. Burgers are good as well.
Though after the renovation, I went twice...and I found a deterioration in taste and quality of food. The banana smoothie seemed little bitter. The hot chocolate seemed like Complan. 
Previously I would hav rated it 4.0, but now I think the taste of food needs to be better.

I have also tried a few of the mocktails, including Bloody Ocean and Dementor's Kiss, which were pretty good as well. The Chocolate Pot Cake is an amazing dessert, which is a must try if you have a sweet tooth. 
Overall, good service, great food, and light on the wallet too. :)

As far the location goes it might not be so easy to spot.Now if you coming from the tollygaunge metro station cross the indrapuri studios and the tolly stores .the very next lane beside the tolly store will lead you to this place.
Ambience was so cool that you could even go and sit with a book and you wont feel awkward¬† .The wooden chairs adds¬† classy touch to it.
Now talking about the food, we had ordered an oreo frappe,chocowalnut potcake,penne pasta in creamy cheese sauce,nutella burst cakes and soy honey chicken wings .
Each and every dish except the soy honey chicken¬† turned out to be really delicious and absolutely spot on.I didnt like the soy honey much.It did not have textures and was really that recommendable .They make food instantly hence it might take time to serve you but its worth waiting for.
Try the Choco walnut potcake and nutella burst cake .

One of the best cafes I have been to till date. I went there with my girlfriend and to our utter disapointment ( yes you read that right ) there was a power cut and we were told that we could only order icecream scoops and ice tea. We decided to stay back and ordered : OH OREO! which was okayish consisting of vanilla icecream and lots of oreo biscuits. And thank god it was Friday evening which by the way was the only day on which The Chaiwala arranges for a stand up comedy show by wonderful young people. And thats how we got rid of our sorrow for the time being of not getting food.
However the power cut didnot last long.
We hurriedly ordered a plate of french fries, a grilled chicken burger and a cheesy chicken sandwich.
I must say that the money and the wait was worth it.
For eighty rupees the amount of french fries they give is absolutely awesome. They were crunchy as well as soft. The burger was cheesy and the patties were juicy. However the lettuce leaves were not fresh. But cheese makes everything better, right?
And the best part is at that all the foods are inclusive of tax.
The decorations were interesting with an old roman clock and various funky cups and kettle on various racks. The ambience was cosy and nice enough.
The service was extremely well and courteous.
And also the cute part was that the bill came in a very cute straw box. Would love to visit again. ‚ù§‚ù§

A small and compact gem hidden in a small alley close to Tollygunje metro. Walking from metro with G maps as your guide will land you at the right place. 
The ambience has a wooden feel to it due to interior decors and colors used. There are some paintings nicely placed. They have a table set outside the gate in extended area which can be used by a group of 6 or more people. 
Food was great and the attendant was polite filled with loads of suggestions. The highlight was the dessert which was a Hot Chocolate cake with ice cream on it. The place was worth a visit and may be more if you are nearby in this locality or just visiting. 

P.S. There was one guy(caretaker or owner may be) who was constantly staring which made us uneasy but we ignored him. 
Oh ya almost forgot they have free Wi-Fi if that's a criteria for someone. :)

Service not upto the mark. We ordered vanilla pot cake, soy honey wings,lime soda and waffles with maple syrup. We had to wait around 30 to 35 minutes before we were served the honey wings. They were too sweet but otherwise okay. The waffles were soft as there was too much maple syrup far more than necessary making the waffles soft which supposed to have been crunchy. The vanilla pot cake was okay but had little walnuts in them which is suprising as they put a lot of walnuts in their choco walnutpot cake. I would have given it 2 or 3 but what really pissed me off is the negligency of the staff. We had to wait a long time to get the seats , on the top of that the staff was careless not listening to our requests and giving us false promises. The people sitting beside us came after us and got their food on time. They had ordered a waffle sandwich. They got theirs on time but we got our waffles much much later. They even ordered a choco walnut pot cake but they got their chocolate earlier than our vanilla one which is not acceptable as we had to wait a long time. They then said it was a misunderstanding. It was not acceptable at all. I have been there earlier bit never have I been treated so badly.

12 of us went to this place for my friend's birthday celebration. It's a 5 minutes walk from Tolly metro station, heading towards Malancha cinema hall. It is a small cafe with nicely done bright interiors. A calendar embossed in clay caught my attention the most.
We ordered a variety of drinks & snacks (I don't even remember all the names) including
Oreo Frappe (I recommend this)
Choco Walnut Pot Cake
Bloody Ocean
Non virgin mojito
Apple Snyder
Dark Desire (yummmmmm)
Chicken Nuggets
Chicken burger
Chilli garlic chicken Sphagetti (this one is so hot n good)!!!
Chicken cup soup
All food & drinks were really good! Well behaved staff!
There is also a small table with few seats on the outside which will be delightful in winters.
Only drawback is we were not allowed to cut cake inside (they allow it only if informed prior 24 hours).. & a birthday celebration without cake is incomplete, right? üôÅ

We ordered a chicken pasta with @white sauce and a grilled chicken burger and the food was more than excellent. Anything said will be less than what we had! The ambience was cosy and perfect for a date. What fascinated us the most were the prices. Just perfect for college students with limited pocket money!

I have been to this place only twice but I can vouch this is the best pocket friendly cafe in town serving high quality food. They have a simple interior ¬†unique decoration...good utilization of space. One thing really appealed to me was their restroom area..very hygienic and spacious which most 5 start restaurants lack. Their staff is polite and efficient. ¬†I have tried their following items:
1) Soy honey chicken wings- very tasty, pieces are big and satisfying... get lots of tissues in hand as eating wings get messy.
2) Chilly garlic chicken spaghetti -- This is one of the very few cafes that keep this dry version of pasta. Garnished with cheese it has a unique lemon-garlic and chilly flavour with sufficient chicken pieces.
3) Scrambled eggs with cheese and mashed potato -- to be honest it tasted like alu seddho bhaat, it lacked texture..consistency was like baby food.
4) Classic Belgian waffle with maple syrup---perfectly sweet and crunchy.
will visit again.

The place is a little small and that is that first and last bad thing about this place. The ambience is great, and the food is amazing. I never thought a small place like this could have such good food. A great place for a first date. Check it out.

I had ordered a shake which was nothing more than a glass of milk filled with ice cubes.
I even ordered Nutella pancake which is supposed to be one of the best items here but the misery with which they had put Nutella between the layers of pancakes was too high.
One of the staff members was also quite rude in his behaviour.

So went to this American styled desi cafe in tollygunge today with a friend. We ordered a Mojito, an Assam tea which could have been a bit more on the authentic side, a bacon burger and also chicken hotdog burger. When the food came it automatically looked really appetising and I couldn't wait to dig in. As soon as I took the first bite I knew it will definitely not be my last time here. The service was really good and was complementing the food and ambience in every way. The only complain I had, was the mustard sauce that I ordered on the side was more of mayo and lacked the strong taste i expected. On a whole it was an awesome experience and i will definitely be visiting the above burger joint again.

Visited this place yesterday. The d√©cor is nice and cozy. The bacon tornado burger is tasty. The grilled chicken burger is good too. The oreo frappe was a little bitter but not bad. It is served with two Oreo biscuits. The service is really good. One plus is that it is tax free and pocket friendly. :)

This place is located very close to my house. If you know the location of Graham's Land and just walk half a minute from there, The Chaiwala will fall on your left. This place is really off beat in this area. Apart from CCD, Pizza Hut and other MNC fast food chains, Tollygunge area was lacking some good place to eat where the food is customised and made with love and care.¬†
The ambience of this cafe is a major plus point. Mainly crowded by school and college students, The Chaiwala boasts of a huge number of regulars at their joint. The sitting arrangement is very pretty. What I loved the most was they have come up with a bar like arrangement from where they serve the food. That counter is placed with high chairs and people can sit and eat over there like they have a drink at the bar counter. They also have a small sitting area outside, mainly for the smoking purpose. Decor is quirky and fun, overall an ambience for everyone to chat with friends and foes for a long time.¬†
Now, the most important thing about this place is the food. Although they provide a very good ambience for chit chat and all with a lovely decor, the food here is equally good and that too, at a very good price. I came here with my sister a day or two back and we enjoyed the food very much. We ordered -¬†
Soy Honey Wings - This is the signature dish at The Chaiwala. Almost everyone who has reviewed this place, have suggested to try this. And we are obedient students. No wonder, they did justice by hyping this dish so high. Loved the sauce that it was tossed in. Had a strong flavour of the soya sauce and honey. The wings were pretty large and it was crispy outside and all tender inside. Loved it.
American Hot Wings - We had got this dish packed for home. It was on the spicier side, very good in taste. I preferred the first one although. My family loved it. People who didn't try the Soy Honey Wings, will surely fall for it. I am sure.
Spaghetti Carbonara - Taste wise, the pasta was really good. The classic spaghetti in white sauce with bacon. Here, I have to say two thing - the sauce could have been a bit thicker and creamier, and the bacon they gave, although sufficient in portion it should have been spreaded¬†throughout the spaghetti portion. As we were sharing the dish, it was a bit problematic to pass on the pasta and then the bacon to another plate.¬†
Vanilla Pot Cake - Have heard so much about this. So I just couldn't let go of it. It was a plain vanilla cake made in ceramic bowl in the microwave. Served with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce with Honey, it was a delicious sinful delight and we gorged upon the cake in no time.¬†
Overall experience was good. Service was courteous and very prompt. Pricing is more than perfect. I am definitely going to come back here. This place is totally recommended if you're looking for a good place to chat over some good food. Happy Dining! :)

Great ambience, great service, great food if only the place wasn't as small as it is, they keep running out of place to sit! But that apart, like I mentioned earlier, great place, have whatever you want, definitely recommended. 
My favourite is oreo frappe and soy honey chicken if you're wondering üòÅüòÅ

Tucked into a side alley off Tollygunge, called Graham's Land, this tiny cafe can pack a punch. The manager will take care of your every need, the service is prompt and their menu card is actually quite funny. 
We tried their iced tea, bacon, and French fries. The bacon was good, even though I like mine crisp. The French fries were perfect. I really look forward to trying some of their burgers the next time I visit. 

Overall, it's a little cramped for space, but the inside is brilliant. The service gets a 5 from me. The food at least a 4. It's not too punishing on the pocket either, so that's definitely a plus.

FOOD ORDERED - Soy chicken wings and French fries..
AMBIENCE & DECOR - Ambience was cool i mean it looks cool, some dope musics were playing at moderate sound, behavior was good..
FOOD REVIEW - Soy chicken wings was nice, something new it was.. Though she(my gf) found it was little bit spicy.. French fries was served with tomato ketchup and mayo, it was yum too.. I was quite surprised with the quantity of french fries, it was more thn enough.. A big thumbs up from my side. Overall it was a pleasant experience there for time pass..
SHOULD I VISIT AGAIN? Yup sure..
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM - If u guys can price Soy chicken wings at rs160 per plate it will be a steal deal.. That was just my too cents though.. Overall it was a pleasant experience..

This place was on our bucket list for a long time. Yesterday, on our first visit, we found the place amazing. We loved the decor as well as the food. The "chaiwala special tea" was made to perfection. The "Chicken sausage krunchy" was unique and very tasty. The melted-in-mouth sausage stole our heart. The "chicken spetnaz burger" was good. The choco-walnut pot cake was freshly baked and delicious. Moreover, we were amazed by the open mic show by Pupa and his group. As we had no clue that this place stages such shows on every Friday, we were pleasantly surprised. We will definitely visit the place again.

A cute little cafe with British ¬†inspired decor, this has wooden furniture and counter. I was there on a friday evening and thus attended a brilliant stand up comedy show which featured Anirban Dasgupta.. (Imagine!)
#HugeWin¬†
The menu is in form of a tabloid, which is quite interesting.¬†
The order was A DOUBLE CHOCO-CHIP FRAPPE, SOY HONEY WINGS and DOUBLE DECKER GRILLED CHICKEN BURGER.¬†
The FRAPPE was ¬†a nice mix of coffee and cream and was a little on the bitter side, just how I prefer it. However the cream felt a little heavy, and thus I think it could've been whipped a little more.¬†
The SOY HONEY WINGS ¬†could be the only reason to visit the Cafe. The acidic hit of soy, the obvious heat is deliciously countered by the honey. They probably were cooked in sesame oil. The sesame seeds add , ¬†a crispy texture to it. #musthave
Two well cooked patties, veggies and cheese, the BURGER packs a punch hitting all the correct notes. The fries were fresh and properly cooked. However I'd like a dip instead of the ketchup.¬†
All in all, Chaiwala was a fun experience and #WillVisitAgain.

BEWARE! Very very unprofessional restaurant. They accepted the order through Swiggy and kept me waiting for 45min and when the pick-up person arrived, they declined citing kitchen / chef issues and cancelled the order. This is absolute harrasment.

Why do they accept orders from Swiggy when they are not willing to process it?

Never been such a horrible experience ever. The cafe management and staff showed us down when we gave our genuine feedback about the so called Double Decker Chicken Burger. Hence, I decided to give an open feedback on Zomato so that its taken care of in future. The burger was bland, dry and tasteless with just a layer of cheese and onion stuffing unlike shown in the menu. And the behaviour of the staff was worse than the food could have been. Disrespecting your customers wont let you stay in the good books for long. Please improve your service as well as work on your behaviour rather than getting offended and showing your temperament towards unhappy customers.

The food is bad and the management is over smart. When We complained about the food they didn't charge us for that particular item but when We were leaving one of the waiter/manger came to us and gave us 2 Rs coin and said you forgot your change although we paid by card. Learn to respect your customers. Sick place.There was some open mic stand up Comedy going on which was pretty decent until a comedian cracked a rape joke and When i said it's not funny somehow I was the one offending? Rapes are funny right? Not going there ever and I'll make sure my 15-20  friends who go there on a regular basis also avoid such a place.

This cafe is located inside a lane in Tollygunge. The cafe looks very pretty from outside as well as inside. They have seating area outside also. The place is decorated with beautiful lights and paintings and artecrafts.
I went with my friends and we ordered banana smoothie, ham egg and cheese bake burger and soy-honey chicken wings. The smoothie was pretty good with perfect blend of cream, mocha and the banana slices placed perfectly. The soy- honey chicken wings are to die for. I can go back to this cafe and order it again and again. The best was kept for the last- ham egg and cheese bake burger. This beast has ham patty, an egg poach and cheese perfectly blended which makes you dive into heaven.
The food is what is going to attract you over and over again. The service is really good and they are always ready at your service. The ambience gets an A. Price is reasonable enough and I can assure that the food is worth the price. You won't be disappointed. A must visit.

I dropped by this place after a tiring day at college. Had heard good things about the cafe. Fortunately, they weren't misleading. I instantly fell in love with the decor of the place. Wooden tables and chairs along with a cowboy bar-like seating arrangement along the serving area win most points! I ordered soy Honey Chicken Wings, Double Decker Grilled Chicken Burger and Choco Walnut Pot Cake. The burger was excellent, and pretty big for the price. The chicken wings were too good, but a tad too spicy for my taste. The pot cake was a disappointment for me, at least. The prices are inclusive of all taxes, so that's a plus. The service, however, is slow and lax at times. Won't mind trying some other dishes at this place again.

Intro: After, a long self imposed hiatus it was good to be back to proper human life!! God only knows how much I missed a decent ambience, glittery lights, slow edm playing on the background, people chatting and above all the heady aroma of food! We just walked into all of the aforesaid things. It was a Sunday evening, so it was crowded and weirdly we ( 4 of us) appreciated that!

Location: it's pretty near to the malancha cinemas Tollygunge, in a bylane, with ample parking space.

Ambience: My friend's were a regular here , it was our ( my wife n I) 1st time. As informed, the place is redecorated. It looked nice ; the glitter , the glamour, the chai "bar" concept of adding high stools in front of the bar, all looked swell. The music was nice.

Service: it was slow, definitely slow. 

Food: we ordered  two cups of chaiwalla chai , two cups of ginger honey tea and a soy honey chicken wings. 
The ginger honey tea was usual but the soy honey chicken wings was delicious. 4, chunky pieces of fried chicken wings, coated with soy honey garnished with garlic pieces was just the start I needed after my break.
Well it was sunday evening and we were also catching up with our pent up adda , so we decided to order a plate of masala french fry and a pork pepperoni sandwich. It took ages to serve em.
 But it was there, at last. The French fry was usual , a tad bit spicy. The pork pepperoni sandwich, also fell short of my expectations!
The ladies ordered a plate of waffles in classic Belgium maple syrup and later a pancake in honey and jam. Both were okayish, nothing extraordinary.

Price: it's very reasonable. All of these costed us a 1000 bux.

Conclusion: to sum it up, we loved the decor, the ambience, the people in there, the soy honey fried chicken wings but rest of the food were okayish. 

Ps: please ensure the pace of the service.

Location(4.5):This place is located Right on the road that goes from Toly metro towards Ranikuthi/Garia.
It is a stones throw from Tolygunge‚Äã metro and The place is fairly easy to spot.

Ambience(4.2): It has an extremely cute and cozy seating arrangement with a perky and comforting decor.Ideal place for a first date or for college friends to meet up and have a get together.

Food(4.6):Food here is Seriously awesome.Though some of the teas we planned to have were not available,but the two dishes Honey & soy glazed Chicken‚Äã wings and Freshly baked Choco Walnut Pot cake is worth the hype.Plus the quantity is adequate for two people to share.Which is a plus for college goers with limited pocket money.

Service:(3.5)The service was okish, but forgivable considering the fact that the place was packed on a Sunday evening and they have a small kitchen.
The washroom was clean and well maintained.


Overall this is a cozy lil cafe to come back to for a nice time provided its an odd time and there isn't too much crowd.Food is good and its easy on the pocket too.

This place was on my list since long. Finally yesterday I visited this place during the late evening hours and so I missed the stand up comedy which they organise every Friday . I simply loved the cosy interiors and the ambience. The staff was very friendly. The burgers on the menu were quite interesting. We ordered a non virgin mojito, soy honey chicken wings, hangover burger and ham,egg,cheese burger. The chicken wings were finger licking good. The best I have had yet in the city. The burgers were stomach filling and worth drooling for. The service was also quite fast. Would love to visit the place again and try the other burgers on the menu and also the Fri Eve to catch up .

It's at a five minute walk from Tollygunge metro. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. The food tastes brilliant. We tried the strawberry lemonade, cafe mocha, veg cold sandwich, veg burger and Nutella pancakes! I was mind blown with each of them. They all tasted very good. As a vegetarian‚Äã, I only had a few choices, but I wouldn't complain. If you like cosy places with not too loud music , you must visit them. Not to forget, the staff are super friendly and the service is very prompt!!

This is the best cafe of the city.

The wooden decore with the perfect music makes the ambience one of a kind.

The food was great too.
It's worth the money.


They have something special on Friday, 6 PM weekly.
Don't miss it.

Kolkata has seen the growth of a large number of cafes all over the city for the last couple of years, and each one of them try to bring in something new to the circuit. The Chaiwala is no different. It compensated for its lack of space by being the perfect adda-zone for the gossip-loving Bengalis. And how can adda be complete without a few punches? Chaiwala takes this to a more serious level by providing an open mic to budding stand up comedians every Friday 6 p.m onwards.

I was not aware of this fact until I ended up in one of those sessions, and soon found myself rolling in laughter. As I said, the place is cramped for space, but the decor and the ambiance will not let you complain. Minus the usual crowd that the place manages to pack in, it is the kind of cafe I would love to frequent to idle my time away. Add to it, the pocket friendly menu and the good taste, the place definitely manages to win my heart.

I had ordered for the specialities - Soy Honey Chicken Wings, Double Decker Grilled Chicken Burger and Choco Walnut Pot Cake. The Chicken Wings are very different from the usual, and even though it's a little hot and spicy, the taste is enjoyable. The Chicken Burger comes in with fries and it's a delight! I found it a little dry, but overall the taste is pretty good for the price. The Potcake, topped with vanilla ice cream isn't the kind of dessert I prefer to end my meals with, but for those who prefer their desserts less sweet, it's a recommended dish.

The best part about the Cafe though, is the fact that the prices are all tax-inclusive. Prime location, good food, cosy ambiance, good jokes - what more do you want? Recommended.

Went there post the renovation. Honestly speaking, I'm not aware why I withheld the .5 ratings. Will be a complete 5 if things go as it went the first time. No questions about food, ambience, staff, decor. Absolutely the best experience I've ever had within a budget.

Edit: Went there a few more times and the experience was just top class. Changing my rating to 5.

After little research in Zomato thought of trying out The Chaiwala. Nice cozy place with really interesting decor. We ordered Mustard and Chicken Cold sandwich which was tasty and quite filling. The blueberry smoothie was also quite nice though a little sweet for my palate.. Me and my friend quite liked the lively ambiance.

One piece of advice that I will like to give them is that they can make the burger more juicy n tangy by adding more sauce and caramelised onions and a bit more of seasoning on the chicken ... Thats all and it will create the magic... 
The pancakes and waffles were  like tasting heaven on earth, even the soy honey chicken wings were spicy and crispy...

Simply best and yet classic place I have ever visit. Nice place to visit with your closed ones. The food we ordered was chicken wings, grilled chicken sandwich, soups, burgers etc.. all I say the items were fresh, fried, the texture were amazing, very well tossed. The wings were little crispy. The burgers were fluffy¬†and moist. The ambiance was like old school coffee shop at the 1950s.The interiors were very cosy and yet charming.

I am a regular here. Their soy chicken wings, spicy cheese chicken sandwiches and lemon iced tea are my staple.¬†

The soy honey wings are absolutely banging with flavours, and it actually finds the right balance between sweetness and spiciness. ¬†I personally would have liked a drizzling of oregano with a pinch of thyme, but it's great as it already is.

The cheese chicken sandwiches are also bursting with chicken and cheese, and they grill it to give it a crispy finish.

I have also tried their Schezwan penne pasta, and would personally like it if it were a bit more hotter with chilli flakes. Nevertheless, I am sure that it would be just right for most of the people, as hotness tolerance limit is not the same for all.¬†

I have also tried their white sauce pasta, and particularly like it because of the smokiness, in spite of my hatred for white sauce in general. That smokiness actually gives a much-needed relief to the white sauce.¬†

My friends have tried the Darjeeling and the Earl Grey Tea as well, and they are fond of the Earl Grey in particular.¬†

The French Fries come with a mildly spicy mayo dip, which is fabulous.

The cold chicken salad is another gem in their menu. Finely chopped coleslaw with the right mix of mayonnaise serving as a bed for slices of chicken meatloaf to rest upon, it's delicious as well as wholesome. If they could just refrigerate the coleslaw before serving, it would have been awesome. Personally, I would like to have a dressing of Dijon mustard or maybe some lemon vinaigrette to go with it. Again, it's just a suggestion, and the one they currently serve is already moreish.¬†

The service time is not very fast. The entire ambiance is idyllic, homely, cozy and laid-back. The tableware they use has a uniquely rustic feel. James, the guy who is kind of a supervisor around here, is an extremely friendly guy, and will likely ask you whether the dish was perfect or not. Believe me, that question is not a perfunctory one. They actually value the feedback you give them.

Whenever I am stressed out, I come here and sip a cup of Lemon iced tea with a spicy cheese chicken sandwich, and I can feel the stress waning away. The ambiance has a magical relaxing effect.

This place is a must try, in my opinion. They also have a comedy night on Friday, from 6-7pm, for the ones who want their funny bones to be tickled.

It was there in my bucket list since a long time, and I finally managed to visit this place today with my best friend. We reached there at around 7.45pm, and all the tables were full. Sadly, the seating capacity is very less. Only 5 tables! And there were two chairs just in front of the waiters, and it feels too awkward to sit over there. Having no choice, we had to take that awkward seats, because we had to go back a long way, and we didn't have much time to wait.

Then we ordered Irish Latte, Chocolate Smoothie, White Sauce Chicken Pasta and Mushroom Onion and Cheese Sandwich. The service was on the slower side, but the taste of each and every item was too good. The Irish Latte was one of the best I tasted, and Chocolate Smoothie was perfectly blended! The pasta was totally yum, and i felt like licking each and every drop of the sauce, only for table manners that I controlled myself!üòù The Sandwich was good, but the flavour of mushroom wasn't prominent.

This place is worth more visits, and other items need to be tried as well. It misses the perfect 5 rating because of less seating arrangement and slow service.

Absolutely loved this new find! Thanks to Zomato for suggesting it to me..
A tiny little 2bhk flat on the ground floor of a building place, done up with a quirky boho vibe, this place sells sandwiches, burgers, pastas, shakes, coffees and offcourse chai! They serve pork and bacon as well, an absolute point winner! A simple menu, with a specials board to add on, this place serves good, hearty food in generous portions which are well priced. We ordered the Bacon Tornado burger, the pork n bacon grilled sandwich, American BBQ wings, Lime sodas and a Blueberry shake. I found the Blueberry shake to be overtly sweet but found everything else to be good. Loved the small curio shop next to the entrance as well. Would definitely visit this place as many times as I can every time I visit Kolkata!

The best bit is you can sit and chit chat for a looong time without being interrupted by anyone. The seating area is a little small for such a wonderful cafe.

I m gonna go there to try out the burgers. They are a must!

On my return to Kolkata after four months, the one place whose name was on everyone's lips is The Chaiwala. So I went twice, once yesterday, once today. It's a tiny place off NSC Bose Road with cheery wooden interiors. Yesterday I ordered the grilled ham and cheese sandwich and a cappuccino, while my friend had the cheese potato garlic pops and a Peach iced tea. My sandwich was huge! It was well stuffed with salami and cheese and was a meal in itself. The cheese pops had lots of flavour and made for good munchies. The coffee was nice - it actually tasted like coffee and not just milk, and came with two butter biscuits. The Peach iced tea was a really refreshing drink - so much so, in fact, that I ordered it for myself today. The other things I tried today were the bacon tornado burger, the cold mustard and chicken sandwich and the soy honey chicken wings. The burger had lots of meat and cheese and was really yummy. The sandwich was great, although I think I would have liked it better grilled. The wings were the best - super spicy and super flavourful, just the way I like them! Prices are surprisingly reasonable, and service is friendly. This really is a gem of a place. An absolute must for cafe lovers. Eagerly awaiting my next visit.

I had ordered the earl grey tea and got some warm water complimentary as a 'second drink',the tea to be infused was the same. other than that, had also ordered their lemon ice tea and Chaiwala cha. The ice ta was good, cha was okay. Had the omlette and pasta and my friend had ordered a hot chocolate. For the sweet dish, we went for chocolate Nutella pancakes. Nice experience. Would totally recommend it for a quiet outing with a group of school friends. Enjoy!

After 5-6 cancelled plans, finally I visited the chaiwala...which had been in my wishlist since a looong time. 
I absolutely loved the place. It is a small cafe with a cool decor. They have got wooden benches and tables which is very unique. There are 5 tables which can accommodate about 16-17 people. 
Coming to the food... We ordered grilled chicken burger which came with french fries and ketchup, chicken wings both honey soy and American. Those chicken wings are the best in town for me. The honey soy one was a sit sweet due to honey but the american one was really spicy and tasty. The burger tasted good enough but I expected a bigger size. 
Coming to deserts... This time we only ordered Choco walnut pot cake which was amaaazing... 
The service is good... Staffs are well mannered. 
I'm absolutely in love with this place. Definitely coming back..

Located in Tollygaunge,it wasn't tough to be spotted.The interiors are nicely decorated with paintings and cute seating arrangements.The ambience is in a word perfect !!

The food was quite reasonably priced.We ordered :

‚ñ™Oreo Frappe : It was very tasty.

‚ñ™ Cheesy Chicken Sandwich : They serve two sandwiches.The sandwich was the best one we ever tasted !! Recommended.

‚ñ™ Grilled Chicken Burger : This one was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint us at all.It melted in our mouth and was really good !!

‚ñ™ Choco Walnut Pot Cake : If you visit this place,you should not miss this at all.It brings water in your mouth,the moment you see it.It tastes simply amazing !!

The service was good enough.

In a word,this place is one of the best places in Kolkata for hangout !!

Have you ever been to a place and knew instantly that you are going to be back there again? Well, for me it definitely has to be The Chaiwala. The ambiance is pretty slick with quality music to keep you company. I always go back for the Lemon Ice Tea and soy honey pops. The pasta needs a bit of work on blending the spices well. But that's just about the only thing amiss. The staff is cordial and funny and who doesn't appreciate a sense of humor? A sure go to cafe place for all ages here in Kolkata.

The ambience is nice and cosy though the washroom isn't, proving it's mostly a facade. Food is ordinary. We tried their special tea. The only special thing about it was it came in an earthern container. Shredded chicken omelette was nothing extraordinary. Bacon tornado was not so succulent. Sandwiches were very dry too. Service was slow. They violated the order in which we wanted our food items to be served. They asked if we are okay sharing our table with strangers. I don't know any place apart from roadside stalls who ask that. Before we were done paying, they allowed another party to take over our table. Overall, a forgettable experience. They failed in every parameter possible. May be it was an odd day but I don't have the heart to revisit this place and find out.

This one is located in tollygunj, a little difficult to locate. It's a cosy cafe where you can go with close friends and enjoy food. Ambience is good. Decor is done well, the photos reflecting the chai culture of Kolkata. Coming to the food, we ordered burger, pasta, soy wings, and Oreo shake. Soy wings stood out in all the three. The burgers were not as expected. Even the Oreo shake was okay kind. Overall experience was okay. The food can be done better.

Ambiance is the best thing about this place. They play such great instrumentals. Couldn't resist from not asking the staff which artist they were playing.

I wanted to try out this place from such a long time and had heard so much about this place. With such high hopes, the food was a big let down here.

We ordered a Chaiwala Special Tea and an Apple Snyder for a drink. American Spicy Wings, a Grilled Chicken Burger and a White Sauce Veg Pasta.
The Chaiwala Special was served with two toast biscuits. Good tea, it was! The Apple Snyder was okay.
Grilled Chicken Burger was dry. The pasta lacked something. The basic herbs were missing. That balance of salt and little sweet was not there. Didn't like it. The Chicken Wings were okay too.

Zomato says ‚Çπ350 for two but it's more. Even though, no extra tax is charged.
Very disappointed with the food. Not sure if coming back!

A cute and cosy little place located in the by lanes of Tollygunj, about 10 mins from the metro station, The Chaiwala stands out from a whole lot of similar places by doing a lot of things just right. The wooden themed decor with nicely chosen photo frames of Kolkata and the people of Kolkata donning the walls is serene. The ever smiling and friendly staff, the classy choice of music (played at the right volume to not hinder a good conversation), the free wifi and the overall laid back ambiance sets up the perfect scene for an adda over good food and coffee.

This place is 10 mins walk from the Tollygunje Metro station.
A beautifully decorated cafe,pocket friendly,ideal for hangouts,good music and some real good,tax free food. üòç
I had been here thrice.
We have tried Chaiwala special chai,Iced Lemon tea,Vanilla tea.The teas taste pretty good.
The oreo frappe is delicious.Non virgin mojito is absolutely refreshing.
The soy honey chicken wings is a must have here.
Another signature item we love is Walnut pot cake with ice cream.
Well,we tried grilled chicken burger,mustard mayo chicken burger.The burgers are very tasty and comes with good proportion of french fies.
Also,the chicken spaghetti in chesse chilli garlic totally allures the taste buds.
The chicken penne pasta in mixed sauce tastes nice too.
I will personally recommend this place to all the college students.

A lovely place to spend your evening with friends over some tea and some munchies...and if you are hungry, they have got some good sandwiches,burgers and pasta on the list. The Chaiwala special tea is a must have for anyone who loves the tea the aroma of the tea makes me crave for more of it. I ended up having some French fries...mushroom sandwich and a egg cheese grilled sandwich and every food was worth a penny.

We have been putting of visiting this place since last year...as we always found "someplace nicer" to go to... but the first thing that came to my mind once i took a bite of that double decker grilled chicken burger was.. " WHY??" Why did we ever put off visiting here...!!! 

Considering its miniature size it attracts a large number of people ... and not only young ppl but also middle aged ppl... but that might be because of the next door lifestyle store they have... its fairly easy to locate ... situated at a 2- 3 mins walkable distance from tollygunge tram depot petrol pump, its on the lane opposite to Silver Screen.

Now coming to the food... we ordered jasmine tea, the double decker burger , a chilli garlic chicken spagetti , and a oh!oreo. As i mentioned before the food was excrptionally mouthwatering and delightful. The chicken patty in the burger was soooo juicyy.. and not to forget the luscious spagetti... and the yummylicious dessert oh! Oreo every toothsome spoonful really let you go ... oooooh!!!ooorrreeeooo. (Just being cheecky here .. but i think i made m point) 

Special mentions ... 
1. Pwrfect choice of music
2. Lady chef ( u dont see that in too many places)
3. Prices are inclusive of taxes
4. Quantity serves 2
5. Quality - they dont go miser on the meat portions..

Cosy, warm, beautiful ambience.

We had ordered Cheese-Tomato-Corn Sandwiches, Soy-Honey Wings, American Hot Wings and Chicken Popcorn.
All of it was simply fantastic, and the best part was the quantity. We were four people and except the popcorn, all came in four pieces. The bill inclusive of taxes came to 550.
The sandwiches were simply awesome and the spicy aftertaste they left in the mouth was actually good though I could do without it.
The wings were juicy and perfectly done, while the popcorn was accompanied by a mayo dip that just goes with everything.

I ordered the grilled chicken burger as recommended by my friend. I was not at all disappointed. The price is reasonable as well. I heard about the pot cake which they make and ordered that as well. When the pot cake came it was love at first sight for me üòã and it tasted yummm. I can go on adding the 'm' in yum!! All my friends were more than satisfied with this cafe. The staffs are friendly as well,they know how to treat customers!! Will surely visit again and again!!

2.Grilled Chicken Burger: A great burger it was with the right amount of chilli..and served with french fries and tomato sauce.RECOMMENDED!
3.Soy Honey Chicken Wings:Chicken wings don't have the honey flavour...and is garlicky..not up to the mark.
4.Nutella Burst Grill Cake:A plate contains 5 pieces..very fulfilling..very chocolaty!!RECOMMENDED!
5.Choco Walnut Pot Cake with ice cream:A much awaited try was not worth the wait.

The chaiwala was one of the cafes in our list that we wanted to explore in kolkata. It looks very elegant and the interiors are very beautiful. It is damn reasonable. I mean we had around 6 things just in 800 bucks. The attenders are really sweet and their service is quite fast.

Me and my friends ordered one chicken white sauce pasta, one schzewan pasta, one grilled chicken burger, one grilled chicken sandwich, choco walnut brownie and one dementor's kiss.

I personally didnt like the burger and the sandwich. The quantity and quality was good but the taste didn't go with my taste buds.

The white sauce pasta had a weird smell. The pasta was drenched in thick sauce and the chicken was very fresh but it was a bit bland. We asked for chilli flakes and other seasoning. After adding that the taste was okay but the smell was still unbearable.

The best dish was the schzewan pasta. It had lots of flavours and veggies. It was a perfect amalgamation of Chinese and Italian food. I totally loved it.

The Dementor's kiss was a spicy drink. For me, the combination of schzewan pasta and dementor's kiss worked really well.

Lastly for dessert, we ordered choco walnut brownie. It looked so good both in menu and in reality that we thought we would love it. Unfortunately, that was not the case. We thought we will get melted chocolate inside the brownie but there was nothing of that sort. The brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. When we ate the combination of ice cream and brownie, it tasted amazing. After the ice cream had finished, the brownie was hardly edible.

Overall,
Food - 2.5/5
Ambience- 3.5/5
Service- 4.5/5
Value for money - 2.5/5

This is a really nice little cafe tucked away in the lanes of Tollygunge just beside Graham's Kitchen. The chocolate walnut pot cake is a really innovative and interesting dessert. The sandwiches and omelettes are huge and even the quantity of coffee is good. All over it's a pretty affordable cafe, considering the amount of food they serve. Great choice for hanging out with friends and family. Would definitely recommend The Chaiwala to everyone.

It's hard to locate the place if you aren't too familiar with Tollygunge. It took us a while to get to the place. The place is decent, in terms of food. We ordered Grilled Chicken Burger which was delicious. The American hot wings was good too.  The lemon ices tea went well with those. The Creamy Cheese Penne was however a let down. Being a food blogger and having over 200 recipes on my blog, I can confidently say it wasn't anything great, tasted like homemade pasta. That was disappointing.

The seating capacity inside is limited and since we were just 2 people, they moved us from a 4 seater to a 2 seater. The table was tiny and had space for two dishes only. That said, the place is pocket friendly and the staff was super friendly.

A cosy little place in Graham's Land but it sure packs in a punch. Amicable staff, nice wooden decor and a relaxed outlook defines it. We decided to hang out at this all of a sudden and were left smiling ear to ear. The food was quick and yummy. The drinks were good as well. I will have to mention Dementor's Kiss because it was a wacky yet awesome drink. I wonder how they made it. This is the go-to place for fun evenings without burning a hole in your pocket.. Loved it.

Enjoyed my time in a cafe after so long!
This new addition is a boon to the people of tollygunge area which lacked a good cafe for the longest period of time..
So to cut the long story short :
Food : tried the spicy chicken cheese sandwich which was mouth-wateringly delicious.. the cheese garlic bread was okay though.. i bet the pastas & burgers won't disappoint u..
Exotic Tea : tried the kashmiri kawa green tea and the jasmine tea.. the former was spicy and aromatic while the latter had a sweet smell.. both were smooth on the palate.. and the best part is that you get one free refill! but these are definitely not for the people who prefer masala tea over the flavoured ones..
Service : quite slow! I was clueless when it took around 20 minutes to serve the tea which involved hot water, tea bags and sugar sachets only..
Pocket Pinch : it does not pinch your pocket heavily as considered to other cafes in our city..
Ambience : quirky decor.. free wifi.. low music.. smoking area available.. lots of parking space as the cafe is inside a lane (right next to Graham's kitchen)..

I am sure to give it a visit again not just because it's near to my place, also as i could connect to the vibe of the place and those sandwiches have completely won me over..
Coming back soon!

My first visit to this place had been great since I was starving for food since morning when a friend suggested this place to me. I was pretty worried about the budget when I was assured that the place provides food at pocket friendly prices and i had to say yes then. 
Ambience,  to start with is a feel good factor for the innovative craft works around and the fact that they have used a small place tactfully to satisfy customers. 
We ordered a Chocolate  shake and the famous  Honey chicken wings followed by a cheese chicken sandwich and a chilly cheese chicken sandwich and then a chilly garlic pasta. It ended with Chai and a dessert which consisted of an ice cream cake kind. 
And you will be surprised  to know that our billing amount was just  Rs 965! 
Quality  and quantity  of the items are too good to be true and i have fallen in love with  this place. 
It also has got an attached boutique where you can sneak in to check unique and creative artworks. 
This place is a must for all the college goers or couples or anybody  who is still thinking whether they should go or not. 
P.s- I love their songs playlist :p

My visit was way back , like four months ago. It was short time i spent here,so could not sample enough of their menu. The STRAWBERRYCINO and the HAZZLENUTCINO were our choices , the former likeable , the latter overtly sweet. The pasta SCHEZWAN PENNE tasted nice in desi style. Friendly staff. The bench style interiors are cozy made for groups and wall paintings of tea stalls over the city goes well with the theme. The outside one table was the best spot that we chose for , coffee puffs and light snackies . Perfect!

The Grilled chicken Burger was Super Yammmm!!! It melts in mouth almost. Loved it üíï
N that Choco Walnut Pot Cake, the one and only place in town that serves this. This is simply mouth watering. N the favorite of the lot from the evening.

It's a small c√†fe on NSC bose road ( Take a left from Tollygunge metro,5 mins walk. Next lane beside Graham's kitchen) with quirky d√©cor. Nice place to hang out with a nice, hot cup of coffee or a chilled mocktail. But, the must try is their "Chicken wings" There are 3 types. We went for the spicy one (American BBQ) and it's one of the best chicken wings we had for a long time! Along with it, we had Hazelnut and Caramel coffees. We also tried Chicken sausage krunchy and the dessert was the mouth watering baked "pot cake with ice cream". Highly recommend!!

The Chaiwala was in my bucket list for a long time. 
It is located in Graham's Land, a 5 minute walk from the Tollygunge Metro Station. 
The cafe is not at all difficult to locate. 
The decor is good and the ambience is nice. 
The staff is friendly too. 
I visited with a friend in the evening after an afternoon of heavy shopping before the Pujas. So we were hungry. 
There are fewer tables compared to most cafes. 
But it was not very crowded. If you want to sit in fresh air, there is a sitting arrangement outside too.
Now, coming to the food.
We ordered a Chaiwala Special Tea, Non-Virgin Mojito, Chicken Sausage Crunchy and a Cheesy Chicken Sandwhich.
The Tea came in a "bhaar" and gave the feels. 
It was basically adrak elaichi tea. The quantity was quiet good. 
The non virgin mojito tasted dfferent and good. 
The Chicken Sausage Crunchy was delicious. 
We loved it. It was creamy and saucy and the herbs in it made it better. 
The Cheesy Chicken Sandwhich, was BIG, cut into 2 pieces, it has chicken mixed with cheese, bell peppers and herbs. Its simple yet tasty. 
The pocket pinch made us happy.
Its worth it.
It has a boutique too. Drop in after you are done eating. :)
Will visit again.

Well, one of the warmest food joints I have ever visited in Kolkata. Recommended by some friends, we took a chance to visit The Chaiwala. The place is small but what I loved most is their decoration throughout the place. With a mind blowing ambience they play soft musics & sometimes funky songs too. Let them be the hosts, front desk staffs were way too friendly to make us feel homely.
Now, what is this place about is food and I must admit, they just not only serve a great quality of it but they give you a super quantity of it. We ordered a Double choco-chip frappe along with a Cheesy Chicken and Grilled Chicken Burger with French Fries. & we also had an order of Choco Walnut Pot Cake & the best thing of these were the dessert one. It was so tasty & the cake was extremely fluffy. Also their frappe tasted dark & smooth enough to melt your heart with. Totally recommending these items to taste.
It might not have a vast area to offer but I have fallen in love with its elegance, its charming atmosphere. A fantastic cafe to spend some beautiful time.

I have come here a lot of times before and was never disappointed with the food. But this time I came majorly to satisfy some major pancake cravings. So we ordered the Honey Butter pancakes, along with the Double Decker Chicken burger (Because it looks so appetizing on the menu you can't not order it) and Oreo shake. 
We sat outside since it was 8pm and crowded. The pancakes were soft with a good helping of honey and butter and went well with the slight chilly weather. The burger was finished in two bites because the patty was soft and moist with adequate fillings. Didn't taste the Oreo shake but the cookies with it were great (they were Oreo, duh). Went all the way from Saltlake for a quick dinner and came back warm and satiated so full marks for that. A little more prompt service for us poor people pushed outside in the crowded cafe would've been better but not complaining.

The rating surely makes it easier to determine how my experience was.
I am totally in love with The Chaiwala.
It's a small cosy cafe In Tollygunge.
I went here with one of my friends .We were awestruck with the decor.It's wonderful and so pleasing.We looked into the menu and was so pleasantly surprised to find a Chandler Bing Reference.
Anyway after some time we decided to order
‚óè Pasta in White Sauce
‚óè Chocolate Pot Cake with Icecream
Firstly the Pasta - It was well cooked in ample amounts of white sauce and the quantity was pretty overwhelming. Ample amounts of olives , sweet corn , carrots ,capsicum, brocolli.It was really yummy and easy on the tummy. :)
Coming To the Pot Cake - It was a absolute stunner.Look wise and taste wise.Heavenly & blissfull.
The cake was so well baked with walnuts and icecream with choco sprinkles. This item is totally recommended.
The service is very good. 
All in all extremely satisfied.
Big Thumbs Up. üëç

We've ordered Grilled chiken burger, soy-honey chicken wings, double choco chip frappe, snow white.. 
Burger was good enough but it could have been better in chicken portion.‚ò∫
 Soy-Honey wings was cooked nicely soooo delicious & mouth watering also. I would love to have this item again & again. üòä
Those who loves actual coffee they can have double choco chip frappe, it tastes slight bitter but aromatic also.
Snow white was not so good,full of nuts..üòê

I had heard of this place through word of mouth. A quaint little spot tucked away in the lanes of Tollygunge, it is a lovely cafe if you do manage to find a spot to sit! It is tiny and the place tends to fill up pretty quick. 
We ordered an exotic mango tea, hot chocolate, a Spanish omelette and ham and cheese sandwiches. Both the omelette and sandwiches were very well done. The former was adequately cooked with vegetables and was neither too oily nor over fried. The sandwich had crispy ham with substantial amounts of melted cheese and stuffing. The latter had a slightly spicy undertone which I loved. The quantities were substantial as well. My friend loved his hot chocolate and the mango tea was average. 
Definitely returning!

Cafe mocha was soul-satisfyingly good served with two cookies.  The soy honey wings and crunchies were something new and just as good.  And lastly the good old grilled Burger..  The Patty was not fried and thank God for that!  It was simply heavenly.  All in all a great place to to visit for brunch.

I have been to this place thrice. I like the casual ambience about this place. The staff is really friendly, the music is good, the food is kinda great.

I've tasted the following stuff from the menu and hope to try the other dishes too. 
Soy honey chicken wings: Too sweet for my taste, 
Choco walnut pot cake : Super, 
strawberry smoothie: It was kinda good, 
Bacon omelette: We thought it was kinda bland,
 Cheese sauce pasta: Too good
 Chicken schezwan penne was too saucy, not that spicy.
I haven't tasted the burgers as yet but I'd like to visit again and taste them soon.

Set in a quintessential lane of Tollygunge this tea joint is a must visit for food lovers. A cozy little joint with simple yet elegant wood work and furniture, this place has a very positive vibe. The black and white graffiti on the walls at the entrance is a reflection of the passion with which the place has been set up. The tiny book shelf and the tea bar set up is something very new and innovative. I loved the stuff hanging on the bar counter. The Hanuman model is a favourite already. The ceramic used for serving food and tray is much appreciated. The earthen touch adds to the look and feel of The Chaiwala. 
Coming to the menu, they serve a wide variety of food from burgers to pastas, ice creams and cakes... Tea and coffee being the obvious items on the menu. We tried the double decker chicken burger and the tornado burger. Both the burgers were excellent; its the Tornado which is mind blowing with the bacon and cheese in it. One word to describe it... Orgasmic. We also tried the walnut brownie pot cake and its a sweet treat to remember for a long time. The softness of the walnut cake just lingers... And lingers. We were too full to try anything else this time. Have kept the wish list of trying their chicken wings and Chai on our next visit. Price is reasonable enough and the service was excellent. We also ended up buying a few cups and diaries from the Bohurupi boutique on our way out. Overall its an excellent place to gorge on good food and enjoy the serenity of the place.

Visited once (hoping to visit again soon though) and it was a pleasant one. Heard of this place from a friend and searched it up on Zomato, finding quite a lot positive reviews about the food. We were not disappointed surely. Located on a small gully very close to Tollygunge Metro, this place is totally a cozy warm little place for spending a nice evening. We ordered Chicken Grilled Burger and Soy Chicken Wings. Both were good in taste and generous amount as well. The Burger patty however I felt could be improved in taste. Looking at the menu now after about 6 months from my visit, I can see they have added some options in the burger section which is pretty good. Surely will try to taste them all. The Soy chicken wings were nicely done with the tangy flavor of sauce and any one having a liking for spicy & tangy food is going to be absolutely delighted with this dish. Overall it was a great visit!Only con is the place is pretty small actually and you would surely have to wait about 30 mins or so in a normal evening. Probably more on weekends.

A little away from tollygunge metro... this is one amazing place to be.
Well lit, clean and minimalist d√©cor makes this place comfortable, cozy and extremely charming.
It was raining outside and so we just decided to have a cup of latte which turned out to be good enough.
The caramel frappe was even better with the aroma of coffee n the sweet taste of caramel.
The soy honey chicken wings was a real stunner. Hot and spicy.... with a tinge of sweetness.
However the star of the day was a burger.... easily one of the best ones in recent times.
And just when we thought we are done with it.... we felt like having a peach iced tea.... which turned out to be as good as everything else.
An amazing experience.... totally worth the price!

Soothing atmosphere, well decorated rather a bit funky. Service was too good, staffs were well-behaved. We ordered chocolate-banana shake, soy-honey chicken hotwings(a must try), penne pasta in white sauce(must try) , chocolate pot cake with vanilla ice cream, mini scoopers.. A cozy place to hang out with friends for hours..would love to visit the place again.

We ordered a bacon tornado burger (it's a must try ) , an oreo Frappe (again a must try for all milk shake people or cold coffee people) one green tea and chicken salad and chicken wings (again a must must must try for those who like spicy food) and after all these the bill came around 790 including tax and everything..
So I will suggest this place and definitely will pay another visit sometime soon..üòä

We were feeling experimental and decided to drop in at our friendly neighbourhood cafe. The Chaiwala is a cosy little cafe near Tollygunge metro station. It also has a teeny-weeny little boutique attached to it. Thanks to our experimental streak, we ordered a 'Strawberrycino' (a strawberry flavoured cappuccino), a honey lemon tea and a cold chicken salad. The strawberry cappuccino was a tad sweet even without the sugar, the honey lemon tea was extremely soothing and the salad was pretty good. Lots of chicken and veggies, all presented in a lovely little bowl with grilled chicken on top. I would definitely like to go back to this place for a nice little chit-chat with friends and to try their wide array of teas.

A nice cozy joint for having your evening brunches. Seats are comparatively less. We have to wait outside for 15mins. Service is good and helpfull. Earl grey was nice compared to other places. Sandwitches are average. We ordered the most popular thing here the bacon tornado. It didn't disappoint us though it can be a bit more spicy. Overall a small joint where you can have your evening chitchats with a sip of tea and munches. Big groups should come early or have to wait outside for a few moment cause they have only one big table inside. Hope to be back in recent days.

We ordered the Veggie Delight burgers and its the only burger option for vegetarians here. Also had an espresso to go with it.
Burger is served with fries and a ketchup. The buns and the patty were fresh. Had a couple of processed cheese slices,lettuce and some sauce in it. The lettuce was too thin and hence couldn't make out the crunch. With so much hype around its burgers, I expected a better patty. Though fresh, it was a bit bland and I am pretty sure the chef didn't spice it up as much it should be.The patty though had all fresh ingredients in it which is commendable and they didn't just microwave some frozen ones.
What was a steal for me was the espresso. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was here. It was perfectly steamed up and was a great kick to the taste buds.Highly refreshing after downing so many fries.

Small cozy hidden gem cafe to chill out with friends for hours. They do also have an outdoor seating arrangements. Food is excellent. Ordered Hazelnut shake and a bacon burger - one of the best cheesy burger with chunks of stuffed meat served with french fries at reasonable price. Staffs are very friendly and service met my expectation. The ambience reflects some of the black and white pictures of kolkata heritages.

Tollygunge is not a place with many cafes.though recently few places have started and most of them are amazing.this is one of them.the inside decor is wooden finish with din yellow lights.. Perfect place to hangout or old frnz reunion spot. They also have a couple of tables outside just in their portico.they have many many many tea types and from their the name  comes I guess

What makes The Chaiwala a caf√©? Good staff, humble food and beautiful ambiance. To start with, The Chaiwala lives up to every bit of that. The menu is straight-forward and no nonsense. The people there are the most cheerful people you've ever come across.¬†To begin with James will ask you for your order with the biggest smile on his face while Dimpy will be the most¬†cheerful and excited to assist you with the Wi-Fi password¬†and Ravi is the coolest server the industry has seen. "But Ayush, the¬†food has to be¬†expensive to live up to all that good name right?" Nah-uh, if you can pay 500 rupees to get 200+ likes on your Instagram burger¬†upload #Chili's or #CafeMezzuna¬†you most certainly can pay 260 rupees for the delectable Bacon Tornado burger or 90 rupees for the oh-so-bold Cappuccino made from the best Lavazza beans¬†at #TheChaiwala15 (follow them¬†on Instagram).

Now the Chaiwala doesn't only settle your food cravings, what it also settles is your craving for the latest¬†fashion. Bohurupi enters the scene here, situated next door it is a boutique that displays the work of¬†designer¬†Roy who has put up a nice collection for both men and women.¬†Along with¬†apparel you get crafted crockery, earthenware,¬†notebooks and art as well.

So Ayush you¬†ought to have¬†some favourites that sets this place apart from other caf√©s¬†in town right? I was waiting for this part. The range of speciality teas,¬†soy honey chicken wings, bacon and ham sandwich, pot cake, cappuccino and the Oreo frappe surely does that.

Nice, cosy place with a friendly vibe. The place was tiny but well decorated with wooden tables and benches and glassware. The prices are very cheap compared to other caf√©s of the area. Serves the regular caf√© fare like variety of teas, coffee, frappes, along with nibbles. We ordered for the Lemon Iced Tea, Double Choco-chip Frappe, Vanilla Cino, and Caramel Cino. Loved all the stuff. The service was prompt. Would definitely return to try their array of burgers and finger foods.

Visited this much awaited cafe which i have bookmarked for a long time.. located in tollygunge, the location is good and pretty convenient...it is a very cool cafe with amazing ambience ... the staffs are good and friendly as well... now, coming to food.. we ordered
1) a chaiwala special tea
2) ham and cheese sandwich
3) soy honey wings and
4) dark desire mini scooper..
They took a little long in serving the food but the foods were worth the wait... it was delicious...
The special tea was the typical masala tea.. what i really liked about them was they stuck with the theme and served the tea in a matir bhaar.. it was refreshing..
The sandwich was very healthy, stuffed with ingredients inside.. it was yum as well...
Then, the soy honey wings was beautifully served in the plate and it was delicious too.. As it was featured in the recommended part we tried it and it was all worth it... and last but not the least..
The mini scooper ( dark desire) was great as well.. the quantity and quality both were great... so really looking forward to try out the other items from here... üòÅ

I walked in this place with two of my friends on a Friday eve. It was literally a hasty plan as visiting this caf√© was on my priority list since a long time. 
The place was quite crowded, though the staff made seating arrangements for us in an adjoining room. After around 15minutes we were offered a seat in the caf√©. Talking of the ambience, I loved it. Dimly lit. Music. Just the way I like it. We then ordered a chicken hotdog burger, a chicken tangy burger and a chicken cheesy sandwich. The sandwich was too good. The spice and juiciness of the sandwich was just perfect. Talking of the burgers, the sausage of the chicken hot dog burger was juicy and perfect taste wise. Same goes for the chicken tangy burger. While we were served food, a stand up comedy show was performed by some guys. It was nice as they interacted with the customers and it was a nice entertainment for all. We ordered hazelnut cappuccinos later, which was just heavenly! Being a coffee lover, I just cannot resist the urge to try coffee from every place I visit and I'm really glad to have tried that. 
Coming to the staff and service, nothing could've impressed me more. The staff always smiling and cheerful. Everyone thanked us with a bright smile as we left the caf√©. The service was fast enough. Overall, it turned out to be waaaay better than I expected it to be. 
Will surely visit this place again!
PS. 0.5 rating extra for the comedians. üòÅ They perform on Fridays from 6 to 7 probably, so try to visit on this day. It's an encouragement for the new ones!

A caf√© with good food and an excellent decoration . I love the ambience . I had there Darjeeling tea , chicken penne pasta with white sauce and American hot wings . The pasta was too good on that price , so as the hot wings . Not only they served well , their behavior is also nice and remarkable . The quantity of food is also great . Menu card is also pocket friendly . I enjoyed my food with a good taste of music . Will be there soon ! üòÄ

The Chaiwala is situated in Graham‚Äôs Land, Tollygunge. When i first heard Graham‚Äôs land, i was surprised to have been passing by tollygunge and never came across this lane or say, such fancy name. It is not at all difficult to locate. If you are coming from Rabindra Sarobar Metro side, head straight towards Tollygunge, cross the mahanayak uttam kumar metro and while just entering the road which goes to Malancha Cinema, on the right side there is silver screen eatery. Just keep moving and just after crossing silver screen, on the left hand side there is a small lane by the name of Graham‚Äôs Land. Gosh!. That‚Äôs where you find the chaiwala on the left after leaving 2 ‚Äì 3 buildings.
                                                                ...

Didn't went their so can't speak about the deco, ambience, staffs behavior etc... this review completely based on their food... which they delivered in time... Now I tried their...

‚ô° Double decker grilled chicken burger¬ª¬ª¬ª It was very good... the patty was juicy and tasty... allover it was a treat to the tummy...

‚òÖ Grilled chicken burger¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... but not good like the previous one...

‚òÖ American hot wings¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... I didn't find anything awesome in it...

‚ô° Chicken chilli garlic spaghetti¬ª¬ª¬ª It was very very tasty... I liked it also recommending it...

Also tried some mocktails...

‚òÖ Dementor's Kiss¬ª¬ª¬ª Okish one...

‚ô° Passion fruit food¬ª¬ª¬ª It was excellent...

‚ô° Double choco frappe¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome one...

‚òÖ Hazelnut smoothie¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... nothing extraordinary...

So overall it was a good experience with the food... Only one suggestion just improved your packaging system for delivery... it's not up to the mark... expect your paper bag... it's very cute...

I will visit the place for sure... till then holding it to 3.5... cheers...

The new age energy of two bongs finally gives you the much needed break with the changing time, the city is experiencing....sukrit poddar and abhishek roy...cheers to the spirit. The city of joy still have the best taste of the chai culture in the entire country. Bengalis are known to have the "addabaji" mentality through out the existence and "ek cup cha" can only enhance that spirit more in every given circumstances. This is a perfect place to synergise with that culture with fantastically spread menu to take care of ur tastebuds aswel. The vanilla ice tea, the jasmine green tea, mint ice tea, vanilla pot cake and the soy-honey chicken wings were the absolute ice breakers to check the cravings for...this is definitely a must visit place for all the kolkatans and all the bengalis around the globe to refind the true spirit of the roots. Cheers guys and keep up the spirit high as always!

This is a secretly tucked away gem of a place near tollygunge metro. We opted for the outdoor seating here and I must say it was a great decision. The decor is smart, the graffiti on the walls draws you in. Since this place is a little off from the busy main road, so you can don't have to worry about the traffic belching out high decibels.
Coming to the food. We opted for the chicken wings in BBQ sauce, cheese and mushroom sandwich and the chocolate walnut pot cake. A friend of mine found the sauce in the chicken too sweet. But that again depends on your palate. The cake had a nice earthy feel to it and it tasted cute. Not too many surprises here. The prices are easy on your pocket and it is pretty satisfactory. But you will definitely fall in love with the vibe of the place.
Looking forward to going back soon, again.

This is a small cafe located on Grahams Land road. It is easy to locate and it is on the lane behind Indrapuri Studio.

Ambiance- The ambiance here is good. They play all kind of Western songs.

The cafe is neat and clean.

Food- Now this is the main part. The food here is really tasty and yummy. The quality of the food is also good and it is fresh. I visited this place with my friend and we ordered one chicken grilled burger, one soy-honey chicken wings and one walnut pot cake. The grilled chicken burger also comes with crispy french fries which will put up a smile on your face. One must really try their soy-honey chicken wings. It tastes soo good and was hot and lipsmacking. I really liked their choco walnut pot cake which was totally fresh and the cake was soo soft and spongy which is a plus point.

Everything about this place is good though I am a bit disappointed with their service. Their service is really slow. I feel they should speed up their service a bit otherwise all well and good.

I would recommend everyone to visit this place atleast once otherwise you are missing out some really mouthwatering dishes people. This is a great place to hangout with your friends. I would like to visit here sometime soon.

This is a small cafe just near Tollygunge metro at Graham's Land. Though the place is quite small, it's crowded most of the time.. But it doesn't matter as they managed to compensate all my feelings with the great food and ambiance the place offered. I took Bacon Tornado, Chicken Cheese Sandwich, American Hot wings, Bloody Ocean and Dementor's Kiss.. Each and every item was top notch.. I repeat TOP NOTCH..

A cosy bistro type joint with diner/deli style cuisine. The music and pictures make the ambience quite pleasant. The staff is prompt to take orders and although service may take a while the food once its at your table is very pleasingly plated.
My personal favourites would be:
1. Soy honey wings
2. Smoked Bacon and Pork sandwich
3. Chicken grilled sandwich
4. Chaiwalla special chai
5. White sauce penne

Theres also a boutique atached to this restaurant with a lot of quirky trinkets,stationery and clothes that you must also check out!

The cafe is situated in a small lane and easy to miss out but don't even make the mistake of missing out.
I was awed from the very moment i entered the place. 
The beautiful setup of the interior added to the wonderful experience. 
We had some wonderful food. 
The BACON TORNADO is a must must try. 
I can go on and on.
It's very very reasonable. It won't burn a hole in your pocket but certainly would in your heart.

Situated in one of the bye-lanes of Tollygunge just diagonally opposite the Tollygunge Metro Station, this quaint little cafe is a food lover's paradise. It is an ideal place to hang out with friends. I have visited this cafe twice and have loved it equally both times. I have had the following dishes:
Soy-honey chicken wings, American Hot wings, coleslaw, Spicy cheese sandwiches, Mixed sauce penne, Chicken sausage krunchies, and Berry berry vanilla.
Though each of their food items was good,I would personally recommend the chicken wings which are their specialities and the Chicken sausage krunchies. 
The service is fast and the prices are quite reasonable. Their chicken wings are enough to make people like me come back to the place over and over again....

Was really excited to visit this place from a long time going by the rating and the reviews. But to be frank i think this place is way too overrated.
Location- easy to locate.
Ambience- very cosy. Very comfortable.
Service- now here i have some complains. When we walked in, nobody was there to greet or offer water. We had to go up to the counter to call someone and then ask for water. Same happened before placing the order. When i asked for suggestions and the specialities of this place,the service person seemed lost about it. He just gave us a beaming smile and said that everything was good. He was also not very sure about what tasted how. Otherwise they were very helpful and cordial.
Food- many expectations there but much to my disappointment they were not met. We had ordered for a chaiwala special tea-it was pretty good,creamy and tasty. Dementor's kiss- the only tastes i could fathom was a sweet and hot one. Also it was not cold enough. Good presentation though. Chocolate and banana smoothie- a very ordinary drink. Not cold again. It was served almost at room temperature.
Next we ordered for potato wedges. It was very oily. Could not manage to eat the entire plate.
Bacon tornado burger and double decker grilled chicken burger- they were good but not enough to leave a mark. The bacons needed to be grilled a bit more and the chicken patties a bit less.
We were already so disappointed that we could not bring ourselves to order for a dessert. @
The quantity of every dish was impressive.

I hope my experience is better the next time i visit (if at all i do so)

Dropped by here with a friend today. I ordered a chocolate smoothie and a cheesy chicken grilled sandwich. Both the proportions and the taste were great. My friend ordered a chocolate banana smoothie, a bacon tornado and we shared a choco walnut pot cake. He enjoyed the burger very much as well. Overall, a really nice experience, and a place I'll visit again. 
                    

Edit - Had food from there a couple more times. The cafe shakerato is a delight, with a hint of vanilla in the espresso. The fiery spetnaz burger is absolutely delectable for people like me who like their food hot. The American hot wings are huge each - don't be put off by the 4 in a plate situation, it tastes amazing. The fact that they don't charges taxes has always been an USP of this place (and precisely why I drop by here ¬†- I'm an unemployed Uni student after all). Hopefully after the reopening of the cafe, it'll continue being tax-free.

The chaiwala has on top of my " to visit list ". I've first come here with a friend of mine but that was quite of a quick check in and check out. The second time was a date. 

The atmosphere is just perfect. The ambiance is good too. The guys out there are smart enough and quite efficient, they won't give you a chance to complain. They're really efficient and handy. 

We ordered a plate of French fries. It was well fried not too brown. It was perfectly golden and crisp. The two dips they serve consists of one regular tomato sauce and the other is a mayonnaise base spicy dip. The mayo dip was really tasty. 
The next day I walked in with a firm mind to try their famous soy honey chicken wings. It was sweet,tangy,hot. It had a perfect blend of flavours. The chicken was moist and well cooked. I'm really impressed. 
We ordered two lemon ice teas, it came a bit late thou. The tea was not strong and neither weak,it was just the way I like. 

Everything was great and the atmosphere goes hand in hand with the decor. It's a really small but sorted place. 

I'll love to try out more of their items. 
 I'm definitely a happy customer!!

A small-ish place close to Tollygunje Metro that was not small on the tasty quotient. We ordered some Chicken Wings and the double chicken patty burger that was the centerfold of their quirky menu card. 

The wings were juicy, succulent and satisfyingly coated in the BBQ sauce. The burger was very heavy. I recommend an empty stomach for the burger to go in :)

I went there on two days sashti and asthami. On sashti we went there just for some snack and it was good...but when we went there for lunch on asthami it was a bad experience....the szechuan spagetti was bland and the szechuan pasta was too spicy. The grilled chicken burger was a little bland as well and my drink pea-ca-cho was bitter in taste.. The staff is irresponsible as they made a mistake in the bill amount. Overall i would suggest chaiwala only for a light snack

Tiny little place hidden among the residential buildings in Grahams land, tollygunge. The Chaiwala is one such hang out spot which has brought a sense of livelihood into this locality. Starting with the attendants, they are very friendly and will guide you through what you should definitely taste when you are at their place. The food is mouth watering and will surely meet your standards.

The feeling that you get when you see a Texan side country bar in movies, The chaiwala is an exact replica of it except the alcohol part as they do not serve alcohol.

A small and cozy food joint, it has quickly rose to fame and is quite popular for its cost efficiency and sublime food quality. The bacon tornado is an absolute humdinger and the grilled chicken burger is equally good. The dementors kiss will keep you in a fix as it tastes sweet initially but after some time the tingly taste of chillies will turn your world upside down. The nutella burst pancake was the best way to end it, though it didn't taste like nutella still it was one of the best pancakes we have ever had and it was more than filling. 
You can visit this place as much as you want to still it won't get monotonous. In my opinion, Mud and chaiwala are two of best pocket friendly food joints in Kolkata with the latter edging the former because of its variation in menu.

This restaurant provides lip smacking snacks and breakfast in a very much affordable price... Burgers, Ham, chicken wings every type of dish is just heaven for your taste buds.  Donnt forget the desserts..  rum brownies, mocktails and shakes r worth trying... This place is definitely worth trying.. i m sure I will revise this place again and again...

I found the ambience quite relaxing. The service is very fast. The food is exquisite. And so are the beverages. It's friendly to the pocket too. However the place is a bit small so it gets crowded easily.

It's a cosy little caf√© with good decor and ambience.... though wen we (me and my boyfriend) visited we were seated beside a noisy bunch of people....really cordial and efficient staff.... ordered a pasta, grilled chicken burger and bacon tornado... pasta was really yummy.... I'd recommend the place for a nice evening date.....

So one fine evening we happen to drop at this pretty cosy place located south some corner the best part about this cafe is that there's this really lil pretty store attached by the cafe conjoined with small things selling from ¬†coffee mugs, to scented candles , scarfs and what not They also have this pretty lil kitchen very decor with dream catchers and pretty cute kettles .

Coming to the food we ordered walnut pot cake and chicken sandwich and chicken wings very well presented and served in unique crockery set , for a moment i though of starting of with childhood crockery games anyway keeping aside such weird thoughts chicken wings was fine well cooked it was american chicken wings i suppose so twas bit sour in taste probably that's how it is suppose to taste than any usual spicy chicken wings , ¬†sandwich was very much filling coming to the walnut pot cake last but nor the least how pretty it looked with a scoop of ice cream on the top twas so soft the whole cake andhot and chocolaty and every¬†
spoon you take you don't miss a walnut in between those spongy soft cake, so here it goes to the staff not a "typical miser"¬†

Anyday chaiwala over ccd¬†
Pocket friendly ..

Ordered online : 2 bacon tornado burgers. 
Costed : ‚Çπ520

Positive : 1 burger is sufficient for 1 person. 

Negative : *Delivery was late (later than the time quoted) 
*Taste was "okay" but would prefer Rubi's Grills Burgers which cost lower, are far better in taste.
*Wasn't warm enough, but edible. 
*French Fries were an illusion, they were more of stale cold fat pieces of Aloo Bhaja from a roadside stall of Sector V. 

Overall : If you want to have burgers just to have burgers, and never had burgers from the likes of Rubi's Grill or Burger You, you can go for it. 
But if you know the taste of burgers from the likes of Rubi's Grill or Burger You, then it'd feel like a waste of money and would leave you with lots of regrets why you didn't go for Rubi's Grill for a far more tastier and lower priced burger.

If you are in Kolkata and you haven't visited this place then you are missing out on a lot!!! The cosy perfect ambience of this place is its USP. The oreo mini scoop is just a splendid showstopper. Each and every mocktail is to die for along with the chicken grilled burger.

It is a great spot to visit. It is a small caffe near tollygaunge. They r extremely nice and humble and did the best they could with the space provided. Its not very expensive and the food there is well above average. With good music playing in the background a well decorated cafe and well cooked and well presented food plated in front of you.

So, I had a lot of expectations from this place after reading reviews and going by the rating. So much so, that I travelled all the way to tollygunge from college street just to eat here last evening.However I was kind of disappointed.
I will quickly sum up what went right and what went wrong.

Very easy to locate.

Good ambience.

The Bacon Tornado burger and the grilled chicken burger we ordered were good ¬†but not great. The bacon needed to be cooked more.

Now coming to the bad part

1. I read brilliant reviews about their chocolate walnut potcake. However when it arrived it was just your regular chocolate cake, not too chocolaty, a bit soggy and cake in a pot version of cake in a mug. I WAS VERY DISAPPONTED.

2. ¬†Their burgers come with fries. They have this option where you can add 50 bucks extra and get potato wedges instead of fries. So we did ¬†that. And asked them again to confirm it.However when the bill comes they charge us 120 bucks for the wedges. While pointing it out they did rectify their mistake.

3. They did not give us water. We had to ask for it almost at the end of our meal.

However despite all these I will say the service is really good. And it is worth a try at least once.

Located in Grahams land this cafe is definitely a benchmark for all the upcoming cafe joints in kolkata. A very cozy ambience and the food is as good as it can be. Response time and delivery time is of appreciation. What i personally like about this place is the behaviour of each and every person working over there. Keep up chaiwala. You gave the people a nice place to hang around.

I went to the place few days back. My friends and I had just finished our work and all of us were hungry. So one my friends suggested the place. It's located near Tollygunge petrol pump, at Graham's Land. The place is small, but it had a nice ambience. We didn't have to wait outside, since that was a working day.
My friend, who had been there before, advised me to have the grilled chicken burger. Other friends of mine ordered other items like the white sauce penne, soy honey hot wings and some Tulsi flavoured tea. Well, I'm not a beverage enthusiast, but I liked the Aroma of the tea. It was pretty good.
My burger was something next to the adverb heavenly. I tried all the items that my friends ordered, and they were pretty good. Especially the hot wings. Undoubtedly, the best chicken wings I have ever tasted. The penne was equally good.
After couple of days we ordered some hot wings n penne from the chaiwala with the Zomato app. They delivered it withing 40 minutes.
I'm sure I'll be going to the place more often now. And I'll also recommend this cafe to everyone. They play nice music, the staff are very nice and humble. And most importantly, the food is awesome.

The Chaiwala is one of the trending cafes in town with a boutique of its own next to the cafe. Wonderful vintage interior and outstanding menu. The Chaiwala is known for its Chai ofcourse and the big mouth bites i.e the burgers. Go for the Soya honey wings, big pieces of wings nicely fried and tossed in tangy soya honey sauce with a tinge of spice. I was lucky enough to get the crisp cakes which is only available for a short span of time. Tbh, really impressed with the variety, quality and quantity of food. :)

Lemme be very honest about it. The primary reason of visiting this cafe was personal and it was the cafe's anniversary. So here goes my observations.

1. Interior: very nicely decorated tables. The lighting was apt to set the mood for a grand treat. The photos on the walls were completely fitting in with the decor and justified the name of the cafe.

2. Service: Very polite. We interacted with the owners and the people in action and all of them proved why this cafe is getting great reviews. Cheers.

3. Food: clear winners are pasta in white sauce and frappe. Though we ordered a lot of other dishes like chicken wings, French fries, iced tea, spaghetti and most importantly, couple of double decker burgers and bacon sandwiches. I never in my life have seen such a gigantic slice of sandwich which clearly justified their tag line 'you get what you pay for'. 

All in all, I am pleasantly surprised after visiting the cafe. Hope they do better though they have very little to improve. In one word, 'Sera'.

Just 5 min drive from my place and I found this gem called Chaiwala ,  was hearing a lot about this place on social media so planned to visit this today with my family, we didn't knew that it was their first anniversary today so had to wait for a while, but the end result was worth waiting. We ordered some iced tea , chicken wings , spaghetti and burger , and closed with the Choco walnut potcake with ice cream, it's a value for money joint with some ever smiling helpful staff, kids friendly , and excellent food.
A must recommended.

This cute and classy little place is located almost near Tollygunge metro. I visited this place today with my sister Luna Chatterjee , as she had suggested. This place being small has a little bit of accommodation problem on weekends. But that is all balanced with their great tasting food items. Also the price is appropriate with accordance to the food.

What we had ordered :
Chocolate Banana Smoothie.( Balanced taste. )

Vanilla Ice Tea. ( Happened to tasty but a little on the sweeter side)

Honey- Soy chicken wings. (One of their specialities.)

Chicken sausage krunchies. ( Highly recommended.)

Grilled Chicken burger. (Tasty) 

Chaiwala special Chai. 

Nevertheless, the staffs are friendly. The ambiance, the food quality, the cleanliness, everything is good over here. Would surely visit this place again. Luna Chatterjee

Absoooolutelyyy loved the place. My would-be recommended the place. So I set out today with her to check out the joint. The place had nice ambience, clean and hygienic surroundings. Quirky quotes like the ones on top of service counter and the flush in the toilet add to the light mood that the place carries.

Coming to the food, it's plain awesome. We ordered pasta in mixed sauce, American hot wings, BLT, Lemon Ice tea and Chaiwala special chai. Each and every item tasted great. We ended up discussing when would we visit next even before we stepped out of there.

The staff is polite and courteous, and speak to you with a smile on the face always.

Definitely recommended if you are in the vicinity.

The Chaiwala, we would be visiting again soon. :)

While striking off restaurants from my wishlist one by one it hit me that instead of living nearby I absolutely forgot to visit The Chaiwala which is one of the top rated restaurants on zomato right now. So on a lazy holiday afternoon I left for this eatery on my own.
.
It's a five minutes walk from tollygunge metro and easy to locate if you are using map. The place is smaller than I imagined although neatly decorated with wooden furnitures, wall-hangings and fun posters, a black board with specials written on it, and a small counter.
.
I ordered one non virgin mojito and one grilled chicken burger. The drink was as refreshing as it looked. The burger and fries looked alluring but tasted average. Staff members were really friendly and helpful.
.
I was fortunate enough to have a little candid chat with one of the co-owners Mr. Asit and as he said and I quote "all you need is good food and good ambience". So now we know what it takes to make a restaurant Kolkata's number one.

Located in the by-lanes of Tollygunj at Graham's Lans is The Chaiwala. It's interiors are well designed and very pretty. A perfect place for a hangout with friends accompanied with tasty food.
 We tried the Non-Virgin Mojito which had a very refreshing minty-lime flavour. 
The soy-honey chicken was delicious! ‚ù§ It had the perfect mix of honey and garlic. Chilli garlic sphagetti was nice too. It did not have too much chilli, just the perfect amouny of red chilli and garlic with lots of cheese! Yummy!üòã

Lastly for the desserts we had freshly baked walnut pot cake. It had a generous scoop of ice cream on top! üíô

A late monsoon evening slowly giving its way into a stormy night and two almost drenched friends,determined to have spend some more time together- The Chaiwala it was.

STAFF: VERY friendly.

AMBIANCE: I loved the place.The designer seems to have a very eclectic taste. ¬†
The finely made woody benches,the photographs on the wall and the Victorian clock ( has been always my favorite) - all seemed to fit in very magnificently.

FOOD: I was full from the food we had at Crystal Chimney. So I decided on the Iced Tea.
It was a tad too sour for my taste and the lemon looked withered and smelled a little bit. I wouldn't have it again the next time.¬†
My friend scored gold with his order- Freshly Baked Choco Walnut Pot Cake With Icecream. Even for person like me who hates chocolate,I just couldn't resist it.It was a bit spongy and literally melted in my mouth. The aroma- ah!¬†

BILL : A measly Rs.230.¬†

RECOMMENDATION: GO FOR THE POT CAKE!!¬†
And please do not go for the Lemon Iced Tea.I am pretty sure you wont like it.

Great little place! Non traditional setting! Awesome food. The Chaiwala does justice to it's name, cuz the chai is awesome! My Boyfriend, who doesn't like tea, could not stop sipping from my cup. Later he ordered his own, and it was well worth it! The soy-honey chicken wings, the double-deck burger were both delicious, juicy and saliva-inducing!¬†Just one complaint: It would be great if they had more sitting arrangement.

This small joint near Tollygunje is an amazing place to hang out with your friends, go on a date or just spend some time with yourself. They serve a variety of tea although apart from their special tea, all are from tea bags and not fresh leaf. They also serve coffee and other cold drinks. As for food there's a small variety and most of them are small snacks and pricing is a little high than it should've been. Only the burgers are huge and very filling. If you're a person with small face and can't eat much Do not try the Double decker Burger. It's sad to find out that they only serve grilled meat and none of the burgers have fried patty. I would ask them to consider keeping one burger with fried crispy patty as there's many of us who just loves it. We had the Double Decker Burger and the Fiery Spetnaz Burger and it was weird to find that both of them tasted the same. The only difference is of an extra patty. That just doesn't make any sense.
Undoubtedly the tea served were really good. We had the Chaiwala Special tea, Ginger Lemon Honey tea, Kashmiri Kahwa Tea and Peppermint tea. Note:All Exotic tea will get a second flush.
The decor is something I fell in love with. The warmth of the wooden interior will make you feel comfortable and cozy and the ambience is top notch! On top of that the service is really friendly. Only if they make they keep better and more different options to their burgers and make them taste unique and not the same and keep their prices a little moderate this place would be thronged with people always. Definitely gonna visit again. I hope they repair their coffee machine by that time.

one of my favourite destination for having eternal delicious bacons. situated at 10 minutes walking distance from the tollygunj metro. beautiful place to spend your rainy day evening while having a sip of darjeeling or assam tea. few signature items that must be tried once : double decker burger, bacon tornado, smoked pork sandwich, walnut choco pot cake and banana smoothie. waiters are really fantastic at their job. simply, perfect place for burger and sandwich lovers. rating 4.5 because there are few rooms to improve. need more sitting allocations, service is bit slow. but overall one heck of a restaurant that should be visited by all the foodies.

The Chaiwala is a very pretty place near tollugunge. The place is small but very well decorated. The soy-honey chicken wings is delectable. The mixed sauce penne and cheese sauce penne is decent. The choco walnut pot cake is heavenly. It comes in a pot and is topped with a scoop of ice cream. The pot cake is one of my favourite and is a must try for everyone.

The Chaiwala stands true to its name, offering a variety of exotic and classic teas. I ordered a Passion Fruit Ice Tea, and it had a very balanced taste. One can choose from among a variety of Pasta, Burger, Sandwiches and some side dishes. The options for Vegetarians are limited, though every thing they have is pretty nice. The White Sause Pasta was particularly good, though it could have been better if it was not that sweet. The Schezwan Pasta was quite different, tangy and a perfect fusion of chinese and italian without killing their essence. The Burger was served with fries. Both were really done well. The ambience, polite and friendly service added to the experience. Also it is very pocket friendly, a perfect go go for college students. Overall it was great. I just hope though that they expand options for Vegetarian Burgers. Rest, kudos guys!!

This is a place in Tollygunge. The place is small but it's pretty. The interiors are so cute! Now coming to the food,we had ordered Bacon wrapped chicken burger,smoked bacon sandwiches,cheese chicken grilled sandwich and choco walnut pot oven cake.
The burger was absolutely the best! A must order!! The cheese chicken grilled sandwich was good too. As the name suggests it was cheesy and filled with chicken. The smoked bacon sandwich could have been a little better. Though the choco walnut pot cake was a bit disappointing. The cake was dense and the ice cream was just not enough. Overall,the food is good,the quantity of food is great! The service is fast and the people are friendly. A great place to hangout with your friends.

Had to visit this much hyped place. Went around 7pm and damn we had to wait outside, it was fully occupied. So we waited and got inside and due to some problem, we again had to wait for an hour! The staff were constantly apologizing for the delay. We were getting bored when we got two lemonades as compliments along with our bacon tornadoes. And man it was delicious, gotta try the other dishes, will be back soon!

Over the last many weeks I was following the great reviews this place was bagging and made it a point to visit it soon. So dropped in with a couple of friends today and was pleasantly surprised. The little porch outside the cafe is sweet. If you list yourself amongst the ‚ÄúKhatey Pitey Khandaan ka bold and obese bachcha‚Äù (like me), it is advised that you push both compartments of the main door together, to drift comfortably inside (learning from experiences).

If you pine for a cozy little place on a lazy evening with a cup of tea and some good food and company, The Chaiwala may be just what your looking for. Located in a small by-lane in Tollygung, it is a cute little place which can just lift up your mood with its ambiance. If you head towards Garia from Tollygunj metro station, walk past the Indrapuri Studio and take the Graham road on your left, walk a few paces and The Chaiwala would welcome you.

It is a small place done up on the ground floor of a residential building with a small seating arrangement. If you plan to be there on a Sunday evening like we did, plan to reach early. The place is done up well with the unique bench style seating. The walls are decorated with well shot frames of chaiwalas at their jobs. The have a bar which serves chai and not liquor for a change. The decor is done up with wooden panels, with small trinkets and curios done up well to decorate the bar.

Now coming to the food, well we tried a lot from the wide menu. For starters, we went with what the name is all about, Chai. I tried the ginger honey tea and my friend chose refreshing lemon grass and ginger. My tea was done well with ginger adding the punch to the sweetness of the honey. Next we tried the much ordered soy honey wings. Well this did give me mixed feelings. The sauce in which the wings were cooked was just perfect, with the sweet honey complementing the chopped garlic, but then the chicken didn't live up to the mark. Firstly the wings were served in sizes that are way to difficult to handle, also our pieces were not cooked too well and were not tender. That is something that needs to be looked up. Next came cheese sauce penne chicked pasta and it was done well...small diced veggies cooked in the cheesy sauce with chicken and penne. Coming to desserts, I tried the berry berry vanilla mini scooper and my friend for dark desire. I like the dark desire better as the berry one was tad too sweet with the strawberry jam making up the bottom of the glass.¬†

As a plus point, the prices are moderate, rather on the lower side and as a bonus, it's all inclusive of taxes as printed on the menu.

Overall it was a happy experience despite the few hiccups. I would definitely love to visit again and try the burgers and sandwiches on offer. It is a place where one would love to be.

Happy eating!!!

Drenched in the rain, me and two of my friends finally managed to visit this place last sunday.. When we reached the place was full so we were asked to wait in their boutique.. After ten minutes of waiting we got our seats and placed our order for Masala French Fries, Veg Schezwan Pasta, Chicken Schezwan Spaghetti and American Style Chicken Wings..

The masala french fries came with a mayo dip and tomato sauce and it was undoubtedly the best french fries i have ever had... It was amazing!!

Both the Pasta and Spaghetti were good and spicy.. Just the way I like..
The wings were good too but i expected it to be a bit more spicy but it was on a sweeter side..

Now came the actually show stealer THE CHOCO-WALNUT POT CAKE... It was a soft spongy chovolate cake with walnut at it's base and on the top it had a depression which was filled with a scoop of vanilla icecream and hot chocolate sauce.. It was so good so so good.. üòã

It was a blissful experience in The chaiwala all because of their food and hospitality and most importantly THE CHOCO WALNUT POT CAKE... And the prices being inclusive of tax was like an icing on the cake.. It is a great place and worth visiting innumerable number of times..üòá

Food is nice except the sandwich (i have had far better sandwitches at some other place)  and the cold coffee (it wasnt sweet at all). plus points to the decorum inside,  and the free wifi, the french fries,  the chicken wings. and negative points for the foods i dint like.

Location: Located near the famous Indapuri Studio, this place is a walking distance from tollygunge metro station. It not located on a main road so couldn't find it at first but Google maps are always helpful.

The Chaiwalla is one of a new genre of eateries in the city which tries to recreate the ambience of European caf√©s, but with a special emphasis on teas. This is really a welcome addition to the food scene. This place is small with just a few tables. This creates a warm, cosy feeling but the downside is that getting a table can be difficult. They serve the usual assortment of cafe dishes like burgers, sandwiches, fries, etc. plus of course a large variety of teas. The jasmine tea and the smoked pork and bacon burger that I tried were both OK. There are some issues with availability as the Tuna sandwich I asked for was not available. The prices displayed on the beautifully illustrated and descriptive menu is inclusive of taxes. The service warm and friendly. Overall this is a decent place to hang out with friends or maybe for spending some quiet time with a book and a cup of tea.

This place is located at Graham's Land,  Tollygunj.  Small cafe but the experience there was great. Food tastes great. About 4-5 tables are there and I've never seen this place empty. I would recommend people to try Krunchies ( it's yumm). 
Smokers can also have their fair share of satisfaction as they have a smoking zone outside the cafe. Staff and service is good.

Nice d√©cor and ambience.
I went there with my friends. We ordered-

Peach and Vanilla Iced Teas- They were a tad too sweet for our liking, and the Vanilla Iced Tea tasted a bit medicine-like.

Oreo Frappe- Delicious.

White Sauce Penne Pasta- Served hot, delicious as well.

Chicken Sausage Krunchy- Tasty, once we had a proper biteful of the sausages.

Soy-Honey Chicken Wings- Served hot, tasted good.

Choco Walnut Pot Cake- Warm and soft, once again delicious.

Honey and Butter Grill Cakes- Very soft, just like it claims to be. Tasted good too, although slightly dry.

The service was good as well. All in all, it's definitely a place I'd go back to again.

After a couple of visits I finally came to the conclusion that this place definitely deserves a good review!
Okay so firstly about the location, this place is easy to locate, merely 3 mins walk from Silver Screen. A lane with a board named Graham's land will fall on the left.. The joint is located there only..
Now, about the ambience I really like the ambience of this place.. I love their decorations and their presentations...! The service is also good..
Now coming to the food part I love their sandwiches and dark desire alot.. I have tried their burgers.. Burgers are also good..!
And yes most importantly their menu is inclusive of tax. They don't charge you any extra taxes.
I would love to visit again and again..

This restaurant is a 5 minute walk from tollygunge metro station, along Graham road. It is not quite spacious, with 4 -5 tables. The ambience is not great, but quite nice.

Coming to the food, we ordered a hot chocolate, the usual favourites bacon cheese sauce penne pasta , soy honey chicken wings and a dementors kiss.

The hot chocolate came first. It was good but nothing great about it. It was not as thick as it was supposed to and not much chocolatey. There are restaurants in Kolkata providing much better hot chocolate . 3.5/5

The soy honey chicken wings was the best dish of the evening. Undoubtedly. The combination of soy and honey mesmerised us. Highly recommended. 5/5

The bacon cheese sauce pasta was also great with lots of cheese to satisfy the taste buds of a cheese lover like me. The only concern is that the price difference between the chicken and bacon variant of this dish is quite huge. They should check to it. 4.5/5

Finally we ordered a drink named dementors kiss, solely because of our obsession with harry potter. But to our surprise, the drink tasted quite well. It was spicy and had a great after taste sensation, perfectly justifying it's name . Recommended to everyone, and especially harry potter fans

Great place, great food and great staff. Would love to come here again.

Decided to take my friend here on his birthday for a small treat. It's a cute little cafe having simplistic d√©cor with a few good touches. The seats are wooden and shaped like park benches. There are charms hanging around the counter which gives it a Boho look. There are black and white pictures hanging on the walls of different 'chaiwalas' at work ;) . Special mention must be made of the salt and pepper shakers here,which are hugging each other. So cute!!!! The menu was promptly handed to us as we sat down. The staff was very polite and friendly which made us feel comfortable :). We ordered a peach iced tea and veg mixed sauce penne pasta. I was delighted to find pot cakes on the menu. I wasted no time in ordering a chocolate and walnut pot cake with ice cream. Since it was my friend's birthday I asked the staff for a candle for the cake which they arranged for us very kindly :-) needless to say, ambience and staff got high marks from me! 
Now coming to the food:- The iced tea was alright and had enough of the peachy flavour. I just wish it was served on a taller glass,that would have appealed to me more. The quantity of the pasta was more than enough for two people. It was delicious and had enough mushrooms,brocolli and bell peppers in it. It was very creamy. The pot cake was just terrific,especially because of the ice cream it was served with. Without the ice cream it would have been a little dry. We took two scoops of vanilla ice cream and finished up the soft and slightly gooey cake in a jiffy :D. The bill was served in a small cane basket. Me and my friend had an awesome experience here and I can safely say that his birthday was made :-) . They also hv a boutique adjacent to the cafe which stocks clothes,mugs,jewellery,cards etc. Definitely coming back here :)

The Chaiwala... 
Ambience- 
The d√©cor is quite different. They have books at your disposal for reading, the wall has black and white photographs on it and the rest let me not tell you, as you need to go and check it out. When we had gone yesterday, there was a stand up comedy going on. This made us enjoy our meal while leaving us in splits.

Food- 
My personal recommendation is the double decker non veg burger. It is so filling so for one person it might be too much. The food is quite good and will melt in your mouth inspit of it not being an ice cream ;) 

Service- 
They were quick and friendly. Thought the place is very small, still they will make you feel at home.

Am definitely going back again to try out some more food

Been there after positive reviews on zomato..well well a cafe near tollygunje .. great! .. I liked the ambience, the photographs hanging on the wall..#Good themed restaura Good one i must say. Great place for hangout with friends. 
We had chilli cheese spaghetti. I loved it . the taste was good. Enjoyed that truly.
And we took bacon tornado something like that burger. Well it was good. No complaint. still i would prefer Woodstock's godzilla sandwich . Anyway. I like the service and staff, their hospitality.  At last but not the least they offer free wifi and smoking zone ;)  that makes it special for me. :P

This place has been such a godsend because around Bansdroni, where I live, the only caf√© around is Caf√© Coffee Day which I'm absolutely tired of. So when a place like The Chaiwala opens up nearby you begin to expect cartloads from it. And it doesn't disappoint.
I absolutely love the decor. The tasteful photographs of everyday Kolkata life on the walls immediately catch my eye as I settle into a booth with my sister and the menu is handed to us. We order a plate of cheese garlic potato pops, american hot wings, a chocolate smoothie, a lemon iced tea, a hotdog burger, a bacon tornado burger and honey and butter grill cakes.
The potato pops are just the right amount for an appetizer when you're sharing and how I loved the grated cheese over the fried potato chunks! Speaking of delicious cheese, the burgers were heavenly. Generous amounts of everything, fresh meat and vegetables, the cheese just melting in your mouth and perfectly cooked french fries (not grainy. Perfect) made them the kind of burgers that you dream of when you sleep at night. The drinks complimented the entire meal perfectly. The chocolate smoothie, I must mention was thick and creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness. The grill cakes were, however, just a little dry. Maybe a little more syrup would have been better. The hot wings we couldn't finish, because my sister and I are a bunch of gluttons and cannot stop ordering even when we know we cannot finish what we've asked for. We took the wings home and had them at dinnertime. I'm not crazy about food that's too spicy and this wasn't. It was just the right degree which everyone should be able to enjoy.
The staff is very friendly, very efficient and service is quick. If you miss out on The Chaiwala, you miss out on a good, affordable caf√©, and I don't think you'd want that.

One of my favourite place for evening addas! Their chicken wings are to die for! Hot and spicy, succulent chicken wings are served in a pretty reasonable price. I keep licking my fingers after having these. Sandwiches are great too! The ambience is good, service is average, the person who takes orders is pretty friendly.

Relevant location. Quick to find ,7 mins walk from tollygunje metro station and you're there. It's a small food joint, nicely decorated and an amazing ambiance perfect for a hang out with your squad.
We ordered
CHICKEN SAUSAGE KRUNCHY- yummiest. Breads topped with sausage and generous amount of mayonnaise and cheese. It was so soft and delicious. Recommended
SCHEZWAN PASTA - pasta cooked with lots of veggies and cheese. Little bit spicy. It tasted good.
SINFUL NUTELLA BURST GRILLED CAKE- we had high hopes pinned to this dish. But quite disappointed us. The cakes were grilled but didn't have the adequate amount of chocolate sauce so felt dry. The proportion of chocolate chips and sauce must be increased to cut out the boredom.
To sum up,the place is cool and happening,offering you it's myriad range of spreads at a very pocket friendly price.

The hype of this place was increasing so much, a must visit was mandatory as it was close to my house too. People from tollygunj area will have no problem finding this place, still for rest others it is located in Graham's Road (near tollygunj petrol pump) just beside the off shop.
A stand out cafe at this location, promises to serve you with their best items, one over-platting the other. To check their amazing delicacies we had-
1. Cappuccino: Brewed and cremed properly served in traditional chai-cup, though i found its a little strong.
2. Soya Honey Chicken Wings: The legendary dish of theirs amazed us in every bite. Chicken wings tossed in garlic sauce along with soya sauce and sweet taste of honey.
3. Grilled Chicken Burger: Typical patty burger alongside fries are served with tomato ketchup. The patty was juicy and the cheese added more taste to it.
4. Dark Desire: The mandatory desert after all the heavy duties, which was able to hold its glory. Found a lot of almonds, walnuts, and chocochips with scoop of ice cream and brownie as the base.
All the prices are inclusive of taxes so pocket pinch is very reasonable (around 500 INR for two). Interiors were made in contrast with name and is well furnished.
P.S. There's a separate store just beside the entrance for accessories and dresses must check out that too.

The great reviews on zomato propelled me to land at this cafe, which is located very near to the Tollygunge Subway Station on Graham's road. The cafe, although quite small in proportion, is designed quite well with wooden furniture, black & white photographs of Calcutta and colourful walls. The main entrance door is however abysmally narrow, making it tough for most people to enter.
But we didn't go there to have a feel of the place only, did we? We went to eat as well. So let me share that experience.

We ordered cheese chicken grilled sandwiches & their signature dish, the soy honey chicken wings.
The sandwiches were good. The cheese & chicken blended quite well to have the almost perfect taste.
The disappointment was however the honey soy chicken wings. The chicken wasnt served hot,it wasnt soft and the taste was nothing special at all. Given that this is their signature dish, one expected better.

And btw they didn't serve water and neither the WiFi is open. Somehow, I feel this cafe is little overrated on zomato.We need more impartial reviews here. This cafe has the potential to become big, but it isn't there as yet. So let's not exaggerate!

The food is excellent....the Ambience is good with a soft music ....since this was on our wishlist for a long period of time....setting and theme based on American cafe....

Now coming back to the food....
We had lemon iced tea, bacon tornado, soy honey chicken wings, and cold chicken salad...
The lemon ice tea ,bacon tornado and cold chicken salad is awesome  but soy honey chicken is also good but the dish is too sweet for us...the bacon melted down in our mouth....
We had these type of burger after keventers in Darjeeling....it was yummy...lip smacking....and the price is pretty cheap and worth it...
The people who served the food are very nice,takes good care of the customer...food comes on time... no delay....in these cafe little things making way to happiness and also uplifting the moods like the portraits as well as the d√©cor...keep it up guys.... looking forward to visit again....

This little cafe would give you a bundle full of joy. On a friday evening my friends & I decided to visit this place since this was on our wishlist for a long period of time. This place is located at graham's land(1st lane on your left if you are going towards ashokenagar).
The sitting capacity is moderate & the interiors are very neat indeed. So full credit goes to the owner on creating such a great ambience. We even had the oppurtunity to enjoy their comedy mic(a stand up comedy show arranged by comedified) which we thoroughly enjoyed while munching our food üòª.

So now coming to the food,let us get down to that:-

1. Iced lemon tea- One word to describe this drink would be "Lemony". This was very pleasant indeed to cool us down on a warm evening. The quantity was good & taste wise also it lived up to its name.

2. Choclate banana smoothie- Unique combination of chocolate syup & banana in perfect proportion which gave our tastebuds a very soothing feeling. Loved every sip of it.

3. Soy honey chicken wings- House speciality which is a very recommended appetiser if you drop down to this place. 4 grilled wings in sticky honey & soy sauce with sprinkled garlic & spring onions. This was simply heavenly. We were highly impressed by this dish. The honey & soy combo taste was superb. Highly recommended

4. Grilled chicken burger- medium sized burger with chicken patty,cheese slice,cabbage leaf,mayo,tomatoe,onion served with french fries & sauce. The burger patty was tasty & was juicy. The fries went well along with it.

5. Veg delight burger

Overall we were highly impressed with the food &  service. All the prices on the menu are tax inclusive. An evening well spent with full of laughter & some splendid food. Keep up the good work üò∫üò∫

This is a gem of a place near tollygunge metro station with an array of lipsmacking dishes that are quite a rage among the youth like burgers, chicken wings, pasta etc. This cafe boasts of an assortment of desserts, variety of coffee and definitely " chai " which is its speciality. We orderd the recommended dishes in zomato like soya honey chicken; double decker grilled burger , nuttela sponge cake (just forgot the name). The burger and soya honey chicken were quite good and lived up to the good remarks given on zomato but the dessert was a disappointment i didnot much like it and it differed totaly from the description given on the menu card. Overall the bill came around 800 for two burgers one dessert dish and a soya honey chiclen wings which is prty decent considering the amount we have to shell out for similar items in any other cafe. Overall good food good ambience and decent pricing will definitely make it feature often in my fav cafe list. Just a point deducted for the dessert which i personally didnot like.

Going by it's name first I thought that it will be a tea specialist shop rather than a caf√©... But my perception got changed after I hopped in here, this pretty oh-my fancy looking den which is more of a snacks place rather than a tea den.

‚ô£ LOCATION & DECOR : :
Starting off with location it's pretty much of a 8mins walk from Tollygunge metro station, towards Ranikuthi. It's a very nice looking organised caf√© with polished chairs tables with motivational quotes hanging along in those crafted walls. The staffs enhance the ambience by playing current English pop songs so anyone will get into the mood.

‚ô£ Coming to food :
(I tried few ones though)

‚Ä¢ Non-virgin Mojito : well I don't know what syrup they used, as it didn't taste like a mojito at all and it looked entirely like a pudina coloured drink (deep green) which it shouldn't be. This was the only gross item of all.
‚Ä¢ Lime Soda : this was normal as it should be
‚Ä¢ Hazelnut Smoothie Shake : A proper hazelnut smoothie should have the taste of Ferraro rocher or else at least smell like one, but this smoothie came totally as pale as white with tints of pink, and tasted like a vanilla smoothie although it tasted good but didn't have the hazelnut flavor.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Alfredo Penne Pasta : Had to go with this one cause they didn't had the choice of Pesto, portion of this dish was more than suffice for 2people and it was utterly delicious with ample amount of shredded chicken in it. With the right amount of thyme, garlic, oregano, and right consistency of gravy this pasta was scrumptious for my taste buds!
‚Ä¢ Coleslaw : lots of fresh veggies dipped in mayo with such yummilicious taste ...only to go with this one if you like salads.

‚ô£ Service was fast and staffs were polite and prompt enough. What I also liked that all of those dishes were tax inclusive, and pretty economic for people.

‚ô£ RATINGS : :
‚Ä¢ FOOD - 4/5
‚Ä¢ AMBIENCE - 4/5
‚Ä¢ SERVICE - 4/5
‚Ä¢ VFM - 5/5

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ‚úå

Chaiwala is surely hitting the food charts nowadays and I've been there a few times.  The must haves include, for me at least, honey butter grilled cake, Nutella cake and bacon tornado. The mocktails are good, but nothing out of the world. However, I once order a tuna sandwich which was not up to the mark. Overall, the place is nice but surely doesn't leave much space to move for fatsos like me. The tables also sometimes move awkwardly. But those factors are hardly relevant if you're solely considering food quality. I hope they would expand considering their popularity.

Well , this one was on the wishlist for quite sometime & eventually we turned up in this cute little joint on a rainy day to satiate our quest for good food & conversation !!! Location is easy to track once you enter the road which takes you towards Garia, from the 4 point crossing of the Tolly metro station. Take the first left to Graham's land & The Chaiwala is the 3rd building after Graham's kitchen.¬†

Service - Reason why I mentioned this first even before food, is definitely special. We had called them standing near the Tollygunj metro station to help us guide with the location & thus, while entering we found the first table for 2, was kept with a "RESERVED" board for us!!! Now that's what you call an exceptional gesture to make the guests feel the warmth in the service. Kudos & thank you ¬†:)¬†

Food - We had ordered a Darjeeling tea without milk, a Cafe Mocha, Chicken Cheesy Sandwich & their specialty, Soy-Honey Chicken wings. ¬†The smooth body & finish of the tea makes it worthwhile. The friend even liked the Mocha quite much. She being a serious food critic, I agree to her point. Now coming to the sandwich, was a little dry maybe due to a substantial amount of capsicum used. The cheese , was used in slices with a hefty amount of chicken in the bread. Felt, if grilled, maybe the cheesy flavor would have been more silky & complimented the taste of the chicken. Soy-Honey wings were the best of the batch, must say. we literally gobbled upon it because it was quite exquisite!!! The dominant flavor of honey & the perfect mixture with the light soy sauce made the dish even more desirable. ¬†We were so full by the time , that we were even wondering if we should order the dessert, but eventually, we did, & boy, we were little disappointed as we had high hopes about the choco walnut pot cake, which had got good reviews on Zomato. The only good thing was that, it was freshly baked, straight from the oven. The walnut crunch was perfect & the ice cream in the hole between the potcake was even delectable ; but maybe , a proper brownie instead of a plain chocolate sponge cake would have added the perfect crunch , I feel.¬†

Pocket Pinch - Just 570/- for two without any added bunch of taxes. Now, that makes me happy & I don't complain further :)¬†

Oh, ¬†and one of the owners I guess had come across and spoken to us regarding the overall experience, that credits them with additional Kudos !!!

Overall, would love to comeback for ¬†the service , experience, & soy honey chicken wings.

Highly recommended.

Opposite Tollygunge metro station there is a road towards Silver line cinema. Go straight and first left, a very small lane. From outside its a nice cafe. One table for outdoor sitting. 
Went after we saw good reviews on zomato. 
Tea and coffee are good. Even the burger was really nice. Would like to try more of their vegeterian stuff in future. 
Hope they are able to maintain their good taste quality in future.

I am giving it 5 stars not because the owner is a childhood friend but because this place simply blew me out of my mind with its food. The sole reason people need to come here is for the food which is in one simple word - FANTASTIC ‚ù§
So I came here with a friend and we started our gastronomic journey with the Lemon Ice Tea and Bloody Ocean. Loved the latter more. Then came the masala french fries which were finger licking good. The soy chicken wings were a special recommendation and we were simply on cloud nine. I almost chewed my fingers.
For dessert, we chose the chocolate walnut potcake that was the best ever that I have ever had anywhere. 
Thumbs up for the beautiful set-up but I feel the seats can be made a little more comfortable. 
Promise to make another trip to this place v.soon!

Their food was just awesome. We ordered oreo frappe, chicken nuggets, chicken sausage krunchy, chicken wings with American sauce and chocho-walnut cheese pot cake. All of these items were served in a well manner and no comments for taste. Mouth watering. I'll like to visit there again and again.

10 minutes walk from Tollygunge Metro Station. Walking might be painstaking on the rainy days because of the muddy roads.

Chaiwala is not difficult to locate once you enter Graham's Land. A small cafe with decent interior. There is no pompousness and the calm relaxed ambiance adds to the charm.

We ordered a Darjeeling Tea, Cafe Mocha, Cheesy Chicken Sandwich, Soy Honey Chicken Wings & Choco Walnut Pot Cake.

The tea was really really good. Thin bodied with great aroma. 5/5.

Cafe Mocha was good too. Bitter & a faint hint of chocolate. They served it with 2 cookies. 4/5.

Cheesy Chicken sandwich had substantial amount of chicken. But it was little dry. Could have been better. 3.5/5.

Soy Honey Chicken was finger licking. Literally. The best chicken wings I've ever had. A MUST try! 5/5.¬†

Choco Walnut Pot Cake was disappointing. Good part was it was freshly baked and served with a scoop of ice cream. But the taste of the cake was totally average. 2.5/5.

Service is good. Staff is courteous.¬†

Price: Reasonable. All inclusive.¬†

Portion: Sufficient.

This place was amazing. It's located not very far from tollygunj tram depo. The ambience of the restaurant is very soothing. It's a small and comfortable place.
The food was really good and pocket friendly. The double decker chicken burger can make you go there often. Everything that we ordered was pretty great.
The service was very friendly and warm. Overall nothing is disappointing.
It's a great place to hang out and munch lots of food at such cheaper rate.

The soy honey chicken wings are to die for. Go for the Bacon Tornado burger as well. The ambience is cozy but space is an issue. The mocktails were pretty disgusting: we ordered Dementor's Kiss and Sweet Mama's Blueberry (you feel like a moron placing the order thanks to the names, so that's a cross to bear). However, the food makes up for this greatly. The cheese sauce pasta was good enough and the portion sizes are great. Service takes ages though and we were made to wait for a while. The cherry on top of the icing is that there's no added tax, so the price you read is what you're actually charged!

Oh I loved this place! I had ordered from here earlier and the food was great, but the place is crazy awesome too! We started off with the double Choco chip frappe which had a strong flavour of coffee, unlike its counterparts in other cafes, an iced tea which was good in quantity, a chicken sandwich which was humongous and loaded with chicken and cheese, and the winner was the Soy Honey chicken wings! It was delicious! We felt like little kids eating with both hands and licked our fingers in a room full of people! We wanted to try the desserts too, but we were too full! Next time definitely. The food is quite affordable. It's located very conveniently right off Graham Road which is within walking distance of Tolly Metro. I have already started recommending this place to my friends. Also, the adjoining store had many quirky goodies on offer. Make sure you pick up something cute too.

When you first think of the word "chaiwala" the sole thing that strikes your mind is tea and in its various forms. But The Chaiwala breaks the boundary of only possessing aromatic and delicious tea. The Chaiwala not only offers tea for tea-lovers but also possess various delectable foods as well. Though this cafe is small in structure but theirs offerings are mind-blowing.

Location- there are ways to reach there but you have to walk a few minutes in order to reach there. You actually need a gps map in order to locate it. Drop down at tollygunge metro and walk a few minutes until you reach the main road/tollygunge tram depot bus stop and then take the left lane which leads to NSC Bose Road. From here you have to walk straight untill you find the left lane which leads to grahams lane(there will be a sign board infront of that lane indicating grahams land). Take that road and you will reach there.

Ambience and decoration- a small cafe decorated beautifully with pictures. The ambience is very good.

Food- coming to the food,we ordered a darjeeling tea without milk, lemon iced tea, double decker chicken burger, cheesy chicken sandwich, american hot wings and choco walnut pot cake.
 
Darjeeling tea- a good quality tea is known by its aroma and taste; the aroma of this tea was so good and immediately recharges a tea-lover. Tastewise its very good. Tea-lovers dont miss this one.

Lemon iced tea- this is very refreshing. the sourness of the lime is very appropriately balance with the sweetness of the tea. 

Cheesy chicken sandwich- beautiful if i have to say this in one word. it is served with ketchup. The upper part has that crunchy effect whereas the inside is soft. The crunchiness of the veggies and softness of the chicken with the cheese was yummy yummy and yummy.

Double decker chicken burger- this is serves with fries and ketchup. The fries are tasty though i found it a bit salty. Coming to the burger, the double patty chickhen was awesome. Each and every components were complimenting each other. The bun was soft the patty was juicy and soft. A must try item.

American hot wings- it comes in a piece of 4 backed up by an irresistable sauce. The chicken is soft. The sauce is just mind-blowning. On the first bite you get the sweetness and tangyness of the sauce but a few seconds later you can feel the hotness of it. An incredible product of this cafe.

Choco walnut pot cake- this comes in a bowl with a scoop of ice cream and sprinkle of chocolate. this is basically a cross between a chocolate cake and a chocolate brownie. its an amazing dish. chocolate lovers will definately love this.

Our journey with chaiwala was remarkable. Pocket friendly cafe. Would definately visit the place again.

I went to Chaiwala with some of my friends. This is a wonderful place for students as it is quite pocket friendly. We ordered cheese sandwich, chocolate smoothie and Soy honey chicken wings. The last item is a signature of the outlet. Never forget to order this preparation if you are in chaiwala. They serve 4 chicken pieces in a platter with gravy which would make you licking your fingers. They are also renowned for their burger but we didn't try it. Beside that I didn't find any speciality in the sandwich and smoothie. There is a drawback of the restaurant, sitting might not be available all time as the restaurant has very Small place.

Just 3 minutes away from the tollygunge metro station, this truly is a hidden gem. It is my favourite place to hangout with my friends. I've been here four times and once to attend an event. The ambience and decor is perfect for youngsters and not to forget, the free wifi. They have a wide range of delicious finger food and i personally like the irish frappe, soy-honey wings,ham and cheese sandwich, the double decker burger and the dark desire. All the items are affordable and equally tasty. The way they serve the bill in small baskets is also to be noticed. Looking forward to visiting them soon.

There's a new trend in town. Pick a 'desi' and considered to be a 'not so trendy' name. Combine it with fresh and minty ambience and food and drinks that are popular all over the World and you get a trendy, chic and happening place. The Chaiwala is one of those places. When you hear about the name, the first thought that might come to your mind is, are we going to a neighbourhood tea stall..? However, when you visit this place, you discover that its a neat, cosy, really trendy and happening little place. Loved the decor and the picnic theme. My Apologies to the owner(s) if that's not the theme they have gone with. Anyway, The service is good and pretty fast. 

Now to the most important part. FOOD.. The Beverages are excellent.. Got that homemade feel, sincere and made with care... I had the Chocolate Banana Smoothie and Luna had a Hot Chocolate and both tasted amazing then we ordered a Grilled chicken burger and a Smoked Pork and Bacon Sandwich. The Sandwich was too good i would go there again just to have that sandwich. The burger was crisp and the Patty was moist and juicy..¬†

Suggested by the expert and experienced zomato foodie ¬†reviewer Luna Chatterjee. This place is indeed a foodie's delight and in my opinion a 'Worthy' Joint.

A little restaurant (think 1bhk flat) in my para that easily gets missed by pedestrians eyes. But once you are in, it takes you with surprise.
It's a modern take on Coffee House for the ubercool generation. It's a place to hangout for hours with chai & various types of munchies to snack upon. The coffee lovers in you won't be disappointed too.
But as I said, it's small. So if you go after 6pm, prior reservation is a must.

A quaint little cafe, near Tollugunj Metro. As the name suggests, chai based drinks are its usps. When we reached , we were the only people there. Gradually people started arriving in twos or threes. We spent almost the entire afternoon there. We started with Caramel frappe and the double chocochip Frappe. They were yumm. Then as per zomato recommendations, we ordered the Grilled chicken burger and the chilli garlic Spaghetti which was on the special's menu. The burger was great. The spaghetti was dry, with shredded cheese and chicken. It was spicy too. We didn't enjoy the spaghetti much. For desserts, we had the Dark Desire mini scooper . It had brownie with chocolate icecream in a glass topped with choco chips and wafers. It was heavenly. Shall visit soon to try the other stuff on the menu.

The white sauce chicken pasta was quite tasteless but the double decker chicken burgers was quite savoury. The mocktails are exquisite. I tried the non- virgin mojito a pineapple based drink was as good as well the oh Oreo. Definitely recommended.üçîüç®üçπüòÑ

Saw this place sometimes back on zomato and finally could make a visit to this place today. Its a small place which they have utilized in great way . They have three area first one is seating area outside which has only one table,second is there store where they sell some hard crafted stuff and clothes where I found few things are reasonably priced whereas some are very expensive and last and the most imp there cafe ¬†which is very beautiful and cosy. I ordered chai wala special tea which they served in kulhad with two rusk was good in taste and Veg burger that too was good . Evening time i believe this place is always crowded because i had to wait for around 15 min to get a place :( . this place is reasonably priced because they dont charge tax

This is a cozy little cafe located quite close to the Tollygunge metro station. The decor is really cozy and homey and really nice.¬†
We tried the Double chocochip shake and the caramel shake - both were AMAZING! We also tried The Grilled Chicken Burger after seeing it in the recommendations and I am so glad we did. It is undoubtedly one of the best burgers I've had in the city!
The only dish I didn't quite enjoy was one in their day's special menu - Chili Garlic Chicken Spaghetti. Although the quantity was HUGE and there was a LOT of chicken in it, it didn't quite do it for me.
We ended the meal with this really cute dessert- the Dark Desire Mini Scoopers, which is basically a layer of cake with a big scoop on ice cream, topped with nuts, chocochips and a chocolate wafer. It was a nice end to the meal :)¬†
Looking forward to visiting again :)

Located at Tollygunge, finding this place might be a bit problematic as it is tucked away in a small lane called Graham's Land. The decor is worth talking about. Interiors have been done up just about perfect. The menu lacks a certain bit of variety though and a few more pork items can be welcomed. Staff's courteous and the food rolled out by the kitchen is exemplary! Must tries would be the bacon tornado burger. The bacon strips are done perfectly with that perfect smokey flavour and just about the right amount of barbecue sauce. Its a must try along with the pasta in cheese sauce with bacon which is severely creamy n cheesy for all you cheesy people out there! Last of all comes the dessert which was a walnut brownie with ice cream which didnt taste completely like a brownie nor like a cake but it was ah-mazing!!!! All in all if you're looking for foodgasms and a break from the regular MacD burger then this place is a must visit! Cheers!

The Chaiwala is a brand new cafe at Graham's Land and is pretty good. This is perhaps the best cafe in and around Tollygunge and is a much needed one. 

My top picks are Oreo Frappe,  Bacon Tornado burger and mocktails like Bloody Ocean and sunset. 

The burger is absolutely top class. 
I have plans to visit this place for the great american breakfast.

Visited this place due to its consistent high rating although being newly opened. It is a small and cosy cafe in a silent neighborhood in the tollygunj area. The interiors are minimal yet refreshing. The ambience is very comforting. They played instrumental tracks that added up to the aura.  The counter is made like a stall in any fair, with small and queer artefacts dangling here and there. You also have charging points near the tables, that is very necessary these days. Talking about the food, We ordered veg corn krunchy, which was amazing. Veggie delight burger was good too. Veg Mixed sauce pasta was average. Mango smoothie was good. Caramel frappe was okay. Chai was amazing. Service was nice. Only if the food was better!

A good showcase of how Kolkata serves up since really noteworthy food for a cheery price.
Starting off, the sandwiches were a little dry, taking away a bit of the yum their burger and wings evoked.
The rain beating down on a mellow Saturday morning pulled up my spirits higher than what the bacon tornado burger might have on its own, but then, I'll let this one pass! The meat, onion and cheese shot real close to the sweet spot, and the flavor on the piping hot wings was nothing home to write about, but was delicious nevertheless! Their fries, unlike most other places, didn't reek of excessive and recycled oil, were good enough i'd say.
The quaint atmosphere before the rush helped present this place well, lots of bright wood and a light template, detailed personalization all around, and a low table outdoors overlooked a small semblance of a garden and a quiet neighborhood. Maybe a joint I'd have frequented for long conversations, some stimulating tea and when needed, peace, had I lived in the the Tollygunge area. Thumbs up!

After getting deeply intrigued by the newly opened cafe in the heart of Tollygunge because of hearing about it so much,I finally decided to pay a visit on a late Friday evening.
On the entrance you'll notice that there's a little boutique with beautiful clothes, quirky home decor things like coasters, painted bottles and so on which adds to the already beautiful decor.
The place though compact, has alluring decor and every corner has been utilised perfectly. The seating arrangement comprising of wooden furniture and the high bar stools give the place  a fantastic look . 
Everything has been dealt with precision. Starting from the menu card to the cutlery in which the food is served to the cute bottles in which water is kept.
As far as the food is concerned. It could match upto the look and feel of this place because it was just as amazing. We ordered for Soy-Honey wings,Grilled chicken burger,Chocolate smoothie and a hot chocolate.
The soy-honey chicken wings was the one dish I had heard so much about and it could live upto my expectations and even more. The dominant taste of soya sauce along with the honey gives this dish a magical taste. I can very well say that this dish is one of the best chicken wings dishes served in Kolkata.
The chicken burger was also very tasty with a thick covering of cheese and a side of French fries.
All in all, I had a huge complaint about Tollygunge not having a good enough place where we could just sit and chat along with some great food. Seems like my prayers have been heard because inspite of the decor and food being so amazing. This place boasts of a very pocket friendly price rate.
All the buzz this place has been making is very well deserved indeed.

This newly opened caf√© is located quite near to the tollygaunge metro station, in a lane opposite to it! A glutton's paradise in the true sense of the term, with lip smacking dishes at unbelivably affordable prices! We ordered banana and honey milkshake with another mocktail, named dementor's kiss which were quite good! Then we gorged down our good ol' burgers, bacon tornado and double decker grilled chicken burger. The patties were thick and well cooked with generous dollops of cheese and thin-sliced tomato and lettuce- and there you have the makings of some of the best burgers in kolkata. Even though we were stuffed, we had to have the Rum brownie, a decision we could never have regretted! Though the place is really small and doesnot accomodate many people, it surely does serve us some delicious grub. Hope to visit again soon!

The Chaiwala
Featured in ‚ÄòHidden Gems‚Äô Collection of Zomato, this has been in my wish list for quite a while . Finally, got an opportunity to visit this place with a dear friend this evening. Well first of all I must say it is worthy enough to get it placed in that collection. The ambiance is pleasing, the staffs were awesome and food served was great. 
Located in Graham's Lane, off the Netaji Subhash road, it is very easy to find. Hardly a 10 minutes walk from the Tollygunge metro station. 
The ambiance is warm by virtue of the appealing decorations throughout, along with some old photographs reflecting the values of chaiwalas across the city. Wooden floorings, tiny bells along the main door which rings every time it is being opened, books and magazines in shelves, antiquated Victoria Watch all add up to a very positive, calm and soothing atmosphere. The interiors have hardly 5-6 tables and they also have one table outside, preferred for smokers. So you might have to wait before you get a table. The staffs were also courteous and friendly. Service was also fast unlike most other cafes. They also provide free Wi-Fi. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Double Decker Grilled Chicken Burger, Cheesy sauce Pasta, Non Virgin mojito and Sweet Mama Blueberry. The burger was really big and stuffed with chicken and cheese. It was served with French fries and tomato sauce. The Pasta was medium spicy with decent quantity of perfectly cooked tender chicken pieces. The drinks were also refreshing and good. Well, we missed the chai of chaiwala this time. Will definitely have that in our next fixture. 
Overall, one of the best cafes in the city with reasonable rates, excellent food quality, amiable ambiance, is surely to be visited for spending quality times with friends. Everything was good but most importantly what we found the best was its affordable pricing. All the prices in their chart are inclusive of tax.
Cheers!

This cafe is truly a hidden gem tucked in Graham's Lane, at just a stone's throw from Tollygunge metro station. Just take the road from Tollygunge towards Ranikuthi, and take the first left turn (just after crossing Silver Screen restaurant). Do note that phone networks, especially Vodafone, tends to get very inconsistent on this road, so make sure you don't have to rely on 3G connection for Google Maps. 

The ambiance was cozy by virtue of the retro railway clock and pretty decorations throughout, with an additional delight being its perfect lighting which brought a very positive feel to the place. And free Wi-Fi , what else do you want?

Next came the menu. I was surprised to see the prices so reasonable! Starting with the DOUBLE CHOCOCHIP FRAPPE which was thick, delectable and one the best of its kind. This was followed by the DOUBLE DECKER GRILLED CHICKEN BURGER, a really tall, juicy burger with two thick chicken patties sitting alongside generous portions of sliced cheese and lettuce between the two buns. It was served with French fries. The burger was more than enough to satisfy a bug guy's hunger. This was followed by CHICKEN WINGS IN SOYA HONEY SAUCE. The quantity was subtle and the wings were served in the most magical blend of hot and sweet. As we geared towards a sweet ending of the meal with the SINFUL NUTELLA GRILLED CAKE, which was indeed sinful and came in a massive portion, the waiter brought us a complimentary glass of MANGO SMOOTHIE as the bill exceeded 500 bucks. 

It is worth mentioning that the sweet items ( including the drinks ) were loved even more as they weren't excessively sweet to almost give you a brain freeze. Their subtleness won our hearts (and taste buds too, right?)

Overall, excellent food and lovely presentation all within a bill amount of Rs 640 (no extra taxes) meant the visit to The Chaiwala was a total win.
Cheers!

This place is located near my place. A small cafe for outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangements. Simple yet stylish decor, though some might find it hard to enter through the door. The serving side looks amazing set alike a pub joint with two long tools. Loved the ambience. They offer wifi adding a twist to it's password. The staffs are really well mannered. Adding to these decor is their newspaper print menu card which is a nice idea. U can find a boutique/ lifestyle store if u choose to enter through the other door.
Coming to my order
Peach iced tea- a little more sweet according to my taste buds
Soy honey chicken wings- absolutely delicious! The spicy tangy taste of the dish is delectable. A little suggestion will be not to add so much chopped garlic for garnishing (i guess that might be garlic). 
White sauce pasta- it was nicely cooked.okay..
Dark desire- this came in a small glass having crushed cake at the bottom nd chocolate icecream with walnuts to the rest. A small choco ball at the top. Fantastic!
Double decker burger- tasty nd juicy.loved it.
Will surely visit this place again n again. Not to mention we had a problem while paying through card, but ended up with a settlement for the process. The owner, sukrit is really helpful in that case.
Cheers The Chaiwala! Keep it up!

The first cafe at my home area..Just 6/7 minutes walk from the tollyganj metro station..and 2 minutes walk from indrapuri studio..located at graham road..it's a decent place serving good coffee and other snacks..Dropped in for an evening snack..ordered mocha coffee, cheesey sandwich and soy chicken.. In just one word...food was "yumm"..chicken pieces were juicy and succulent..sandwich had good amount of chicken and cheese filling.. It was a happy evening for me. 
It's just that the place is small ..and that's why you might have to wait for sometime to get a table for yourself..
There's also a boutique by the cafe entrance..if you want you can check out their stuffs even :)
PS.
Dropped in again today (29.8.16) for our evening snack..so editing my review. Ordered schezwan chicken pasta, grilled chicken burger, caramel frappe and their dessert of the day rum brownie!! Food was as expected ..delicious! Service was quick and friendly. We were pleased to see the place running well as we had seen on our first visit.. So double thumbs up!!
(the pics are from my second visit)

It's a nice little place not too far away from Tollygunge metro station - though you do need to use the map to find the place. Decent food and environment, courteous staff and nice decor - ¬†though nothing overwhelming. Although the price for 2 of 350 is a bit of a low estimate. Probably 450-500 would be a better estimate. Still probably would do good for people to try the place - because it felt like something that grows on you after a while.

The Chaiwala is one of the few chai cafes in Kolkata which offers variety of tea and foods in a cafe like atmosphere. I entered the cafe with a friend to spend some good time over tea. We ordered Chaiwala special hot tea and that was nice served in earthen cups, though over priced . Also, Spicy cheese sandwhich was ordered but they served us a sandwhich which had chewy cheese which we later figured out to be Chicken. The waiter tried to dodge the situation by saying that chicken was ordered which was later proved wrong. The most surprising thing was that the owner was bluntly sitting on the other side, witnessing the entire episode and just asked the waiter to be careful. He did not even have the courtesy to come and apologise. The only solution he came up was striking of the chicken sandwhich from the bill. One of the worst experience of a cafe where the owner should enroll in a class of customer interaction and cafe management. After all, branding is not just about opening a food joint with good interiors but the behaviour towards the most important aspect and that is their customers. Just hope them to get more professional in the coming future. All the best for their venture.

It's a cute little place tucked away in Tollygunge. The interiors are pretty with wooden furniture and flooring. Coming to the food , we had the mixed sauce pasta , cheese onion and mushroom sandwich , the double decker chicken burger , the grilled chicken burger and the mustard burger. They were very good with a well seasoned patty of chicken and a juicy slice of tomato alongwith onions. They were served with fries and ketchup. For drinks we had the coffee mocha , Irish coffee and Oreo shake. I really like their coffee because it was concentrated and well balanced and with a lot of foam. It was also not very sweet which I prefer. It's a pocket friendly place and I'd love to come back here again.

It has been a great experience I had with #Chaiwala.. The best thing about this restaurant is, it has great combination of superb inside decorations along with superbly duperbly teasty food. Personally I will recommend the soy honey chicken wing... oh man it was heavenly teasty... once you have this dish you can't resist yourself from ordering another one.. Also I would like to say that the other dishes we have ordered, were very teasty indeed.. I can't wait to visit the place one more time.. and have some different food from the next time..

This a quaint little place, located in Graham's Lane, a short distance from Tollygunj metro station. The ambience is pretty soothing, with it's music and all. Quality of food and beverages is really good. Staff is quite friendly too. A perfect place for a feel good experience with your friends or loved ones. Highly recommended. :)

Location: If you're travelling from Rashbehari side towards tollygunge, cross the tollygunge metro station and you'll see the road bifurcating. Take the left road, and then take the first left and you'll end up in a lane with The Chaiwala in it.

Ambience: Nice cosy, definitely has a caf√© vibe to it. It is very small though, with 4 tables (with 4 chairs each) and a few stray seats in front of the counter.

D√©cor: This place has been done up pretty nicely with wooden furnitures and beautiful Kolkata photographs hanging on the wall.

Staff is ver very courteous and polite and don't forget to ask them the Wifi's password.

Coming to food, we were four people and we ordered:

‚Ä¢ soy honey chicken wings
‚Ä¢ black currant milkshake
‚Ä¢ double decker grilled chicken burger
‚Ä¢ pork and bacon sandwich
‚Ä¢ bacon burger
‚Ä¢ chocolate pot pie

Okay first of all, I'd like to give them brownie points for their choice of crockery. It is q delight when you get served in such beautiful plates and bowls.

 ‚Ä¢ soy honey chicken wings was good. This was touted as one of their most ordered dishes and it sure lived up to its fame. For some people, it might be a bit too sweet but it worked for me. The heat from the chilies cut through the honey glaze and made a perfect amalgamation with all that garlic-ey soy sauce. Yum!.

‚Ä¢ Black currant milkshake was okay I would say. It was more of a melted ice cream than a thick milkshake. Taste wise good, texture wise nope.

‚Ä¢Double decker grilled chicken burger: O my God. this burger was epic. two freshly grilled chicken patties layers with two slices of cheese sheets enclosed in two burger buns. It came with a side of fries and ketchup. this burger was heavenly. To give you an idea of how enormous the burger is, I've attached a photo of me devouring the burger.
            

‚Ä¢ The bacon burger was delicious. Oh my, it was soo good. Grilled with generous amounts of grilled bacon and again served with fries and ketchup. Good stuff

‚Ä¢pork and bacon sandwich: The pork was in the form of salamis I reckon. It was again filled generously with bacon strips and came with fries and ketchup. Super tasty and the sandwich was grilled to perfection.

‚Ä¢ Choco pot pie: Basically a warm chocolate brownie on whose center sits a chilled vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce.What's not to like about this dessert? Gone in a few seconds.

Our bill added up to a total of around 1200 bucks. (No extra tax added)

Highly recommended!¬†

P.S.- If they grill a few bits of bacon till crispy and serve it with with the normal way they serve, ¬†It'll be heavenly. I mean, who doesn't love crispy bacon?

Well as a part of Exploring Kolkata's Best Cafeterias.. I always had a keen interest in visiting this Cafe and so decided to visit here on Wednesday with my Friends..!! The Outlet is located in Graham's Land just after Graham's Kitchen in NSC Bose Road near Tollygunge.. The Outlet is divided into two parts.. Right Hand side is a Small Outlet for Shopping as like Souvenir shop where items are good and quite cheap.. On the left hand side is the Main Dine-in Hall for the banquet lounge.. Ambience was amazing and the interiors were really worth praising and innovative.. With some light Music playing in Background.. You will love to have a hangout for a long time in the cafe.. Coming to the Staffs.. They still need to be more professional and experienced.. The Menu was a Huge and Long one with innumerable options for a Cafeteria but is quite reasonable and cheap.. We Ordered Latt√© , Chicken - Bacon DD Burger , Fresh Lime Soda Sweet and Grilled Cheese Chicken Sandwich.. Believe Me Guys.. Their Burger was Huge and Fully Stuffed.. Though expected to be a little more better but still it was superb in taste and quantity.. The bacon just melted in the Mouth and so was the Tender Chicken in it.. The Lime Soda needed to be a bit more Sweet negligibly but was very good.. The Latt√© was a soothing melter in the Mouth and the perfect Grilled and Baked Chicken - Cheese Sandwich was a phenomenal success.. It was amazing simply.. Overall I would love to visit this Outlet again and again as simply this is One of the Reasonable and Best Caf√©'s that I have came across apart from MUD and Few Others.. Do give it a Try Everyone.. I bet You will Love it..!!

Can be a bit hard to find, but what awaits you is worth it! We had an omlette, a salad, burgers, sandwiches and desserts, all of which were prepared and presented well.  Service was a bit delayed, but the staff is very courteous and helpful. My only gripe is that for a place named Chaiwala, they should serve brewed tea rather than tea-bags!

Talking about the good things, this place has that friendly ambience with pretty things to decorate it. Free wifi too. And definitely a pocket friendly one.
However, the food disappointed us highly. Went around the evening when we weren't really hungry. Decided to stick onto sandwiches. Okay so. Cheese sandwich it was added with too much salt.
The mocktails were complete disaster. Dementor's kiss and blueberry one. Both were utterly horrible. The former which I had tried, almost got me choked.
Maybe wrong choice with the menu, certainly not willing to visit again.

A small cafe but a cosy one The Chaiwala has earned immense fame over a very short span. And what exactly may the reason be ? A. a beautiful ambience
                    B. Not at all flashy
                    C. Serene
                    D. Great food
                    E. Unbelievably low price
                    F. Perfect quantity
The space inside is very small though so you may want to make prior reservations because this place gets more and more crowded as the sun starts to set.

The place can be easily located in the Graham's Lane. This place has earned a lot of publicity in quite a few months. 

Right from the entrance the place had a good vibe. The interior was very classy. I'm in love with the theme of this place. 

Now coming to food we ordered the Double Decker chicken burger, Bacon Tornado and Grilled Cheesy chicken sandwich. I heard a lot about their Double Decker Burger and finally I had it. It's very delicious but it's not worth the hype. I found it average. On the other hand the Bacon Tornado was amazing. It had a thick Patty with lots of bacon and ample amount of cheese. It was totally worth it. Coming to the Cheesy chicken sandwich it was properly grilled and was luscious. 
Sadly I went to this place twice but never found the Grilled Cakes on their menu. A bit disappointed. 

Service was apt. Staff were courteous. Overall I had a nice experience. They have a promising menu. Food is very cheap and inclusive with taxes. Would highly recommend this place.

The bacon white pasta was great as well along with the bacon tornado burger. The beverages r quite delicious also. They ran out of grill cakes. Hope they'd b there the next time i go n the many more times later.

Well, following the feed and reading the reviews it was kept in my wishlist for quite a few days and today i made it there. While returning from office checked it out with my gf.

Its located near tollygunge tramdepot, it will take less than 10 mins if u walk down the road towards garia and following it take the first left then walk straight about 30 steps it falls on ur left.

The decor is admirable i liked the idea specially the grayscale laminated hanging photos of some prominent roadside teashops in Kolkata. The soothing music playing in the background created a perfect ambience for some gossips with snacks. From the seats, water containers to the tea kettle presenting the bill every single thing has a touch of uniqueness in this cafe.

We ordered their speciality that is soy honey chicken wings,chicken schezwan pasta and lemon darjeeling tea. The soy honey chicken wings stole the show. It is undoubtedly unbeatable. It is very well described by many other foodies so i am not repeating the words but the fact i really enjoyed is that jhaal e amr kaan laal hoe gechilo still i cudnt resist tasting the sauce again n again. Its was awesome truly awesome. Pasta was also very well prepared. Lots of shredded chicken pieces, all the vegetable peices were nicely boiled and it had a tangy feeling which i really liked. But the tea was utterly dissapointing. It had no flavour and only lime juice in it. Presentation was so so but i liked the plates.

They donot charge anything extra and take only what is printed on the menu. Its pretty reasonable even for the student community. Everybody was very cordial and nice. Had a wonderful experience overall. Being located very near to my place i will surely visit here quite often.

Would have happily given 5 but only for the tea.

Situated in Graham's Land in the lane beside the liquor shop this place is easy to locate. The ambience is quite nice along with the service. Ordered one oreo frappe, non virgin mojito, chicken burger, French fries and soy honey chicken wings, chicken sausage krunchy, brownie. Though the oreo frappe could have been better, the rest of them were nicely prepared. The soy honey chicken wings certainly stole the show. Perfect balance of salt sugar and everything. Loved the presentation too. Overall very nice experience. Will visit again and again.

This place has garnered quite a name for itself in a short span of time. That coupled with the great ratings on Zomato, as well as recommendation from friends compelled the me to go and check it out for myself. 

It wasn't too difficult to locate and from the very entrance itself the place have a good vibe. The bench like seating, the plum walls accentuated with black and white pictures, the line of trinkets adorning the counter, the coloured glass bottles, the newspaper menu, everything added up to make it a really interesting and cosy little place. 

We ordered a Bacon Tornado Burger, a Peanut Butter Brownie and a Chaiwala Special Tea. And my liking for the three things were exactly in that order. The burger was amazing, with a thick, juicy patty, loads of bacon and of course, cheese. The fries which came with it too were pretty good. 

The brownie was almost like a regular chocolate brownie, with a hardly-there marbling of peanut butter. So it wasn't exactly what I expected, but was undeniably a good little piece of brownie. However, I didn't like the chocolate sauce at all. It was runny and extra sweet and was only making the brownie soggy. 

The tea was a typical cutting chai in a 'bhanr', served with toast biscuits. With a mild hint of cardamom, it is the typical conversation fuel. 

Chaiwala also has a shop selling knick knacks and clothes. I couldn't help but pick up a cute little notebook from here. 

The place, though almost tiny, has been designed beautifully. The menu looks promising and I will definitely go back to this place again, soon.

Location: It's situated in the lane beside the liquor shop on the way from Ranikuthi to Tollygunge. Prime location, very easy to find out.

Decoration: simple yet beautiful. Chaiwala pictures all around, provided with some books.
Ambience: Fine. Cafeteria experience.
Service: good!

Food: This is definitely the best part. They make the food with such care! I love everything I have tried till yet!

Must try: 1. grilled chicken double decker sandwich! Also bacon tornado sandwich. Try the grilled chicken burger if u are low in fund. It's equally tasty!
2. Chicken wings! Delicious!
3. The Nutella burst grilled cake! Honey and butter grilled cake is also good but I found it a bit too sweet. If u r a sweet tooth then try that.
4. The dark desire. Its lovely!! Chocolate ice cream with cashew, walnut, 1cadbury shot, chocolate sauce and to my surprise there was powdered cake dust at the bottom!
5. Chocolate pot cake! It's a conceptual brownie u can say! It's a small chocolate cake baked in a bowl with walnuts, above which they serve a scoop of vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce. The taste is much like the homemade chocolate cake. (I was stunned! It exactly had the taste of my chocolate cake!! Haha!)
6. Well definitely don't forget to try their latte and coffee!
I have the krunchies on my list for the 5th visit.
Lovely delicacies at pocket friendly prices!

Well I have something to mention to the management.
On my first two visits, I visited after 9pm and the owner was present as well. On our 2nd visit, I faced a bad incident! There was a group sitting in the last table. 3girls-1guy(bald). My boyfriend and I sat on the table for two, right next to that. From the beginning I had noticed the bald guy having his eyes stuck on me in an uncomfortable way. But more to it, he raied his phone in such a position from which it was clearly sure that he was taking my photographs! As soon as I told my boyfriend and he turned around to the guy, he immediately lowered his phone. We had to switch seats b/w ourselves. To my surprise when we switched seats, the girl sitting next to that bald guy, started to stare at my man ridiculously! She even made the other girls(her friends) sitting opposite to her shift at the 2 corners so that they don't guard the view and she can stalk well. Seemed like we are some alien sitting there or some artists for their entertainment! They were listening to every single word we were talking within ourselves, checking every minute detail about us, my dress, hair, his hair, his shirt, his physique. We heard them speak about us loud and clear!! We were shocked at this!!! 2 of the owners were present right beside!!! This group seemed to be friends to the owner! But their behaviour was damn annoying and embarrassing!!!
Dear owner m sad to tell u, please make sure ur friends don't make ur customers uncomfortable.

Ordered a iced lemon tea, pasta with white sauce(chicken) and soy honey chicken wings. I was really apprehensive about whether the order will reach me in time or not as I was staying at a guest house which is rather very difficult to find(even for the locals). The owner of the restaurant was very courteous and promised to deliver it within time and they did!!¬†
4.5 stars not because I got the food in time but definitely because the chicken ¬†wings were super awesome in taste. I cannot eat hot items, sadly the preparation was too hot for my taste. But I chose to shed tears and eat it rather than give up on eating ;)

-0.5 because the iced lemon tea was not up to my expectations.

Overall I would recommend that you guys order from this place without any worries and I am excited to try out the other items in the menu!

Note to self : Next time inform them about my inability to ingest "hot" food ;)

Indeed a hidden gem, this eatery is located at a 10 minute walking distance (or less, if you're not as lyadhkhor as myself ) from tollygunje metro. 
This quaint little place is beautifully decorated. If not for the food, you can visit this place for the ambience and adda. And I can assure you they will treat you with  *good* food as well. We had their  burgers and grilled cake. This 'chaiwala'  will also serve you quality tea for, well, a fair price. Would recommend their special tea. 
So, if you love trying new places to eat and hang out , this place should obviously be in your bucket list.

It's located near the tollygaunge metro station. If you're going from the garia side, it'll be on your right. If you're coming from anwar shah side, it'll be on your left. Google maps are handy for first timers.
The ambience was pretty nice. 8.5/10 for that. It has nice small arrangements for two and big ones for group. They have nice framed pictures of chaiwalas hanging on their walls. Plus I heard that they put up a small comedy show on Fridays. Will really keep an eye for that.
Coming to the food, we ordered bloody ocean which had a syrupy taste , although I'd prefer a bit more fizz in it. The schezwan chicken pasta was amazing. Will order that again for sure. The honey-soy wings were great. Last but not the least we had ordered vanilla pot cake. Now we were told that it's amazing. Definitely it was. It was all good till we discovered a small egg shell piece in that. That was a setback. Taste-wise and concept wise it was really good.
Will definitely visit this place again. :)

On my second visit, ordered the grilled chicken burger, American hot wings, caramel frappe, Oreo frappe and my favourite schezwan penne pasta :D The burger was amazing. It has the perfect moistness in it and the patty was good too. The frappes were a bit more on the bitter side and both of them tasted the same. The pasta was well done again. I personally loved the American hot wings. They tasted better than the honey soy wings. 

Tried fries with cheese and chicken today, lemon iced tea and chicken wings. Tried this place after two years and I must say that they've improved so much!

Heard a lot of this hidden gem located just next to grahams kitchen in grahams land.So finally decided to put my wait a stop and went here to grab some of their stuffs for supper.I ordered grilled chicken burger,cheesy chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and their speciality soy honey chicken  wings.The burger was the juiciest and messiest burger I ever had.And by messy I mean it was a good burger.And soy honey chicken wings was marinated to perfection that i had to initially lick my fingers.The nuggets and the sandwich was so so.Overall good experience and the experience was made great by the sweet and welcoming  staff.

Walking down the streets of Tollygunge, ever if you feel hungry, or stressed up with your daily chores; All you need is to take a turn to Graham's Land, where a wonderful place is awaiting to let you break through the shackles of monotony and stress and indulge in to some mouth watering delights, in a mellifluous ambience with awesome decor. "The Chaiwala", is the place I'm talking about!!!
The quintessential vibe the tea culture of Kolkata is evident from the name for sure, but the 'moment of truth' appears, when you actually get some piping hot tea to sip on in a 'bhnaar'(heated clay cup)- Yes, that's the way they serve their signature teas to the guests walking in.
So far the hospitality is concerned, I would like to salute the director Mr.

This quaint little neighbourhood cafe has been creating a buzz since inception and rightly so. Hidden by thick foliage it is not exactly visible if you do not enter into Grahams road. 
Great ambience and a tempting porch, dying to have sop of hot tea sometime during the monsoon. 
Since it is chaiwala, so I opted for Darjeeling tea and now famous soy honey chicken wings.
The chicken wings are a winner! Perfect balance of sweet, salt, sour and loads of flavour. the presentation is innovative.
Can't say the same about the tea though, I would have liked it to be more fragrant.  
Since the cafe was full, I sat on the bar stool and could watch their activities...a sincere approach shone thru...
Next time I am going to try the sandwiches.
Though they have breakfast spread on the menu, it is not yet served. Wish they start it soon.
Good to have a chaiwala nearby....

I read much about this place in zomato as well as some food blogs. N that is why i gave a visit. This is a small place with nice ambience. N no doubt that you will be greeted with a smiling face.
Now coming to food, we ordered the double decker burger, chicken wings in honey soya sauce(as recommended highly) along with a cold coffee. The burger was juicy with a grilled chicken, tomato, onion, lettuce and cheese. It came with fries. I liked it al lot. It is a must have. The chicken wings were very spicy, i will say a little too spicy for his(

What a place, loved it. Never thought i would love this place so much. I was thinking of visiting a New cafe free from hookah and final ended up here. The food is so fresh i mean when on my table the fresh bake pot cake arrived and i took tge 1st bite it just melted so spongy and ofcourse delicious. The chai was refrehing. The burger had nothing special in it but the taste and the bun freshness made it the burger i have eaten. The staff is friendly and always ready to help you out.
The place is little small so do call them before going. Sometimes small places make a big mark and i am sure a foodie will love it :)

The Chaiwala...
Too much taste in such a small place.
The first impressive thing of the restaurant is the location. Just 2 3 mins walk from tollygunge metro.

Decor is awesome, from the lights to tables to the salt shakers to plates. Are those plates made of stones ?
The menu card, just like newspaper, so impressive.
Ordered pasta and soy honey chicken.
Pasta was good.
Loved the chicken item. It was a first-time for me and it was waooo.. overall it was excellent.

Located in Graham‚Äôs land- Tollygunge, this is a great place to hangout with friends. The d√©cor is nicely done with wooden furniture. The food is  tasty and the price is reasonable. i really liked the chicken cheese sauce pasta. The choco walnut pot cake, served with ice-cream and chocolate sauce, was exquisite and had the warmth of a homemade chocolate cake. But I was disappointed with the mini scooper-berry berry vanilla. They had put a lot of mixed fruit jam at the bottom which was uneatable. Apart from that, the rest of the food was good. The staff is friendly and helpful. ¬†I totally love this place and would highly recommend everyone to visit it.

Had double decker chicken burger and cold coffee. Went to this place a couple of months ago and forgot to write a review. This place slipped my mind. It is a small outlet, but serves lip smacking food and justifies the rating it has on zomato. It deserves that much. The prices for the taste are a steal, i must say.

Located at Graham's Lane, it's a small cafe in terms of sitting space. It was highly recommended by one of my friends. I wasn't disappointed. Ordered Banana Chocolate Smoothie,which was satisfactory. I would give it 8/10. Shredded Chicken Omlette was good too, with generous portions of Chicken and veggies, and I will rate it 7.5 out of 10. Now, the best item which was I highly recommend to everyone. Chicken Wings in Honey Soya Sauce is capable of getting 9.5/10. We took snow white for dessert,which was vanilla ice cream with generous portions of cookies, cake slices, waffles and I would give it a 9.
Ambience and service wise also, it would score 9/10. So, 43/50 in my opinion which is 86%,thus enabling it to earn a rating of 4.5 out of 5. Will surely go back for the wings!! :D

Okay so a place to sit and enjoy the company you are with... The food here is really cool and mouthwatering. If I were to choose a favorite it has to be the grilled burgers. Soft juicy chicken meat patty and likely they say if it fits in your mouth it is not a burger. It is surely a mega sized one, the double decker grilled chicken burger. I really like the passion fruit ice tea here while there is just one reason I don't have simple tea here.. Tea bags.. I have never liked the concept myself, it simply spoils the aesthetics..
The other items I rather like are chicken sausage krunchies and the bacon omelette. The pasta is pretty decent, though I didn't like the garlic bread and the chicken wings. However very few cafes get as good a rating as this from me which proves how impressed I am.
In the dessert section I pretty much loved the choco walnut pot cake which was served with ice cream

I am from dhakuria,it is a hard fought route for me to be there,but now 3days back I decided to taste it and I found it worth sweating and tracking the map consciously for some time. Now in the last three days I had been their for two times.
  The food is very good,they strive to maintain their quality I guess. The atmosphere is not clumsy even being short of space. Very nice and thoughtful decor so that to compensate with the shortage of space. I would suggest people to try the american hot wings, and grilled chicken burger. I still have not tried their coffee part. But I bet they are equally up to maintaining the standards with the other items also. Keep going,best wishes.

Visiting the cafe yesterday was an impromptu decision by my boyfriend. It is very easy to locate and Google Maps come in real handy. The decor of the cafe really stands out but the accommodation capacity is low. After waiting we finally got our table. We ordered the Soy - honey chicken wings but it was unavailable. So we settled for Grilled Chicken Burger, Cold Chicken Salad, Hot Chocolate and Cappuccino.
It is definitely recommended and worth a second visit.

Read nice reviews about this place and wanted to try it out. Went there with friends for snacks and chit-chat. The small joint is located pretty close to the Tpllygunge Metro station, but inside an alley and so might get a little tricky to locate at first.
The seating area is small, but nice and comfy with a cute decor. Nice little space for a hangout. 
What we ordered: grilled chicken s/w, cold chicken s/w, grilled chicken burger, dementor's kiss mocktail. 
The sandwiches were pretty average to be honest and didn't excite us much. Also, the crusts should have been removed for the cold sandwich. 
The chicken burger was absolutely fantastic. One of the best burgers I've had in a while, and probably one of the bests in the city. The patty was cooked to perfection with the right amount of juiciness. 5/5 for the burger.
The mocktail, however, was a disaster. Tasted pretty horrible for a 135 bucks drink. 
The rating goes out to be 4 solely due to the burger. Would revisit, if not for anything less, the burger.

I loved the ambience of the place although the coffee was like sugar syrup. I got it changed three times and yet I only got a version which was still too sugary.
The cheese sandwich was nice.
For the people to go, I would advice them not to try the coffee as its too sugary. The tea is comparatively better.
Also with the quality served I found the rates quite hyped up.

Well. We i.e me and my boyfriend first started going to chaiwala because it always gave us the first date kind of feeling.  The food is so freaking awesome. Specially the lemon iced tea. And every one should try the walnut pot cake. It is so delicious. Then one friday.. a very rainy day it was.. we went to chaiwala because we had no where else to go to. And there was this group of stand up comedians who are absofuckinglutely hilarious. They made us go this friday too because they perform here every friday. And now we have become regulars for the friday evening. Even if you keep the comedi open mic aside... chaiwala is an awesome place what with good music. Good food. Beautiful photographs. And ya free wi fi. Oh and the owner Sukrit is very friendly. :)

A nice and well-decorated corner for the tea-lovers. Cool ambience with a good crowd attendance consisting of young age group only :-P Service is pleasant with quick response time and great suggestions. Chaiwala Special Tea has its own flavour and smell in a bhaar and the Peach Iced Tea is filling in its own taste. We had Cheese Onion Mushroom Grilled Sandwich and Bacon Omelette both of which was up and over the satisfactory level as they met our expectation. The sandwich was well-grilled with delicious mushrooms treating our tastebuds. The omelette was the cherry on the top. Surely a place with a goal of a 5-point rating. The added experience was the D√©cor Shop adjacent to it. A homely feeling touches you as cordial behaviour of the owner puts this Tea-Shop in your list of Bookmarks.

Chaiwala is one of those joints that strikes just the right chord between aesthetics and good food. We were hanging out there after the comedy open mic that happens every  Friday from 6pm. Budding comic after a successful open mic craves for nothing but good food. And honestly Chaiwala impressed us and how! I always wanted to try the Bacon Tornado burger and ordered for it. And oh boy! It was magnificent! I hate veggies in my burgers and requested them not to put tomatoes. The patty had the right softness and it was wrapped in pieces of bacon. Not deep fried, but the ones that makes u go weak in the knees! Amaaaazing!! We also ordered a plate of chicken spaghetti.  It was nice and had a good number of pieces of chicken. But it was little too spicy for my taste though. We also ordered for Chicken wings! It felt nice to be served proper chicken wings with the delicious soy sauce adding to the taste. I am a big fan of chicken wings and is often dissatisfied with the kind of stuff most Kolkata's restaurants serve. Needless to say, Chaiwala is a welcome break! Go. Today.

This place, located at the Tollywood-zone of the city (that is near the Tollygunge vicinity),  is like a cafe in your 'para' you would keep going back to.
The place is  small with nice and not so flashy interiors. It is mostly full during the evenings so you might have to wait to get a seat. 

Coming to the food, 
1. The coffee served here is just about perfect. Way better than the biggies (read CCD, Batista Coffee Bean and Tea leaves etc ). I cannot comment on tea as I'm not a tea-person. 
2. The frappes and the smooths are good but nothing extraordinary. I found double choco chip frappe the best.
3. If you are ordering one single dish here, go for the double decker grilled chicken burger. I really liked it.  The chicken wings did not go well with my taste buds. The jumbo sandwich was good as well. Ample meat and cheese to make it delicious. I had fires and cheese toast as well and they are good enough as nibbles with your hot drink. 

Overall Experience: Exceeds the  expectation you would have from a small cafe in a not so famous by lane. 

Extras: You can shop for some quirky stuff from the little store adjoined to the cafe and there is free Wi-Fi.

This place just cropped up out of nowhere. Made a plan before leaving Kolkata and landed up. Good day actually, some seriously good stand up comedy from a group whose name I am forgetting. 

Coming to food, ordered Chicken Wings, Darjeeling Tea and Chicken Grilled Burger. I must say they tasted really good. The food. The wings were a bit on the chilly side but that was really good. Loved it. The Burger was well made with a proper grilled patty and Cheese. It was juicy. I like it that way. So, yeah. Points.

The tea was good as well. Not extraordinary. But then again, what to expect from a normal Tea? 

Great experience. Visit the place, peeps. It's a bit small, yes but nice interiors and gives a good vibe. Plus, free wifi. :P

We finally visited this little outlet situated at the Graham's Land area of Tollygunge. I already had quite high expectations from this place, thanks to my co-reviewers in Zomato; and I must disclose it exceeded my expectations by many levels.

The ambience was pretty sumptuous yet humble. Adorned with contemporary decor, the vibe here is perfect for some tea and evening snack. My wife and I visited it on a late Saturday evening and despite the rush, the service was excellent and the food kept coming in pretty frequent intervals.

We had ordered for the Oreo Frappe with Ice-Cream, Soy-Honey Chicken Wings, Ham & Cheese Waffled Sandwich, Fiery Spetznaz Burger and Chicken Sausage Krunchy. The flavour of soy-honey with some chilli into it was absolutely ambrosial. The waffled sandwich was crisp and the filling was mindbogglingly juicy. The burger was large and loaded with pretty generous amounts of fillings in it. The krunchy was very tangy and baked to perfection.

Few months back, I had ordered for a home delivery from this joint, and it was an awesome experience as well. I had ordered for the Bacon Tornado Burger.¬†

It was simply outstanding. A simple mixture of bread, bacon and pure awesomeness. The burger was quite huge as well and with a very mellow stuffing. There were bacon fillets supplemented by a large bacon patty, some lettuce and lots of cheese. Every bite was just as savoury as it could get.

Finally, an awesome joint in the neighbourhood.

Although named Chaiwala, this place gives off a nice vibe of the new cafe culture. The service is polite, and the burger here is amazing. The drinks are average. and pasta best be avoided. But it's definitely a place to put on your regular visit list. Do try the aforesaid burger and sweet corn krunchies.

The Chaiwala is a nice place for a quick bite of the pocket friendly delicacies that they offer. The cafe boasts quite modern interiors and the ambience is something to be impressed about in such a cramped area. The quality of the food was also quite good, however it can be better.

We ordered two kinds of pasta for home delivery: white sauce veg pasta and mixed sauce veg pasta. Both were AMAZING! Not only did they taste good, they were also nutritious and did not have a crazy amount of oil which is something I have found in pasta preparations in other restaurant outlets. The food is also very affordable. And they wrote lovely messages on the take-away boxes thanking us for our order: so sweet! If you are vegetarian/vegan and are looking for some great food, definitely try this place; it won't leave you disappointed. Definitely plan to visit sometime and try the burgers and wedges. Lovely experience :)

Visited this place with great expectations. But I feel it is a little over hyped. 
Located in a small alley off Netaji Bose Road near Tolly metro. It is small outlet with seating space of around 20-25 people. Very well decorated with comfortable seating.
Every vegetarian guy has to try their Veg burger. It is really nice. The patty is really well made. The sweet corn crunchies were really nice. 
But other than these two most of the other things are not very good. 
Overall it is a good experience and it is quite economical.

Located right beside Graham's kitchen in tollygunge, this cute little place is really a new hub for the young crowd. The interior is quite decent, enough space to fit around 20-25 people at a go. It has an outside seating arrangement too ( too hot to avoid the AC these days though!) The place is well lit and the staff is well behaved. We had ordered cold coffee, lemon iced tea, white sauce pasta( bacon) , chicken sandwiches and choco chip pot brownie. Food was sufficient quantity wise and tasted good. Special mention must be given to the dessert. It was amazing! Oh, the best part is that the pocket pinch is reasonable. Visit this place guys! Highly recommended. :)

Ahhh..finally I got to visit this place.
A small cosy joint opposite to indrapuri studio,this place has got some real good stuffs to offer..we ordered lemom iced tea,soy-honey wings and chicken schezwan pasta...good food I must say...
but those chicken wings-those were something to die for...üòäüëç
And I will be coming back to try the rest of the menu...
Only con-
I just felt the quantity of the pasta is a bit less
P.S - I loved the boutique shop too.üëå

truly a pocket friendly restaurant with wonderful ambiance, apt for a sudden hangout.
this time we ordered smoothies, oreo frappe, grilled cakes and a non-virgin mojito.

firstly when we arrived , it was closed , we didn't know about the timings, but they were kind enough not to kick us out.
we waited for 1 hour and it was worth the food.
the staffs are good and friendly.

i loved the smoothie !
grilled cakes were sweet and awesome ! tried for the first time and it didn't disappoint me.
mojito was sour and spicy at the same time yet it was a good combination of taste.

hoping to visit this one again soon, but this time gonna try all the non-veg ones.

I ordered from this place on Friday 13th May 16

Before i talk about the food,i must talk about the service.I called up the place to find out about the different burgers.A guy took the call and very politely explained what is in which burger.Following that i ordered through Zomato.I received a call after 20 mins asking for the directions to my place and said that food will be delivered in 15 mins.Just as i disconnected the call,the storm started outside with wind and rain.I was pretty sure that the delivery will be delayed if not cancelled.Yet in 15mins i received a call from a lady saying that she has my delivery and was standing outside my door.I opened the door and saw a smartly dressed young lady with my delivery.The first question i asked her was how did she come?And she said she came in a car with her friend.

In Kolkata where many restros routinely cancel or delay orders just like that here was a place where a lady came in the wind storm in her friend's car to make a delivery.Top Notch commitment i must say.

Now coming to the food.

I ordered a Bacon Tornado burger and a Soya Honey wings.

The burger bread was neither soft and soggy nor too crisp.Just about right.The burger patty was thick and the taste as good as any i have had.The patty was sandwiched between two thick bacon slices and topped with a slice of cheese.

The Soya honey wings had 4 pretty large size wings.The taste was good but some what familiar to what i have had at another place.

Overall the food deserves a 4.0 and the service a 5.0.

I forgot to take the name of the the lady who came to deliver the food or the name of the guy who took my call,so if the restaurant owner sees this review,then please thank them for their wonderful service.

PS:Again ordered a home delivery on 15th May 16

This is a very small food joint, where around 20-25 people can sit at a time. But the food and the beverages they serve is totally going to blow your mind. We ordered a cold coffee, a cappuccino, a shakelato, chicken pasta, cheese garlic bread, and one plate cheesy ham burger. And the bill amount was ‚Çπ 750 only. So much to eat, at this amount. They don't charge any kind of taxes. 
The ambiance is nice, well decorated, cozy place. Best for an evening snack. They have free wifi too.

got grilled nutella burst cake which smelled of eggs, cold coffee was good and so was the mocktail called sunset!
the best one was the chicken sausage crunchy!'soft bread topped wth chilli flakes and a thick layer of mayo , topped with juicy pieces of sausages! price is reasonable

Tucked in a quant corner of Graham's Lane near Indrapuri studio, Tallygunge this is a place where u can go to soothe your mind away from the daily humdrum. The Chaiwala was on my wish list for a long time now and finally yesterday me and my friend succeeded in our quest to visit this place. The cafe is beautifully made up with wooden chairs, posters of kolkata chaiwala's hanging on the walls, chalkboard menu, vintage clock and a lovely selection of music playing in the background. Now coming to the food.
What we ordered-
Lemon ice tea
Irish frappe
Soy honey chicken wings
Mixed sauce penne pasta
Choco walnut pot cake
The food was really awesome and the pasta was out of the world. Highly recommended. The chicken wings were a bit tricky to eat but had a really good sweet and tangy taste. The pot cake was yum with the vanilla ice cream. Drinks were also good though I found the frappe a bit on the sweeter side ( maybe it's meant to be that way). There's only one suggestion that I have for them is that they should include pizza in their menu and it'll be perfect.
Overall we had a really good time there, eating and lazing around. And we are already making plans to visit again. üòÅüòÅ 
Happy dining folks!!!

This place stole our heart.A small area with some finger licking pasta preparations..Located at The graham land lane of Tollygunj ,just a few footsteps away from the metro.They even provide free wifi helping them to attract more young crowds. Their wifi password is very Unique üòÇüòÇüòÇ. WE had recommended White sauce pasta and schwezan pasta ,and We adored them. The staffs were extremely friendly ,cordial and helpful with us. We indulged ourselves in a long adda even after paying bills and nobody complained.Loved the expirience highly RECOMMENDED to all. Even they have kept the restaurant very tidy ,playing good numbers in backgrunds. I wonder how they could decorate the small space so well ‚ò∫

This cafe is beside the Indrapuri Studio and pretty quirky in it's look and feel. The wooden benches, the colours and the happy posters on the walls can instantly liven up your moods. I went around Valentines and they had the front glass wall done up with love messages written on pink heart shaped papers by the visitors and it looked so cute. That moment when they actually serve you nice and rich chai in a matka? Bazinga! The outdoor seating cries out for space but ideal for tete a tetes on breezy summer evenings! I have had their bacon cheese sauce pasta and it was HEAVENLY spelt all CAPS! The guys are so courteous. xoxo

Me along with my 4 frnds been there on last Sunday. We went there 1st time by seeing the review on Zomato. But after reaching there we found out honey soy chicken wings wings are not available as the frying machine was not working properly.
We ordered Peach and Passion fruit ice tea. The iced teas were not too sweet as per our request. But we liked the flavour of Peach iced tea rather than passion fruit.
Double decker chicken burger and chicken sausage crunchy was good but not super type. Choco walnut pot grill cake blown us away...super tasty n yummy. But honey butter grill cake was just ok ok type.. Cheese sauce chicken pasta was too tasty. Lastly the waiter surprised us by giving their famous dish honey soy chicken wings as complimentary as we waited for 2.5 long hour there. That is definitely their signature dish..chicken was crispy but soft..the blend of honey with soya sauce was just perfect.
A good place to hangout with frnds and loved ones...and also pocket friendly.

The place is a 5 minute walk from Tollygunge metro station towards Netaji Nagar.. We actually made the mistake of getting up in an auto to netaji nagar and then getting down a minute later. It was a hot summer noon and the place was empty. The silence was too much for easy conversation to occur and at our request, the waiter put on some music. There is enough seating accommodation for about 16-20 people maximum.

We ordered Peach Iced Tea, Lemon Iced Tea, Non-Virgin Mojito. The iced teas were not too sweet as per our request. The non-virgin mojito was as weird as it's name. It had a weird minty aftertaste reminding us of toothpaste.
The burgers came next. They were quite yum.
But the star was the honey soy wings.
They were spicy,they were sticky and they were sinful.

We were too full for desert. I do not remember them charging tax much. The bill for three people was around 1000.
            

Been here a multiple number of times after this. Love this place. Increasing ratings.

Beside Indrapuri studio, in Graham's road, the new cafe joint have recently sprang up. Small and cozy, this place is quiet uniquely decorated with wooden furniture presenting a very fresh look and ambience. The food is quiet normal and super cheap. One can opt for double patty n cheese mega burger here along with a sip of tea in earthen cups. As per the cons section is concerned, I personally dint find any such things . This place is surely worth a try.

Located about 300m from tollygunje petrol pump(in the first left towards ranikuthi), this is a place I had heard a lot about. I dropped in at around 4 and was pleasantly surpised by the tasteful ambience and decor. Adorned by wooden tables and chairs it gave very friendly vibes.
We ordered 1 lemon tea with honey, 1 lemon iced tea, 1 chicken popcorn, 1 cold chicken salad and 1 grilled ham and bacon sandwich. The quantity and the taste are the standouts here. Everything tasted great (especially the tea based items). The quantity is so good that we could not finish and had to pack our sandwiches. The bill amounted to Rs.745.
Overall I suggest everyone to visit this place atleast once, if not more. I am looking forward to visiting this conviniently located cafe again. #chaddicted

1. Caramel Frappe: a cold coffee served wid a swirling of caramel.. d bitter taste of coffee and d sweetness of caramel was quite good.
2. Chicken Sausage Krunchy: aahhh this dish was just amazing...though i dont know why its called krunchy.. d bread was soft d mayonnaise was yum d chicken sausages were well cooked..and d herbs as toppings made d dish even more delicious
3. Sunset : a orangy mocktail...nice
4. Grilled Cake: i had high expectations from dis one but it failed... look-wise it looked yummy..but i didnt find d taste so good.. d cake or wat to call it d bread was soft..going by d name i thot it to be b crunchy.. there was also the smell of eggs which i didnt like.. d vanilla essence cudnt hide d smell.. so disappointed wid this one.

Last Wednesday,i hopped into this place...mostly because this place has gathered much reviews in zomato for quite sometime now...i liked this place all at once i entered...a small cafe with not more than 6 tables...the decor is nice too ...they provide all the items like any regular cafe with affordable price...we ordered for a cafe latte and krunchy chicken as a customised version of small pizza but the spice quotient in it were too much to take....one drawback the cafe has is i think the staff out there are too reluctant to hear the guests ...one has to call again and again to get their attention which is not at all desirable for a such a small cafe

It is a nice place to hang out with friends and siblings. The price is affordable...student as well as pocket friendly. They give a warm welcome and service to the customers. I went there plenty of times and ordered mocktails like sunset, non virgin mojito, apple snyder, chocolate smoothies and also ordered cappuchino. Presentation of food is very nice. We also ordered pasta, spicy cheesy chicken sandwich, soy honey wings, crispy fried wings etc. I would always prefer and suggest this place for others to visit. Love Chaiwala.

Food is really good! Chaiwala nailed almost everything1. Food is amazing
2. Minimum delivery of Rs. 200. ¬†I am a student and hence, i cant afford a 500 ruppes minimum delivery every time. Plus they deliver all the way to garia!
3. No tax or packaging charges. You pay what you see in the menu! +1 for that
4. The manager who sometimes takes order over the phone is super friendly from what it seems5. Now someone pointed out down in the review section that all items arent available in the online menu system and thats true! hope you guys will work on it!Overall its a solid 5/5 if only they make everything avaialble to the delivery menu as well.

Concise but still they are flawless at what they make!¬†Now my complain is that not all the items on the normal outlet menu are avaialble on the online delivery menu! nuttela burst cake, penne pastas, espresso, capucinnos, omlettes nothing is available on the delivery menu! I have a leg injury so it will take some time for me to heal to make it to the outlet but please make all the items available to the delivery menu as well :(¬†

If you are coming from tolly metro,walk towards ranikuthi and take the left gali right after the liquor shop.Was planning to go to this place for a really long time.Finally,went there today(2.5.16) and was damn impressed.Only one visit has made this a favourite of mine.When we sat down,the guy notified us that the AC wasn't working and was likely to get fixed within 15mins.This was a very very nice gesture.Browniw points for that.We wanted to order pasta and scrambled eggs.But the waiter suggested the soy honey wings instead and we took it.We had ordered the chicken pasta in white sauce and a lemon iced tea.The food?Very very impressive.The quality is impeccable. The decor is really nice.Lovely ambiance.And no vat.

I think I had the Classic BLT at Chaiwala. And iced tea to go with it. I am a fan of food outlets that have a good decor, because I feel that you can recreate the food you are having (awesome chefs at home :P), but the ambience and the customer service are two things that I look out for. Ambience was too good and the reason I might go back. Service satisfactory.
I liked the BLT sandwich which had generous amounts of bacon in it. The kitchen counter was prettily decorated like the rest of the place. You also have a cute little sitting area outside for people to enjoy a fag. 
A perfect getaway for a lazy evening, I would say!

I generally don't write reviews on a single takeaway! Reading such amazing reviews I had odered a spaghetti (chicken) a month back through zomato, the spaghetti was not well made and on complaining the person on phone said he would be careful the next time onwards. Yesterday deciding to give it another try I called for a chicken salad and a wings, the salad was bad, it smelled of rotten onions a and wad filled with onions, the chicken was hard. The chicken wings were good, but loaded with too much cornflour. I think their quality drops majorly with delivery.

After reading numerous reviews about this place ,finally i and some of my friends decided to visit this place. This small cafe located in graham road is really one of a kind! The decor and the ambience of the cafe was really good. Coming to the food part, at first we ordered green tea, fresh lime soda and lemon tea , all of them were good. Then we ordered white sauce pasta. Have to say this i havent eaten such good pasta dish for quite a long time. It was superb in taste. Then we ordered honey spicy wings . They were very juicy,spicy with right amount sweetness and generous amount of that sticky spicy honey sauce. They tasted heavenly!!!! Then at last we order nutella burst . Grilled cakes with right amount of chocolate sauce and choco chips tasted very good. All in all my experience in chaiwala was too good. Hope to have more such great experiences further in this cafe :)

It has been almost two years i have been a member on zomato and in these two years,i havent wrote one single review about any restaurant from what i remember, maybe because, I am way to lazyand secondly i find it very hard to describe food, hardly can i cook maggie, who am i to critique food hah? :P ¬†Though i love to go through all the reviews about the different restaurants here in kolkata !

Now Chaiwala, where do i start really? Every single thing about chaiwala is perfect. Starting from the food,to the delivery, to the packaging, everything , hey I am not much of a food expert like i said before but all i know is,
their food tastes phenomenal! starting from the cold chicken salad to the grilled chicken burger to the frappe and the sandwich! ¬†I dont know what else to say but you guys really need to try out their food and i promise you, you'll be pleasently surprised! This is the 6th time i got my food delivered from chaiwala and oh boy! everytime it just gets better! :)

Its been two weeks since i visited this place. So this review is long overdue. After a long wait we finally went inside and were very pleased with the decorations- simple yet elegant. After a bit deliberation we ordered lemon iced tea, spicy cheese chicken sandwich and polynesian wings. Every item we had was lip smacking. The wings were very spicy however we liked it that way. This place is especially recommendable for the students as they will get good quality food at affordable prices.

The decor of the cafe is simple yet attractive and it's obviously a great place to hangout with friends and indulge into limitless gossips. We had ordered for cheesy chicken sandwich, spicy cheesy chicken sandwich and grilled cake (nuttella burst). As for the sandwiches, they tasted good but what blew my mind away was the grilled cake. This was the first time I had tasted grilled cake and the first impression was awesome. As this is my first review of the cafe, and I am yet to try the other dishes; I would request all the foodies and non-foodies out there to try the grilled cake without fail. I would like to visit the place again and hence, for now, leave a rating of 2.5 out of 5.

Ordered online through zomato...they r giving 10% discount on home delivery and luckily they deliver to my address...! I was craving meat for so long now...that finally decided to order this afternoon.
1st of all...this place in Tollygunge delivers to Lake gardens with a minimum order of Rs.250. I ordered for Rs.290+20 packing charges and after 10% disc it was Rs.281...which is good.

Coming to the food...ordered 1 Grilled cheesy chicken sandwich and Grilled chicken burger with fries and mayo.
The delivery was done within 30 mins though the expected time given was 1 hr which was gr8.
The best part is their food though....I never had good burgers in Kolkata...most places don't know how a burger patty is made...they normally crumb-coat it like a cutlet which makes it hard. But this place made the juiciest chicken patty...perfect size and perfectly seasoned soft patty with a layer of cheese and onions and some salad leaves...I liked that they didn't overload with toppings. I just couldn't believe I was having such a gr8 burger for Rs.150 that too in Kolkata.
Next, Cheesy chicken sandwich...filling had enough chicken pieces,cheese,sweetcorn,red bell pepper nd chillies. Priced at Rs.140...worth it.
Only disappointment was the French fries,they were crunchy...but bit too oily and had a bitter taste...Don't know why. -0.5 for that.
Lastly, The food came in a paperbag came with a Thank you note which I never found before.
15.05.16... 2nd review.Deducted 1 point for poor quality of food. The sandwich I ordered had fungus growing on the edges of the bread...and guess what...I saw it just before finishing it. I have pictures to show that. Basically the bread was stale.
The resturant should be more carefull in this matter. I'm highly disappointed and also scared that I may fall sick after eating that stale bread.
After complaining on zomato,the owner called me and said sorry and offered a refund but I said it's ok. They better maintain quality in future. +0.5 for customer service.!

Good food at affordable prices.I had expected that this shop would be purely dedicated to tea only but more delicious things are being served. I like the interiors and it's a cool place to hang out with friends. Service and staff is satisfactory. Ambience is pretty cool. And by the way free Wi-Fi is also available. That's a pretty big deal now a days :P

It's a nice cafe...tucked away in the lanes of tollygunge. We ordered an iced peach tea which was too sweet and syrupy and a cold coffee. The coffee was good, but again a bit on the sweeter side. Then the mixed sauce chicken pasta and soy honey chicken wings arrived. Both the dishes were tasty but by now, I was convinced the chef is a bit too generous with sugar. We topped everything off with lemongrass and ginger tea. It was definitely the highlight of the evening. Price is reasonable. Overall it was a pleasant and economical experience. Will probably visit again. But please, Chaiwala, cut down on the sugar!

To beat the 40 degree heat in Kolkata, I along with my husband visited this quaint li'l cafe located near Tollygunge metro. Gmaps will be handy to locate the place for 1st timers in this area. The entrance door is very narrow though but i liked the ambience. As soon as we seated, we ordered for lemon iced tea and soy honey chicken wings. The lemon iced tea was one of the best in the city. Very refreshing. Perfectly done. But the main highlight was the soy honey chicken wings. Its a star dish of the place. The sauce is outstanding. Finger licking totally. Must try for people visiting here. Service was quite good. Pricing is reasonable too. A really nice place.

You must have heard the name of The Chaiwala. A small caf√© in Tollygunge providing an impressive variety of food. Known for its well made pasta, Chaiwala should be on your list to visit if you're a Kolkata foodie!

Location: The Chaiwala is easy to locate. It is in Tollygunge. A few minutes walk from Great Eastern and is on the same lane as Graham's Kitchen.

Food: This place may seem like an underdog but it brings big game to the table. Food here is fab. 

Chicken Hotdog Burger: Burger buns accompanied with pickled onion and freshly cut tomatoes tossed in a bit of mayonnaise and served with big chunks of sausages inside. This is complemented with a side of fries and a tangy mayonnaise dip. Tastes pretty damn good. (3.5/5)

Mixed Sauce Pasta with Chicken: tastes nothing like your regular mixed sauce pasta. Penne with a thick mixed sauce that tastes very different and very out of the world. This is accompanied by pieces of chicken and dressed with shredded parmesan cheese. A must try. (4.5/5)

Oreo Frappe: a chilled coffee and chocolate based smoothie with broken, tiny pieces of Oreo strategically kept on top. This summer drink is served with three to four Oreo cookies. (3.5/5)

Management: the staff here is well mannered and the service here is fast. Light music in the background allows smooth conversation. Ambience is warm. Light on the pocket. However it is a bit small in size.

The ubiquity of The Chaiwala had started becoming quite evident in Zomato for some weeks now, either through it's online ordering promotions or reviews from fellow foodies. As the place seemed to be quite the hit amongst the young, we planned to check out this new kid on the block while catching up over coffee.
The very first turn-off that we had to face on reaching the cafe today in the evening, was a long and tedious wait for over 35 minutes. There was an event going on inside and the tiny place was crammed with people with not a single seat left empty. The owner came out after short intervals of time to convince us that the program was going to end in 10minutes and those 10 minutes arrived shortly after 40 whole minutes had passed. For the whole time we stood outside without being offered a chair even. Later into the evening when I had suggested that they could've kept a couple of plastic chairs at least (as it was quite obvious that there would be a lot of people waiting outside while the event was going on) the only thing which seemed to bother him was that "plastic chairs would spoil the look of this place". Well, no one is stopping you from keeping extra wooden chairs instead, but to be honest, no one gives a damn about the prettiness of a place when their legs start paining due to standing over 35 minutes at a stretch. If we had any other option nearby, we would've left the place but we had already wasted a lot of time, hence we waited.
So finally the three of us went in, occupied the largest table and placed our orders; a Hazelnut Cino, Cafe Mocha, Double Choco-chip Frappe, Cheesy Chicken Sandwich and Soy Honey Wings. Both the cappuccinos came with a thick top layer of froth which was more lovable than the coffee itself. Cafe mocha was sweeter with a nice and strong chocolaty undertone and the hazelnut cino was robust with the flavors ready to kick in from the very first sip. The coffee came in with two salty cookies each.
The frappe somehow lacked the punch I had expected it to have, but it was nice to sip on, nonetheless. When the sandwich came in, the smell of oregano mixed with cheese infiltrated the whole air above our table but one bite into it left me feeling disappointed. Firstly, the sides weren't cut, which made the grilled bread harder to chew. Secondly, the filling was quite meagre. I could hardly feel anything except for the aftertaste of some herbs and capsicum in my mouth.
Now, the dish which saved the evening and prevented it from turning into a bitter one was the soy honey chicken wings. Four peices of chicken wings were nicely laced with a mixture of honey and soy sauce and covered with chopped garlic and some greens. They were juicy, flavorsome, soft and so yummy that I had to constantly lickmy fingers clean. I also loved how the sweetness from the honey didn't dominate the overall taste. This is probably the best value-for-money dish in the menu and an absolute must have!
Just when we were assured that the evening was going to end well after all, something happened which turned us off right again. When we had asked for the bill, the owner came up to us himself and stood in front of our table, staring for the whole time while we were taking out the money from our wallets and I found this action to be really, really rude. It's basic courtesy to provide your diners with some privacy and time when they are paying the bill.
Anyhow, despite all it's shortcomings, Chaiwala is a nice place to enjoy your evening cuppa with friends and the place has a decor cute enough to make you forget about the space crunch. Hopefully the owners would read this review and try to work on the aforementioned points.

P.S. The earlier review got deleted due to some reason and I could not read the whole reply posted by the management. I would request them to post it again.

After the long await, finally I was there this evening...quite crowded n the cafe decor was truly eye-catching...
We had the double decker bacon burger, which was splendid n exotic. The meaty bacon n patty with cheesy toppings of tomato n onion was mouthwatering... The soya chicken was just finger licking good...the sweet n tangy sauce with sauted garlic was delicious...
Overall, quality n comfort food...n best place to go for an evening adda with friends on weekends along with delicacy bites...

A much waited visit, I had quite high expectations from Chaiwala and it did not disappoint me. Though it was a full house, we managed to get a seat on the porch of the cafe,which not only gave us a bit of privacy but we could also laugh our heart out without getting worried of disturbing other tables. The decor is minimal and classy.
Now coming to the food:

Bacon wrapped chicken burger - The best burger I have had till date in town; the patty was juicy n delicious, and the creaminess of the cheese, the meatiness of the bacon, the tang from the tomatoes..its just perfect. I literally was having it with all hands and legs. 
Lemon Ice Tea : Its simple but good.
Hazelnut cino : The hazelnut taste runs through the drink making you crave for more and before you know your glass is empty.
Soy honey wings : Tasty, sticky, you cannot stop licking your fingers or even from scraping the last bit of sauce from the plate.
Chicken omelette : It was okay..appropriate for breakfast.
Oreo Frappe : I loved the hint of bitterness which beautifully balanced the oreo sweetness.

My only suggestion would be to expand the place as soon as possible, and to give a tad more attention to the presentation.

The best part about the place is the warm reception you will receive. The place is built with a lot of care and passion and that reflects with every food item of theirs, its like they have picked one thing at a time and tried to bring a difference from the mundane while keeping in mind the sensibilities of the classic. Well done guys. I definitely going back :)

A quaint little cafe in Graham's Lane near Tollygunge , The Chaiwala is an amazing place for an evening hangout. Although the seating space is a constraint yet the neatly done interior brings coziness to the place. Coming to food, we ordered lemon ice tea which tasted amazing after a hot day, Passion fruit ice tea which was slightly on the sweeter side and another fantastic frappe called peacacho. Aroma of peanut butter with sweetness of caramel and goodness of chocolate in coffee. I took a cold chicken salad which was beautifully made. Finely chopped coleslaw, onions, cabbages in a mayo base with sliced grilled chicken. If you are the health conscious type this can be yours truly. Bacon wrapped chicken burger seemed sinful but apart from the main patty the usage of raw onions again won't get a thumbs up from me. And it was a bit tad dry. Soy honey chicken wings was the stunner of the evening. 4 portions of chicken wings in a thick soy gravy with a hint of sweetness and detectable flavor of chopped garlics. Service was prompt but they are kind of understaffed. Hence it was becoming an issue for the two of the staffs to provide attention to all the tables. Otherwise thoroughly enjoyed the food and the pocket pinch really motivates you to go back to the place. Recommended.

Visited for the first time last evening. It's a 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station (Mahanayak Uttam Kumar). We were a group of 10 and were looking for a place to organise a small farewell get together. We were expecting the place to be crowded and noisy, as it was a weekend. However, as soon as we entered the cafe, it felt like we're stepping into our own little getaway, away from the busy & noisy ( & blistering) streets. The ambience and decorations are distinctive, with photographs of chaiwalas through the ages. 
After settling down, we ordered Oreo Frappe (really good), Schezwan and White Sauce Pasta (it could be better), Sweet Corn Krunchy (this is an innovative item), Lemon Iced Tea and their signature Chaiwala Special (the best tea I've ever had). 
Now for the best part - the staff. As they say, "A place is only as good as the people in it." They make this place special and are really courteous. Their service is brisk and they even let us play their guitar (which also doubles as a prop) and sing songs. I'd like to express my gratitude to the staff for satiating our needs and making sure we had a great time.
I'll surely revisit, as I didn't get to try the non veg items on their menu, as most of the people I came with were vegetarians. ;)
PS: Do check out the quirky quotes written at the bottom of their menu. The effort they've made to design such an exclusive menu is commendable.

I recently ordered home delivery from this place. And I did it online on zomato. It was much easier than I thought it would be.  The delivery was quick and the food was reasonably hot. Coming to the food. I had ordered the veggie burger and corn cheese tomato grilled sandwich, both of which were good. I had also ordered some french fries which were alright. They could have used a little more salt though. They were a bit bland. All in all, will recommend this place

Well, the mood and the decoration of the cafe says it all with its classic photographs hanging on its wall. The food here is next to awesome. I have tried the tomato corn sandwich last night and it was yum. My all time favorite is the one and only black coffee without sugar but again if you are a taste-lover u must go for the cold coffees with ice-cream. Its a great great great place to hang around with friends and family. Last but not the least "thechaiwala" makes the most classic "chai" [tea] I have ever had. I am almost addicted to this place not just because of the ambiance and the food but also because of the behavior of the staff and cleanliness.

This place is unexpectedly beautiful. You wont find such a nice place anywhere near to this area. 
This caf√© has definitely got a very innovative decoration. Starting from the chair tables to the wall paintings and fancy decorations, everything is made upto the theme. a very nice cosy place to spend your time. Enough sitting arrangements. So you wont have to wait during rush hours. 
Talking about the menu. This cafe has got a wideeeeee spread of menu. Teas, coffees, smoothies, mocktails, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, chicken wings and everything is there. A wide range of foods available.
Prices are kept wise. 
Service is good. 
Comfortable seating arrangements.

1st thing i wana say bout this place is "unexpectedly  unexpected place" !! üíÅ
 I visited The chaiwala for the 1st time with my friend üë´ after checking out the place @Zomato. U cnt evn imagine there could b a cute decent  cafe inside that congested alley . without zomato, For an outsider  its impossible to hv a knowledge bout this place. Anyway its Tucked inside a quiet lane, this is seriously of those out-of the box cafe, where u can get peace of mind & can engage yourself in a delightful conversation with ur friends for long time. Or, u can even site alone, enjoying hot and warm tea or coffee or even their amazing shakes/smoothie/chillers while digging in at some of their quick bites. üçΩ üç∑ This place üè°Nicely decorated in a classic vintage tone. And their food presentation is very innovative. We had orderd chocolate banana smoothieüçµ , ice tea üçπ,  chicken wings üçóüçñ. Evrythg  tastes great but Chicken wings was unexpectedly saucy. üòï Hot n sour. I personally dont like very saucy things, although my friend loved it .üêÆ I would like to visit this place again n try different dishes for sure.  mayb next time my eyes get stuck in something nice dish from the menu,  which will  touch my taste buds.üòá

Lovely Concept, Tasty food, Good service- Very satisfied.

Over the last couple of weeks I was following the great reviews this place was bagging and made it a point to visit it soon. So dropped in with a couple of friends today and was pleasantly surprised.

The little porch outside the cafe is sweet. If you list yourself amongst the ‚ÄúKhatey Pitey Khandaan ka bold and obese bachcha‚Äù (like me), it is advised that you push both compartments of the main door together, to drift comfortably inside (learning from experiences).

Once inside, you are sure to notice how uniquely the interior has been done. It is not over cramped, and the picnic tables with comfortable benches are a sure shot win. There is a casual shack like feel, thanks to the beautiful counter, which I personally loved. All very impressive, yes, but, now coming to the food.

Beverages: 

We ordered a Peach Iced tea, an Irish Frappe, and a Pee-Ka-Choo. The Peach Iced tea was the favorite of the table (though a little too sweet for us, but I am sure that can be easily altered). Compared to the frappes, it did score a little higher. The place is called The Chaiwala after all. 

Food:

1.¬†¬† ¬†Soy Honey Chicken Wings:¬†¬† ¬†

This dish is the best seller of the place, as we were told by our attendee, and has all the reasons to be so. It is hot, tangy, and sweet and within no time, we were salivating. It has a fine crunch on the outside and is juicy on the inside. We wiped the sauce clean off the plate. Though full, we were still debating on ordering another plate of these. 

2.¬†¬† ¬†Pasta in Cheese Sauce with Chicken:

Good pasta. No complaints there. Not as exceptional as the Soy Honey Wings.

3.¬†¬† ¬†Double Decker Grilled Chicken Burger with Wedges and Grilled Chicken Burger with Fries: 

The first bite might not interest your taste buds, as it may taste averagely spiced for the Indian palette. As you keep going for your consequent bites, the flavours take form and you do enjoy the seasoning. The best part is unlike other burgers available in the city, the patty is not fried, the burger is not exceptionally greasy, the bun is soft and the patty is thick and meaty. The burgers generally come with fries, you can order wedges for an additional Rs. 30. Pasta scores ahead of the burgers.

4.¬†¬† ¬†Grilled bread with Nutty Chocolate Spread and Peanut Butter:

On special request, we were served with some grilled bread with both peanut butter and chocolate spread. When you have a craving, you just ask, even if it is not on the menu. Though we were presented with what we asked for, it was not really what we were craving for. We were hoping for hard, crunchy toasts, the bread was not quite there. The chocolate spread was topped with a layer of caramelized sugar, made it a bit bitter. We had to leave the plate unfinished. Certainly not the favorite dish out of the lot. 

All in all, the beverages were above average, the mains were very good, the toasts a little disappointing. I can easily forget the toast, or maybe not order them the next time.

When you think the word "Chaiwala" your mind can gives you the picture of street tea shops around the city.... But you'll be amazed when you come here.

The deco and the ambience was not as same like tea shop or any other caf√© in the city but simply like small American diner. The furnitures, musics played in background, lights all were liked the same.

Now coming to service and I must say I was impressed. I guess those two boy and the girl were two owners of the place and they are caring each and every person on the room. Service was too good.

From the liquids I tried peached iced tea and Vanilla iced tea. Peach tea was spectacular but vanilla was okeish.

Coming to the foods which they were offering a lot from the menu... 
My stomach was full because this was my 3rd visit on one day so I tried simply the chesse chicken grilled sandwich and Bacon Omlette.
Sandwich was perfect and omlette was also good. Presentation was fine. 

If I judged them by their food then 4/5 is enough but am giving them extra 0.5 for their ambiance and innovative deco.

The Chaiwala is a hidden gem in true sense, tucked in a narrow lane, this place is absolute bliss. Very nicely done interiors, great food and the best part are the prices :D. We ordered for two flavours of iced teas namely Peach and Lemon, with lemon being the best. Our order was followed by the Cheese sauce pasta (with bacon) which in true sense is pure delight and the grilled cake, which was not that great. Staff is very cordial and service is fast.
Do give it a try and do not miss the cheese sauce pasta :) ;)

A place as cosy as this one, in particular, is a perfect hangout venue with friends and family on summer evenings. Along with two of my girlfriends, I hit the place a little earlier before it's opening time(as on Mondays it opens at 4'o clock in the afternoon).

The attendants were very welcoming and friendly enough to give us a nice treat through their service. As the name itself speaks one's got to try out the teas in here...the lemon iced tea(which is my personal favourite) and Kashmiri kahwa green tea we took was absolutely refreshing and refilling on this sunny day. Then, we got a chilli garlic spaghetti (which was not as much spicy as told to us) and a Nutella Burst(grilled cake) afterwards which were both extremely mouth-watery and delicious.

Even though we didn't take the recommended food , we had a great time there devouring fabulous foods and chattering for hours. The friendly and soothing ambience of the place is beyond description unless you try it out yourself. Though we had got lesson all Justin Bieber's songs non-stop, everything else about this place covered for it.

The interior arrangements , the fantastically designed Menu cards and the cute ghost/kinda penguin looking SALT-PEPPER shakers all entertained us thoroughly. We left the place feeling juvenile, promising a return to try out the other stuff on the menu real time soon.

Ok So I have never been to this place but I have ordered in from them quite a few times. 

The food form here is just mind blowing at a equally mind blowing price. We have enjoyed almost everything from this place from burgers to sandwiches to fries. 

If you ar ordering in they have the online ordering from Zomato and it is very easy. All the times we have ordered they have delivered before time and their packing is really good. Never seen anything out of its place.

Overall this place id o not know how it is to visit but I do know their delivery and their quality and taste of food is superbly spot on!

especially since getting good burgers in this city is quite tough!

A discovery while browsing through Zomato, this hidden place is a wonder. The location is right opposite the Charnock City in Tollygunge and in the lane of Graham's Kitchen. The place is so compactly done and i absolutely liked the interiors. The lighting was perfect which makes the mood for hangingout with your loved ones. There is a bar counter kinda arrangement made inside which i really adore. They have a single table outside which is preferrable for smokers. We ordered for 3 flavours of iced tea namely Vanilla, Peach & Lemon with Lemon being the best. The scrambled Egg with Cheese was prepared to perfection and to my delight they served the item with a portion of hash brown potato. The star of the night wad the Grilled Cake. Absolute gem. Dont miss it if you are here. The guy who was taking our order was very polite and courteous and even he was well informed about the items and was even making very good suggestions. Kudos to the management for operating this place so efficiently. Kind of a place where you keep coming back.

Online order on zomato app! Good experience with a few rough corners but an overall good one.
I ordered three cold coffees and an American hot wings. Cold coffee was very very nice and had a lot of coffee in comparison to other places but only thing I felt a bit left out was that the amount was bit less than what I was expecting, or may have been because I had it home delivered instead of having it there. The American hot wings were good but didn't quite add up to a good taste with the combination of spices and sauces they put in, should have been a little drier I guess.
Anyway for what's it's worth the cold coffee was very good and a must recommend! Prices are also quite decent given the good quality!

My college is in kudghat and for four years I had this place undiscovered. Few days back, while surfing through pocket friendly places near my college area. I found 'The Chaiwala' out. It is indeed an amazing place for short hangouts with friends. The interior is fantastically decorated with photographs of kolkata. There is a deck that you generally find in the drinks zone of pubs, with high chairs and a bar-like-feeling. Food no doubt yummy with the varieties ranging from hot and cold drinks to edibles like burgers, sandwich,burgers, spaghetti and pasta. There is a stock of dorling kinsley books on travel and illustrations. The waiters are very friendly and jovial. They also play good English songs. On the whole, if you are avoiding a pocket pinch and are wanting a cool adda zone, then chaiwala is where you must be.

Very very nice place but it's small in size with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. To be true when it full it means it is having say atmost 20 customers. The decor of the place was very good also.
Now comes the food its very good in having nicely prepared with minimum lead time. Of all the foods  what I liked the most was the double decker chicken burger. The patty was prepared exceptionally well. And the passion fruit drink was very very good.
About the price part not at all costly compared to the type of food served.
In short when there is a cash crunch but then again you want to have quality food. This is the place.

A nice, quiet place located in Graham Lane, near the Ashoknagar Bazar. Its a five minute walk from the Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station. The playlist of the cafe provides for a lovely ambience. We had American Hot Wings and Salami Sandwich and both tasted fantastic. The Hot Wings were too good and irresistable while the Sandwich was enough for two people to devour it. And yes! They provide you with free WiFi which is an added bonus.

Tollygunge surprisingly has a low number of places to hangout. The Chaiwala is a recently opened cafe, which is located in Graham's land.

Location - From Tollygunge Metro take the road going to Garia, and take the first left. It is beside another restaurant 'Graham's kitchen'

The cafe is a bit small and can seat around 20 persons at a time. However the wooden chairs,tables, and the d√©cor is great and there are some brilliant photographs on the walls.
I ordered a Chili Garlic Spaggheti( it's not in the menu, but was there in the Specials for that day), a Hazelnut smoothie, and a Dark Desire.
The spaghetti was hot. It was really spicy, but was tasty as well. The smoothie was okayish. And the Dark Desire was well made. The menu is quite big, and the prices are decent. Service is fast. One of the better places to hangout in this area for sure.
P.S Going back soon.

While passing through Graham's land this afternoon we saw this place and decided to try it out. Without having any expectations from an average looking place from outside we got in. But we were really impressed on
 seeing the interior. Beautifully decorated with small and various artifacts. Books on the shelf, normal tables decorated with paper cut outs pasted in a see through middle portion of it, the bottles of water and the the beautiful cool and calm atmosphere was just so amazing. 
Then we ordered the food. A side named "Polynesian Chicken Wings" and a grilled "Ham and Cheese" sandwich. The chicken wings were one of the best I ever had. A bit on the sweeter side but amazing flavors, beautiful taste and sesame on top giving an amazing look. If you don't mind the sweet taste then should surely give it a try. The sandwich tasted amazing as well. Really juicy giant piece of ham with whole lot of cheese mixed with red, yellow and green pepper with onions. The sandwich was served with a spicy sandwich mayo which adds up to the interest.

Lovely food, beautiful place, pocket friendly and great host. 

Surely recommended. Give it a try.

Located just at the entrance to Graham's Land, this is a quaint little caf√© I only came to know of through Zomato, but was eager to visit. It's a nice place, with decent ambiance. The food is excellent, as evidenced by the Bacon Tornado Burger I ate, washed down with a Fresh Lime Soda. My only complaint is that there aren't many options on the menu, but I was very happy with the quality of the food! A must visit place...which finally gives a good option to people living in Tollygunge area!

I have to say I hadn't expected much from this cafe...But I was surprised! The ambience is amazing with such cool decor. The wooden tables and coloured bottles also give a nice creative touch! There is outdoor seating arrangement too. We ordered soy honey chicken , mushroom and cheese grilled sandwich and fresh lime soda and all the items were very tasty! It is a very good hangout spot for students . They don't even charge taxes! So go ahead and visit this place if you already haven't! :D

Just visited this place today with my friends, I had'nt heard about this place before and decided to visit it only on the request of my companions. Well, I have to say I was blown away by the ambience!! The decor is really eye catching. Now to the food, we ordered fresh lime soda, chicken wings and mushroom cheese onion sandwiches, and I have to say that the sandwiches and chicken wings were awesome!! I can't say anything about the fresh lime soda as my friends finished it without me!! But they loved it, so it must be great! An affordable place to chill and hangout with buddies, a must visit for everyone!!

Was literally floored by this cafe located @grahams land near tollygunge.The ambience and decor are very very attractive and the place exudes a positive vibe from the get go.Loved the wooden interiors and the walls adorned with pics of "Chaiwalas of Kolkata ".
Food ordered 
1.Chaiwala Special -Masala chai with 2 piece toast biscuits.It was good. 
2.Lemon Iced Tea -Very refreshing. Just what the doctor ordered for this sultry weather.a real thirst quencher. 

3.Double decker grilled chicken burger -Superb.with double chicken patty double cheese served with French Fries on the side this is an absolute delight. 

4.American Hotwings -Showstopper.explosion of flavours inside your mouth. Tangy and spicy with that smoky aftertaste in the wings will make you drool. 

The hospitality and service is topnotch and I'm in love with this cafe. Keep up the good work guys.

I cannot recall the names of the items ordered but there was a jumbo sandwich and corn , veggi small pizza.
The food was good and light. I loved the corn pizza which reminded me of my mother's homemade pizzas...

The chaiwala is exactly what this neighborhood needed and the sheer fact that these guys decided upon this location to open something so brave for its surroundings is very impressive. 
Very cute little cafe. Everyone from around here would agree how fresh it is. Quality of food is impressive too. A burger which has minimal sauce and a patty that's that flavorful and juicy is a clear win for the chaiwala. 
Cheers guys. :)

The place was good. Food was excellent,but the space was tiny. We ordered cold chicken and mayo sandwiches and it was worth the 110 bucks spent, we then ordered chicken wings in honey and soy sauce, that was good as well. We also ordered a vanilla latte and a mint tea, both were really great.

We had orderd mixed pasta, veg corn krunchy, potato cheeze garlic pops, choco walnut pot cake and irish frappe. Food tastes great. Loved the food and ambience. Nicely decorated in a classic tone.

My first visit to an eatery in the Tollygunj area was worth. Location, ambience, decor and mostly the food- all add up to make this place amongst the top cafes. 
Its easily accessible and located at a very close proximity of Mahanayak Uttam Kumar metro station. 
The Cafe is very spacious with a seating capacity of around 30. Another plus point is that they have kept separate seating arrangement for all possible combinations e.g 2,4, 6 and 10 people can be accomodated separately keeping abundant space for hassle free service. 
The menu is quite promising with an extra large two page irresistible burger picture, abundant options and varieties of Tea ( the Cafe nametag), pastas, mocktails and sandwiches. There are plenty of options on the "This Months Special"- an innovative concept where you can add fluctuations from the usual dishes on the menu.
We decided to try the White Sauce Pasta( recommended), Veg Corn Crunchy, Hazelnut Milkshake (recommended) and Sweet Mama Blueberry.
I fell in love with the very first bite of the Pasta. It had everything in the perfect quantity- the sauce, vegetables and the origano. Completely satisfying in taste and quantity. 
The veg corn crunchy is a normal everyday easy-to-make bread base dish. I would suggest the dish will be better if the bread is crunchy. Among the drinks the Hazelnut Milkshake was recommended by my friend and I was surprised by its refreshing taste. I had never tried a hazelnut shake before so it was pretty good in taste with the addition of trace amounts of chocolate syrup. The blueberry Mama mocktail was average in taste with an excess quantity of mint succumbing the taste of blueberry.  

The ambience is very fresh, peaceful and pleasant. The service is also fast. Decor is very cosy with black n white pictures of the city on the wall, a separate space for home interiors and clothes are also available.

I would definitely want to visit the Cafe again to try The sinful nutella burst grill Cake and If it fits right in your mouth, its not a Burger...
P.s.- Its pocket friendly- the rates are inclusive of taxes...

It has become a regular place that I visit with friends. The decoration of the resturant and the ambience is something I crave for.Its so cozy, you will love to sit for hours. Moreover they offer free wifi. Not only a good place to go with friends for hangout but their menu card is also full of yummy offerings. Do try the Smokedpork bacon sandwich,double decker sandwich,chicken wings and chaiwala special chai. Other foods are also good but the above mentioned are recommended.

Tucked inside a quiet lane, this is one of those out-of the box cafe, where you can get peace of mind and can engage yourself in a delightful conversation with your buddies for hours. Or, you can even site alone, enjoying hot and warm tea or coffee or even their amazing shakes while digging in at some of their quick bites.

Location:- Get down at Tollygunge Metro. Take the lane going towards Ranikuthi/Bansdroni. Cross Monti, and keep walking straight in that left lane. After 3-4 minutes, you would see the first land turning to your left. That should the Graham's Lane/Land. You should see Graham's Hotel to your left and after 2-3 houses should be this cafe. They have a distinctive signboard which is hard to miss.¬†

(For those, coming from Jadavpur 8B via auto, kindly note, you would need to walk for 15 minutes atleast, as those auto's will drop you well before Tollygunge Metro, very few of them actually comes till the Metro Station)

Coming to the ambiance, very well done. Wooden Tables and Chairs, with the tables having a slit in between and was probably covered with glass! The door to this cafe was however narrow, and I had a hard time while coming in and going out! They have this menu which gives in the vibe of a newspaper. It's surely going to beckon your senses and impart a completely different feeling. If you walk into the cafe to the inner end, you would see the counter to your right, with a rack full of books placed right next to it. In front of you will be some special menu written on a white board.

Making myself comfortable, I ordered for a Chicken Sausage Krunchy and a Choco-Banana Shake! The Shake was to be served first. Personally, I didn't like it much. I still have the soothing taste of the same shake I had in Blue Sky Restaurant tucked into my tastebuds. The Krunchy was however a complete game-changer. Soft yet delicate and tasty sausages tossed in a tangy sauce, probably barbeque or soya sauce and a couple of them being places on a round-grilled bread! The bread was kinda over-grilled and became hard in short time. But then, I could care less. My entire attention was devoted towards the delicious sausages.¬†

Much satisfied, I decided that I was full for the day and asked for the bill and my mandatory take-away order! Much happy and delighted, I made my way towards my home. (It is here, the sad story started). The take-away order comprised of:

a) Spanish Omlette
b) Double Decker Grilled Chicken Burger
c) Soy Honey Potato Pop

Spanish Omlette => Inside wasn't cooked properly, absolutely no stuffing. It was more like a Dosa, with small chunks of vegetables (perhaps?) stuck onto the body! What a waste!

Double Decker Grilled Chicken Burger => Decent size, full of cheese. Enough to satisfy a hungry soul. However, the french fries were absolutely horrible! Even a 10 year old kid could make better french fries. And no matter, how cheesy the burger was, the patty wasn't grilled much (Or probably wasn't grilled at all)

Soy Honey Potato Pop => If I were to extract potato out of the batter, I would probably end up with hardly 10 gms or even less of potato! The entire thing was soggy and messed up! I really had no intentions in gulping in those watery batters.

Much dejected, I knew, I wasn't gonna have anything else for my late-night snacks!

Am I gonna visit once again?¬†

Probably yes, but then I would make sure, it is for dine-in only, so that I do not make the same mistake of ending up with horrible food! As they say, everyone deserves a second chance!

This cafe has a very different decor than any other coffee shop. Like the old british cafes. It has a small section where they have handicraft for sale, which is totally separate from the main guest area. They have a great breakfast menu. Tried the chicken nuggets. It js was good. They have a wide choice of tea and desserts. Ordered for a honey ginger tea a honey lemon tea and green tea. Would visite the place for the food. I have not tried any food as such but the ambience and the cafe was pretty amazing.

This is a cafe....so it has all the ingredients of a cafe....but where it differs is the decibels, unlike all the other run-of-the-mill cafes. The place is a bit difficult to locate but is worth taking the effort. The place oozes good ambience and is perfect for relaxed conversations. Nobody really cares much about the eats or the coffee (although loved the ice tea and chicken nuggets) but loved the place overall.... need more such "quaint corners" in Kolkata.....

A small and cozy place to hang out with friends.

The Chaiwala has a perfect combination of great food and amazing ambience, which will make you want to come back again and again.

Coming to the food -- the Double-Deckar Burger is my absolute favourite. When you can have double of everything, why resist?
The chicken wings are heavenly and the cheese pasta and spicy chicken sandwich are equally sumptuous.

The Pot Brownie is every dessert lovers' dream! Chocolate brownie served in the bowl it's baked in served with generous scoops of ice cream. I honestly would have two in a row if I had a big enough appetite. 

The first thing I order every time I visit The Chaiwala is their Lemon Iced Tea. Trust me on this, they do have the best iced tea in Kolkata.
And if you fancy something different, try the Dementor's Kiss or the Pea-Ca-Choo frappe. They are nothing like anything you've tasted before and they will surely blow your mind!

The menu is very pocket friendly as well.
One can eat as much as they want without burning a hole in their pocket. The staff is very friendly and if you're lucky then you'll even find the owner cooking for you. 

Needless to say, I've now become a regular customer here and every time I try something new, the food never fails to impress me.

Visited the chaiwala today evening with my family. A very quaint little place near our house. Ordered veggie delight burger which was awesome and a must for any vegetarian! But was a little disappointed by the omelette ( underdone) and the cold coffee ( flavour was fabulous but was not chilled at all )...would definitely come back for the burger, fries and the cold coffee ..( If they promise to serve it chilled this time !! ) oh not to forget the oh Oreo..a sinful serving of vanilla ice cream mixed with crunchy Oreo bits..fantastic !

The place can be small but has a wide range of food pallet to choose from. The decor exuded warmth but could be improved even further. Though the space crunch can be a bit of a problem for the customers, who come trickling in from time to time; They have set up seats in their balcony,  to address that issue to some extent. Coming to the food: well, the Chicken Nuggets and Chicken Popcorn were good but didn't leave a lasting impression. The iced lemon tea was satisfying indeed. Service was at par. Marginally costly but manageable. A good hangout place.

It's a small cozy cafe with a small outdoor section meant for an ideal adda! Love the smart interiors, a small boutique attached to this cafe and some smart photographs of the city. Now coming to the food, ordered a corn cheese tomato sandwich(spicy dip as an add on) and a grilled chicken burger along with a lemongrass ginger tea. Food was quite good with a very good helping, although the dip was not worth 20 bucks. The tea was refreshing but a bit of natural ginger would have made wonders to the overall aroma. Would love to go there again.

It was one of my friends' post birthday celebration. Since I am known as a big foodie to my friend circle, I was asked to search for a cafe but there were some conditions which my friend asked me to keep in my mind while searching-- Firstly,it has to be near any metro station and secondly it has to be reasonably priced since it was month's end. So after going through several options i noticed this joint on this search engine and informed my friends.
¬†¬† 
¬†¬†¬†¬† On a fine sunday afternoon, we decided to visit this cafe. We met at Tollygunj metro station. Since none of us had no clue about the exact location of the place, I found it better to ring them(the cafe) begore stepping into any transport. We were informed that it is 2-3 minutes walk from Tollygunj and it is on the first left when we are going towards ranikuthi. 
¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The ground floor of the house has been turned into the cafe. A huge name plate on wooden plank cannot be missed. The balcony has been decorated with a bulleTEAn board where the guests have left some special messages for the cafe.One wooden round table and three stools have been placed here.On the right hand side,there is an apparel shop. The entrance gate or rather door is very narrow. All the tables and chairs are made up of wood. Even the false ceiling is in sink with the theme. All the walls are in dark brown or biscuit colour. 10-15 people can sit inside and it is air-conditioned(thank god!). The glass of the windows has been decorated with pink stick-on papers with special notes forming a heart. A book shelf with few books is there,so anybody can sip on a cup of tea and read book.

¬†Now the food---- 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Since it was hot and humid outside we were sweating like anything and first we ordered for cold beverages. I thought there will be a wide variety of both cold and hot teas but I was wrong. I asked them to suggest. Sukrit(most probably)asked me to go for lemon iced tea and two of my friends ordered double choco-chip frappe and oreo frappe. 
¬†¬†¬† Oreo frappe was served with two oreo biscuits and it tasted good. The ground oreo biscuit and chocolate was blended well.
¬†¬†¬† In double choco-chip frappe,I didn't get much choco chip in it though tasted better than oreo frappe.
¬† ¬† Lemon iced tea was truly a very good suggestion. It was tangy,cool and very refreshing with a perfect color and well balanced sweetness.

¬†¬†¬†¬† Next we again asked Sukrit to suggest some dishes since his suggestion turned out to be a good one. He suggested us to have soy honey wings,smoked pork and bacon sandwich and bacon cheese sauce pasta.
¬†¬†¬† Soy honey chicken wings were tasted out of the world. Little bit spicy yet sweetness of honey gave an amazing taste to the chicken and it would force you not to leave a single drop of the sauce.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Sandwich was again a very good one with three layers. It was properly grilled and crispy and stuffed with pork,bacon,cheese,lettuce and served with french fries and tomato ketch up. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† Though I am not a fan of pasta, but here i liked it. The sauce tasted good and well mixed with penne. Penne was boiled enough and soft. 

¬† In one sentence,it is a nice place to hang out and very pocket friendly. But there is a serious problem of space crunch and more variation in cold tea is needed. Service is good.

Well went their with my boy friend yesterday. As it was sunday so had to wait outside for quite a long time. As soon as u enter u will feel the wait was worth it, the perfect ambience and courteous staffs will simply make ur day, specially d owner, I have never seen a restaurant's owner so humble and down to earth. He made sure that all his guests were comfortable. Coming to the food, we ordered tangy mustard grilled chicken burger and white sauce chicken pasta and both were awesome. We ended with chaiwala special tea which was really good and served with typical khasta biscuits for that authentic touch.

Okay I just wanna utter one word i. e. AMAZING!! Thanks to Zomato for letting me know about this hidden gem at Tollygunge area! It was a rainy afternoon when me and two of my friends arrived at this small cozy place. Interior is well maintained with a very neat and clean ambiance. We first thought to give a tiny try to its menu as we are not very fond of the clich√© menu of cafes at Kolkata (no offence please!)!! So we started with ginger lemon tea, hazelnut milkshake and caramel frappe. All of these were tooooooo good which made us want something more. So we went on ordering honey soya chicken wings, schwejuan veg pasta and chicken nuggets. Each and every item just stole my heart!! A special mention goes to the pasta and chicken wings!! I am still salivating while writing about these two items :P. We had vanilla pot cake to end our journey on a sweet note. The best thing about this place is that it actually won't burn ur pocket compared to other cafes. Price is absolutely justified with the quality and quantity of the food served. Staffs were polite and well behaved. There was something magical about this place and I am eagerly looking forward to experience that spell again and again.. Till then keep it up Chaiwalas!!! U made a permanent mark on this Foodwali... :D :D :D

This is our group's official 'go to place'. I love The Chaiwala. It's amazing. Honestly, amazing is an understatement for such a cafe. It's not just a cafe, it's a warm feeling all over.
Now coming to the food, they serve the best lemon iced tea. THE BEST. I love their schzwan pasta. The white sauce pasta is also highly recommended. The soy honey chicken wings is beyond this world. The perfect crisp of the chicken and what not. The Double Decker Burger. Oh my God!!!! It's so cheesy and so delicious that my lips are watery already. The sandwiches are also very nice. My personal favorite is the smoked pork and bacon one. Again, HIGHLY recommended.
The choco walnut pot cake is to die for. It's like all your tension and stress will go away after having that delight.
Service is excellent. They play good music and have a decent collection of books as well.
I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND any foodie to visit this place.
The Chaiwala is becoming our own Central Perk.
What more do you need when you get a cosy atmosphere, brilliant food and love!
So next time you're around Tollygunj or anywhere, come to The Chaiwala.

Suggestion to the management:

The small bowl made of jute, in wchich you provide the bills to the customers is indeed a unique concept. If you present that bowl to the customer as a complimentary gift or a token of love from The Chaiwala, it will be delightful.

Had bookmarked this outlet after reading a lot of good reviews, one specially from a friend of mine.
Location wise it was quite easy to find. Just a couple of meters from Tollygunge more towards Garia a signboard on the left promptly directs you to "Graham's land".
The decor too is quite good.Definitely a 'go to' place if someone is looking for a place of adda & wants a break from from the monotony of CCDs.
However, for a place that calls it "The Chaiwala" we expected more varieties of tea to be available. There are around 10 varieties of tea. Rest of the menu is filled up with usual latte,frappe & breakfast menu. I, for one expected a larger assortment of fine teas. for example they could have included white tea & other variants.
anyway we were three & ordered one cup of each of darjeeling tea, masala tea & Kashmiri kahwa.
The masala tea was served in a kulhar along with two pieces of complimentary toast biscuit.
But for the price we paid for it (rs 60) I don't think it matches with even the 40rs chai from Sharma tea house.
The darjeeling tea was a disappointment too. I mean why would someone visit a tea outlet to drink short leaf darjeeling tea? Kehne ko toh lipton bhi darjeeling tea bechte hain.. but you know.. darjeeling tea...full leaves...
The only saving grace was the kashmiri kahwa, which we quite liked. Of course they don't pour it from the traditional silver pots, but still the aroma & taste both were up to the mark.
The service was standard if not slow. But since its a place intended as a cafe that did not disappoint us.
Overall an average experience.
Will update the review if I visit again & find anything interesting. 

P.S The price is inclusive of taxes,so you pay what you see.

Finally a great hangout near my home!! Excellent tea, lip smacking food, lovely ambience and a very well behaved staff. The prices are reasonable too...and they do not rip you off in the name of taxes! A quaint cozy joint in a pleasant neighbourhood, and they have already started making noise. I had their special Chaiwala tea and chicken cheese sandwich which were both delicious. What I loved about this place is not only the good food but also their warm hospitality and the lack of cold business-like demeanour which most of the expensive cafe chains in Kolkata proudly possess. It's the kind of place where you can visit for some solitary moments as well as for a reunion and not be worried about pocket pinch. It reminds me of my Presidency days, when Coffee House was our most sought out place whether it was for crazy fun or for intellectual discussions.
 I will be visting The Chaiwala soon again to steal some moments with a novel in hand, and hopefully many more in future. I wish them success and opulence and pray that, The Chaiwala doesn't not lose itself in this competitive world.

This place is the perfect destination if you are looking for delicious food, reasonable prices and tasteful decor. 

I visited yesterday, with three of my friends. They open at 4pm on Mondays. We did not know this, so when we arrived at 3.45pm, we found ourselves waiting outside. Within 3-4 mins, the owner welcomed us and another waiting couple in. He said we could wait inside but they would start serving at 4. However, we received menus and placed our orders before 4. They were very gracious.
 We ordered one Bacon Tornado, one Grilled Chicken Burger and one portion of Soy Honey Wings. The burgers were the best I have ever had in Kolkata. Juicy patties, right amount of cheese and hearty fillings with a side of well seasoned fries. The wings were good too. They could be improved if the honey and soy flavours can be balanced better.
Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I will be returning again and again.

Newbie. A small little cafe at one corner of Tollygunj has potential to draw a lot of customers. Reason? They serve great tea, awesome desserts and strangely there aren't any other cafe in this area. Their coffee isn't that good. Sandwiches are fair. Do not try chinken wings. Their choco walnut pot cake is a spot on winner! It was emotional. They play peppy pop numbers. Service is nice. They have worked quite well to make up for the small space.

We have visited many cafes scattered around south Kolkata but this cafe was an unique experience altogether. The ambience was great. The interior has an old wooden finish and the service counter resembles a bar. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. As we entered we promptly fell in love with the outdoor seat which gives a nice view of the quiet locality and makes u feel as if u r seating in a "dalaan". We ordered cappuccino, ginger honey tea, white sauce chicken pasta and chicken sausage krunchy. Every item was tasty and consisted good portion of food. The tea and the krunchie demands special mention. The tea was extremely refreshing and the krunchy was mildly spicy sausages on the base of a grilled burger bun on top of a spicy mayo. It tasted fabulous. They occasionally hold live concerts. They have a small handicraft shop where one can buy ceramics, cups, jeweleries, designer dresses etc. We bought 2 of those items and the pocket pinch was of only rs. 900 including food. Spent a great evening.

I think I have found my official "go to place" in Kolkata. This nifty little shop located very close to the metro station has all and more of everything you need to have the greatest time hanging out with your buddies. From the superior interiors to the amazing paper cup and other ethnic merchandize boutique to the most amazing food and last but not the least the super awesome people who run the joint. The seating arrangements are good for a gang of 4-5 and the sign boards put up with the wacky quotes make it the unique place that it is meant to be. Amazing pictures of "cha kaka(s)" and "cha Dada(s)" adorn the walls and you just can't get enough of it.
We went there and honestly had no wish to leave that place. The boutique sells porcelain and glass articles (pots, vases, show pieces, etc), a lot of creative papercup stuffs (writing notebooks of various sizes, handmade cards, etc), quilled artwork (earrings, pendants, etc) and indo western wear designed by Abhishekh (I hope I got your spelling correct). The food varies over an array of dishes, all penned down brilliantly and witty. You get everything a good Adda can ask for, superb tea, coffee and smoothies, typical breakfast packages of pancakes or sausage and toasts, pasta, omelets, chicken fries and the list is endless. To top it off, you also get extravagant deserts. Basically, this little place that opened up will make it's way to any foodies' heart and ultimately stomach because that's basically where our love comes from.
Thanks guys for bringing such a warm and heart melting joint to the town :)

It's one of the cosiest cafes in Calcutta. Located in graham's land it's easy to find. Food is brilliant. We had schezwan chicken pasta, sweet corn chicken soup and chocolate walnut pot cake with vanilla ice cream. All the items were delicious. The pasta was the right amount of spicy and the cake was sinfully delightful. And all of this at extremely pocket friendly prices. With yellow lighting and wooden furniture, the decor is warm and welcoming. Please do visit the place, I assure you, you won't be disappointed.

Came to know about this cafe through zomato. Visited this place today afternoon with a friend of mine. This cafe is not at all hard to locate. If you are coming by metro then you will just need 5mins to reach this place by walking. It is situated in the lane of graham's land. The ambiance is really cosy with good music. The decoration is prim and fine. We were served by a girl who was very well behaved. This cafe is not too spacious but also have a clothing and accessories store alongwith it. Coming to food we ordered their grill cheesy chicken sandwich which was really amazing, chicken pasta in schezwan sauce which was good but the chicken were a bit hard. From beverages we had double chocolate frappe. Overall we had a good experience.

A welcome addition to South Calcutta. Quaint little place near the metro station - a brisk 5 min walk maybe. Had coffee and an amazing mushroom-onion-cheese sandwich served by a cute girl called Dimpy. Not too big a seating area, though there's a table and a few stools on the verandah outside, too. General understatement in the air and Dimpy won the day for me.

The Chaiwala is very close to my heart. I have been with the team from its conception to its completion. I love the people and the food. This place has become my home, literally. My friends and I have christened it our own "Central Perk". 

My go to drinks are the Lemon iced tea and the Darjeeling tea, depending on the weather and my mood. My go to food is the Masala fry and if I'm hungry one portion of any sandwich is more than enough to suffice. 

The food portions are waaaaay too large for my nearly non existent appetite, but for all the food lovers it is a good day. The taste is perfect to the T. The service is awesome-sauce because they're all my friends and o love them. 

Sukrit da, keep it up. I love you all! ‚ù§

I've already been here twice and I can promise, I'll again be going soon. The ambience is very nice, especially with the attached souvenir shop. The menu is quite elaborate considering the age of this joint and what surprises me more is the food quality - awesome would be an understatement. If you want to spend a quiet evening with good food and chai or even coffee, this is where you would want to go.

Ambiance is awesome with lovely music around.  I and my friend had a chicken burger and chicken pasta which were very tasty, specially the burger. According to the quantity and the taste of the food the cafe is economical and service is also very good.  Good work guys keep it up.

It's strange that Tollygunge didn't have much Cafes before, but this new outlet situated at just 5 minutes walking distance from the Tollygunge metro station is a cool place to hang out in. The service is good and friendly. We ordered a Grilled cheesy sandwich and a Grilled ham sandwich for two people. They were delicious, and so big sized that we didn't need anything else for dinner. The beverage non-virgin mohito was one of its kind. Will definitely pay a visit again. :)

Guys thank you for reminding me that food is worth falling in love with. Your place will definitely be my place of coffee in the country so far. Cafe Bombon defines me :) And THAT sandwich, reminds me of fond mornings in the hills and home. Thank you for the warmth. Keep shining !!

Awesome ambience and ofcourse the chaiwalla special tea is a must have...

Lil short on veg menus...sincerely will recommend adding a few more veg menus...Maggi can be surely one of them...

Stuffing in Sandwich was cold...right out of freezer.. I guess a bit more can be done on the work... 

Still a must visit place...and a much  hangout joint in the neighbourhood..

My first visit to this cafe, and lets just say il visit again.
Pros:
The amazing playlist which usually has covers of popular pop songs of the day.
The cozy ambiance along with the wonderful pictures hung up on the wall.
The service, fast and friendly.
Cons:
A need for a better menu card with more options for dessert.
Now coming to the food, it was well presented and my friends loved the veg burger. The bloody ocean was also great. The chocolate cheese burst sandwich was average. Didn't like that very much. Pasta was too spicy but tasty.
Overall, shows good promise. Cozy hangout destination with good food.

This place is a two minutes walk from my house,, which is why I've been to this place for quite a number of times now. As for me I'm really impressed with the mocktails in their menu. Have tried them all. Splendid I would say.... Lack of space makes it a bit clumsy at times but that's not much of a negative aspect when you have a such a cool ambience and a homely caring service. For me it could've been a four. It's space costs a .5 :)

I have been to The Chaiwala twice and it has become one of my favourite joints now. They serve good quality food in a very affordable price. A few of my favourites are the soy honey chicken wings, chicken pasta in white sauce,masala French fries and the masala tea. 
Only,I think that the price of the tea is a bit high. Otherwise,I love the place. The decor is simple yet eye catching. 
Also, i love the things they sell at the boutique attached to the caf√©. 
Looking forward to more visits to the place.

This one is special for me and Saptarshi. This is the new novel venture of our dear friend Abhishek and his friends. And we are absolutely thrilled to be writing this review. Located very near to the Tollygunje metro, on the way towards Garia, this place is the cool new kid on the block. The thing that makes it unique and novel, is that it is not only a cafe, but under one roof, it also houses a really cool lifestyle shop. And while you wait for your meal to be served, you can always check it out. When we had visited the place, it was on trial run basis but even then, we were glad that even on a curtailed trial menu, the occupancy rates were high. As of the food, we had ordered Tangy Mustard Chicken Burger and the Chaiwala Special Chai. Now, I will be very impartial here, and still I can vouch for the burger which, in my opinion, was one of the best burgers I have had. It was delicious and frankly, I can have it all day. And as for the chai, here is a little story that should serve the purpose. Saptarshi is not a 'chai' person. But on this day, he actually ordered the chai twice. Yes! It was that damn good. We have been to places, way more grand and famous than this, but what I felt, is that you can come in here, sip on their tea and have anything you want, and when you leave, you are going to feel better. This place will turn out to be such a mood lifter. Kudos to Team Chaiwala! And all the best for the days ahead! Remember, a lot can happen over 'chai'! üòä

A gleaming place with amazing ambiance & the chaiwala (Sukrit Poddar) with a smile around. The food is good specially the schezwan pasta & the teas are a must try. A awesome place @ Tollygunge. Never thought of such happening place around. thanks to the Chaiwala for the awesome place. 

Visiting again soon to explore & enjoy the floating menu.

The chaiwala is a very resplendent place because the ambience was amazing. The music was subtle slow soothing to ears... Very comfy and evident place to hangout with friends. For food the non veg menu was good... Honey and soya chicken.. Sauce was delicious... Chicken outside crisp inside perfectly cooked n juicy... But for pasta it was egregious. Sauce had no consistency, very runny, tasted very blant, too much pepper in seasoning and pasta was overcooked.
Rating it 2.5 only becoz of honey and soya chicken and ambience, that pasta ruined the rest of my day.....

Hands down, the best grilled chicken sandwich in town. The ambience, and staff are absolutely brilliant. The arrival of the food was fast. The place is nice and cozy. The interiors are beautiful. When you enter the place, the entire thing smells like a fulfilled dream, and that's what Sukrit Poddar has established through this. He's part of it all, he's taking orders and he's making the food: he's making people tummy-happy. If you like home made continental food, you should give this place a try. Chaiwala is going to see a lot of visits from me in the future. And hopefully, you. 

Also, what they ask for is what they take. The food is brilliantly priced and the quantity is great. This is the new place to be.

Dropped in here after office my friend. It was suggested by a friend of mine.From outside it looks small but from inside its cozy and comfortable. At first we were confused as there was no menu card as such, only a variety of tea list is kept their on every table. As there is no hard menu card and the menu is floating u got to see it from the Black board in the counter. We ordered Mango Detox Tea, Masala French fries with honey and butter grilled cake. The Detox tea which was mango flavour is one of the best thing I have ever tasted in my life. I jus loved its fineness.The flavour and the aroma was jus amazing. The masala french fries were yummy too , it was served with mayo and sause. The new and their version of pancake as they named as grilled cake came out good too. It was honey dipped and served with a small cube of butter. Liked their sweet gesture and the 10% offer for next visit on an order of 350. Would love to taste their other variety of tea.

This small little place tucked in just behind Graham's land is amazing! Their peach iced tea actually had tea in it which you could taste unlike most places which pass off cold juice as pretentious iced tea. The Ham sandwich was stuffed with ham and cheese and capsicum. It was to die for! This is definitely a place that I will be coming to often.

Went to The Chaiwala the very first day it opened with a friend who lives in the neighborhood. What had me fall in love with this place at first sight was the ambience and decor-minimalistic and soothing.
We were not very hungry so bought glasses of lemon ice chai and a single grilled chicken burger to be shared.
Thank God, we decided ro share it as the burger was EXTREMELY FILLING and JUST DELICIOUS.
The chicken patty was grilled to perfection, with a crunchy, smoky exterior and a soft, gooey layer of herbed chicken mince inside. The lettuce and tomato freshening up the palate. They are also quite generous with the fries on the side.
The lemon ice chai was also very flavourful...
All in all, a great experience.

Special kudos to Sukrit Poddar for making this absolute marvel Chaiwala...enjoyed to bits, the pork and bacon sandwich perfectly grilled, tangy mustard chicken burger as juicy as it can get, move over Big Mac. I haven't ever had any chicken burger as tasty as this... The Nutella burst is to die for... Excellent and courthouse staff, the cute little Dimpy is a sweetheart...cosy little joint to gossip and unwind over lovely tea (chai)....

Dropping by at this brightly lit yet cozy little chai place was an absolute delight. The smoked pork and bacon sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich tickles the taste-buds and the Darjeeling tea with good ambience is great accompaniment. And that's reason enough to keep coming back.

If you're a fan of Chicken Wings then The Chaiwala is definitely the place to be. The concept of celebrating the chaiwalas of Kolkata is unique and this place surely captures that essence. Cozy interiors and WiFi equipped,people here welcome you inside with a smile and provide you with great music and amazing food. The Soy Honey Chicken Wings are to die for, so as the Pork and Bacon Sandwich. Quite a pocket friendly place for students as well.

The Chaiwala experience: Visited this newly launched space tugged in one of the narrow by lanes of Tollygunge, a Cafe cum Lifestyle store which is a brainchild of a very dear friend Abhisek and his team of likeminded creative individuals. It houses his brand of young urban trendy indowestern clothing called 'Bohurupi' along with paper craft, funky accessories and ceramics. The cafe space is ideal for a session of hearty interaction or adda with friends after a hectic day at work over delicious cupcakes, tarts , sandwiches and chai. The menu is a no brainer and is very cost effective. Specially loved the Mayo egg sandwich and the red velvet cupcake and the Chaiwala special chai. This small but nearly done space has already become the favourite joint for the Tollywood gang. Dying to make a stopover again. Checkout this place asap!
