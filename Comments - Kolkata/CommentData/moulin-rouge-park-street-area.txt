I had a bad bad experience to be honest.
We went for dinner and it was quite late by then and the place wasn't over crowded either. We had ordered their speciality dish , Baked fish. And it was lip smacking no doubt.
It raised our expectations of course.
And then disaster was on our plates.
We had ordered Mix Hakka Noodles , Chicken Fried Rice , Chicken Chowmein , Stir fry chicken or something that sort of ( The experience was so bad that I forgot the names even ) and Chicken in hot garlic sauce.
The noodles had hair in it and the Chowmein had a dead fly. The chicken in hot garlic sauce was hopeless and the fried rice was bland. 
The stir fry chicken was still okayish.
Overall , we almost had to return hungry because of all the inconvenience.
And it was so late that we couldn't go anywhere else as well.
The only good thing is their quantity of food. But when the quality isn't nice , what do I do with quantity! 
The atmosphere isn't catchy or classy either.
Service isn't so prompt but well behaved waiters.

I am definitely not going there anyday again.
The 2.5/5 is solely becausr of the Baked fish , staff manners and the quantity of food.

Excellent rabbit roast and turkey dinner. Value for money and very courteous staff.  I would recommend it for the European fare but the fish tikka kebab is tops as well.

The place is nice to have food with friends and family. The service is good but then they should pay the full change. The bill was 189 and I paid 500 so they gave me 300 rs back .If they didn’t have the 11 rs change then they should have at least said that. Otherwise the place is good. No issues.

The food was very bland. And it was way overpriced. The cuisine options included Italian and Continental. But there was no distinct Italian food here. Service was prompt, but food was just horrible. 10/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

Food-
I ordered simple hakka noodles with shrimps... It was pathetic. I generally don't have high expectations.. But this was so low, I have to write this up, here. 

Ambience - 
Very old and sullen. Smelly and dingy. 

Staff-
Old but tries to cooperate.

Feel-
Really not a place you wanna go, sit and enjoy.

A second visit here and it's already one of my favourite restaurant at Park Street. And I always make it a point to order baked fish in white sauce from here....the perfect blend of fish and the cheesy white sauce is a much welcomed guest to our taste-buds. Also ordered fish tikka kebab and the lip-smacking grilled fish. Service is courteous and quite pleasing, and the atmosphere is calm and dimly lit, with soft music playing in the background.

Its off my bucket list last night and I am glad to have dined in one of the oldest heritage restaurant of the city.
The ambiance seems to reflect the old charm of Calcutta which is mesmerizing in its own way. No fancy lights, nor any ornamental seating arrangements though.
It's simple with varied heritage. 
You'll soon find a comfortable zone to treat your family n friends as you enter the place.
Now coming to the food I would say there's nothing to go gaga over it.
But yes they do serve a lot of continental dishes which are quite good.
My favourite is their #baked fish.
The boat shaped dish is droolworthy with lots and lots of white sauce. Soft n creamy!
#Chicken ala kiev was not as good as I expected. It wasn't that fresh.
Mixed grill was yummy though the fish wasn't good. Prawn was delicious to eat. 
Well I expected a lot more than this. :)
Pocket pinch is bit high compared to the quality of the dishes.
Staff was courteous.👍

Despite being located at one of the best spots in the city, Moulin Rouge was a disappointing experience. I was looking for Jack Daniels/Black Label in the scotch section, and they didn't have either. Some of the waiters too, were completely unaware of what was available in the liquor section. As for the food, the dry chilli chicken was poorly grilled and was a challenge to finish it. Definitely not worth the money.

Since I'd treat myself on continental dishes given any day, Moulin Rouge is one place I can swear by. My personal favorites would be the grilled fish (which comes with sauteed veggies) and the chicken tetrazini. The thing about the grilled fish is that, they cook it with such perfection that it is neither over-cooked nor left uncooked. The fish is so flaky and tender that you have to put almost zero effort to use your teeth to chew it down. The taste remains intact with a hint if smoky flavor to it. As for the tetrazini, cheese lovers like me, can never go wrong with it.

Service is impeccable. I think the waiter was Anglo Indian regardless he deserves a raise, he made sure we felt like home. The decor is great quite liked the wall paintings and the chandelier. The staff also allowed me to play on the piano which is why I've rated them 3 stars even though the food was a big let down. Felt like they living in the shadows of the other great restaurants on park street and they can't keep up. Shame because the food did not live upto the service and decor.

Another iconic spot in kolkata. I was so impressed by their service and honestly i stepped into the place only coz peter cat had a long queue. 
The host recommended dishes to us since we weren't feeling too good that day. we wanted dishes that weren't too spicy and he ensured that we got the best with little to no spice. it was a lovely experience the servers there are quite elderly and very doting with tales to tell and the food is one of the best chinese i had in India.

Let's talk about the one that I ordered.. 'chicken tetrazzini', a dish with lots of cheese &  butter and trust me my Italian friend was not at all disappointed rather being appreciative about it.. so you can conclude it was a 5 rating for food! 

Now when you talk about the decor, it is a little disappointing.. although the music that they play is soothing (live music) and that's an experience you should have when in park street!

I love the ambience because you'll always find less crowd among the hustle bustle of Park Street . I don't know about the perspective of my taste buds but buyooy these guys serve the best chill chicken in kolkata or maybe all over West Bengal . It's too soft to gobble and they give you 15 pieces for 250 bucks . The service is very warm and the waiters are kind as well while putting the the whiskey in your 60 ML limits ;)

Well this place brings out a mixed feeling. It was my 2nd time at this place last sunday. The first time was as enriching and the second time was disappointment at the same level. They were not playing the guitar and piano that they generally play during evening. The waiter was also not good and had a grumpy nature. We tried the Chicken Tanduri along with Jack Daniels and then Mocambo special cocktail which they make using whiskey,egg white and vanilla ice cream(picture given). Then we tried the prawn a la diana sizzler and Chicken cordon bleau. Sadly none of them did not taste that good and the chicken cordon bleau size has gone down. In the end we tried the Mango mousse which was also not enthrilling. However I would definitely recommend the lime soda of this place. It is really refreshing.

This is a very old restaurant on Park Street. The best part about this restaurant is after entering the restaurant you will be taken back in time. 

The food which we ordered was fish and chips and chicken Stroganoff. Both were very good. Food is highly recommended. 
But I want to bring to the management's notice about the shabby service. The plates were broken and the service was terrible.

"An old man is waiting for death", my first reaction after getting out from Moulin Rouge. The restaurant has lost everything it had. Service is too bad. The waiter with 'moustache' served us, was very nagging and irritating, was continuously forcing us to order more food, was hampering our privacy and dinner. MORE THAN THAT HE CONVINCED US TO PAY A PORTION OF BILL (350) IN CASH & DIDN'T PROVIDE BILL FOR THAT. WE ASKED FOR THIS BILL BUT HE DIDN'T PROVIDE. So we had to pay 800 through card (we got bill for 800), and 350 in cash (they didn't provide bill for that 350). Its a horrible idea that I didn't have in any other restaurant. We ordered FRESH MANGO JUICE and they provided a 12 RUPEES MAAZA OR MANGO FRUITY AND CHARGED US 100. They don't have even the idea of a restaurant management. Provided soup in glass bowl, rice in cheap glass plate and side dish in white bone China plate, and water in metal glass 😛😛😈😈😈.
I don't want to write more, I m so much irritated. I will not visit this place again to spoil my dinner.

The essence of vintage kolkata bars can be visited once you enter this place. They also have live jazz music. So i can safely say its a unique bar/restro out there in the heart of park street. That's not all. The taste of the food they serve is also noteworthy . I have been here 5-6 times along with my friends. And Moulin Rouge never disappoints. The price of the drinks is a bit on the higher side. They also serve taquila shots. So yay. Anyways last time i went here i had taquila shots, then couple of pegs of Black Dog whiskey and then a few more pegs of BP😁 for the sides we had Lemon Chicken, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and a very exotic Prawn dish i think it was called Chilli King Prawn. It was mouth watering and yum. Our group always has a gala time drinking and eating here. All in all its a very nice and soothing place to hangout with your gang.

One of the big names in the world of restaurants at Park Street. The ambiance is a  reminder of colonial Calcutta. 
Much spacious with comfortable seating arrangements. 
Live music makes the overall dining restaurant more pleasurable. 
Behaviour of staffs are well polished. 
Coming to food. 
We ordered Chicken Sizzler, Fish Sizzler, Mix steak and Chicken roast and. Prawn cocktail. 
Fish Sizzler was most amazing one followed by mix steak. Rest of the items are standard.

First let me start by saying that the ambience is great the dim light the music creates​ certain vibe which I think can't be explained. Now, coming to the food well frankly speaking it's good, very good. Being a Biryani lover I did order my usual and the quantity along with the quality impressed me a lot and the baked fish is simply marvelous. I do recommend everyone to visit the place for a quite family dinner.

Bad experience.. Lost its charm.. Ambience was not soo good.. Went there on sat to celebrate a friend s birthday no hppy birthday tune was played.. The waiter was continuesly nagging like juice nin shake nin ETA nin ota nin.. Ordered a mango shake atlast nd gave me a rs 12 frooti which costed me 100 bucks.. Spite 100 bucks... Fried rice chilli chicken was good.. Veg hot and sour was too too spicy.. We had to pay 300 in cash and did not gave a bill.. Third time after asking for the bill he said whispering j tax dite hobe tai jnno bill hobe naa.. Horrible..Tirthankar Das

Was a good time.. Reasonable rate as always.. We went on a Sunday noon.. the ambience was sad...the place smelled... We ordered two mixed sizzlers with pasta.. But the portion of pasta was sad... Food was a bit late given only 4 customers were present.. 
I had better memories of this place... Kind of felt disappointed... But I do understand.. old place like this would be hard to maintain and compete with the new restaurants

The remains of old time, the remnants of colonial Calcutta.. Places like Moulin Rouge had defined the culinary culture of the city with the classy ambiance, the good music and the trademark Anglo-Indian cuisine.. In a city rapidly changing places like Moulin Rouge will help the old players and the new foodies to reminisce the charm of the rocking sixties.. Very few actually remembers that Moulin Rouge is not just about the food, but the supreme taste for music which has enthralled the connoisseurs for long.. It was here only that the acclaimed Jazz musician Late Carlton Kitto first started playing as part of the Jazz ensemble..
Coming to ambiance, it is like a time travel with the entire décor kept intact from old times, save the LED TV and the mobile phones around.. The grand piano at the corner is still functional with some old classic being played giving you a soothing charm.. The European paintings and the large sofas truly makes the experience a nostalgic one.. Service is a major pain point.. Actually these old boys have ignored the passage of time, be contended with their old repertoire and failed to update to the changing demands of hospitality.. The servers seem way too haughty to actually host the customers, rather a sense of pride works within the place.. Our server kept on rushing with the food and wouldn’t let us even 5 minutes of private space.. Coming to food:
Strawberry Smoothie: Way too sweet, tasted almost like a cough syrup.. Even two of us were unable to finish it since the sweetness was unbearable.. Lacked the usual flair even though it was listed on their special menu..
Batter Fried Prawns: The sizes of the tiger prawns were commendable.. Sadly, the dish tasted horribly wrong.. Firstly, the batter was too thick.. The golden rule with any seafood or fish is to keep the original flavors intact.. Same goes with prawns, if you can’t feel the flesh in one go then it’s a pathetic waste of a dish.. Also they forgot to soak off the extra oils with tissues and the prawns were literally dancing in oil even after served..
Beckti Brochette: We ordered Tuna Fish actually.. It was only after tasting the fish we spotted the error and on pointing it out they blankly told us that Tuna is not available.. Such horrible lack of professionalism from an age-old and revered restaurant is totally unacceptable.. They should have informed us at the beginning only.. Anyways we felt to continue without making a fuss.. It was basically pan-grilled fish served with rice.. The fish was well done though, fresh, crispy and tangy..
Mixed Grill Sizzler: Some respite finally.. A nice assortment of grilled proteins served with Fusilli Pasta in tomato sauce base and grilled veggies, topped with an egg sunny side up.. The chicken and fish tasted much better than the mutton.. The prawns were also nicely done.. The seasoning was perfect, the French fries were crisp too..
Our total cheque was Rs.1506/- (all incl.) for 2 people.. Overall, we went there to relive the old magic of the evergreen Park Street but sadly I felt the time has come for us to move on leaving behind these places only to be remembered in History and references of colonial times..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

Its astonishing but still one of the cheapest place in park street. The first thing that comes to my mind while visiting this place is chicken tetrazini. That heavenly dish made by this very place. Full of nostalgia of college days. Eventually I would say you wont find such a pocket friendly environment in the entire park street. I would suggest others to drop by this place. But don't expect a royal ambience or royal hospitality from this place. This place is good enough to fill your empty stomach without putting some pressure in your wallet.

Recommendations:- Chicken tetrazini, Baked fish

One of the most nostalgic places of kolkata. Located just on the park street crossing Oly pub and before Mcdonald - this place is serves all sorts of cuisine starting from chinese continental to tandoor items. 
The place has got a larger space with comfortable sofa and chairs as well. All the waitors are would be of our grandpa's age however they are very very courteous and soft spoken. Price of food is a bit high but the taste definitely fills up that amount. After 8 pm, there is a nice musical session of saxophone and royal piano which will mesmerize your dinning experience.

Been here once, they had the hilsa festival ongoing that particular time. We had smoked boneless hilsa with some sauted vegetables and toasted bread. 
However I didn't like the hilsa much without the bone. I feel the taste slips away. They had prepared it well. 
The restaurant is well decorated and spacious.

Decent place, good food. Something that has been taken for granted in Calcutta so no surprises there.
Better not bring your friends here who have gasoline pumping through their veins. Just stick to the ancient people who can't see the difference even with powerful specs. The amount of red they chose for the interior is psychologically disturbing.

I went there only once with my sister and brother-in-law. Not linking the next instance to us visiting this place but I have not been talking to them for 3+ years now. The next time I go, it'll probably be raining and and I'll be sick without an umbrella in Park St. oddly mistaking MR to be the bar next door and too occupied about something or the other to care about where I am sitting as long as I have beer served within 5 mins.

We had a good time at Moulin Rouge over new year's eve. At that time all other restaurants were packed, this one allowed us a seating area so we went inside and had a good time with a large pitcher of draught beer and tandoori & fish. The food was delightful; drinks were awesome. 

I would certainly recommend this place as it is quite cheap and definitely worth a visit.

Tried out this restaurant last night. As the ground floor was entirely occupied we were asked to go to the first floor. The ambience wasn't that good. No music. Coming to the food , we ordered Hot n sour soup, Chicken Biriyani , Chicken fried rice , and chicken in hot garlic sauce. The food was not bad. The quantity was sufficient too.

One of the oldest places in the heart of Park Street. Went with my wife and a friend on Last year Sasthi evening. We did not had to wait and got a table immediately. Along with drinks we ordered 
Full Grilled Bhetki: Very Good
Chicken Tandoori: Good
Butter Nan: Good
Some Mutton Dish: Good
Chicken Steak: Good
Not overwhelming but overall a good experience. Price was also decent. Can be visited in future.

A calm and quiet place to dine in. Was at Park Street with friends and just needed a place to sit and chill. Had read about this place on Zomato and thought to give it a try. Though we didn't try anything much but just a few starters and mocktails, still can say this pace is a gem at Park Street. Starting from the ambience to the service and the quality of food, everything was amazing. Would love to visit again to grab some meal.

One of the oldest restaurants of kolkata which still boasts its presence among the other well known restros in park street area.
The interior is very much an example of the old british era. As we visited on 1st Jan 2017 it still had that festive look with all the lights and christmas trees around. We were offered seats as soon as we entered. I found the menu card a bit restricted. We did face a lot of trouble while selecting the starters. At last we settled for shrimp in mayonaise, Fish in mayonaise and dry chilli chicken. The fish and shrimp mayonaise was just both these things dipped in mayonaise or rather swimming in it. Those who like mayonaise can opt for these starters as you will get plenty of it. The dried chilli chicken was quite good.
In main dish we ordered mixed noodles, mixed chowmein and mixed fried rice. These were pretty average but among these mixed chowmein was a winner for me.
In side dishes we had hunan chicken, sweet and sour chicken, schzewan chicken, hot garlic chicken. No complaints as such. Quantity was really good. Finished off with fresh lime soda.
I found it quite good actually. Nice ambience and well behaved staff.

Well this one of the traditional park street restaurant. It has the old look and feel both from inside and outside, it won’t be like one of the modern day restaurant with too much sparkle in the ambience (which doesn’t mean that it’s bad). But those who are looking for real testy food with descent ambience, this is a must visit for them. Try their kaba, sizzler and Indian/Continental dishes. Don’t expect too much in the Chinese side, and if that is your preference, then go to Bar-B-Q.

Try prawn cocktail as appetizer. With drinks try Fish with Chips or Grilled Fish. Mixed Grilled Sizzler is another thing that you can try. In the main course try Machhi-Be-Nazar or Balti Murg Masala, Murg Mumtaz with plain rice. Also there is chicken Caserole, Chicken Tetrazzini. But at the end I would say it’s a nice place for those who want tasty food over restaurants with modern day sizzling interior. Trust me you wont be disappointed.

The service is not very swift but still it is ok.
Now the alcohol is slightly overpriced  compared to the other places in the locality like B.B.Q
Now to the food. First of all if you visit this place make sure to order Baked dish in red sauce. It so amazing that I had 2 of this on the same day. Also the dry chili chicken is very nice. 
We also tried the roast duck and sadly it was tough a rubbery. We threw away half of it. Don't order any duck items.

Situated on park Street this is again an old known restaurant of Kolkata. The decor is not that great but when it comes to food and service it doesn't dissapoint you. We had their fish butter masala with stuffed kulcha and tandoori roti and every thing was cooked to perfection and delicious. We also tried their mulled wine and it was yummy and had the taste of spices but was not even luke warm, mulled wines are served warm. Prices are as per market and the service is professional and friendly.

but beer is overpriced and then you get extra 27 % tax on alcohol.

On the lane beside BarBQ,  just beside Oasis located the very old Moulin Rougue. The ambience is average in the ground floor, upper floor is not at all good.
The crowd is pretty decent there with several foreigners mostly seen. Good food. Good service. Staffs r well behaved and friendly. Serving time is too much. 
Mostly the continental dishes are all wonderful.
Love the chicken Stroganoff, mixed grill sizzler with pasta, baked fish is yummmm..
Chicken steak sizzler and chicken Tetrazzini is also good. Quantity is pretty less..
The waiters will wait in front to see how much tips u r giving, and ask for tips if u don't give.

Visited the place on Vijaya Dashami late night. We reached the place at around their closing time but still were received with great hospitality. It is a nice place, with a good ambience, tasteful music and decent crowd. I have always avoided this place because I thought that being a water-totaller I would feel awkward here since the place is mainly famed as pub, however that was not the case at all and my misconception was wiped off.We had ordered tropical cocoa and Moulin Rouge special both the drinks were fabulous. Of the many vegetarian things we ordered for main course, I found the fried rice mouth wateringly tasty. I mean while typing this, I am reminded of the taste and I am getting the craving for it. The price is slightly towards the higher end. I am looking forward to hit the place again for some non-vegetarian relish.

We ordered Hilsa fish and 2 beers - fish was very ok and beers were over priced. Plus they have some extra tax for alcohol which is about 27 percent. Even if you compare to Mumbai, price at this place were quite high. 

Would suggest to skip this place if you are at Park Street

Overrated place. Hardly any decorations inside and looks very old. I have visited Moulin Rogue once with my friends. It is pocket-friendly and the food was not bad either. The service was kind of awkward as the staff stood next to our table looking at us all along.

This is the place where I will never refer anyone in future. Went here for some good food after hearing a lot about it. It was always in my wishlist. But the behavior of  the staffs simply spoiled our mood. not only they did not serve but also they just come for tips and gives you a sharp eye if you take a little extra mouri ( heights of bad service). The food costs too much for the quantity. The other places in park street provides better ambiance and service ( not too mention food quality and quantity) in that price.

This has been the place with many memories. Very good place to hangout with friends for a dinner party. The ambiance with Piano playing gives you the feel of vintage Kolkata. I use to celebrate special occasions with friends here. Food is Ok. No as such special cuisine to suggest. Order Indian and mughlai. The peo[le running this place is courteous and helpful. Go there for ambiance.

As you open the doors.. you enter the pre-independence period. 

Positives: 
- Food quality is ok type. Pretty average. 
- Service time is good. 

Negatives: 
- The decor & the smell kind of obstructs you to order for another drink or another dish.

Even though this restaurant is located right at the heart of Park Street, it's not a very happening place, in the strict sense of the term. We had visited this place on a Saturday afternoon. While there were scores of people waiting to get a table at other prominent restaurants located nearby, we were actually surprised to find this place practically empty except for a handful of college goers seated at the central big table. The ambience is modest. No extra points there. At the time of our visit, they had a duck festival thing going on. We made use of that opportunity and had ordered us a plate of roasted duck. The dish was made available to us at a discounted price, courtesy of the ongoing festival. The duck was really well prepared. The meat felt crisp and tender at the same time, if that's possible. After having the duck, we decided to go for tandoori chicken (since we were in the mood for kebabs and tandooris). Even though they were prompt with our order, the tandoori was not up to the mark. The chicken was severely burnt at places and gave off a charred taste. Needless to say, the tandoori disappointed us.

another one bites the dust - yet another legendary place ticked in my wish list. have been there a couple of times, so in a position to give quite a comprehensive account. at the onset the name moulin rouge in french means "the red windmill". incidentally a small red windmill adorns the entrance of this very place.

no sooner have you entered the place do you realize that you have been transported into an old place with all its charms intact. courteous, well-mannered captains usher you to your seats and help you out while placing the orders.if you are lucky you would be witness to some live jazz which takes place during the weekends. the jazz spices up the old world feel a notch higher.

the seats are comfortable as you settle yourselves.. i had ordered for a chicken tetrazzini. let me warn you this is a sinful dish one must definitely try - the original sin what with its juicy cheesy appearance, it makes you feel so guilty that probably would impel you to hit the gym next morning or hit the ground running! my sister had asked for a prawn sizzler - these were medium sized and nearly half a dozen in number and quite a satisfying experience. we had been previously told by a friend that this place known for its sizzlers. my mom had requested for a mutton kasha - now i don't think this place is known for its indian, so 'our bad'. the mutton kasha was anything but kasha in taste.

on a separate occasion, i had been here alone. so i can forewarn you folks never to try out their chicken roast/ chicken fry which was one-quarter of a skinned chicken smeared with some dark sauce insipid and unimaginative in taste. another disaster lurking to disappoint you is their chicken pepper in saute sauce.

however, having said this i do add these are individual perspectives and one must give this place a try for its food, ambience & jazz...

I cannot resist Chinese food. I always walked past Moulin Rouge, whenever I came to Park Street,but never visited this restaurant. It was on my bucket list for long. Finally came here on Sunday for lunch.

Food - We had ordered mixed hakka chow with Chicken garlic gravy, as side dish. It took them 15 minutes to prepare the fresh, less oily and tasty meal. The quantity was sufficient for two famished souls and good value for money. Our bill was just Rs.450.

Decor - It has the vintage Kolkata feel with dim lights. I love the ambience too.

Staff - They were polite and co-operative.

Overall, it's definitely worth a try. :)

Dropped in here, a week or two back, after having a quick round of beer and beef steak at Oly Pub. Ordered for a Fish Kebab and Grilled Chicken for take-away. Firstly, one particular manager/waiter/server seemed low and depressed, and kept staring at me and two other customers (Couple sitting together) for ages. As if, someone has forced him to stand there and do his job. The package they used to seal in the dishes was of inferior quality. Much like some cardboard made out gift box, which turned soggy and wet, by the time I took them to my home for consumption. The Fish Kebabs had a weird smell in it. They were fresh and looked like some cold kebabs heated up for service. The Chicken portion was too small in size, and wouldn't even feed a 6 year old kid. Had been to this restaurant many years back with some of my family members, in and around 1995-1997. Undoubtedly, the quality has gone to ruins in all these years!

We ordered chilli crab, mixed grilled sizzler and roasted duck along with cocktails and beer. 
Chilli crab was a really spicy dish. The sizzler was also awesome to taste. The roasted duck was something new to me.
The ambience was also very soothing. The total pocket pinch after all these was surprisingly low.. 
So just go there and grab some good food

Moulin Rouge located in the food hub of Kolkata can be easily missed beacuse of of its small entrance. For starters we ordered stir fried chicken which was pretty good. For the main course we ordered mix chomwin mixed fried rice and hunan chicken. The fried rice tough tasted alright, but the chowmein was so shabby in its taste... it lacked spices... same with the hunan chicken.. it lacked the taste! It tasted as if it was cooked hurriedly without the required spices. Both the chowmein and chicken dishes had a minty flavour which me and my friends did not like at all. We didnot expect the standard of the food to be this from a restuarant in Parkstreet.

They offer italian, indian and chinese and hence gives us the option to choose from many. I prefer the italian dishes though. I visited Moulin Rouge this Puja with my family. Tried their Cheese Chicken Kebab, Baked Fish in Tomato Sauce, Mixed Fried Rice and Chili Lobster. Each of the dishes were delectable specially the Chili Lobster and the Baked Fish; the service was very good though they were serving a large crowd.

This place was already very popular with the residents of the City of Joy and it's popularity increased 3 fold after "Parineeta" happened! 

The interior is basic & simple. I find the place little congested too. Few menu cards are worn out & you might find stains & spots here & there. 3/5.

Service: I find it very good! Like most old restaurants at Park Street, waiters are really skilled and smart. They will help you with the choice of food & suggest you the best things to have. 4.5/5.

Food: I am a fan of the Fish Fingers that they make. Also, other delicious items include Fried Spring Chicken, Chilli Prawn & Chilli Fish. 4/5.

Price is reasonable. Cheaper than other restaurants with the same standard of food. 

Portion is sufficient.

We wanted to visit other restaurants on Park Street but it being a Sunday night most of the popular ones were Jam packed, Moulin Rouge seemed a safe bet to get a table and luckily they did have seats available. The ambiance is old and in need of new furnishing but suitable considering the cheap prices. They had a live music going on adding to the 70's feeling. We ordered our drinks, some starters and main course. The service was fast, the food mediocre, the prices very reasonable, all according to expectation. Go to the place if you want to cheap dinning options in Park Street or if you are not getting seats in the more popular joints.

The menu is not extraordinary but the food is great, taste and quality wise. Stir fried chicken, tandoori pomfret, chicken tetrazzini, mixed grill sizzler, fish boti kebab, chicken steak, mutton sheik kebab, every single dish maintains the standard.

Not many places serve good gin, this place is an exception. The gin is really smooth. The cocktails and mocktails are wonderful. Their pinacolada is much, much better than the pinacolada of many renowned restaurants.

Moulin Rouge is a restaurant that I recommend to others on regular basis, because it's totally worth it.

Moulin rouge has seen its glory days but now it is one of the lesser known places in park streets. A small entrance to this place can be easily given a miss. However they have a windmill, which signifies their name. I and my friend went here for lunch, as we have always heard this place being considered a legend of  70s kolkata. Upon entering  we found the place to be quite spacious with dim lighting and quite a huge sitting area. We almost had the place to ourselves as there was only 2 other customers in a faraway table. We ordered for a chicken steak sizzler and mixed grill sizzler. But both the dishes were just average. There is not even a single good thing which can be recalled. The sauces were bad, the chicken pieces were dry,  the vegetables were soggy, only the fries were good. And all this bad food was with quite a pocket pinch. The only thing worth remembering is the service, which was very prompt. With many legendary places in park streets itself for sizzlers and steaks, it is wise not to waste the money here. I am not going back, for sure.

Pleasant experience here, one of the oldest restaurants in park street. The Moulin rouge has an old british raj feel to it. Dim lights, a piano and a chandelier both of which are at bay. We were stationary on a comfortable sofa and the waiter took our order - Fish fingers and chips, a chicken steak sizzler, a mixed platter sizzler and lastly a dry chili chicken. There were also some beverages too. Now to the food, the fish was the most tender and subtle fish finger i have ever had and dipping it tartar sauce, heaven! Both the sizzlers were good and the quality of the meat was excellent. We spend a good amount of there, with these and lastly we wanted to try out the dry chilli chicken and to my surprise it was pretty good. I will surely come again to revisit the charm and good continental array.

I will surely come again to revisit the charm and good continental array.

Park Street and the numerous places here to dine in at. This place, however, is among the legends. 
Enter the place to find an amazing decor with comfy sofas and i loved the glasses. This place might need a little attention to the restoration, not a makeover though since everything is in place and well decorated.
The menu here on Zomato is different that what was offered to us yesterday. We had a Tuna based appetiser and Mixed grilled sizzler with pasta. A draught beer to drink and their special mocktail. The portions were adequate, rather good. The tuna was delicious and the sizzler was perfect with chicken, mutton, prawn, fish and poached egg. The mocktail was good and draught beer was....well like beer. So the food part was good.
The pricing was rather on the higher side than suggested here. The food alone was for 900 and another 600 for the 3 glasses of beer and the mocktail. The staff was really good and polite and was insisting on nolen gurer ice cream which is due for next visit.
Surely one place to visit for casual dining every once in a while.

Although the name is typically French (Moulin Rouge means red windmill),,,, they don’t serve French dishes,,,,in fact,,,, there are huge blades of windmill attached to the restaurant...... The interior is done in an old-worldly style which i luv very much.....
However,,,, their legacy doesn’t end with the décor,,,,, the food shouts out loud its legacy too...... Moulin Rouge specializes in sizzlers—so its a must try....Chicken Scallion is my fav here.....

Did you know that Moulin Rouge is a French phrase meaning 'red windmill' ? Or are you already imagining Rekha dancing to 'kaisi paheli zindagani' from Prineeta? Either way being one of the oldest restaurant of Park Street , Moulin Rouge has a multitude of history to offer!!! While this place may not be happening for today's youth, this place attracts many from the yesteryear generation. With lovely food, decent & sober interior, old school staff, reasonable prices & a strategic location this place has a lot going on for itself.

Wish them many more successes in future!! :)

Moulin Rouge, an accidental discovery. 

Me and girlfriend were out on the streets of Park Street looking for a place to dine-in. Looking at various options we stumbled upon Moulin Rogue. Not thinking any further, we thought of giving Moulin Rogue a shot.

This place has a vintage feel to itself. Live music, musicians playing violin in front of you, beautifully done interior decor, Moulin Rogue will definitely take you back in time.

Coming to food, we'd ordered Hunan chicken and some Chicken Hakka noddles. My girl wanted to try some crab however the waiter said that crab wasn't available at that time. Saturday evening, people throbbing into the restaurant to try out good dishes and then when you don't have some good dishes to offer, it's a bit turndown. Nevertheless, the Hunan chicken was very well prepared. Just the right mix of gravy and boneless chicken. The Hakka Noodles was dry and complimented the side dish we ordered.

Overall a decent experience if not one of our best.

It is probably slightly underrated. The food is quite delicious. So is the ambience. Even though you don't get the feel of what Moulin Rouge used to be some decades ago, as I have heard from my family, it sure still is a great place to go. In order of quality of course, it would go - Peter Cat & Mocambo (same level), and then Moulin Rouge. But the gap is quite small.

Have been to this place long back, about three years ago. The entrance and the ambience in the ground floor was great upholding the sixties' culture of Park Street. Live violin being played and the lights everything added something to the charm. We couldn't manage a seat at the ground floor. So we were sent upstairs which is rather shady and dark. The food was below average. Tried the Bassa Fish Fingers and Chicken Tetrazzini. Food was nothing special, not even something that you may call good. That's it.

Coming on to the food section, we really like this place. Very nice quality food and of sufficient quantity makes us visit here often.
The employees have been cordial all the time and they do remember us. Quite impressive service offered by them.
A place according to me worth visiting anytime.

One of the tastiest and finger licking good food served here. 
It was my wedding anniversary and dining here was a sudden plan !
We ordered Mixed Sizzler and Grilled Crab as starters and they were so decilious. Specially the crab. Its a must dish in ur order 
For the main course went for Ghoshtwali Biriyani and Chicken Butter Masala. Though the biriyani was not that tasty but the butter masala was a complete yumm ! 
Pls visit this place. 
The only irritating part was the person who was taking the orders. Didn't give enough time to go through the menu card !

I finally got the chance to visit Moulin Rouge. I was alone and when I entered, the place was absolutely deserted! I went and chose a table and luckily I saw one person sitting at the bar. With a sigh of relief I sat down! 
The place is quite well decorated. It has a vintage feel which is really nice. The waiter quickly got the menu and I placed my order. I had :
The Moulin Rouge Special - This was a really nice mocktail. I quite liked the taste. It was really filling too! 
Fish and chips - This was a cracker dish. Well almost. I LOVED the fish. It was perfect. The flavours were bursting in my mouth. Just heavenly. But the french fries and the boiled vegetables were blah. But the fish was just so perfect that I didn't really mind. 
Baked Alaska - I was quite excited to see how they'll pull it off. But sadly, they failed to impress me. The dish just wasn't right. There was no meringue on the outside, it was just some eggy covering over the ice cream. Definitely disappointing. 
All in all, it's a nice place to visit. I would happily be back again looking to try out some other dishes! Happy Dining!

The ambience of the place is very lovable, however the services provided by the waiter is really poor they were lazy and was behaving like they don't want to serve food, it took a lot of time for them to provide the food, we ordered one chicken tikka, one reshmi and one garlic kebab. Though the chicken was fresh but taste of the dish was not up to the mark. We couldn't enjoy the meal due to poor service and for a restuarent situated at an area park street the standard of this restaurant is low. Hope that they would improve their condition in the upcoming time. I would not suggested it as a place for the foodies but as a part of heritage this restuarent can be a one time visit.

This is one of the very old restaurant in park street area. But now days  their quality and service drastically changed and it is downgraded, specially the service. Few days back I visit this place for lunch and ordered tandoori chicken as a starter but I was very upset when the dish served, chicken was not fresh enough and a distinct smell are coming from it. How ever the service and management was very poor, service boy constantly poked us to complete the lunch as early as possible. Don't know why but after I complained against him no one from management comes for the apology. This was not expected from a very old and renowned place. I have very disheartened and probably will not go back to this place. Suggestion is not visit the place this will not fulfill your expectation.

The small, vintage gate with the name written in neon leads you to a restaurant that's mostly empty and quiet. The decor, with huge paintings depicting French landmarks, cabaret, etc. gives an old-world touch to the ambience. The bangali touch, on the other hand, is added by the semi-dry garland around the idol of Jesus Christ above the main gate. The name had me expecting a French menu; unfortunately, that didn't happen. It turned out to be a multi-cuisine place with the menu featuring Chinese, North Indian and European dishes. We went there in a group. The peace and quiet inside was the best part for me. The food was satisfactory. The saute chicken with pepper sauce, and the shrimp cocktail were quite nice, and the nolen gur ice cream was unique and quite a nice finish to the meal. If you're looking for a quiet place where you can grab a bite and talk, Moulin Rouge might serve the purpose.

Being located in one of the prime restaurant location of kolkata, moulin rouge could not keep up to the standard. I was very disappointed with the food... quality was quite normal standard and I almost wasted the fish mayonnaise appetiser.... only thing good was the quantity... price is on the higher side and the ambience is just okay. But a quick drink it's worth a visit.

May not be a perfect place for todays youth, but certainly for 90s kids like me, who are still stuck in the glorious past. A truly great place, no loud music, just a serene ambience, with some pretty delicious duck and crab specialities. The attendants are all quite experienced and cordial, wide range of beverages, but the food quality is just fantastic. One of my personal go to places as I dislike loud music. Overall, the vintage aristrocacy that this place exudes is mesmerising.

Moulin Rouge isn't as fancy as it's name sounds. Visited this outlet long back. It's a very old restaurant and that is evident by the way it looks inside. Loved the ambience. Not too pricy. A normal restaurant just for the location and nothing else. Drinks is the main focus with detoriating service. The restaurant is dull. The food is good too, there's nothing in particular I wish to highlight about it. There were only 2 options in beer. Kingfisher mild n strong. Ordered the Butter Nun & Reshmi Tikka Masala which were good accompaniments. Service was very average. We stuck ourselves to only ordering the drinks for the time that we were there.

Wanted to match a Ftbol match alongwith the necessary requirement of some plenty of beer to quench our thirst while we were at Park Street on a Friday night. Moulin Rouge offered jst that, big screen groundfloor, but given our huge entourage, we were put up on the top floor. Surprisingly and much to our displeasure, there were only 2 options in beer. Kingfisher mild n strong. Ordered the prawns tandoori and masala papads, which were good accompaniments. Service was very average, almost bordering on poor even..though the place did have an old man playing saxophone n piano love for the guests. Since the food and service wasn't anything that we were enjoying..we stuck ourselves to only ordering the drinks for the time that we were there. Wud love to try out other options next time. With

This place appears to be one of those oldest restaurants.

Food quality is satisfactory. Fish item was good.
The staff, who took our orders, seemed so reluctant to do his job. Should be checked.

A heritage diner in the much talked about locality of Park Street. This place doesn't need any introduction. 
Still It was a long awaited dream to dine here and finally got to accomplish that yesterday. I went there after office and was in a mood for a little alcohol. My fiance suggested we try this place and I was really happy about it. 

We went in and found ourselves in an ambience that was yesteryear  elite Kolkata. The whole feel good factor in the place was the decor complete with chandeliers and paintings and all. The waiters were very hospitable and well mannered and the service was excellent. 

We ordered the Mixed Grill Sizzler and the Hot Garlic Prawn Sizzler. The food was simply awesome. Also in terms of spirits the bar was well stocked. All in all I loved the experience and am looking forward to my next visit.

Moulin Rouge - one of the premiere restaurants in Park Street area served us with one of the best Chinese food we have had. The Fried Rice -the mixed one was delicious to say the least coupled with the Basa Chilli Fish. The fish preparation was not spicy but palatable. We were also served the Chilly Chicken comprising of 12 pieces  which was a good experience to have. As it was a weekday not much people were around but the ambiance was exquisite with flavors of Chinese interior. Above all it was an economy lunch as the tariff was reasonable enough.

I guess this place thrives on its past glory. Not bad, but not something extraordinary also. When you step in you get a feel of grandeur. The royal interiors are praiseworthy. However the waiters are not very professional. We ordered baked fish with mayonise and chicken steak. The steak was average and I have had better steaks. The fish tasted kinda nice. The cold dish with a generous serving of mayo and cream was good however the amount of fish was very less. The price is on the higher side.

Today we went there to attend our 2 bestie's birthday treat.we had heard from our friends that sometimes they don't serve quality food.But still we chose that restaurant for its vintage backgrounds. After we entered staffs arranged the seats for us as we were 13.We cut the cake,after that they gave us enough time to chose items.But they took more time to serve the food.Now we had ordered 3mixed rice,2 mixed chowmin,3 side dishes,and a baked veg item.All of them were really very very tasty,quantity wise they were huge.1 chicken side dish contains 10-12 pieces of chicken. Pocket pinch was 2500.Lastly I want to say the person who took our order and those who served us are good too.

Well who hasn't heard about this iconic place in park street. Exactly!
It's this venerableness that drew me and my colleague to this eatery on a cozy winter noon!
The place is actually smaller thab it looks from outside, the interior suits the continental fare.
We ordered sweet corn soup, prawn noodles and chilly panner and sweet lime soda.
The quantity of the dishes were sumptuous.
The soup was warm and apt however the noodles were bland to taste.
The worse was yet come as we had to actually send back the sweet lime soda as it was nothing but sugar water.
As icing on the cake the waiter did not mention the soda in the bill and charged us 100 buck for that separately to our surprise! (on inquiry he informed that this would 'help' him)
With so many options in that area I dont think I would want to peekaboo here again.

Liquor was pretty cheap in terms of price. 
Food was average nothing worth appreciating for. 
What pissed me off was that with their service and staff's decency. Otherwise it's just an average place with decent liquor and food price.

Not so bad, not so good either. This is what i felt from my experiance here today. Not so bad because the food portions were sufficient and somewhat tasty, not so good because chicken in hot garlic sauce did not taste like one. Instead it reminded us of chicken in white sauce😐. The mixed noodles were abundant and somewhat tasty, the chicken tikka in starters though was not up to the mark. The person in blazer taking the order lacked proper etiquete and it seemed that he was doing a favor by taking down the order. The rest of the staff were good though. 
Do not visit this place if you have a better option.

Well who hasn't heard about this iconic place in park street. Exactly!
It's this venerableness that drew me and my colleague to this eatery on a cozy winter noon!
The place is actually smaller thab it looks from outside, the interior suits the continental fare.
We ordered sweet corn soup, prawn noodles and chilly panner and sweet lime soda.
The quantity of the dishes were sumptuous.
The soup was warm and apt however the noodles were bland to taste.
The worse was yet come as we had to actually send back the sweet lime soda as it was nothing but sugar water.
As icing on the cake the waiter did not mention the soda in the bill and charged us 100 buck for that separately to our surprise! (on inquiry he informed that this would 'help' him)
With so many options in that area I dont think I would want to peekaboo here again.

I don't know why this place is rated so low but I prefer Moulin Rouge's food over other bunch of 'high rated' restaurants particularly in this area. This place have a classic ambience which overall suits my temperament and their foods are too good. Also the stuffs are very cooperating and well mannered which is another thing that kinda forced me for a straight '5'.

Right from the entrance to the interior decor, this restaurant exudes a different charm altogether, with its VINTAGE appearance. The dim light, the theme, the decor, everything together provides an exceptionally exclusive look to this "one of the old restaurant" of Kolkata.
People who loves to eat, or wants to chill out over a few drinks, may visit this place. Even the place is good enough to spend some quality time with family, friends, and loved one.
The soothing ambience inside allows you to get rid of stress and relax in peace.
Food is genuinely awesome, specially the sizzlers and fish finger.
A place worth visiting.

This place is elegant with the finesse of the ambience and Christmas decorations too. We went on Christmas eve and were lucky to find ourselves a table here. The food tasted good, right from the starters to the main course although the Christmas menu had very selective dishes. The attendant who took our orders had so much poise, reminded me of Alfred from the Batman series. Fun experience

Moulin Rouge - A vintage feel.
=====
Intro + Location:

I had been to Moulin Rouge with one of my friend. She recommended me to try this place and hence, we arrived here. It is not very difficult to locate as it is located in the main park street area. The ambience of the place is nice but a lot dim. I somehow don't prefer dim places much. Nevertheless, the seat and the table is quite attached and it is really difficult to sit at the first place. That was really a pain. Nevertheless, we sat and began to stalk the a la carte.
=====
What we ordered:

• Fresh Lime Sweet - It tasted fine. 

• Chicken Fried Rice - The Rice was really good and so was the chicken. The portions were also suffice for two people. ✌

• Schezwan Chicken - Tasted super good. The chicken was mouth melting and very tender. The problem was with the gravy. A little more corn flour than usual. ✌
=====
Meal for two: 500-1200 max
=====
Pros:

• Prime Location
• Good Food. 
• Good Ambiance. 
• Moderate serving speed. 
• Price is fine as per the portions order for a fine dine restaurant. 

Cons:

• The restaurant staffs are less empathetic. They usually insist on ordering their own dishes. 
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation 3.7/5
Food Quality 3.5/5
Food Taste 3.8/5
Hospitality 3.4/5
Hygiene 3.6/5
Value for money 3.5/5
=====
I would definitely give it a visit in the near future. I really liked the chicken here. ❤

Vintage. Well behaved staffs. Efficient serving. 
Good food. 
Nice décor. 
Excellent grilled fish. 
Duck in kalimpong chilli was delicious. 
Not so good Chicken sizzler. 
Stringent dessert items. 
Overall, recommended just for the sake of being one of the oldest restaurants in Calcutta.

A legendary eatery in the Park Street area which takes it name from the famous Moulin Rouge Cabaret in Paris. It has an old world charm inside & tries to hold onto the bygone era. Continental, Chinese & Bengali cuisines are offered here. It attracts both the family visitor as well as the hangout groups. However, food quality has detoriated over the years. The Chinese dishes are tasty though. On my last visit I ordered for Golden Fried Prawns & Fish Finger. Both were not upto the mark. But, the Mix Hakka Noodles was good. The place can be visited occasionally to soak into that old times.......

This place is legendary so it does have a lot of nostalgia added to it. Now going by my recent visit to this place, I was a bit disappointed.

Yes they still have their dim lights,same ambience and the colonial feel. Also the food menu and pricing are the same.

Coming to taste : The soup I tried was so bland that I didn't even feel like taking a photo of it ( not that it was presented well) . The grilled fish was definitely the best. The corn starters were nothing great,not bad either.

Coming to service, it was bad, the servers were muttering while clearing the leftover and to top it all they demanded special 'tips'. I am not going back here ever.

Moulin Rouge is one of the oldest and most renowned restaurants of Park Street. I see the 3.4 rating which the place currently holds in zomato and think what could have gone wrong and why this is not a 4 star rating eatery. Frankly i do not have any answer. I have been to this place before but did not change upon to write any reviews. Well here it is , we went there from office . We were about 21 people which they accommodated without any fuss. It has a wide variety of menu to choose from starting from continental to mughlai through chinese. below are the items we ordered.

Starters : -

1 . Chicken tandoori ( 3/5).

Main Course :-

1. Murg Biryani ( 4/5 ). <--- Excellent Biryani 
2. Chicken Steak (4/5).
3. Fish Steak (4/5)
4. Chicken Stroganoff (4/5) <--- Simply yummy
5. Fish Manchurian (3.5/5)
6. Butter Nun (4/5)

Deserts :-
1. Nolen Gur Ice cream (4.5/5)
2. Caramel custard (3.5/5)

As you can see from the above food ratings that it has really been a very pleasant experience for us. The fish and chicken steaks were basically sizzlers and were very well cooked, the fish steak is just awesome. The Biryani is yummy quite surprisingly it was way better than an Arsalan one. The biryani was served piping hot which  made the dish taste better. Chicken stroganoff was cheesy and very tasty. At the end the nolen gur ice cream just made our day.The ambience is amazing and the behavior from the staff is something you will relish. So for people who have not yet given a try please do . Enjoy the time and enjoy the food . :)

Chanced upon this place during my visit to kolkata. As you enter you can notice a
modest facade leading to a big hall with cluttered Mughlai-style seating with sinkin sofas along the walls divided to ground floor and first floor. 

Ravenous that we were decided to have Chinese and ordered the usuals from Chinese cuisine. 
Disappointed with the unavailability of certain Beers and Cocktail on the menu, I wasn't really looking forward to the food. But boy I was wrong. Fried Rice and Noodles were delectable and the Baby Corn Manchurian with semi gravy was scrumptious and piping hot which made me savour my food all the more. Quantity of food was generous and service was prompt.

Another visit to the once so very popular restro bar..though this place has lost its old glory and charm over the years owing to numerous other hangouts in the area it still remains a decent choice for a change..no live music like in the past nor is the piano playing to soothe ur ears alongside ur tastebuds..we had sweet and corn chicken soup..followed up with chicken a la kiev,chicken steak and mixed grill platter..the platter was supposed to come with pasta which apparently the waiter forgot to serve..upon insisting he did..the service is lacklustre at best and there seems to be a certain amount of lethargy among the staff who seem to have a i-dont-care attitude..the food is pretty ordinary and it makes me wonder how long can they continue with this quality considering the variety of options around the area..overall not a very joyous or a foodelight experience..

Don't let the name fool you. Neither it has got the Nicole Kidman feel nor the midas touch of Kaisi Paheli Zindagani. The floor carpets,the dimly lit hall,the retro couches aren't worth mentioning. Food is the only saving grace and the only thing that spices up the mood. Like the other Park Street joints MR too excels in continental cuisines. The Pasta variants are worth a special mention. Last but not the least, the food is decently priced.

Food : not very good by teast. We order fish fingers, chicken Tetrazzini, grilled fish and prawn thermidor. Prawn preparation was smelling badly. We returned it and in place of that we ordered another plate of fish finger, which was good enough by quality and quantity. However at the end they included the prawn thermidor in the bill. Also when we told them it's smelling badly, they were not agreed to that. 
Overall experience was tooooo bad. 
I don't think I will ever try for this restaurant in future.

The food is also equally good. We once ordered some unique preparations of paneer and we loved it ! The only reason I am giving it 4.5 and not 5, is because we had to wait a lot for the food to arrive. Else, it is a must-try place in park street.

Persistent insistence of a friend made me visit Moulin Rouge for the first time 3days back. Once a dead restaurant as history says,this place has pulled itself beautifully with its new decor and range of food. I so wish to hear the piano being played live the next time I visit the place. 
Even in the rush hours of the pujas,we got a table comfortably enough. Straight to the food then. Best chance? Go for the chicken tetrazini without a second thought. Its delicious and better than most other tetrazinis of the city. Other than this, we ordered for rather simple food : naan, rogan josh and chicken tikka masala; the latter being really delicious whereas the rogan josh tasted homely.
Service was extremely prompt and that was quite impressive on a hungry stomach.
The mocktails and cocktails were average ones and sadly couldn't floor me.
Visit the place at least once for the heritage it has to offer. :)

Went to Mouline Rouge for saptami lunch.
Apart from the staple Chinese diet of mixed chowmein and crispy chicken, the stars of the lunch were fish mayonnaise and the three layered tooti frooti.
The fish mayonnaise consisted of fried fish and nicely boiled vegetables in an ample quantity of mayonnaise.
This was followed by the chowmein and chicken which were pretty good in their own rights...
The lunch was rounded off with a triple layered tooti frooti ice cream 🍨 which was truly yummy...
This was undoubtedly one of the best lunches that I have had in a long time.

Hovering in a place like Park Street and not willing to stand in a queue , just peep in this comfy zone. The ambiance is too good to spend a quality time. Starters with chilled beer add the flavour to the mood. What I don't enjoy is that the quality of the main course drops down during the Pujas or Festive Season.

A great place for spending a quiet evening with your loved ones. Ambience is more than good. Cosy sofas, dim light, the piano at the entrance, the warm hospitality and not to forget the awesome food. We ordered sicillian chicken which was filled with chicken,cheese,mushrooms and chicken ala Kiev in which the chicken was so tender and juicy. I would recommend everyone to visit at least once if you want to experience the old world charm and the good food. Looking forward to visiting again.

One of the oldest restaurants of Park Street, Moulin Rogue isn't much high standard in their ambience and glamour but the food is definitely very good,and both the quality and quantity is satisfying. We ordered a premium vodka, kingfisher strong and hakka mixed noodles,it was quite filling. :) they also have a roll shop in front of it which is too good actually :P

Along with that they play piano accompanied by song .

A high price restaurant but worth to try all the cuisine.

Loved this place. I was a bit skeptical to try it, owing to its low rating in zomato but this place amazed it. The interior of the restaurant is so crafted to give a 1980's shabby look. The star attraction is a live pianist, playing melodious tunes. I was completely won over. Then came the food, we had ordered a fish streak and chicken steak. Both the dishes were cooked to perfection, not too many elements and enough to fill your stomach and still leave a little room for dessert. The price food and drinks were reasonable. All in all, Loved it . Waiting to visiting you guys again.

It is nice place, Moulin Rouge has the rouge on the walls however was a little disappointed with the place. 
The chicken Tikka was nice but served a little cold, but cocktail was nice. 

We didn't stay too long, it's nice and cosy place and the staff is nice.

The hangover of 60's is found in almost all the restaurants and bars in "Classic Park Street". However MR is a special mention. The cabaret is gone but the ambience remains.Food is ok and a aint expensive if you compare with other joints in the locality. Run by the Mantosh family, some of the waiters are serving at this place for 30+ years.

I have tasted almost everything they have on the menu.During the hilsa festival: Try boneless Hilsa kebab. Its nice! During the duck festival: Try Chilli duck!Ambience is old and classy. More of a college joint than anything else!

A signboard with "Hilsa Festival"written on it grabbed our attention as we were roaming in Park Street, we went inside and ambience as we use to see in 90s . Yes , we can call it a vintage styled restaurant with spacious and comfortable sofa seating arrangement. We ordered Smoked Hilsa, Roasted Hilsa, Garlic chicken as starters , I must say Hilsa didn't disaapoint us and we enjoyed our starters with complimentary wine. For our main course , we ordered Chicken bharta and Jumbo prawn Jhalfrezi , Chicken bharta lacked spices and it was sweet . Prawn Jhalfrezi was having a common taste and nothing special about it . Overall , it is place to handout and give a try , but will not rate it extraordinary or near to its rival restaurants on Park Street.

Vintage feel at its best. One of the oldest clubs located at the heart of the "city of joy". Quite dramatic / cinematic feel with red carpets, dim lights and music. The beer ain't too expensive, the food ain't too bad, the overall experience was fun - am sure the place would have been the lifeline of the town at one point, though one must admit that the place has lost some of it's charm over time.

Park street never disappoints, nor does this place. Hearty portions, nice taste and a friendly ambiance is definitely something that will take me back to this place again. Had visited this place with friends for lunch, Crab was the best I had, well-cooked in exotic spices, the crab meat was wonderful, starters were a bit disappointing, but the chicken and mutton main dishes rocked!! The sizzlers were also well made. Was really happy with their sparkling wine which accompanied our dishes....

Nothing to rave about but this place has the basics covered. Well trained staff, timely service, decent ambience, live music (nothing too great but still) and better than average food. And all this keeping in mind the price point which is very reasonable. If not in a mood to try out new places, this is a pretty bankable joint.

Food : This place is better than any other places in Park Street.

Drinks : All is good until you enjoy. Not a place for drunkards.

Pocket Pinch : Reasonable and in fact, cheaper than many restaurants in and around Park Street.

Staff is rude to the point that they actually asked us for larger tips. Place looked kind of shady to me and staff served us on the side plates. Waiter actually asked us to pay him separately for the cocktail!!! I won't be going back for sure.

Can't give below 1 :/ food was ok but it lacked the most important thing good service. They asked for extra money stating service tax goes to the government and continuously said the same thing over and over again even the waiter called the manager and he said the same thing. I mean seriously do they think everyone's a fool and so asked extra money, asking extra tip isn't the problem but lying to do so to get mere 100 or 200 bucks. Total dissatisfied with the service, would never revisit this shity place or would recommend this place to anyone ever.

I completely agree to a recent newspaper article on how the old school, typical calcuttan architechture of long windows, high celings, spacious verandas, intricate grill work, round-edged buildings, arches and columns are being replaced by boring, banal, straight, ugly towers, taking away with it the understated grace and uniqueness of our city. So there was happy feeling at the end of a long, traffic-tormented ride to park street for, one, I got to marvel at many such old houses en route and two, in the park street eating houses are still trapped the smells and stories of the bygone days. The grandeur of Moulin Rouge must have tarnished over the years, the nature of the clientele changed, a TV had to be introduced, space had to be saved, the upholstery had to be changed, wall colour had to be settled for a gaudy shade to hide the cracks or may be not. But elderly waiters, the live music being played,  the camaraderie between the two elderly musicians has its own charm. I was happy to see the place buzzing with people on a Saturday night and we even had a enthusiastic five-year old to dance away to the tunes of the piano paying no heed to what her parents said!
Coming to the food, it was very good. We had garlic fish, chicken stir -fry, chicken soup and mixed grill sizzler along with spirits. The pricing is moderate.

The soothing music, classy look & a perfect ambience made my day after a whole day work...  Ordered for masala pea nuts, fish finger, tandoori chicken, last but not the least chicken steak sizzler, which I loved the most.

I visited d restaurant just after the release of the Movie Parineeta to find whether any one like Rekha will do dance and sing a song but to my suprise there was nothing like that which dissapointed me a bit. Regarding the food its ok ok, neither too hit nor too flop. However the ambience of the restaurant is collonial style and u will feel as if you are in british era. I would reccomend it to frnds to go once and give it a try.

"Form is temporary, class is permanent".
Thus goes the motto of this era-old biggie, located in the very stomach of Kolkata. Unlike some other companion of its own age, Moulin Rouge serves you with excellent food along with a slice of the bygone nightlife of Kolkata.

Honestly speaking, I was  a bit apprehensive about the place because of my earlier encounters with a few "once-a-mammoth" restaurants. But now I can take my inhibitions back. I was there with my family and each of us loved the food like anything! We started with Tuna Brochettes and Chicken Casserole. The tuna was pan fried, tossed with assorted vegetables and a little sauce and served with rice. The whole dish tasted fabulous. It was the perfect start for a dinner. The look, the spices, the typical Indian craving for a tangy tastebud - the chefs got everything right. The chicken was okay, not as good as other dishes we had. Though I had an idea that a usual casserole preparation, like a tortilla or rice casserole, has a creamy appearance, here they serve it in a bowlful of gravy. I would personally suggest to avoid this, if possible. The next in the line was Chicken Tetrazzini which tasted really good and followed the standard preparation. Then we had Roasted Duck and Chilli Crab and both were heavenly fabulous! I guess you can trust them with your duck; they simply wont score a duck! Lastly we had a Mixed Sizzler and a Tooty Fruity. Both were as good as they are in other restaurants of Park Street.

The decor here is a bit dull, but nonchalantly draped in a nostalgic air. The pianist near the doorway will make sure to add a slight, molten flavour of aristocracy to your surrounding. And that makes the mood.

“A default without faults :-)”

We were looking for a decent restaurant for a team dinner, after a long day of reviews and discussions. Going to authentic Bengali places was ruled out, as Kewpie's was on weekly off and Bhojohari Manna was far away from the office.

Our colleagues from Kolkata suggested Park Street as the location, and any decent restaurant there as the destination. I knew about the food and nightlife of Kolkata and told my colleagues about the same as they were in Kolkata for the first or second time.

But what happened next was unexpected even by the Kolkata colleagues. We went hopping from restaurant to restaurant without luck. Long queues waiting for a table on a Monday night, at 10 pm. We can never imagine the same in Mumbai. People here are either reaching home at that time, or are retiring for the day, to get ready for the supersonic Tuesday morning.

Moulin Rouge was our 5th attempt at getting a table, and we were successful finally.It appeared to be an old but decent place, and we were tired and hungry. I checked TripAdvisor on my smartphone and was reassured as the reviews in general were good.

The place, the decor and the staff, all were vintage. The use of red and gold in the decor was obviously meant to relate to the Moulin Rouge theme. The place was not dingy, as most vintage restaurants are. The staff was courteous. Special mention of Mr. Albert Fernandes, who in his fluent English, guided us through the menu, customized our orders and even suggested about the portions we should order to avoid wastage/overeating. Thank you Mr.Fernandes.

The food was good. We ordered vegetarian starters, mocktails and rice and dal to round off the dinner. Other colleagues had non vegetarian and drinks, and they too were satisifed.

Moulin Rouge, then, was a default choice without any faults. We were happy with the rendezvous.

Went there yesterday evening. Ordered Chicken Russian Salad, Boneless Mutton Kasha Dry and Prawn Malai Curry Dry along with alcohol. Mutton was the best among the three. Other two were ok type. Ambiance is average. Service was not bad. But the worst thing was that the waiter bargained for extra amount of Tip. The guy seemed more like a footpath seller of Esplanade than a service person of Moulin Rouge. I will not recommended anyone to this place simply because of his unbelievable behaviour.

One of the oldest on Park Street, the place has tried to maintain it's old world charm, though the lack of renovation sometimes borders on shabby. This place is not as packed as Bar-b-q or Peter Cat, but has a steady stream of regulars who like to visit for a drink.
Food is great. Old continental favourites like Chicken Tetrazzini, Chicken Cordon Blue and Mixed Sizzlers, along with a plate of Fish Fingers with their delicious tartar sauce and a glass of whisky felt great. Service is ok, with the waiters suggesting good choices, but at times tends to be slow. A tad bit overpriced.

Went there yesterday evening. Ordered Chicken Russian Salad, Boneless Mutton Kasha Dry and Prawn Malai Curry Dry along with alcohol. Mutton was the best among the three. Other two were ok type. Ambiance is average. Service was not bad. But the worst thing was that the waiter bargained for extra amount of Tip. The guy seemed more like a footpath seller of Esplanade than a service person of Moulin Rouge. I will not recommended anyone to this place simply because of his unbelievable behaviour.

One of the oldest on Park Street, the place has tried to maintain it's old world charm, though the lack of renovation sometimes borders on shabby. This place is not as packed as Bar-b-q or Peter Cat, but has a steady stream of regulars who like to visit for a drink.
Food is great. Old continental favourites like Chicken Tetrazzini, Chicken Cordon Blue and Mixed Sizzlers, along with a plate of Fish Fingers with their delicious tartar sauce and a glass of whisky felt great. Service is ok, with the waiters suggesting good choices, but at times tends to be slow. A tad bit overpriced.

Pathetic place at the very beginning the reception seems to be good but later went upstairs ages old table clothes waiter busy for collecting tips no music at the first we ordered chili paneer which was ok but later the tango kebab was pathetic hakka noodles were even worst butter paneer was bad paneer was not fresh I just had two beers two small brandy as one of us was having cold this is all we had and guess what the bill was 2,500/- it's not about money but not worry it at all I guess I should have gone to Peter cat or oasis if after reading this review if you ppl don't trust me go and check for your self rating -5 will never go back again zero food zero ambiance too heavy on pocket not worth it.

Went there for lunch. The place has an old world charm with beautiful pictures of ladies dancing and red decorated walls. In the background jazz music was playing which can transfer you to the vintage world. Still you can't forget present world with the giant tv screen showing latest news.Lol. They welcomed us cordially. For the food, we ordered mixed sizzler and chicken chowmein Cantonese style. The presentation was good. Both the dishes were enough for 2 persons. chowmein was okayish. sizzler was very good and came with pieces of pasta.

It has an old world charm and ambience... The walls r a nice shade of red with a mural on one wall of showgirls dancing :). Staff ws friendly and helped us with their suggestions. We ordered chicken sicillian and chicken cordon bleu and a couple of beers. Chicken sicillian had a nice creamy texture... I ws expecting chicken cordon bleu to be a bit more cheesy or smooth in texture. Although it ws crispy and tasty,it reminded me of a chicken cutlet :/...

Moulin Rouge has been one of the colonial bar since the time of British rule, Though their golden days are gone still one can go there to have some time of his own. Not so much full of people,chaos free, a little bit old Calcutta ambiance. Well,lets come to the food. I went there with 4 of my school friends,so was busy with "School days were gold" talk, ordered a beer and two pegs of rum for each and fish fry with mayonnaise,  Then ordered some common dishes, those were good. overall,enjoyed it.
Food- 6/10

A vintage feeling comes to your mind on entering the place.Located in Park Street the place is quite popular.The wall decorations mainly consists of paintings.The seats are cosy,though there is a bit of a space crunch owing to the fact that a lot of tables are accommodated in the restaurant.Coming to food,the food quality is quite good.I went there with my friends and ordered chinese.The staffs are quite helpful.However there is a bit of dust on the walls.A big tv is something which makes the entire place happening as you can enjoy the beer while watching your favourite cricket match.Overall the place is good for chilling with friends.

A nice place with warm hosting can be expected. This place would give you the flavor of old Kolkata. 
Sad to find that they are not able to leverage their position and respect. 
No signature dish, no signature offering. Dim lighting as if this place is only a bar. As far as I'm aware, people around me have a very wrong idea of this place. They feel either it's costly or not meant for them. Young crowd isn't excited to be here. 
I would look for something special as my reason to be here again. 

However, if you are looking for place to eat at a time when other places are full.. Hop in here..like we did.. You will be lucky!!!! :)

The building's facade is like a windmill, much like the Paris nightclub and it's hard to miss, being one of the oldest establishments on the street. However, the food as well as the service have gone south over the years.  The continental is okayish, with the Chicken a la Kiev being among their better offerings. Same goes for the Chicken Tetrazzini. The north Indian is pretty mediocre, and I remember the Biryani tasting very bland. The highlight of their menu is the Tutti Frutti small, which is one of the reasons you keep going back to these old places on Park Street.

The ambiance of this place has deteriorated beyond belief. Looking at the mouldy walls, tattered carpets, dusty seating, bruised dishware and bored staff I couldn't help but weep an invisible tear for the establishment with an ordinary menu that was once a lighthouse in the city's grandest area. 
While the main course tasted alright and went down without a hassle, the shrimp cocktails ordered were made with stale, funny tasting shrimp that wasn't deveined and thus unsurprisingly gave some in our party food poisoning. Kindly check with the staff before placing orders.

Today the food remains good but the crowd had changed and it had become a off colour driving joint at some level which also served you decent food.... This used to be one of the better night clubs type place when my parents were young.... Remember the movie Parineeta..

The first thing i remember about this place was that two cockroaches was busy fighting with each other on the floor.. :P

Just dont wanna ever visit the place. It is horrible.The decor is not upto the mark. The staffs are busy watching the big screen. I ordered crispy chilly babycorn for starters and blenders pride. Well the crispy chilli babycorn was horrible. The menu card for drinks is very confusing. It does not include the brands of whiskey or vodka. It actually says domestic,premium,standard and so on. So when I ordered BP they called it premium .However the taste was exactly like Imperial blue or even worse that that.

The best part was the attitude of the staffs. For ex:- When I asked a staff can you serve the starter quickly.The staff literally told me on my face," Itna jaldi kyu hai bhai."  Hats off to your service.

The tikka kabab was pathetic. which I ordered later.For this kind of food and service I wasted around 2.5k. I was wid a friend of mine. With around 6 to 7 pegs of whiskeys and two starters it actually summed up to 2.5k.

DO NOT VISIT THE PLACE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY.

And to the admin:- YOU NEED TO REPLACE YOUR OLD ANNOYING WAITERS AND BRING BACK NEW FACES. IMPROVE THE DECOR. AND PLEASE STOP USING THE PIANO.

If you go to Park street and find all your favorite restaurants full to their capacity then this can be a decent option of dining. Although I have heard from old timers that this restaurant has lost it's original glory, I found  ambiance was pretty good, food wise they serve good varieties - Indian, chinese, continental. Quality, quantity and service wise it was equally good. In all it is a value for money dining option.

Con: Sometimes  waiters are not happy with the tips amount you pay and they bargain with you.

Moulin Rouge ,a iconic restaurant on Calcuttas Park street cant be missed ,what with its windmill  exterior. It was here that flirtatious Delilah belted out popular numbers in the 1950 and 60s. It was a popular place for the young crowd to relax over oversized beer mugs,Tom Collins,Pinkies and gimlets. Alas all that magics gone and it now is a bit of a dumpy bar which also serves some very ordinary food and sadly one has to say "..best avoided..".

Definitely a good place to grab a bite whilst checking out park street. Above avg. Ambiance but I felt the tables could have had more room for its occupants. The basa fish we ordered wasn't that great but the chicken tetrazzini was definitely worth it. I would recommend any1 checking the place out to order that tetrazzini. Was a bit disappointed though since I couldn't have the infamous mutton lasagna. Overall, the place was a refreshing pit stop and would drop by there again in a heart beat.

Twelve of us went to Moulin Rouge as Bar-B-Q, just adjacent to it was full to its capacity. Surprisingly, Moulin Rouge was almost without any customer, that too on a Sunday afternoon. We felt happy with the thought that we won't have to waste much time looking for other restaurant. But soon realized that it was really a bad decision. The fact that Moulin Rouge was almost without any other customer was its pathetic food. We ordered for Chicken Tandoori, Tom Yum Soup, Mixed Platter Sizzler, Chilli Baby Corn, Noodles and of course, some hard drinks. The chicken tandoori was definitely stale, tasteless and smelly - undoubtedly the worst I ever had. The soup was way too sour. The chicken and prawns used in the sizzlers also demotivated us. The noodles gave us a feeling of chewing rubber bands. Those who didn't take alcohol opted for Fresh Lime Soda, which again turned to be too sweet. The only silver lining was the Chilly Baby Corn which I liked much. Overall, a pathetic dining experience compared to the price.... 

NEVER would I recommend Moulin Rouge to anyone...

A very nice place to eat, with a oriental charm about it. The ambiance is warm, and the place is beautifully decorated. We ordered Vegetable Au Gratin, Hot and Sour Prawn Sizzler and a mocktail, Sunshine. The drink was wonderful, pulpy and just the right amount of sweet. The sizzler was served with rice, which was amazing. The prawns were nicely done, though I would've preferred a little more spicy, as it was a little bland. The Au Gratin was so damn cheesy, and very filling. The service was cordial, and they took the time to explain all the dishes I kept inquiring. The prices are nominal, at par with the other restaurants. All in all, a good place to go.

Terrible service! Simply terrible! That's the first thing that comes to my mind when I sit down to write a review of this place. I went to this place because I had heard it maintains the retro and posh charm of Park Street. It also looked really classy from outside. But once we took our seats, the waiter (who looked like one of those shady men we hear about in seedy bars) kept hovering around us. He wouldn't give us any time to read the menu properly and choose accordingly.The food is of good quality, but there's nothing exceptional about it when you compare it to other continental restaurants on Park Street. After we placed our orders, he kept returning from time to time to get us to order more, or stared from a distance. The end of the tether was reached WHEN HE ASKED IF WE WOULD MIND PAYING FOR OUR FOOD WITHOUT BEING GIVEN THE BILL! We didn't agree. The service tax was also something we were asked to pay by them. I won't recommend this place to ANYONE!

We went there on 1st Jan 15 to have whole roasted turkey preparation. Later we came to know that they were not serving it. We opted for the roasted turkey but to our disappointment, the preparation was cold and definitely not worth of the money they charged. 
Secondly, the service and behavior of waiters were disgusting.  They were even not concerned about serving the water on the tables. 
Lastly, they stopped us for the tips at the end although they charged service tax.

Call me a snob. But I really hated Moulin Rouge. 

I went there the day after Christmas and they were serving the Christmas menu.

I am not too fond of meat these days. But the friend I was with wished to have a duck, which, itself was a bit icky for me.

So anyway, he ordered the duck. I had just a bite and I lost my appetite. It was soggy, undercooked and simply bad. The vegetable sides only had some beans and carrots and 2, count that, two, cherry tomatoes. The fries were barely there. 

The place lacked the vibe. Felt like an old and sick 60's has been restaurant.

Never again going back there. EVER.

Although located in one of the best locations in kolkata. ..This heritage restaurant fails to live up to its legacy. On Christmas. .We were disappointed as they had run out of almost all dishes on the menu...even the Christmas special roast turkey was not there. The worst part of it all is the horrible service rendered by the waiters. To the point of being disrespectful and rude. An absolute no no if you want a mix of elegance, class and superb cuisine.

Ambience: Very simple yet traditional and classy decor. The music is pleasant and lighting is soothing. The waiters are in traditional uniforms. They sometimes have live music playing and in case you are there to celebrate a birthday, they won't mind playing a short "Happy Birthday" instrumental for you. I rate it 3.5/5.

Food: Delicious. Their Chinese and sea food sections are awesome to taste, although they need to improve in the continental section. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Extremely good service. The waiters are mostly older men with very sweet and polite behaviour. They are very attentive and prompt. Speed is medium. I rate it 4/5.

Price: It's one of the affordable and economical restaurants in the Park Street area. Totally worth what they are charging.

Overall, I give it 3.5/5.

Don't be fooled by the name and it's heritage, it was a classy place a long long time ago but now it's just an appalling place. Horrendous service, seedy smelly decor and simply not worth it. If people go there it's probably for the cheap booze or sheer nostalgia. Simply avoid.

Moulin Rouge was a regular Christmas Diner Venue for My Father and Me. I tasted or rather wasted my 1st Lobster there. Now me transforming from lass to dame find this joint which was nothing less than a Fairy Land to me with christmas carols being played over the sax and sizzling ducks adoring the palate....it some how makes me feel like a kid and i enjoy being there simply. If you want to enjoy Good Lobster then Moulin reouge is the place...during christmas they serve array of Duck entrees amongst which Whole Duck roast as you like it is my favourite. Its up to you what sauce would like it to be cooked in but i like their authentic british jus with hint of rosemerry and cranberry with the well cooked succulent duck. A must have is their Fish Fingers with Tarter sauce which is like butter like...all reqady to melt in your mouth with its crisp exterior inviting every bite...and baaam its all gone...like all good things too fast.....I am in love with their perfectly cooked mixed grill sizzler and ludicrously adorned shrimp cocktail. Their Seasonal Nolen Gurer Ice cream is divine.

Again in parineeta who can forget the scene of sexy rekha shaking her legs with the tune of KAISI PAHELI ZINDEGANI...it is again a restaurant of true park street charm....
1.Ambience-it has the ambience typical classic old school park street restaurant which I love the most.
2.Reception-up to the mark
3.Food-again it may not be the beat in the city but worth for a visit.
4.Price-very reasonable
Final verdict just try it once for experiencing the good old Kolkata charm...

Nostalgia & Heritage are two words just right for this restaurant. Mixed with good service & great food.

We usually visit this place for some great Chinese food.

Dishes we specially like over here are Mixed Chowmein, Chilli chicken, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Sweet & Sour Chicken and Fresh Lime Soda with Rock Salt.

A couple of my friends, went today and they were denied alcohol menu,because apparently they were females and could not be served alcohol unless accompanied by a male partner,despite being legal drinking age.This kind of sexist comments is really not expected from a place with such heritage located at the heart of Park Street and puts the name of the entire institution to shame.If the management is reading this,please take note

I never went to Moulin Rouge regularly but dropped down a couple of times - sometimes for a dinner or otherwise for a drink or two - the masala wafers is extremely tasty and satisfying along with a beer on a hot summer day. Their kebabs, especially the mutton sheekh is also quite nice. They keep having festivals on and off - a nice alternative to go to in Park Street for a change from the regular ones.

Heritage meets affordability at this cozy diner bang in the middle of Kolkata's hip Park Street neighborhood! The bar menu offers imported drinks (as well as Indian ones) for a fraction of the cost of the same elsewhere in a comparable facility!
What i loved the most was the very affordable price point at which Moulin Rouge offered me a small peg of my favorite JD No. 7- INR 300 only (500-600 in restaurants in Mumbai, if stocked at all)!
So, next time you want to drink in a great place without encountering the maddening noise that most pubs and bars have come to be associated with- head straight to Moulin Rouge and say cheers!
A word of caution- the starters, particularly the chicken dishes may come across as slightly expensive compared to the remarkably afdordable selection of drinks as mentioned earlier.

Dinner out means Park Street for me and a week back I went to visit Moulin Rouge with my brother. This is one of the oldest places in Park Street and I loved this place(except there was a quarrel between a drunkard and the manager of the restaurant, which was sorted after 30 mins !! It was a relief that they pushed that drunkard out of the place. These are the people who make the name of old restaurants like Moulin Rouge and other famous bars and restaurants bad) .Coming to the ambiance this restaurant is furnished with old furniture . There are two floors in this restaurant (the upper one is for family), dimly lit like other restaurants of Park Street.
Service-- The service of this place is pretty awesome, we wanted to by by card but we din't have go downstairs the attendant made the arrangement of collecting the money and brought the machine to our table. The behavior of the attendant was very good, he was very cordial and we loved it!
Food quality and quantity--->  We ordered Pinnacolada but we were not fortunate enough to get it that day, the ingredients were not available  So , we settled for diquiri , blue heaven and fresh lime soda. Blue heaven was exceptionally good. I liked both the cocktails but diquiri was not made that good. As starter we ordered dry chillie chicken which was exceptionally good. In the main course we ordered Chicken tetrazini and chicken breast sizzler. tetrazini was wonderful but for chicken breast sizzler we din't like the sauce which they served with. Anyhow, the food quantity  was enough. Looking forward to try more dishes out here. A pretty good experience.

This might not be one of the best restaurants on Park Street when it comes to ambiance, but it is definitely delicious and pocket friendly. I have tried Italian, Indian and Chinese at Moulin Rouge and none of them were a disappointment. 

If you are a kind of person who loves Italian cuisine, lasagne and cheese baked vegetable delights are a must have. 
Now I am in a situation where I can order anything at Moulin Rouge rest assured it will turn out to be good. 
The vintage feel of the place and the classic tunes played by the pianist will set your mood for the evening.

Definitely the kind of place to be at if you want to dine and drink ensuring both your pocket and your taste buds are happy in the end.

This classic restaurant situated at park street has a great ambience and lives up to its heritage. The interiors will give u a post independence era kind of feel. Coming to the food, both in terms of quality and quantity, is great! The indian flat breads (kulcha and naans) are amazingly soft and fluffy. The side dishes, be it veg or non veg, simply melts in ur mouth. The gravies in some dishes are rich, smooth and creamy. Their desserts are unique but with very limited options. I better not forget to mention that their vegetarian dishes are equally good and you will find it pleasantly surprising that veg dishes could actually be that good. A dish called "Moti bahaar", its a variant of paneer malai kofta, which is not included in their menu/a-la carte, is worth a try, you have to ask for it separately if you want to try it.
But, after several visits to this place, my recent visits dissapointed me. The restaurant staffs who used to be very courteuos and well mannered, have turned a bit rude. They even go to the length of asking for more tips. The ambience could have been helped with proper ventilation systems cuz it gets really suffocating when its crowded with guests, even worse when most of them are ordering sizzlers. The dining plates often appears not to be washed properly. They also used to rejig their whole a-la carte menu once in a month, sadly they have stopped doing that as well. Since some of the waiters are very old and aged persons, they tend to hear the wrong dish you ask for and are adamant in correcting themselves. This place is best suited for lunches on weekdays. Though the quality of food served during public occassion is equally great, but to avoid dissapointment, its better to visit this place on weekdays when the rush is possibly at its lowest. Prices of the food is a bit on the higher side.
My opinion, this place used to be great once and its on a decline, visit this on a special occassion, try admiring its old world charm and try ignoring the little nitty gritty of this restaurant and most of all, savour the flavour and texture it offers in its foods, let it simmer in ur tummy and memory, live and enjoy the intoxication it gives while eating their foods, afterall, nothing in this world is perfect!! ;)

Moulin Rouge is modelled on a cabaret in Paris, France with the same name.  Moulin Rouge means  Red Mill in French. Pronounced Moolahn Rooz.  The outside is modelled like a red mill. It is situated on Park Street (officially Mother Teresa Sarani), which is a famous thoroughfare in the city of Kolkata. Park Street used to be British Indian elegance personified and the restaurant is part of it.
Continental, Indian and Chinese dishes are available at Prices are reasonable and affordable. Ambience is superb. A nice place for families to dine in.

We originally planned to go to a different restaurant but ended here as the other one was too crowded.

The ambiance was very nice and relaxing with live music playing in the background. There was World Cup screening on a large display which locked down my behind to the table instantly.

The drinks were were not expensive. 130 for a premium beer (650 ml). 
We decided to skip the main course and only go for starters.
We were suggested to try the lobster. It was not on the menu. It was prepared in Continental style and was very delicious.

We had a good time and will definitely visit again when we get back to Kolkatta.

Location: Park Street. 


This restaurant is located on the same stretch as restaurants like Kwality, Olypub and Oasis and is a multi-cuisine.
This restaurant has been one of the most visited ones in my childhood. Every alternate Sunday Dinner meant Moulin Rouge. 

During the earlier years, this place served great quality food and was one of the most crowded places in Park Street, but, sadly it has taken it's downhill route.  
Visited it a couple of weeks back, opted for North Indian, and realized that the food quality that it has to offer is just near to average now. Better quality can be savored at other restaurants in the same price range. 

Dishes that deserve a positive mention include: 
-Dal Makhani. 
-Masala Kulcha. 
-Butter Naan. 

Dishes that deserve a negative mention include: 
-Tandoori Roti (Wasn't made to choice even after being told thrice, was served the same stuff). 
-Paneer Butter Masala (was found to be lacking on flavours and was slightly high on salt). 

The staff out here used to be courteous, but, now have turned to be rude. :-\ 

The prices are inclined towards the high. 

Overall an average experience.

I've been to Moulin Rouge multiple times and i've noticed the quality has been deteriorating rapidly. The only thing nice about Moulin Rouge now is the old fashioned decor, with huge tapestries of cabaret dancers. Occassionally an elderly gentleman plays the piano too, which is lovely. However, the negatives about this place can ruin one's experience. The last time I visited, which was perhaps two weeks ago, I had to request the waiters about four times before they took our order. A Fifa world cup match was on and all the waiters were staring at the screen watching the match and avoiding making eye contact with the customers. Everytime we requested someone to take our order, he pointed at a different waiter saying he would take our order and that next waiter also passed the buck. This was most annoying. Then they brought out a hot bottle of beer, saying they didnt have a chilled one and proceeded to stick the bottle in an ice bucket at our table. My friend ordered a cocktail which was supposed to have strawberry flavouring and champagne. The drink didn't have a drop of champagne in it but only had strawberry crush. It tasted like pulpier roohafza. After we ordered our drinks during last call, the waiter brought our beers and promptly opened them all up saying after last call has been announced, all bottles on the table have to be open! I have never heard this rule in any other restaurant on Park Street. Finally, I have to say the place is overpriced. For example, a pint of beer which costs Rs. 40 in the market costs Rs. 180 here. It's cheaper to order a beer inside Park Hotel!

With so many nice restaurants around Moulin Rouge has not been able to change to keep up with the competition. Yet I enjoyed my time at this place. The food and service are not excellent but passable. The interiors and lighting did not impress me much and I entered on a day with ample of seats hence not giving me a lot of positive vibes but no negative ones either.

One of those old school park street restaurants which would score with me for the 'heritage' factor, but not really the food. I was here this Durga Pujo, and we ordered soup, chicken tetrazzini and pasta. All of it was pretty average, if I consider the hype and the pricing. The restaurant looks impressive from outside and is prominently located, easy to find and quite inviting actually. But really I was a tad disappointed. Furniture is quite old and the decor peeling off at the corners, overall the place is in shambles. The service is slow and cold. And of course the food does not make up for all of the above.

One of the oldest of famous Park Street restaurant. They keep the ambience almost same as it was in time when English ruled our part of the world, including wall painting and frescos. Indian delicacies are best if you visit this place to dine. Serving is average, behaviour not bad. If you are with your friends, it's best to visit moulin rouge's sister restaurant which basically share same kitchen with much less price tag for same item. If you are with your family, you can't opt to go for this place though. Drink costs same as other restaurants around, nothing extraordinary.

Had visited this place during lunch hours . We got a table without any trouble . Ambiance was nice and decor was good . My mom does not like experimenting much so we ordered the basic stuff 
Chilly chicken
Veg fried rice
Veg chow 
Veg Manchurian 
All the items were pretty average . Other joints serve better at the price they charge . Fried rice tastes more like peas pulao as there was excess peas in it. This place should improve on their food quality cause they have a brand they which they have to put up with ...

Luckily we got a chance to sit upstairs in the family section.ordered for chicken breast russian salad and grilled fish. The salad was my past favourite. And it tasted same. But the grilled fish was a pleasant surprise. The best fish prep in my recent past. It was so mouth watering that i had to order once more. Service was cool. Waiter was homely. The ambience is calm n soothing. Its a slowpaced and seems to live in the past memory of British era. Overall a great outing.

Well..it was 'her' birthday and also it was 'Saturday'.. So we had to go somewhere very special but selecting a particular place for dinning is very tricky  in park street.And after a tedious research we voted for Moulin Rouge .( 'the name sounds pretty cool').It was our first time there and we expected a lot .

As soon as we entered a waiter came to our help and guided us to a table upstairs.The view was nice.Then one person approached and asked for order.As we did a little research before it came handy and we ordered Chicken Tetrazzini with Bread Crumbs and one Carlsberg and one brezzer.The service was quick and plates looked clean.clean. Tetrazzini tested nice,prepared with some kind of sauce served over pasta and topped with cheese.It is so good it will melt in your mouth.The ambiance was soothing.We noticed one guy was playing famous english numbers piano and acoustic guitar.We foud it very romantic. :)

A little tip : Sometimes the waiters here will ask for tip and they will continue standing unless you place a few extra bucks inside that leather bill fold wallet.The only 'dark side' I would say.

The food is great, ambience is pretty cool and ofcourse the location is superb, right on park street. Its a pretty old place ane the rush also isn't that high. Resevations are not that necessary. The services though can be improved a lot. The entire staff spends more time chatting Wiith each other rather than attending their guests.
Overall a pretty decent place. The price is pretty standard. Would surely visit again.

Good homely place with a sort of a Victorian era cabaret set scene. Some evenings you will find an old uncle and his friends playing the sax. That was really cool. Food is below average and beer is ok  priced.

This is renowned restaurant since a very long time,and can be easily located on park street due to the huge brightly lit windmill at its entrance. What i found cheesy here was that the waiters beg for more tips,no matter how much you give them initially! So keep less money in the beginning! The service is quite quick though. It's perennially crowded,like other park street biggies.
Ambience 8/10
Apart from the windmill outside,there are spacious interiors with beautiful walls and comfortable seats. There's a separate dining section on the first floor as well.
Food Presentation 8/10
Nothing exceptional. The tetrazzini was served in a normal portion used to serve curry,the chicken bharta came in a handi and keema naans in a basket.
Food Quality 8/10
The spaghetti which we ordered from the Italian section was a fatter version of normal Chinese noodles and tasted no different from Chinese noodles! However,the chicken tetrazzini became the highlight of the day with ample amount of chicken in cheese baked to form a crust on top! This is undoubtedly the best dish here. The bharta was just about average,keema naan was good.
Food Quantity 8/10
Just the right quantity of chicken tetrazzini to fill your tummy. One keema naan is sufficient for two and it is generously stuffed with keema
Cost Effectiveness 7/10
It is a famous restaurant,prices are obviously high,and after paying all the taxes and charges you'll find waiters begging,so better be prepared to face that!
Overall 39/50

I had heard this was a place of heritage, a place which the older generations cherished for the memories it had attached.  But I for one, couldn't be sure which place of heritage had waiters lounging all over. The sad irony of it all was that even the piece of furniture which most obviously proclaimed that this was a place of heritage, the red piano by the entrance, had waiters using it as an armrest. Sofas and chairs were comfortable, if a tad bit in need of maintenance. There goes ambience.
 But the food was really great for the price we paid (INR 800 for 2, including alcohol) Chicken Tetrazzini and Chicken a la Kiev are some great dishes in here. Chicken Tetrazzini is actually baked chicken rolling in liquid cheese and it tastes just like it sounds, delicious. So overall it's a 3 for me. And oh, the waiters tried to slip us a torn note when we didn't tip them to their expectations. Maybe that's heritage.

"MOULIN ROUGE"-one of the most oldest restaurants present in the heart of Kolkata.Ambience is  pretty ordinary , sitting arrangement is quite comfortable . We ordered chicken - a - la - kiev and chicken tetrazzini  .Chicken tetrazzini  was exceptional, chicken - a - la - kiev was unremarkable.the service was not at all upto the mark.There was a lot of goof up among the waiters. But  chicken tetrazzini was the show stealer .please try this one if you are opting to visit Moulin Rouge.

If I had to describe Moulin Rouge in two words,i would just say "shameless waiters". From the start till the end,it was a gala experience till the waiter started begging for more tips in a very rude manner! Does he expect money raining from the pockets of college students? Pathetic! Anyway,coming to the brighter side,this restaurant has been a famous name since ages and the windmill sign is really eye catching. The restaurant is spacious and the seats and couches are quite comfortable. The ambience is nice. Now the food,they serve continental,Italian,North Indian and Chinese cuisines. We touched all the cuisines-chicken tetrazzini from continental, Spaghetti a la Romaina from Chinese, Keema nan,murgh reshmi kebabs and murgh bharta from the Indian options and chilli chicken from Chinese. Chicken Tetrazzini was undoubtedly the best of the lot-chunks of juicy chicken baked with tons of cheese-ah,heavenly! The spaghetti was more like regular noodles with a thin crust of cheese on top-just average i would say. The kebabs were good,though we missed the green chutney here. The keema nan was huge and generously stuffed with minced mutton,you can even have it without any side! The food came quick,no complaints there. Price is slightly on the higher side. Overall,the tetrazzini had tempted me to give this place a 4.5 on 5,but the waiters spoilt it all!

This grand old restaurant with all its heritage and legacy somehow gets overshadowed by the newer more polished fancy restaurants in and around Park street.It was the case with me at least and I had not visited this place for a very very long time until this New Year time.My friend and I saw an advertisement outside this place saying some Turkey and Duck festival was going on.We wasted no time and decided to check it out.

Coming firstly to the food,Moulin Rouge I must say has maintained the quality of food quite appreciably.Normally this place has a huge menu offering continental,Indian and Chinese food.But this time when we visited since it was the festive period,they had a very limited yet compact menu.We ordered a Slice Grilled Turkey and a Whole Grilled Bhetki in white sauce and some drinks to go with the food.The Grilled Turkey was decent  not extra ordinary.We were a bit disappointed at the quantity of the Turkey which  was actually quite less.Our disappointment was quite obvious because we had actually visited attracted by the advertisement of the Turkey food festival.But our disappointment was made up by the Grilled Bhetki and the fact that a glass of wine accompanied the Turkey.The Grilled Bhetki was absolutely delightful.The fish was fresh and cooked to perfection.The white sauce was really cheesy and creamy and thick.The quantity too was very good.

Now coming to the service and the ambience.This is where Moulin Rogue loses out to the newer crop of restaurants.The ambience and decor  is decent but it is not maintained properly.The service is quite poor.The waiters are not at all courteous.They are busy in their own work and hardly pay any attention to the customers.Yet ironically and inexplicably they end up demanding a hefty tip.The hygiene and cleanliness can also be improved.The prices are moderate and similar or slightly lesser than normal Park street restaurant prices.

In short the iconic Moulin Rogue with all its heritage has maintained the quality of the food but the service and the ambience lacks polish and refinement.For the people of the previous generation who have a soft corner for this place the old Calcutta dining feel makes up for these shortcomings.And for the rest,if you are concerned mostly with the quality of the food and not fussy about ambience and service,this place is surely worth a try because of its legacy and also because it promises a somewhat different experience.

What is the first thing about a place that strikes a note and makes an impression?
It's name!
The name Moulin Rouge definitely paints a flamboyant picture in your mind, a picture that lasts till you go inside.
Don't get me wrong though, my review is solely based on my experience last Saturday when I happened to be in Park Street and decided to grab a quick beer before heading home. As I said, names can often be misleading this place is not what it sounds like. This is a family restaurant and I was the only bloke who was sitting at the bar (a rather small one at that) while the bartender was busy watching a reality show on the TV. Nevertheless, I ordered a beer which was served with complimentary "snacks" (read cheese bits).  As I was pretty disappointed with the entire setup, I did not order anything else and focussed on finishing my beer. Now here is the shocking part. When I asked them if they had a smoking zone, they told me that I need to smoke outside (which is normal). But when I got up, they asked me to pay the bill first before I could go out (my beer wasn't finished)! It was an outrageous behavior and I asked for the manager and was nonchalantly  informed that he was busy. Also, one of the waiters told me that he felt that there is a probability that people would go out for a smoke and would leave without paying their bills! I mean, imagine a waiter (a group of waiters to be precise) suspecting a customer of doing something which is a figment of their foolish imagination! Needless to say, I loathed their incompetence, immediately paid the bill and got the hell out of there.
Now, people say, this place is very old and they have childhood memories (and therefore they can be biased), but see, I am not from Kolkata, and for me, therefore, it was quite a disappointing experience.
As I mentioned, my review here is based solely on the (in)hospitality of the staff and not a reflection on the quality of food or beverages, but yes. I will definitely not go back to try them out either.

There is not much to say about this restaurant, the name it self carry a legacy for so many years. I got a chance to visit there twice once with friends and once with family. The 3 things we look into a quality restaurant is 
1. Ambiance :- 4 out of 5
2. Service :- 3 or 3.5 out of 5
3. Food :- 4 out of 5 
the interior part is designed like old heritage restaurant culture of Kolkata, and the ambiance is very nice. The service was quite good, we got the food right in time. The food was really nice, we have ordered Chicken Tetrazinni, Murg Tikka, Keema Naan and Masala Kulcha. 
1. Chicken Tetrazinni- was really awesome, the chicken was perfectly tendered and baked upto the amount that the juiciness of it was entact.
2. Murg Tikka- I personally like a little bit spicy food so I give it a try and it didn't let me go down. The chicken was soft and little extra spicy.
3. Keema Naan and Masala Kulcha- Both the kulcha and nun was so soft that it just melt in my mouth, but I personally like the keema Naan more, though the kulcha was equally good.
All over experience was very nice. So I personally suggest all food lovers to give it a try. Thank you.

An old place, but redecorated quite nicely...service is slow, but the waiters are quite polite..
To come to the food we ordered..the fried prawn that we ordered as starters was bad..it had small pieces of prawn n too much of batter..so one could taste only the cornflour batter in the beginning..the soup was not bad..
In themain course, we had chicken steak which was quite good, grilled duck which was quite tender but could have had a bit more flavour.. Apart from that we ordered the chicken breast with Russian salad..that was quite tasty.
For dessert we ordered tuti fruti n nolen gurer ice cream. They were good but the tuti fruti could have had a bit more fruits in it..
So on the whole I would say an average experience.

Visited this place yesterday with my friends. All I can say is that the place is pathetic in terms of its food or service. We ordered chicken hakka noodles and after waiting an hour were served mixed hakka noodles. After complaining 5 times was our order corrected and on top of that the waiter had the audacity to "demand" a tip. Definitely a thumbs down from me.

I went there on the eve of 18th dec'13 and my experience was pathetic! The interiors are nothing great and the food isnt delicious at all! We ordered Blue Heaven and Pina Colada in cocktails and a full tandoori chicken! I must say that I have had better tandoori chicken than this even in various road side dhabas! the chicken was not tender at all and we actually had to leave the fork aside and tore the pieces with hands to grab a bite! The taste of the starter didnt let us order the main course and we left having these only! But the worst part is that while we were coming back after paying our bill, the waiters directly asked for tip! this is something which is a biggest turn-off for any restaurant. Although it is situated in the entertainment hub of Kolkata, Part Street, still I didnr find anything special about this place! I am surely not going there anymore in my life!

park street is a well defined landmark in the foodies map of kolkata.  anybody who is choosy about what they eat, must have visited this grand old pioneer restaurant at 31, Park street.
i am visiting this restaurant since my early childhood days , accompanying my parents for weekend eatingouts. though at that time i had no sense of food,but still i was fond of MOULIN ROUGE,may be due to the way it pronounced. 
            Then some how , MOULIN ROUGE somehow got lost in mind with so many upcoming restaurants in different places serving world cuisine. This festive season, suddenly while walking across park street, i noticed this red neon with the windmill and had a craving for revisit my memories.


Through the small entrance we enter a huge restaurant,warmly welcomed by the staff. now dining at moulin rouge is an old calcutta experience and it doesnot need cozy sitting arrangements, fine cutlery set or fancy decor. it has a good ambiance with staffs serving people in their own old fancy style for decades. it has its own style of taking orders, servings and demanding tips. now anybody who is only accustomed to the new kolkata-era fancy restaurants will definitely dislike their style but it remained the same since the old time with the people who serves in and the regular patrons here. 
The staff taking order is well dressed in black suit and is thoroughly updated about the availability of the kitchen and a efficient effortless guide through the menu.

The food menu is differentiated into Continental , North Indian, Chinese and is sub-sectioned in appetizers ,soups, fish, poultry, italian ,with a huge list in every part .  The bar lists a lot of alcohol but some of the higher end  scotches were not available,which narrows down the choice to limited brands. 
we ordered
1. chicken tetrazeni
2.chicken scillian
3.vegetable canaloni

the chicken were fresh. soft and cooked flawlessly. the baked chicken was optimally baked and poured with molten butter.
this chicken scillian is a must try for everybody. quantity is quite less and a dish is optimum for a single person. but quality is still keeps their head high in the continental food world.
 a word of caution - the extra cheese and butter will definitely add extra fat and will higher your cholesterol  and LDL.

do keep the tip amount ready ,as the waiter will simply stand beside you,still you give them their tips.

Great ambience, good comfy seating and average food...polite but inefficient waiters. Everybody's looking for tips here...nothing else... The waiters would not serve you even water and are always in a hurry to take away your plates. That annoyed me a lot. I am half done with a dish and they throw in a bowl of warm water with a piece of lime. Its like they want us to leave , which is, to my utter surprise, an attitude problem, given the place is half empty. Amazingly hilarious. To add to it I had a friend with me who was from Australia and imagine the audacity of the waiter when he stood firm asking for some tips. When I told him that the service tax was included in the bill so he had already got his tip money (he didnt deserve any though), he retorted that it goes to the government and not to them. Such incourteous behaviour is highly undesirable. And to add to it, he was complaining that to the fellow waiters who were eyeing us. The 22 inch LCD at the vague end of the restaurant doesn't make sense either. You cannot view a single morsel on it. The piano near the enntrance is a resting place for the waiters. It should have been  preserved well enough for it to be an attraction rather than the arm rest of the waiters. The food is tasty but is too oily for my liking. The rice is nice and huge quantity is served. A request to all the foodies out there, please do not tip the waiters at restaurants where you pay service tax. It only heightens the expectations of the waiters. Extremely unhappy with the people here. Would think twice before going here. A lot more is expected ffrom a legacy restaurant like Moulin Rogue. (more than the windmill they have maintained for decades)

It is one of the oldest restaurants in the city, certainly the first ever restaurant I visited. Moulin Rouge is reminiscent of the Raj era. The ambience, the buzz, the food everything takes you back to that era. A flow of nostalgia...

We ordered Grilled Crab, Stir Fried Chicken and a glass of scotch each. 

The crab stole the show, it was fresh, properly grilled. The crab meat was soft and moist, had tonnes of flavours straight from the sea. A perfect compliment to our scotch.
Next we had the stir fried chicken,  a spicy affair, the chicken was soft and succulent. The spices and the herbs packed the right combination in terms of flavour and bowled us over. A treat for the taste buds.

Over all, an amazing place that makes you feel lost in the sands of time. A lot may have changed in and around park street, but moulin rouge is still the same.

Moulin Rouge, one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata is known for its hip ambiance. I was accompanied by my friends. We wanted to try their all duck items but we controlled our wild gourmand desires and settled for some crunchy chilly Duck in hot garlic sauce as a starter. It was too good and 'us', poor hungry people finished it up quickly. Next item we tried was 'Duck Do Piaza'. Although its taste very good but it has lots of bone. The final item we ordered was 'Chicken Steak'. Their 'Chicken Steak' is simply awesome, absolutely melts in your mouth. The quality of food is decent and the pricing is just about perfect. The staffs are cordial and well behaved with a smile on their face. I would definitely suggest all of you to come here and have some fun.

It is one of the oldest restaurants in the city, certainly the first ever restaurant I visited. Moulin Rouge is reminiscent of the Raj era. The ambience, the buzz, the food everything takes you back to that era. A flow of nostalgia...

We ordered Grilled Crab, Stir Fried Chicken and a glass of scotch each. 

The crab stole the show, it was fresh, properly grilled. The crab meat was soft and moist, had tonnes of flavours straight from the sea. A perfect compliment to our scotch.
Next we had the stir fried chicken,  a spicy affair, the chicken was soft and succulent. The spices and the herbs packed the right combination in terms of flavour and bowled us over. A treat for the taste buds.

Over all, an amazing place that makes you feel lost in the sands of time. A lot may have changed in and around park street, but moulin rouge is still the same.

Moulin Rouge, one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata is known for its hip ambiance. I was accompanied by my friends. We wanted to try their all duck items but we controlled our wild gourmand desires and settled for some crunchy chilly Duck in hot garlic sauce as a starter. It was too good and 'us', poor hungry people finished it up quickly. Next item we tried was 'Duck Do Piaza'. Although its taste very good but it has lots of bone. The final item we ordered was 'Chicken Steak'. Their 'Chicken Steak' is simply awesome, absolutely melts in your mouth. The quality of food is decent and the pricing is just about perfect. The staffs are cordial and well behaved with a smile on their face. I would definitely suggest all of you to come here and have some fun.

The glorious past of kolkata.... the first city in india  to actually have a night life... Moulin Rouge, has so many memories.... we as children always wondered what it meant, what went aroung there....many of us who are 30 + now have had our first beer at Moulin Rouge.... what i like the most about this place is the sheer nostalgia... 

Blue Fox, Magnolia , Trincas, Mocambo, Oly pub and Moulin Rouge hold a very important place in the history of kolkata gastronomy ... these are the restaurants which actually taught kolkata to eat continental food.... Making what they used to call the Brown Sahib.... 

Thankfully not much as changed here... its still as awesome as it used to be.... cant say i hav eaten much here.... but yes drunk a lot of beer for sure...   regular orders used to be chili fish.... fish finger.... and roast chicken .... and if i go  i am sure to have the same again ...

the staff had always been the SALAAM SAAB kings.... and like to please the people coming.... need to visit again soon.... a lot of nostalgia awaits ..

'Moulin Rouge' has always been an iconic restaurant in Kolkata & their standard has been surprisingly consistent through the years. The quality of food is decent, especially the continental dishes but their indian & chinese items are also good enough. Only complaint, their shrimps are not cleaned (deveined) properly most of the times.

Last Friday evening, and we were in Park Street after a hectic week, as usual. This time we decided to give our usual haunts a pass, and headed straight for the iconic windmill, Moulin Rouge. As I entered I half expected to see a raised platform with a lady swooning to music. Though there was none of that, the staff were extraordinarily polite, courteous and attentive. The seats were cosy and relaxing.

As we were seated, we ordered for our drinks. Whisky for him, a cocktail for me, and we settled in for the rest of the evening. We left it to the staff for their suggestions, and we were served French Fries, Stir Fried Chicken, Fish Brochettes and Hot Dry Meat Curry as starters to go down with our drinks. All the dishes were tasty and in good proportions. The Meat Curry was made to perfection. The fish was made in a spicy tomato gravy, and was succulent and juicy.

After relaxing for long, it was time for the main course. We ordered the Mixed Grill Sizzler (Mutton, Chicken, Fish, Prawns and Egg served with veggies). The sizzler was well made. With hardly any space left in our tummies, we decided to give dessert a pass. The meal came to around Rs. 2,300/- and considering the really relaxing evening we had, was worth every penny.

With its iconic Windmill sign in the front, its difficult to miss Moulin Rouge when you're in Park Street. My friend and I were trying out all the restaurants in the area and decided to give this place a try even though we didn't have a pocketfull of money. The place looked good, the waiters guided us to our seats. I, for one thought we would be short of money and was reluctant to stay. Nevertheless, we ordered chinese. The food was good and us, poor hungry people finished it up quick. I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came. Would visit this place again for a more elaborate meal. One of the oldest restaurants in Park Street, it has surely not lost its charm.

I love this place and it's situated in the heart of Kolkata at 'Park Street'. The ambience is quite unique and stylish though yes it's very cramped up and most of the time it remains crowded. It gives you a feel of ancient English pub with suitable lighting. 
The staff are cordial and well behaved with a smile on their face. The pricing is just about perfect, neither too high nor too low. I love their north Indian section the most. Their butter nan is simply awesome, absolutely melts in your mouth. 
Overall whenever I come here I was love my meal and feel happy from inside. I rate it 4 and feel it truly deserves such high rating. I would definitely suggest all of you to come here and am sure you would want to come here quite often.

I think this is one of the oldest restaurants in Park Street. Ambience is good and staff are friendly. Prices are also quite reasonable. I like their asparagus soup, prawn wafers, grilled fish and chicken sicillian as starters. their italian section is also very good with pizzas and spaghettis. In italian section I love their Spaghetti alla milanese and Pizza Nepolian. In their indian section I love their Chicken reshmi Kebab, chicken tikka and chicken tandoori.
Overall, a good restaurant. I would rate 3.5 for Moulin Rouge.

The magic of Moulin Rouge- just enjoy it!
3.5 out of 5

When you think of the old restaurants in Kolkata the name of Moulin Rouge crops up in your mind time and again. Moulin Rouge, one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata is known for its hip ambience. The light music playing in the background, the tantalizing aroma of the food and the monotonous humming of the customers- all combine to create a truly entrancing ambience. Eating at Moulin Rouge was like a dream come true in its hey days. I have been past Moulin Rouge many times and always yearned to eat here. The colourful entrance (decorated with flashing red LEDs) always welcomed me. It was only a few months ago that I actually got to dine there. 

Accompanied by a friend of mine, I reached this restaurant on a particular Sunday evening. I was quite impressed by the way we were welcomed inside the restaurant - good service. Once inside, we were shown our table by a friendly waiter. I was quite impressed by its artful decor and cool ambience. 

Next, it was our turn to order our dinner. Moulin Rouge offers a whole range of lip smacking delicacies and I'll not be surprised if you get utterly confused while choosing your items. We were totally confused, wanting to taste all the delicacies listed on the menu. Nevertheless, we controlled our wild gourmand desires and settled for some fish mayonnaise (poached fish covered with mayonnaise and served on bed of Russian salad) as a starter and asparagus soup. For our main course, we settled for grilled crab, chicken casserole (a unique preparation of chicken and vegetable cooked in white sauce), and chicken a-la-Kiev (a lip smacking preparation of fried chicken breast stuffed with butter, mushroom - my absolute favourite!).   

Moulin Rouge also offers a wide variety of Indian delicacies, but we decided to go in for its Continental preparations. After a sumptuous meal, we had chocolate mousse which was simply yummy! Eating at Moulin Rouge can be an expensive affair with a meal for two costing about Rs.1300 (extra if you have alcohol). Nevertheless, this is one of the better restaurants in Kolkata that has retained its old colours even today.

designed after the iconic moulin rouge of paris, this restaurant provides an interesting landmark in kolkata's food capital,park street. but apart from this exuberance outside,moulin rouge fails to impress its customers.even the decor inside is a big letdown.the only thing you can look forward to is authentic chinese and some continental food.the staff arent that congenial,but when they do manage to serve your heart's desire,its not that bad.its an average park street dining,with the hint of pomp and show,and a memory that lingers. a visit or two would suffice to pacify your curiosity.

Once upon a time, there was a place called Moulin Rouge which used to be a young girl's dream. Her father would tell her stories about the place and amazing food, and a lot of other things, right down to the windmill sign in the front. He would tell her about the prawn mayonnaise and Chicken Cordon Bleu and a lot other things which she sampled the first time when she turned 8. 

And she loved every bit of it. 

Years later, she returned, armed with a handbag full of money and a willing partner, and dined there again.

It also took the waiters about 10 minutes to notice them, before that, three of them stood chatting on one side, glancing at the poor, hungry, ready-to-order people, and no one came to fill water glasses, or ask them if they would like something to drink. In short, they were ignored for that time. Then the order was placed. It took the first course 20 minutes to appear, and the second one came in 20 minutes after that.  

The food was... average. The chicken cordon bleu was oversalted and smacked of processed cheese. The mixed grill was oversalted too. The prawn mayonnaise was cold and delicious though. 

So no, no prizes Moulin Rouge.

I used to have a good opinion on this resturant. the food is good. but the service that i and my friends got on the 25th dec , 2012 was very pathetic. we had to call them again and again to place the orders. they food was served very badly. at last when we were finished they started to tell us the amount. they wanted us to hand over the money to them and leave. no bills. but we insist on the bills. after several minutes they gave us the bills. the service tax was already there like any other resturants. and i always give some tips. since the service was really bad i didn't feel like giving any tips. and believe it or not they asked for the tips. they told us that the service tax is not for them and as they have served us so its our duty to give them some tips.
i never thought that in such a good resturant the waiters will fight over the tips after the service they have provided.
i think the management should get rid of this kind of waiters who are determined to lower the reputaion of the resturant.

Ambience is normal..ain't that remarkable or something to talk about. Price is way above as its located at heart of park street..but quality int that spl. My suggestion walk just 100m ahead to find Bar-b-que restaurant.

It is in Park Street. It is ornate and chic. And it smells of the old Calcutta. Though the live 'singers' dont enthrall the anymore, the live music, especially the saxophone and piano kind of sets the mood for a musical dining experience. The thing with Moulin Rouge is that, its spacious, its designed perfectly, and the hospitality is pretty commendable. But, when it comes to food choose right. There is Indian cuisine and continental. The Indian portion is pretty much same. Nothing 'oh so great' about it. Yet, the continental offerings are extremely satiating for the taste buds. The sizzlers are the smackers out here and you should try them out at least once! The price range is high indeed, but which fine dining comes cheap? So, go to Moulin Rouge if you need to spend some really good time lazing with park street, food and all that jazz!

Moulin Rouge, a well place for food lovers, although doesn't have anything that could take you to it for the second time. Foods are very common, and it is not nourished and prepared with specialty. Good to see that old peoples are serving. They are mannered and well dressed but has little knowledge about food and recipe.

Prices are okay but ambiance needs revamp. I would rather refer another one.

May i disagree to agree with the scores of negetive coments on this 70 year old heart throb of night life of Kolkata. I went there, & i was really amazed. The ornate walls, the chandelier, the live piano & the seating araangement is so much reminiscent of an era go by. Ordered Mutton Lasagne for myself & a chicken steak sizzler for my friend. Lasagna to be precise was more a heavenly experience than i could have ever imagined, ditto for the sizzler. the most important thing is that these guys really know how to make a chicken breast steak in sauce.& the oozing cheese in my lasagna, scalding hot, in my mouth really set the evening in motion. I really loved the place. But please ignore the waiters. they have seen many a winters over their faces, now that they are slow to react. But sure was an evening worth remembering

Rating it average only because the crab chilly was yum. Rest am flabbergasted cos as we entered the place,the waiters were all pumped  up  to serve but alas aint the case once you  are seated. We had 2 keep reminding them of our orders and not to forget the  unavailability  of the most  basic dishes. So we always had to re-place the order...sigh!! Donno if such is the case in places telecasting the IPL, but here the waiters forgot to serve us cos they  were  glued  to the screen and we had to keep on shouting and tell them to serve .It was like banging my head on  the wall.......Waiters were like zombies  super slow  in every aspect(mind  and body ), even for ice we had to remind them  constantly, i wonder  hw  hard it is to get the drink n ice together esp.wen the  kitchen was located  on the ground  floor..-.lack of common sense..gosh!! They also lacked basic drink glasses so  dont expect any posh treat or better expect an ordinary or abnormal treat.   
However  with regard to  the price,i thought it was reasonable but that  should be the case with all these demerits. If it was over  rated as most restaurants in  park  street are  it would prick us more. But whatever may be the case i wont be going there again cos i really don have the required patience for a bunch of  turtles.

Moulin Rouge! the quaint exterior was too much to resist so we went in for a late lunch - and were glad we chose to come here. Quaint interior as well... ornate ceiling, huge chandelier, silverware, two huge paintings - (Paris, where else?), a piano, plants, comfortable furniture, and a gracious maitre d'hotel... . The only two things I felt  were out of character were the aquarium and the modern TV screen showing a tennis match that clearly no one was really interested in. Though there must have been other paintings, years ago, the spaces were camouflaged with red and gold lacquer. I thought the crucifix with a marigold garland on the main door was a nice quirk. 

The food, served on silver, was good - while my husband had tomato soup followed by fish, I had shrimp cocktail followed by duck - all served with great care and tasted just YUM! Dessert was nolen gurer ice cream which was truly delicious.

The maitre d'hotel told us that on Saturday and Sunday evenings from 8 to 10, there was live music provided by saxophone and piano. It sounded so charming and so in character with the restaurant!

Points I noted were that there were only two waiters who seemed run off their feet. The shrimp cockatil, though cold, should have been chilled, and the bread rolls we'd wanted with the soup, came with the main meal - all harmless in the light of the lovely relaxing time we had.

Park Street does seem to be reviving!!! Cheers!!!

Though there must have been other paintings, years ago, the spaces were camouflaged with red and gold lacquer. I thought the crucifix with a marigold garland on the main door was a nice quirk. 

The food, served on silver, was good - while my husband had tomato soup followed by fish, I had shrimp cocktail followed by duck - all served with great care and tasted just YUM! Dessert was nolen gurer ice cream which was truly delicious.

The maitre d'hotel told us that on Saturday and Sunday evenings from 8 to 10, there was live music provided by saxophone and piano. It sounded so charming and so in character with the restaurant!

Points I noted were that there were only two waiters who seemed run off their feet. The shrimp cockatil, though cold, should have been chilled, and the bread rolls we'd wanted with the soup, came with the main meal - all harmless in the light of the lovely relaxing time we had.

Park Street does seem to be reviving!!! Cheers!!!

Well this is the place which used to be my favourite during my childhood days and today also its my favourite place to dine out with friends and family.I am basically in love with the interiors of this place which has  almost remained the same in the years...You look up to view a large room with a number of tables all over the place in a picasso-ish arrangement that would require at least a post-graduate in modern art to understand.The walls depict paintings of the can-can - though the music is definitely not can-canish. It's audible but the constant chatter of the bhadralok out for a well deserved drink and meal tend to push it to the background.
Well some of my favoutites from the menu which i can suggest everyone should try are
1.MURG IRANI
2.PANEER SHASHLIK
3.PANEER PASANDA

Mixed up, confused, mystified, befuddled. Questions torrent through your brain - is it a bar or a restaurant, 50's or 90's, young or old, upper class or down market, can-can or waltz. What hits first is the red and blue carpet (contrast, contrast and even more contrast) that must have been the toast of the town when my dad was the life and soul of the party in the 70's. You look up to view a large room with a number of tables all over the place in a picasso-ish arrangement that would require at least a post-graduate in modern art to understand. The huge glass chandelier sets a hindi movie ambience to the place - you can almost imagine Rajendar Kumar (lipstick and all) romancing Saira Banu under the glittering lights - no one can complain that the place is dingy.

The walls depict paintings of the can-can - though the music is definitely not can-canish. It's audible but the constant chatter of the bhadralok out for a well deserved drink and meal (with family) tend to push it to the background. The pitter-patter of little feet and the sounds of grandmothers pouring discreet tumblers of chilled beer (with ice) prove the fact that MR has moved with the times - sadly no longer the boisterous place it must have been. Richard, the steward, confabulates with our middle class bengali family neighbors recommending appropriate fish delicacies as nonchalantly as he guides us through the extensive cocktail menu. This is not the place to host an MTV grind.
