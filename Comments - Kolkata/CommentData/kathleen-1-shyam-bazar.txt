This outlet is located just near to the Shyambazar Five Point Crossing. So it has a convinient location. ☺

Ambience - It does not have any seating capacity. So that's a drawback.

Food - Quality of food is satisfactory. Should be better. 

Service - It is somewhat quick.

কাজের জন্য প্রায়ই সামনে দিয়ে যেতে হয় । পকেটে চাপ কম দিয়ে পেট ভরাতে চাইলে যথার্থ জায়গা । তবে আগের স্বাদ এবং মান কোন টাই নেই । চিকেন ৬৫ পছন্দের খাবার ।

Had a chicken 65 roll. I generally prefer mio amore's 65 roll. It was not bad. The best part was it was fresh and size was large. Overall a good experience.

This Kathleen outlet is located at Shyambazar , is quite spacious with quick service .

Tried choco tart , puffs and chicken pizza . Choco tart was fresh, soft. Puffs were tasty. Chicken pizza was cheesy but a bit stale.

Pocket pinch is ok.

Overall a nice experience .

Kathleen has so many outlets in kolkata.There are so many bakery shops in kolkata.But some are too costly and some are too cheap.Cheap one provides cheap quality pastries and costly one provides expensive very expensive pastry.REcently I visited kathleen which is located near Girish Ghosh residence near Baghbazar..Its ambience was just ok an medium size shop. We purchased a chocolate pastry, pizza, puffs etc.Pastry was soft and cream was yummy to eat.Pizzas were quite fulfilling and tasty.Their cheese were extremely good.Puffs were very tasty too.AIr condition was also working great .It was itself so relaxing .We also took few bread packs.breads were quite soft and tasty to eat. Price of the pastry, breads, pizza were so pocket friendly.One can easily go every weekend and enjoy the pastries there.Absolutely value for money.

This store is located near Girish Avenue. I had their Rum balls, Choco Duet both were average quality.
Also tried their Chicken Burger and Chicken Patis which didn't strike anything then average.

This Kathleen is quite prominent and is located near the Girish Ghosh residence and beside the Khawab, Shyam bazaar outlet. The outlet is quite spacious and has couple of small stools for sitting. The place is easy to locate for its huge name board and is quite a savior when you need to have a quick bite, have very little time to spare or maybe when your purse is not very heavy. Perfect joint to enjoy some cakes, pastries, with light snacks and a bottle of soft drinks maybe. The ambiance is pretty much like other Kathleen outlets with all the items displayed in front of you from where you can choose and pick. 

When I was at this outlet I ordered for a Chicken parcel, Choco waves cake and a small can of Sprite for myself. The Chicken parcel as they said was very fresh which I agreed to after having a bite, at INR 35 it was quite filling as well. The chicken filling was quite generous and flavorful. The Choco Waves pastry was nice but could have been bit more fresh I guess. I washed all these down with a can chilled sprite and overall it was a nice and fast meal for much less than INR 100! 

The one thing that I didn’t like is – the person at the counter asked me not to take any pictures inside the store! That was funny, maybe he thought I will steal all the flavors from his food through these pictures of mine, a direct minus 0.5 for this attitude. Apart from this, the experience was pretty okayish. Would rate the place 3 out of 5, at max!

Cheers!

Situated on the right hand side of the road towards central avenue from the five pint this is a place for quick bites. Snacks,pastries and cakes is the usual food available. Nothing more to explain. Its just a casual take away outlet.

Usually, I rate Kathleen confectionery 3.5/5. But I'll add .5 to this outlet just because of the nostalgia associated with this place. I remember going to this place whenever my guardians came to pick me up from school on some special occasion. Even now, whenever we go to school on some special occasions like Independence day or Saraswati Puja, this place is a must visit for us- just to relive those memories again. 
The person who runs this place is super-awesome.
