Quite a nice place. 
Offers you with stomach filling, delicious food at affordable prices. 
Had tried the Naam Prik Noodles,which turned out to be spicy and had tulsi leaves in it. Felt kind of weird to me. However, the spicy chilli pork was delightful and on the contrary, not so spicy. 
For dessert, tried the chocolate rolls which was sumptuous and more than enough for 2 foodies.

PLEASE REMEMBER YOU ARE IN SERVICE INDUSTRY WHERE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT


FIRST LEARN HOW TO BEHAVE AT HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY THEN RUN BUSINESS

Though I'm an old customer ordering foods over phone since last few years know those Old gentleman and Lady husband n wife Proprietor of the restaurant.... was very good at behavior but

Now the situation is different The Behavior of the New person Mr. Alex was highly disgusting and ridiculous as too bad in customer dealings
At present I'm sitting at the restaurant and writing this comment

PLEASE REMEMBER YOU ARE IN SERVICE INDUSTRY WHERE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT

Located at CIT Road, near Anadapalit Bus Stand.
Small restaurant with both Dine in and Take Away facility. The dine in part is small in size, can accommodate around 20persons at a time. Well maintained and air conditioned.
Service is quick but the stuff boy who served us water was not aware of every item in menu card. May be he is new there.
We ordered Chicken American and Â Hunan Choupsey. The choupsey came in two part. Crispy fried noodles in one bowl and Gravy soup in another bowl. Both tastes well but the Hunan variant was too much spicy but tastes well. You can try any of them if you are a fan of Choupsey.
The pricing of each item is low. It cost around 350INR for two items. No vat tax added.
Overall good dining experience.

This is a small place on Cit road and you can oversee it if you dont pay attention. There is not much space very few tables are placed here. They make average chinese food not bad in taste. I have tried their hakka chicken noodles, fish manchurian and chicken steamed momos. All were of average standard. Its a reasonable place.

This place has been there for ages .
I have been there 8-9 years ago and then I parcelled dinner yesterday .
Ambiance is still the same .
Small place with around 20-25 ppl sitting arrangement.
Nothing too elegant and sparkly....it's more towards very simple and shabby looking.
Staffs are very polite .
Serving time : 20 mins for 3 dishes
Packing was simple yet gud .

Now coming to food
We ordered
1. Veg Hakka chowmin
2. Veg fried rice
3. Chicken with and cashew and dry red chilly
The quantity is ample and 2 people cannot finish the above dishes.
Hakka chowmin was not extra oily and tasty
I loved the fried rice more . Veggies were generously given.
The chicken was awsome. Tangy with a hint of sweet and a ample taste of dry red chilly. It was real gud. More over there were big sized 8 pieces of chicken . Coating was not thick and chicken was soft and tender .

Packing : 3.5/5
Ambiance : 2.5/5
Quantity : 5/5
Taste : 4/5 ( chowmin can be better )
Pocket pinch :4.5/5
They also gave us a 600 ml 7up for free....yepii 
The above dishes costed a perfect 400 rs
Over all I am satisfied
Will taste their other dishes and will be soon back with a update .
