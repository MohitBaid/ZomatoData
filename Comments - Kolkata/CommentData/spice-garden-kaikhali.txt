It's a dance bar which has a quite good kitchen. So in the daytime you can have booze and food here peacefully. But after 8pm it takes another body - loud music, crazy people and dancing girls.

Not a good place for hanging out with friends .
Although you will get desire things but certainly not up to the mark .
Ambience was really horrible.They suddenly started some spiritual songs and completely destroyed our evening.

I went to this place for lunch with friends. This looked like a setup for a dance bar. The bar is located on VIP road near B P Poddar Collage. The food was decent and the place was empty during the afternoon hours.

It is located just next to B.P poddar college on vip road.
Basically a place to have some drinks and music,its a dance bar cum restaurant.
And obviously not a place to been with a girl.
We ordered few bottles of beer along with complimentary.
Their kabab platter is good.
If you wanna enjoy ur drinks with dance then visit after 8 -8:30 pm .

Purely a place for booze lovers not so good with the food. Very average located right beside the BP poddar Engineering college easy to locate as its in on VIP road. Food is not that great according to the price. For me a below average place.

The kebab platter is too much delicious.... each & every kebab had it's own beautiful taste.... You should try that specifically... It's nice for couples & particularly at evening...

Visited once with friends. Food was good .surroundings were not good. We had some snacks and after two rounds we left the place. So overall it was not so impressive.

Before I start, I would like to take a moment and mention that the "Spice Garden" for which I am writing this review is not for the one at Kaikhali but for the one located over E.M Bypass, Metropolitan crossing as this one is not present in #Zomato.
Couple of days back, me and one of my colleague visited this place. Honestly speaking, I didn't expect something unforgettable as this is a singing/dance bar cum restaurant and from my past experience, I know very well that this kinda places never prioritize on the quality of food they deliver. However, to my utter astonishment, i hold the couch I was sitting, tight ,after giving the first bite on the dry chilli chicken - it was no way less than many other famous chinese restaurants we often visit. We didn't stop and ended up with having more food than booze. The dry chilli chicken, crispy babycorn, red pepper chicken, chicken tikka kebab, fish finger and few more. All of them were actually very nice and can compete with any proper muticuisine place anyday. The icing on the cake was when the singing started inside, trust me, this place is not filled with voluptuous girls who just go up on stage, music being played goes somewhere, and they travel somewhere else. They really have decent sense of music. One point I would not wanna miss to say that, the price of drinks are bit high, else this is a fair enough place to drop in with ur buddies. Check out the photos.

My visit here was accidental and out of necessity on day when I missed to grab my share of booze with friends on their way. One of them advised us to come here and man, I regretted it.

I mean the place is cramped with tables in a physic manner I'd say and the music is so damn loud that your ear drums would hurt. It basically was a dance bar when I visited and the food is just about average. I wouldn't at all prefer this to anyone cause you'll hate it.

Don't in here for the food..The music is so loud that u can barely hear yourself think..
The deal lies with the Co curricular activities..linked with booze it soothes your nerves . .only go in if u are a bachelor..and any woman of any age is a complete no no..

Another one of those places which you should visit only if you really have to! With the option for restaurant and bars constantly on the rise in VIP Road, it is one place that should be the last resort. Dont even think about it if you are going out with your family!

Your chicken jhaalfarezi man. Oh my god. Was soooo goood. Worst part of this place is your sitting arrangement which is outside and because of that mosquitoes will eat you up. Change it. Thats it.

I visited this place only once and definitely not with an expectation of peaceful dinner but with a partying mood on a Friday evening. To my surprise, they asked me to deposit my bag at a counter outside the restaurant with exchange of a token! I had a feeling like I went to a supermarket not a restaurant. Next came the actual disaster. Inside was almost dark with a lit up small stage where some performers were singing with music instruments. Nobody was dancing; there was no space for dancing but the mode and volume of the musical performance was intolerably loud. It almost cracked my ear membranes. I was extremely hungry and thirsty with no other suitable options around, so, I took a seat and ordered for one plate of dry chilli chicken and a peg of white rum. The dish was not very tasty and of bad quality, only positive being the quantity that somehow managed to bring down my appetite. Rum was served in a normal glass in which water is served. The performers were singing cheap songs of with cheap quality but in that loud volume. I could not enjoy my drink and somehow quickly completed the stuff and came out of that hell. I was almost not able to hear for almost five minutes. Horrible ambiance and bad quality of food. Not recommendable.

Nice place to visit but not with our girl friend or wife...;)..if you know what I mean...

Food is good enough, starters only, alcohol is quite cheaper but the points they need to take care really are the air conditioning and specially, the bathroom!!! God it is a real mess and unfortunately nobody even cares.

Ask the guy in the counter for the specialties.¬† The special dishes are really enjoyable over a glass of whiskey or two.

Out of the various Spice Gardens dispersed across the city , the VIP road branch , IMO , is certainly the best. IStrikingly enough , the food remains almost the same everywhere ! !

Of course , the singers and the disco varies greatly , and by far the VIP road branch remains the best among the lot.

Kebabs , specially the Chicken Tikka and Chicken Reshmi are two superb starters. Preferably , the indian dishes remain superior than the Chinese variants.

For main course , one can safely order Chicken Bharta , Chicken Butter Masala , Mutton Chilli , Kulchas and Nans.

It is a bit difficult at times to make the server understand what exactly is wanted by the guest , because of the loud music , but , the food certainly remains the winner !

Spice Garden was perhaps the first Disco in the surrounding area. It was the first time that people this side got a hang of blaring music, alcohol and a dance floor. The crowd used to be a mixture of oldies and kiddos who would drop in here to get a hang of the Disco culture which they had never experienced before in their life. I remember the dance floor having mirrors where girls and boys used to see their reflection and dance crazily to the music played by the DJ.

Good restaurant cum Bar near the Airport. From 8 pm to Midnight non stop music and dance you can enjoy!! Alcohol is cheap, Quality and and quantity of food is also good. Service is okay. Chinese cuisine is better to try out. Overall ambience and interiors are good. Though people used to smoke inside in the A.C. So for a non smoker it will become a bit uncomfortable.
