This is small fast food joint near Ballygunge railway station or more precisely just beside the Ballygunge bus stand. My kind suggestion is try their egg roll, chicken roll or whatever roll you may want. They make one of the best rolls in this area. Truly best. But never try anything other than rolls. The experience won't be that good then. And this place is super pocket friendly too.

Lovely snake shop. Hungry people always visited this place like after college , school , office etc. Its held near to the ballygunge railway station. Mostly people like chicken tikka roll, beef tikka roll. Peice is reasonable.

An above average take-away roll counter near ballygunge station road, biryani is good here. Golden fast food centre is like grab a roll chalte chalte.

Once I used to be a regular customer here...me and my friends all used to eat here be it rolls or biriyani or kebabs....we all saw how the prices increased and quality of food fell day by day....sadly now its like a shadow of its former self....I no longer visit this place as I can't stand to see how much the place has changed still I would recommend it to people as they always deserve a chance for old times sakes...

This fast food had many memories of mine with my friend having rolls when the price were 12 rs for chicken roll and 14 rs for mutton roll, I am one of the oldest customer of them I think, cooks was changed couple of times but never their taste. I lover their rolls till date. Recently tried also. Very good.
