So this time too a friend was in town and we didn't have too much time to go hunting for places for lunching. This was close to the Airport and since it was raining too, the O Zone was more of a compulsion than a choice. Now the restaurant is on the first floor and we were lead quite cordially to an otherwise completely vacant seating area. I had a feeling that it is one of those places that come alive after dusk as the ambience looked quite jazzy but shut down and also as the service, though polite was very gloomy. What I noticed was that a Sea Food Festival was going on but when asked for the dishes, most of them were unavailable then. Thus, we settled for some Non-vegetarian kebabs. The food was pretty average- not good, neither bad. Just plain average! There's no smoking zone which my friend from Singapore complained about (haha yes!) and the washroom was pretty far off.
So overall the experience was 'meh'!

Been here with some friends. Night life is good. Dance floor is enjoyable and stuffs were cautious. This restaurant is closed for some days under the new guidelines of supreme court.

Hell too much delay serving food...we ordered drums of heaven at 9 pm and got it delivered on table around 9 40..40 minutes for a single dish? sorry guys, not acceptable at all....btw, the dish was very nice and delicious, frustrated with time and ambience so left. One advise, go before 8 pm, when the environment is calm and quiet, experience should be better....

A dance bar which has nothing related to food or drinks... People loves noisy stuff while eating or even drinking fine foe them...Food is awfully bad... N quantity is not for a single person... Not worth at all...

A good place to spend some time on weekend , test is good as well as quality too. Good staff response. I was there on a Saturday night, although it was almost empty due to some issue but I liked the place and enjoyed my lonely time, the stuff who served me was polite and quick in response time. You can spend some light time here after hard working weekdays.

I have been there only once. The venue is really big and spacious. However, like other bar and restaurant on VIP road, You have to bare with very loud bollywood music with musically illiterate men/women singing inside just after the sunset. The food is not that good as predominantly it is a BAR and less a restaurant. rates are bit high (One kingfisher beer bottle used to cost 230 INR). The washrooms are far away from the sitting location. However, the waitors are well-mannered and waiting time for food is not that much.

The place is kind of secluded and the ambience is also not good. The waiters are also not very quick to respond.
I would not recommend this place at all.

This is a very isolated and dull place, the ambience is nice but it's not happening type. The dancing girls and the loud music are nuisance. It's basically a singles place with no one to accompany them for a drink. I didn't find any woman customer there. 

The food is ok, not too delicious or anything, this place needs to gain popularity  so that the customers feel more comfortable.

I do not know how o zone is under zomato. Its a pub and I love the ambience.  The music played. The lights. The couches.  The whole atmosphere.  A small place but very cosy and calm if you are in the mood to party hard worh yiur frnds and hit the floor. Well we have been there twice. A group of friends ofcourse planned this day out where we were all heading for the pub. We feel hungry. Planned to order for some finger food types. Ordered for a mahi hara bhara. Well fish lovers you are ought to get caught in the taste of this dish. Yummy it is. Then we went in for a chilly garlic pepper chicken which was good. Just the normal good standard. But fish harabhara was mind blowing. Then ofcourse we planned to have tequila shots which we actually pulled it pretty well. It was awesome. And the booze is pretty cheap as compared to the other bars in proper kolkata.  So guys bang on, eat, party , live and  dance.
