Great infrastructure with calm, chilly and dark environment. A felts like entering in the middle of a jungle that's why the name is perfectly suited. 
The food taste and quantity is good compare to the price, and the service is also well.

Rotten food is served
All left over food is served
Nobody should visit there
Rude behavior of all the staffs
Don't spend your hard earned money in a shit of a place like this

At a time when the Supreme Court has given an order that all bars should be closed on highways all over the country, how is it that this pathetic hotel cum bar is running on a daily basis when every other bar on VIP Road has been closed from April 1st.

The Govt. Authorities must close this bar to respect & comply the order of the Supreme Court.

Aranyak is located within hotel host international, near to the airport, hence a preferred location for tourists. Food is of good quality & reasonable.

This is an average restaurant situated inside the Host International Hotel on VIP Road near Teghoria taxi stand. The ambiance is nice but the staff behavior is not upto the mark. The food is average.

Aranyak is located inside the Hotel Host International on VIP road. It's a secluded place during the afternoon but things get a bit 'wild' in the night, no pun intended. The tree/jungle decor is very amusing but it is extremely dark inside even during the day. The service & the food are just about ok but drinks are comperatively cheap. All in all it's a good place to enjoy drinks with your friends but it's best avoided on special nights.

Food is below average and the place is crammed down a bit, not enough free space that you expect from places like these. Service is crap, with people constantly asking money, even when you are clearly reluctant for such. Overall a below average experience not one you would expect after seeing the reviews.Â 

A nearby place is the Mehak-e-Punjab bar which has much better ambiance and service and I would recommend people to visit that only.

Have been a frequent visitor to this place. The ambience is sober and the decor is good. The food is tasty and pocket friendly. Good experience over-all.
