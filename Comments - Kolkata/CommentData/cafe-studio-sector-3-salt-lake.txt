What a lovely cafe it is! Situated near the Bengal Tennis Association in sector 3 (Salt Lake),this place is a complete surprise. The coffee was great along with the hot chocolate (hazelnut) we ordered. In main course, Grilled Chicken and Fried Eggs in Mushroom Sauce and Baked Chicken Parmigiana are absolutely memorable. Great coffee along with superbly delicious food,what more does one need? But Cafe Studio offers more in the form of decor and ambience. The decor is beautiful along with good behaviour of the staff. Only con is that it is slightly heavy on your pocket but one can definitely give it a try once in a while. A surprise cafe and eagerly waiting to visit again.

What a wonderful place to be in. Located at walking distance from my office. This place is a breath of fresh air in the crowd of Salt Lake eateries.

Location: IA block, Sector 3 Salt Lake , bang opposite to the Bengal Tennis Association grounds. Very near to Carnival Cinemas .

Decor and Presentation: From the outside, this place comes out as a small cosy eatery , with about seating for 8 people. But once you step in, you will be pleasantly surprised to find the whole place as very large, sapcious and tastefully decorated with murals and wall paintings. I love the seating arrangements and the ambiance.

Food : Who says healthy can't be tasty. We ordered the Oats Risotto with Cherry Tomato's in Pesto Sauce . It was beyond any expectations. Oats could actually be a delicacy is a surprise.

The Tex Mex Chicken Sandwich: Grilled Pita bread enveloping juliennes of shredded chicken with Pesto Sauce with a serving of French fries and Salad. This is how good healthy food can be.

Sinful Walnut Brownies: After a series of healthy food , a little indulgence is always allowed. This is one of the BEST Walnut Brownies. The best in Saltlake hands down. I am sure I haven't tasted better Walnut brownies. Chunks of walnut in every bite and oh so sinful chocolate. This is heaven.

A big shout-out to our server for the evening Bidhan. He was courteous enough to offer us a complimentary chocolate ice cream bowl. Thanks k you so much for the experience. Will be back before you know it.

Food: 4.8/5
Decor and Presentation: 4/5

A cozy little café right opposite the Salt Lake stadium, Tennis Academy. They have the most helpful staff. The coffee tastes better than at Barista or CCD. Trust me I have had coffee at all these places. The Old Fashioned Egg and Chicken Salad is healthy and tasty. They give good value for your money in quality and quantity. Bidhan and Abhijit and the others are always greeting you with a cheerful smile ready to attend to the customers.
Simply put Café Studio serves the best coffee and ambience this side of the city.

Easy to locate, opposite to BTA and saltlake stadium gate 2, situated on the main road. Its quite big with high numbers of sitting capacity. But when we visited, it was completely empty. We wanted to order milk tea, which was unavailable. They said, they can provide black tea with separate milk but can’t serve proper Assam milk tea. So we decided to have darjeeling tea which was average.  As we were already full, we just ordered french fries, which was good. We couldn’t taste much food here, but we felt this is just a new specious cafe, with good decoration, nothing much more than that. Service is not that great too! Moderately pricey.

Just opposite to the Bengal tennis association,this is a relatively new joint.The decor is chique and the service quick.We ordered the crispy chilli chicken which wasnt something very special.But the main course of lasagna and grilled chicken with brown rice was quite good.Overall the prices are reasonable enough and u can come and spend a good hour or two relaxing and enjoying their continental choices.

Location: Opposite Bengal Tennis Association in Salt Lake, 2nd gate of Salt Lake stadium.

This is a relatively new cafe and we landed up here after getting no space in Calcutta 64.

It is a very well decorated cafe with a good mix of Colors, funky walls with nicely done drawings.

The seats are tad small and lack back rest.

Coming to the food, they have all the cafe favourites but with a healthy touch to it.

We ordered pepper tossed fish, chicken quasedila hot chocolate, tiramisu shake and grilled chicken.

The fish was okayish and the quasedila was not great, but just good.

The tiramisu shake tasted like syrup.

The hot chocolate though was heavenly, awesome taste!!

Shockingly they have just one staff to serve and we're so slow that we did not get our grilled chicken and had to cancel the order!!

Need to hire some more staff, and be more organised.

Some more work is required on the food taste as well.

Presentation wise they are doing well.

Pocket pinch is pretty affordable too.

Decor and ambience :
Thumbs up for the decor. The setup is cute and really impressive. They have books and few board games.
The clock on the wall is the main attraction.
Food :
We had chicken bruschetta, wok tossed pepper salt fish, Singaporean chicken and egg noodles, risotto quinoa and pan fried chilli chicken. Among desserts we had walnut brownies and coffee praline parfait.
Taste was okay but the service was quite slow. Must have is walnut brownie and risotto. Taste can be improved a little for better experience.
Budget :
Won't pinch your pocket much. It's a cute new place in saltlake and worth trying too.

Favorite place in Salt Lake.  Great care with ingredients, very delicious, healthy and tasty food.  My baby daughter is in love with the Quinoa risotto.

The menu is very creative and large and have not tried a single thing I have not enjoyed yet. Prices are fair considering the quality of ingredients they are using.

Service is excellent, everyone is very kind and flexible for special needs.

Last, its very clean and cozy!  Wonderful little haven if you need to escape the stadium mobs.

So visited this new place called Cafe Studio in Salt Lake with few foodie friends and really loved the overall experience 😊
For starters we had Bruschetta Pesto Olive Melt and Chickpea Kibbeh with Tzatziki dip which tastes great .
For main course we had Potato Roestie and Soba Noodles which were quite flavourful .
We had some mocktails out of which my favourite was berry berry good which was basically a berry smoothie .
For dessert we had Chocolate and Orange Indulgence which was absolutely delicious.
All in all had a great time and would surely recommend this place to anyone who is looking forward to having healthy food at a really cool cafe !

The only good things about this cafe are the pastel coloured walls, the courteous and sincere employees and the ambitious menu. The real deal, however, is as average as it can get. The Pizza al Funghi (thin crust, really?) & the watery and deadly sweet Hazelnut Hot Chocolate were the worst of the lot on our order and dipping even below was the Tiramisu Shake (some flavour with yogurt and milk). The only saving grace was the burritos. As for the music, the playlist really really needs to be redone completely - you just ruin the soothing ambiance with Aashiqui 2 and such albums, guys (try jazz). The cafe scene in Salt Lake is not that happening, except maybe for a few crowded and decently good places. With the interiors and all, Cafe Studio seemed like a winner at the first glance. You have good walls, Books, board games and a polite staff. But, the cringeworthy and despicable food and beverages ruthlessly snatch away all that streak completely.

This is the new cafe in a series of cafes mushrooming here and there. Thought of giving it a try. Went with a friend this evening. The place was almost empty when we reached. The decor is cosy and soothing. We ordered two hazelnut Cappuccino. However, there was no hint of hazelnut in it. Tasted like regular Cappuccino. When we told the waiter about it, he offered to add more hazelnut to it, but we said it's fine. We also ordered one pizza which arrived almost after half n hour of waiting. The pizza was a total disappointment. It was burnt and the cheese tasted like chewing gum. I really hope they improve their service and food quality looking at the tough competition that's around.

Just visited this place this evening. Ambiance is warm and cozy.They have decorated the interior with creativity.

The staffs are courteous. Though I think they should increase the number of staffs  to handle large number of customers with ease.

Now about the food. We  ordered Bruschestta with spicy chicken melt and Old fashioned egg chicken salad. The salad was nearly bad, didn't like it at all. The lettuces in the salad was not fresh. Bruschestta was good in taste. Though was a bit overpriced than other places. Overall nice experience and would love to visit again for other food.

Date of Visit – 27/10/2017

Location – It is located in the lane opposite saltlake stadium bang opposite to Bengal Tennis Association.

Ambience – The restaurant has some nice interiors. Some nice books & board games on the shelves, guitars & some nice quotes on the wall makes the whole ambience awesome. 

Service – The staffs were well informed & courteous. 

Food & Description – It was a meet of few vegetarian foodies. Though we choose a wrong day as it was a world cup under 17 finals at saltlake stadium. But good food compensates for everything. Good food which is healthy too is a paradise for foodies like me. It was erstwhile Eat Good Food which was also a health food joint. It changed the name but items in the menu are almost similar with few good additions to the menu. Coming to the food :

Berry Berry Good - Awesome smoothly. It has some awesome goodness of berries with no added sugar. Yummy & healthy.

Chia Fresca Cucumber Lime - It was little average for me. The best part of chia drinks is that u can see the chia seeds n it come in your mouth prominently. I missed it in this drink.

Chickpea Kibbeh and Tzatziki - It was mashed chickpea cutlet kinda thing served with Tzatziki dip. It was crispy and dip went well with it.

Bruschetta Pesto and Olive Melt - Excellent taste & excellent presentation. A must try for Bruschetta lovers.

Potato Roestie - Roestie was crispy and what make it different from any other place is that it was served with sauteed veggies & cheesy dip. Lipsmaking.

Soba Noodles Tangy Peanut Veg - Soba is the Japanese name for buckwheat. It usually refers to thin noodles made from buckwheat flour, or a combination of buckwheat and wheat flours. It had veggies but I missed the peanut flavour. But loved it as it was healthy n tasty and I could eat it guilt-free.

Chocolate and Orange Indulgence - This is such kinda indulgence that you don't want to miss. Excellent blend of chocolate & orange in the desert. Must try.

Overall the experience was good. Some nice healthy made my day.

Pocket Pinch - 700 for 2 approx.

In the middle of all the noise and chaos of the city of Kolkata, Cafe Studio in Salt Lake is an absolute delight. It is a beautiful, spacious place where you can sit, read quietly, enjoy soft music, or play board games with your friend. It allows you to have a conversation, in comparison to all the happening places in the city where loud music is the same as relaxing. The food here is pretty good too. What's I found interesting is that this place gives you some delightful health food options. Altogether, it's a place to sit and enjoy some quiet conversations and just relax.

Located just opposite Bengal Tennis Association, Sector 3 Saltlake, this place is basically renamed from Eat Good Food To Cafe Studio. Easy to locate , this place is a perfect place for all the fitness freaks out there , because the food is totally healthy as all the food is made using olive oil and sweet dishes are made sugar free. 

What I Ordered - 

1. HAZELNUT COFFEE : Being a coffee and also a hazelnut lover, the coffee was too good. The smell of strong fresh hazelnut was so soothing .

2. HAZELNUT HOT CHOCOLATE : If you are hot chocolate lover, do go for their Hazelnut hot chocolate. It was totally blissful 

3. GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST WITH POACHED EGGS IN MUSHROOM SUACE : This is a perfect dish for the for the gym goers, the chicken breast is totally good and the dish is filled with veggies . The mushroom sauce adds a touch to the dish .

4. WALNUT BROWNIE WITH ICECREAM : Sinfully made ,the walnut brownie stands out and will make you feel good. The icecream on the top is just too good. 

In a nutshell , the place is perfect for all the gym goers and fitness freaks. The food tastes amazing . But the service was a bit slow. So please look into the service.

This is the newest addition to the list of cafés’ in salt lake that serves healthy food as well. Conveniently located bang opposite to Salt Lake Stadium’s - Bengal Tennis Academy gate, the brightly lit place is difficult to miss. 

Taking you through what I tried:

Tried two items from their drinks section, one was hot and the other a cold option:

•	Chia Fresca – Cucumber Lime: One word - absolutely Refreshing!

•	Hot Chocolate – Hazelnut: The usual hot chocolate that one would like to sip while reading. By the way there are lot of reading options available at the café.

Salads:

•	Good old Greek Salad – This is a diet salad, as I already mentioned earlier that this café serves healthy food. The main ingredient are feta cheese, Lettuce and Vegetable.

•	Waldorf Salad – This is also a healthy salad, with red and green apple with mayo dressing.

Starters:

•	Sesame Crusted Fish, Sweet chilli – A crispy fried fish with sesame coating, served with sweet chilli dip. Liked it, and would suggest it! 

Mains:

•	Baked chicken parmigiana – A great option for the health-conscious individuals but with no compromise on taste. A protein filled dish consisting of Chicken, cheese and Tomato. The chicken was soft and tender, recommended. 

•	Blackened Fish, Potato Tartare & Citrus dressing – Another healthy option for the fish lovers now. The dish is full of antioxidants and vitamin C. Hence there is no regret, you are having a healthy meal which is now a days difficult to find. 

Desserts

•	Blue Berry Cheers Cake – A nice way to conclude your meal. Layered with biscuits, cream cheese and topped with blue berry, tasted really good and was well presented. 

•	Brownie with ice cream – The walnut brownie is served with two scoops of ice-cream. We all know the combination works well, hence was good as usual.

Went to this newly opened place today for a quick snack. The place was almost empty and we felt really comfortable to click plenty of photographs to post on our social media accounts! 🙌

Locating the place can be a little confusing to some people, but that's not a big problem. Just try to reach the Bengal Tennis Association (BTA). We took an auto from Bidhannagar Road Railway Station and reached Karunamoyee, took another auto and reached BTA in a few minutes. This eatery is situated opposite BTA.

The place is really quite nice! From the outside it looks small but is spacious inside. The decor is very charming. Comfortable seating, painted walls, hanging bulbs, geometric lamps, cool photo frames, guitars, colorful bottles, knick knacks and plenty of bestsellers to keep you engaged. We read a few pages of Rutuja Diwekar's book and chatted away until our food was served. Service is fast and servers are really polite.

The food and the presentation is good. We had a minestrone soup and veg burritos. The soup was flavorful with chunky vegetables and pasta. The burritos were made of corn, rajma and minced vegetables, thus loaded with plenty of fibres and is a great snack for the health conscious. Could be made better, though. The tomato salsa served with the burrito was so fresh and tangy, we LOVED it!

We both had a good time at Cafe Studio! Its definitely worth another visit. If you happen to visit and love something from their menu, do let us know what else to try there and we would definitely keep your suggestions in mind on our next visit.

The pocket pinch-
Minestrone soup- INR 145
Veg burrito - INR 175
Total after adding GST- INR 377, 
No service charge.

This is the same old outlet of Eat Good Food with an altered name , exact decor and almost similar menu. i dropped in for lunch yesterday , ordered for two smoothies and two maincourses .
BERRY BERRY GOOD and CHUNKEY MONKEY : presentation wise zero , taste wise average and distinctively overpriced especially the later.
BAKED FISH n CHIPS : the only dish which we liked although portions are very less and the "chips" part entirely missing , however the green pea mash saved the dish.
CHICKEN ALA GREQUE : a total spoiler . from the most disgusting penne arabiatta ever i had , to the most lean slice of breast i ever imagined and a simple unimpressive salad , this was just bad.

Eating good doesnot mean eating in horribly tiny portions but consuming good calories as proteins, fibres and carbs in a proportionate and measured amount. The portions are the biggest concern for sustainability of this eatery , in the heart of kolkata serving half the quantity with no compromise in price won't suffice long. Also tastewise the recipes left us disheartened.
NOT RECOMMENDING for sure.

far from the madding crowd...  because it is new in town. we visited the place during rush hours of durga puja. fortunately the place was new and people knew less of about it that is why we got in easily without any queue . the place is located near stadium tank no 13, near mia more. the soothing ambiance coupled with the  photo-friendly modern decor will catch one's eyes definitely. the food is sumptuous and cost efficient. quantity wise and quality wise - food was more than indeed satisfactory. hope to hop in again. a must try cafe in salt lake region
