Being bored of the common zomato restaurants providing home delivery i tried to try something new...Before ordering i saw the reviews of other food bloggers and the common complaint was not being delivered food... Still i decided to take the risk and ordered from this restaurant... I ordered chicken reshmi butter masala, hot garlic chicken, Butter naan and roti... Both the chicken dishes were fabulous and was beyond my expectations.. But the butter naan disappointed me it was dry nd didn't have even the smell of butter... But i am happy overall... The main dishes were so good that i didn't feel the pain of having dry naan... Still I would not recommend a restaurant which has inconsistent order delivery but if anyone wants to take the risk its a risk worth taking.. And yeah i did get my order on time... So friends try this restaurant at ur own risk but it would really be worth the risk if u get the food... ðŸ˜‚

Even there were few negative reviews. I wanted to try my luck and guess what, It went well. Food is ok keeping the price in mind. I am not going ahead with 5 because delivery was little delayed and they packed rotis in normal plastic bag.

Fake people. They took my order but didn't deliver the food. And it showed my food is delivered. They switched off their number. Never ever order from this restaurant. These people are thieves.

They didn't deliver my order.. out of the world experience ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Fake place! I place the order yesterday at 9pm and I called 9:30pm then they said they will deliver at 10pm.. but when I called them at 10:40pm they said that they haven't prepare my food!! Oh my God!! Terrible experience!! There r few restaurants(in zomato) near my places so that I ordered here without knowing this place which was my fault but as this place is in zomato I never thought that it would be a fake place.. at last they didn't deliver my order and I had to cook at 11pm last night because all restaurants were closed that time! OMG! What a mess it was.. ITS A F*CKING B*LLSH*T FAKE PLACE.. GO TO HELL MAN!!
Saale tum jaise log marr kyu nahi jaate!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

A hole in the wall place near Tobin road signal and monginis this place looks most unappealing.. But one day i landed up there while returning home and ordered one full plate chicken chow and one chicken cutlet.. To my great surprise both the dishes were very tasty.. The rating is low because of the look of the outlet.
