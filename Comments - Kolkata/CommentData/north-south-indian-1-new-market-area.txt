Did not try anything on my own, but my mother ate dosa from this place. 
Plain masala dosa costs 80bucks only.. 
Good in taste and fair in price. 
Expecting it to be a bit more clean.

The resturant is a little bit off the mark, and this is my first time im giving such a low rating, 
The ground place is quiet congested and smoky(due to the cooking that is done in front)
The upper floor is ac which is also not that upto the mark.
We ordered dhosa and the quality sucks to be honest. 
The price is way more than what they served . 
Ps -not recommend at all 
Sorry for this type of review but this place is not worth it

I went to New Market with my parents yesterday for some work and visited this place to grab quick snacks. The ground floor looked quite shabby and uncomfortable, but fortunately the first floor has AC.
I ordered Mixed Uttapam & Kulfi Faluda (Pista Badam). My parents had Paper Masala Dosa and Lassi. Service was quite prompt. The food was decent and worth the money. I really liked the Kulfi but the lassi wasn't good.
Our total bill was around Rs. 400.
The place needs to improve on cleanliness & hygiene.
Overall it's quite suitable for grabbing quick and pocket friendly snacks.

The best part of this place is the service. The staff is really friendly! The food is pretty good. They serve both south indian food and North Indian food, and it is tasty too.

Just like their name they serve north and south indian Cuisines with few Chinese snacks too. Situated in new market area near new empire building. Situated in two floors. 1st floor has AC and ground floor has fans. Sitting arrangement was good. Ambience was good. Hospitality was really nice. Friendly and helpful owner and staff. Quick service and good presentation. Price was reasonable compare to taste and quality. Today I tried their Idli and Sambhar Vada which was tastes very good. Coconut chatni was also tastes good but most I liked was their sambhar. Pure south indian flavored tastes more then Delicious. Must try place. Recommended to all.

Located just on the right turn after you cross city Mart this is a small outlet serving quuck snacks in their offerings.

Tried chola bhatura and plain dosa from here. Both the dishes were freshly made and served fast. The sambar and chatni was also good but I didn't like the chola with the bhatura. But very reasonably priced and Swift service.

Located close to New Empire, had tried the Masala Dosa here. Crispy and fluffly dosa filled with a flavorful potato mixture. The quantity was great and the quality was also quite good. A hadcore vegetarian joint, Â not sure if I would come here back with the likes of Aminia and Nizam around..!!

Today I went there with one of my friend for the first time. 
This place is in new market area near citi mart, you have to walk towards main road from citi mart, there you will find it in left side. 
Ambiance was worst, but service was good. 
We ordered butter masala dosa. It tasted very simple like normal dosa no butter trace at all. 
Costly if we compared with food. It should have been cheaper bcoz they don't offer quality food. 
So not recommended unless you are very hungry and don't have any other option.

Nice food quality for vegetarians. Pocket friendly also with respect to food prices. The shop remains open for longer time span in a day so one can easily have both lunch and dinner in a day.
