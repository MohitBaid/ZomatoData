Tandoori Hut Home Meal & Catering had served a catered lunch at my dad's law firm's holiday party on 7th Dec 2017 for 300 people in Kasba. The menu of Lamb chops curry, Chicken curry, Steamed Rice, Dal, Dhokar Dalna, Chutney and Sweets was delicious and costed us just Rs. 500 per person with free service, mineral water, plates and glasses for 300 people. The Lamb chops were really tender and juicy. The service was excellent and the quantity that was provided was for more than 350 people.We are really happy with the service and honesty of this franchise. Just give them a call at +919051119765 to book them or visit their website: tandoorihutcatering.ml for details. We have also tried their daily Non-veg thalis starting from Rs. 90. They are unbelievably delicious! Visit their Facebook page: TanduriHutCatering for details.
