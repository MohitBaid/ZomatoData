Wonderful hidden gem - was rushing for an appointment nearby and they cooked quickly and the food was tasty and fresh and the service friendly and the place was cozy clean and sunny. They accommodated my paleo tendencies generously. Recommended for a casual nice experience!

Great food and good ambiance, super quite. Went with 2 picky north Indian food lovers. Food is not oily like in most places and you will get the flavor.

The best thing about Courtyard is that it's not packed all the time.  The next best thing is the flavor of the food.  Here's what we had on our most recent visit and how we remember it:

Aloo Tikki: super-good!  The deep-fried potato croquettes were just the right size and crispiness, and the tikki sauce it was served with was so flavorful and fragrant in a wonderful way.  It doesn't look like much, but you will want to try this appetizer.

Fish Curry: generous chunks of white fish served in a chunky tomato sauce.  The tomato sauce is not overwhelming, because it's seasoned so nicely that it's actually quite complex.

Shahi Paneer: nothing special about this saag, it's pretty standard and by that I mean a decent staple.  There are huge cubes of homemade paneer floating around the curry, which is a good thing.

Chicken Tikka:  not the best Tikka, but very decent, and the medium was spicy enough to make my husband wipe his brow and gulp his water several times.  Even though it was spicy, it was also (purportedly) rich in flavor.

Garlic Naan:  for two people, it was one medium-sized serving that was cut into four little sections.  Not very generous and you'll definitely run out, even if you were metering that naan hardcore.  Also, it's delicious.

Note: Medium spiciness is pretty spicy for most people.  Call ahead and put your name in.

We'd visit again - highly recommend.  Enjoy!

We love the fish curry and the Chana Masala, but we've honestly never had a bad dish here.  The mango lassis are amazing and have such rich flavor.

I hope this place does well!  Definitely check them out!

Nothing negative to say about this wonderful place!! I order take out from here very often, and over half the time it's after nine o'clock. I've worked in restaurants and I would hate when people would order food right before we closed. I get off late though, and everything I've tried is delicious! Regardless of what time I order or what dish I choose, everything comes hot and just as good as the first time!

Courtyard in Kolkata is one such restaurant where you would like to dine quite oftentimes when in Kolkata. The ambience,  food,  drinks,  cocktails and the whole enviornment makes us visit this restaurant again and again.

As far as the curries go, they are creamy, aromatic and not overly spicy, and generous with the fillings (e.g., goat meat). The goat curry is a tomato and onion based curry, similar to a rogan josh curry, and the meat practically fell off the bone. The saag curry had some heat and the comes crisped.
