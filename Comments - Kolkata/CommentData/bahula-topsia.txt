Came here for the first time to celebrate a birthday in the family . A very wrong decision.  Awful service and equally terrible food . 

Please come to this place atc your own risk . 

Never tasted such a tasteless Hakka Noodles .
They apparently do not serve the sizzler to customers.  We have to serve ourself . When asked it to be served , the server flatly refused . Told us to serve it ourselves. Never in a restaurant have I come with such attitude . 

We have come here on a Saturday and the place is virtually empty. Now I know why. Ohhh yes ... they do not have diet drinks and they will only serve soft drinks in a glass and will not open the bottle in front of us . They serve schezwan sauce only at starter and not in main course.  They do not serve vinegar onions unless you order main course. Tawa roti takes around 15 minutes ... so your vegetables turn cold.  

It's better to eat at any Dhaba in Kolkata then coming to this place and wasting your time money and remaining hungry.

hi all.. i  visited this restaurant, situated on bypass. I had near buy coupon for indian food. the ambience and the food was good but the portion size of the vegetables were half the normal portion served at other restaurants. i want to know if the portion they served was their normal serving or it was for nearbuy coupon holders? the taste of the food was very good though. the servers were good too.

The food is simply delicious. Starting from soup and starters to main course and dessert, each and every item is made tastefully with rich aroma and flavour. In the Indian selection, the breads were crisp and yummy. Even the biriyani and raita were good. 
The service is also pretty good and hot food was served to us. Enjoyed every bit of the meal. Felt like keeping on eating even after the stomach was completely full.

Bahula- opened in barsana boutique hotel at topsia. Not to funky but simple decent and rich ambience and hospitality..
Food was ok we ordered crispy sambal cottage cheese which was delicious ( I liked it very much ),then. We ordered baby corn which wasn't upto the mark as it wasn't​ that crispy and the pieces were too small..next we ordered shajani tikka which was ok.
Moving to the main course Dal makhani ,malai kofta was awesome but I didnt like tandori paneer butter masala as It was too oily and lacked the taste.. 
Cheese nan was very soft but we were served burned nan twice and we had to ask them to change but still some were burnt..
Overall a decent restaurant for one time visit

Visited on 6 july 2017 with a large group. The decor is excellent. Staff is courteous. The menu is also decent. The service leaves a bit to be desired. Even though it is a small place and was barely occupied it was difficult to get the attention of the waiters or the steward. Things like fresh lime took half an hour to come. We ordered a tandoori platter which was below average. The taste was not great. 
For the main course we ordered pindi chana, aloo do piyaza, paneer butter masala and roti ki tokri. Paneer was good and so was aloo. Chana could have been bigger and better quality. I liked the rotis. They were soft and well made. 
Suggest to improve the service. Look after the guests. Serve water without asking, be attentive to what they need. We had to stand and wave to grab your attention. Also improve the time to prepare the food. Food is not bad.

Amazing restaurant in terms of price and taste. They do not have valet parking despite being a boutique hotel. Coming to food - Bhuna Makai ka soup was something unusual and increased our expectations.
In starters, Paneer Tikka was ok but Crispy Baby corn had excess Salt which made it bitter.
Main course were spicy and whether it was Paneer Makhani or Veg Makhmali, it tasted similar. Malai Kofta was too sweet. For their tasting and review session, a lavish spread was showcased, so as to establish the grasp of their culinary talent, 
which is partially responsible for bringing in the bookings of Advaya, their solitary banquet. Both for their restaurant dining and banquet events, the vegetarian patrons, in general prefer a multi cousine with a good balance of traditional and new age food items, with eye pleasing presentations. Barsana's kitchen is well equipped to live up to such expectations.

Visited this place for a dinner on Sunday! The first major drawback here is that they do not have valet parking despite being a boutique hotel. 

However, to get to the restaurant, the ambience is pretty pleasing and has decent seating. 

We ordered a whole range of starters, in which some of them really stood out like the Lal Mirch Paneer and another fried mix veg cutlet. 

In the main course, the rotis were really nice and light, the Kali dal and Paneer tikka masala was also tasty. 

Overall a good experience!

Visited this place on 12 the April for Dinner.

It's a boutique hotel, located just before Ganges Ford.

The Interiors of the hotel are good.

Service was good.

Coming to food: Though the start was good, overall experience was Average.

Bhuna Makai ka soup was something unusual and increased our expectations.

In starters, Paneer Tikka was ok but Crispy Baby corn had excess Salt which made it bitter.

Main course were spicy and whether it was Paneer Makhani or Veg Makhmali, it tasted similar. Malai Kofta was too sweet.

Pricing was reasonable.

Lavish Vegetarian Spread @ Bahula - Barsana Boutique Hotel, Kolkata ☺

Barely a month away from celebrating it's first anniversary, Bahula is the pure veg multi cuisine diner of Barsana Boutique Hotel, which is situated on E.M. Bypass, adjacent to Ganges Ford and bang opposite Porsche showroom.

Situated along side the lobby on the ground floor, Bahula is the only restaurant present in this hotel. It is built in a straight line, with two columns of seating arrangements, one at the window side and the other at the lobby side. Almost half of the seatings are on an elevated platform, which lead to the parallel buffet counters and a bar counter. The bar is expected to be operational by mid of this year. Behind the lobby side buffet counter, a partial view of the working kitchen is available.

Bahula's interior is kind of hued in mustard-green with good quality furniture comprising of - firm upholstered couches, leather bound chairs and thick square wooden tables. The ceiling is covered in glass (not mirror) and the beige-brown hued granite flooring is covered with thick mud green carpet till a certain length. Soft instrumental music plays in the background.

For their tasting and review session, a lavish spread was showcased, so as to establish the grasp of their culinary talent, which is partially responsible for bringing in the bookings of Advaya, their solitary banquet.

Well decorated vegetarian wares, adorned with cream toppings, salad carvings, sauce spreads etc. that were showcased, comprised of -

- Beverage: Lung Fung Soup, Mushrooms Cappuccino

- Starter: Crispy Samble Cottage Cheese, Sahajani Tikki, Stuffed Wheel Jugni Tuscan, Chakundri Paneer Tikka, Spinach Wrapped Rice Cake

- North Indian Main Course: Kundan Paneer, Vegetable Makhmali, Irani Kofta, Deewani Handi, Dal Barsana, Kuska Biryani, Kesari Naan, Butter Naan

- Oriental Main Course: Stir Fried Veg In Palm Sauce, Pad Thai

- Dessert: Cottage Cheese Caramel, Lord Cham Cham, Rose Sandesh, Mango Strawberry Sandesh, Tutti Frutti, Badam Halwa

Needless to say, that this lavish spread was enough to satiate a whole cricket team!

The food items that I opted to taste were -

Beverage -

- Mushrooms Cappuccino (Rs. 165/-): Served in a ceramic bowl, this beverage had a nice taste and flavor of mushroom. It was a nice non spicy start to the upcoming spicy meal.

Starter -

-Crispy Samble Cottage Cheese (Rs. 280/-): It was a sauce rich Oriental take on crisp fried cottage cheese dumplings, garnished with enough spring onion and fried noodles. It was served with a beautiful beetroot flower backed by cucumber foliage. It tasted nice and spicy.

- Sahajani Tikki (Rs. 280/-): They were crisp cornflakes coated tikkis, made of an assortment of finely chopped vegetables and edible greens, binded together with potato and cottage cheese mixture. The accompanying green chutney was served in a bowl made of tomato, which was carved in the shape of a flower! They tasted rich and nice.

- Spinach Wrapped Rice Cake (Rs. 280/-): Two triangular rice cakes, covered with spinach leaves were served with a tangy chutney and some decorative salad. The chutney was placed in a seashell shaped bowl made of orange rind. The dish looked quite innovative and attractive. In spite of tasting a little bland like polenta, it tasted quite nice.

Main Course -

- Irani Kofta (Rs. 330/-): It consisted of cottage cheese dumplings dipped in a rich almond paste gravy with subtle spices. It tasted relatively bland, but it was an authentic preparation and tasted nice.

- Dal Barsana (Rs. 285/-): The Dal was served in a ceramic bowl and topped with some butter and cream. The dollop of butter was placed in the centre and surrounded with a cobweb made of cream! It tasted quite nice.

- Kuska Biryani (Rs. 315/-): Two colored flavorsome Biryani came in a ceramic bowl, topped with enough burnt onions and some chopped greens. It was served with a small bowl of mixed veg raita. The biryani tasted very nice. Very rarely you come across a good veg biryani in Kolkata. So, finding one in a newbie like Bahula, was a pleasant surprise! The raita also tasted nice.

- Naan and Butter Naan (Rs. 60/- and Rs.65/-): They were the usual tandoor baked soft breads. They tasted nice.

Dessert -

- Cottage Cheese Caramel (Rs. 195/-): It was an attractive dessert plate consisting of two triangular and little bulbous, cottage cheese based sweet bakes, coated with edible red and green colors respectively. The bakes were covered with a toupee of thick caramel thread mesh. An arc of thin plum roundels was arranged alongside, mainly for beatification.  This dessert tasted excellent.

Post the afore mentioned meal, I was quite filled to taste anymore. So, tasting portions of the remaining desserts were parcelled for later tasting, in the confines of my home. The parcel comprised of - 

- Lord Cham Cham, Rose Sandesh and Mango Strawberry Cake: These were different and beautiful fusions of Sandesh, the popular sweetmeat of Bengal. Each of them was well crafted, intricately garnished and tasted good.

- Badam Halwa: Soaked in pure and good quality ghee, the halwa emitted a nice ghee flavor and was quick to melt in the mouth. It had a smooth texture and was infused with almond slivers and pistachio choppings. In totality, this dessert was quite well made and tasted excellent.

In Bahula, the entire crockery is made of white ceramic. The staff is courteous. The entire place has a nice, clean and bright feel.

Both for their restaurant dining and banquet events, the vegetarian patrons, in general prefer a multi cousine with a good balance of traditional and new age food items, with eye pleasing presentations. Barsana's kitchen is well equipped to live up to such expectations.

A bit out of way for the Veggies as this is near to Topsia crossing just besides Ojas Banquets. The interior  and decor is very impressive. The restaurant is on the floor higher to the Reception area.   Since we had bought Groupon coupon of 549 for 2 was a bit worried about the Quality and Quantity.
 The groupon offer stated was for 1 Soup, 1 Starter, 2 main course dish 1 Dal, 2 Breads, 1 Rice and 1 Dessert.
They gave lots of options and since we were big group we almost tried everything on the menu.
The food was served hot and taste was excellant.
Will surely be visitng soon.

We had visited this place for the first time with a nearby coupon of around Rs. 460/-. We thought the service would not be as good as we were going to dine in here with a coupon. However, the service rendered to us was astonishing. The Staff was well behaved and we undoubtedly relished the food. Lovely vegetarian food is available here. Perfect place for vegetarians.

We got to know through a sms msg that Bahula was having a Durga Puja special buffet. Not having heard of this place we called them up to enquire about the buffet and location of the place. We were informed that it was in Topsia and along the same side as Ganges Ford showroom and opposite the Porsche showroom. Anyway we found it easily and our apprehensions about the new place was put to rest as soon as we entered. We were greeted and shown to the restaurant. The ambience was wonderful, the decor was tasteful, nothing over the top....elegant. Of course the decor also incorporated temporary touches of the season, is.,Durga Puja, which I'm sure they'll do away with once the festive season us over. These touches added to the ambience.
The server enquired if we would like to go for the Durga Puja special buffet and we decided to do so. They served the soup at the table....it was a corn soup, different from the starchy sweet corn soup generally served elsewhere. It was subtle with the corn flavour coming through. I liked it. The starters also were served at the table.....they had four different types of starters.... paneer, potato.etc and they tasted good with mint chutney. For the mains we went to the buffet and served ourselves to a variety of salads and veggies. We were spoilt for choice. They had various preparations of paneer,potato ,mixed veggies, black dal,chola dal etc. The breads too were served at the table, hot. Choice of breads we could have luchi, naan, tandoori roti or even laccha paratha. There was a biryani also with Ranita. Then there was Thai green curry with Ahad Thai noodles. There were two mocktails and lassi with the food. The desserts too were in keeping with the occasion and theme.... mishti doi, rabri, jalebi, sita bhog, chena roll.
The food quality was good, the ambience was excellent and the staff too were good
We had a great time lunching at this all vegetarian restaurant in the boutique hotel Barsana.

Pathetic behaviour. Called to check details of nearbuy voucher, but the manager behaved in the most pathetic way possible. Street side dhabas behave much better. Shameful and disgraceful. Said voucher is not valid on puja days but it is not there respobsibility to inform. Restaurant to be avoided forever. Customer has to call and check details. Will write to nearbuy to remove such restaurants. No respect towards customer

Bahula is located right opposite to the Posche showroom at Topsia. I was hungry and was round this space so hopped in for a quick meal.
Had veg fried rice and babycorn. Both the dishes were decent and made well. Fresh and served hot. The rice was not very oily and not sticky at all which some times happens but the babycorn was ordinary in taste nothing much to talk about. I hogged in as I was hungry and had rush. Service was decent too hope they will be doing well in future.
