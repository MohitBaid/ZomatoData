Been to Tollygunge Tales few days back to attend a friends anniversary party. The decor does justice with the name to a large extend and the props used goes well with the theme. However when you come to food they have nothing to boast about. All the fried items in the starter's were oil soaked and not worth a second try. Most main course items were also tasteless. Not worth a visit

Today I went for lunch, expected to try some continental items from their menu... But unfortunately they have chaged their menu for christmas eve .. Menu had very common dishes with inflated price, 4/5 pork prep which i cudn't try as my mom never eats pork... Anyway I wanted to order soup but there was only french onion soup only in their menu but they said they can make chinese soups ..
So I ordered :
1. Sweet Corn Chicken Soup (4.5/5) : Good taste , texture was not that thick and creamy as they used fresh sweet corn kernel not the Canned creamy corn... But overall the portion of chicken , taste  and quantity was good..

2. Galauti kebab (3/5) : [Not in the spl menu,made when i asked for it ] 2 pcs of big kebab served along with 1paratha, green chutney... The binding of kebab was not proper so it was breaking easily, mince was too soft ... But there was a Pungent,tangy smell as if the meat was stale but I couldn't claim it as the strong flavour of spices was dominating...

3.  Pan Fried Prawn (4 /5) : 6 pcs of prawn made in Drums of heaven style.. Taste was nice but u have to search for prawns inside the batter... It was so thin ,  I felt they have removed the half portion of prawn...
Service and decore is very nice.... But food quality is average as compared to its price....

The restaurant owned by Dev. Ambience is good. Decoration is nice. But the lighting could have been better. Specially for those people who like to click pictures.
Coming to the food. We ordered..
1. Chicken popcorn- It was like other restaurants only. It was nice crispy. It was served with a dip.
2. White sauce pasta- It was cheesy. The flavour was good.
The menu was Christmas and New Year special so not much varieties were there.
Overall it's a nice place to grab a drink or two with friends and enjoy the music. Byt I didn't find it extraordinary.

Tolly Tales the name itself tells us its tale that it is a Tollywood themed resto-lounge serving Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisine.
 Dimlights & Music smiply adds on to its Ambience.While having your food here if you look around,the walls will refresh your memory of yesteryear movies as the interiors are done with posters of famous tollywood movies giving it a complete filmy touch.As you enter your eyes fall on Tolly Heart-throbe Dev painted on the Wall :)
I visited this place in the first week of January. So I got a special menu as it was in the festive season of party & celebration.
 The food was Good and the service was at par to it.Overall a good experience.
So this was my tale at Tolly Talesüòä

Tolly Tales would be a perfect place to grab a drink with your mates at a nice and cosy place. The walls are decorated with movie posters from the yester years. Visiting during the happy hours is what you shouldn't miss out on. Though the food is priced slightly on the higher side, you will like the quality and their presentation. Service is prompt and efficient. Overall a good experience.

This place was bookmarked by me for a long time and at last got a chance to visit the place on 31st Dec,17.. As it was the 31st night,we went there around 9-9.30pm and were told to wait for 45minutes to get a table there but luckily within 5minutes they called us and handover a table for us and I felt so lucky and thankful to them because I was damn hungry ü§£
They had a particular menu for the 31st night..
Overall food and drinks ordered by us were-
Polar Bear(mocktail) - 3/5
Special mocktail- 4.5/5
Some hard drinks..then coming to the starters-
Smoked Chicken-5/5 I loved this one,this dish was simply amazing..
Chicken Reshmi Kebab-3/5 this one failed to do the proper justice with the name as Reshmi kebabs are used to be juicy as the chicken remains soft but this one disappointed me
For the main course we ordered-
Mutton Biryani- 2/5 (this place is not for biryani,don't go for it)
Chicken Hakka Noodles- 3.5/5 ( this one was nice)
They took a lot of time to serve the maincourse..
That's all..let's see what experience I would gather when I will visit again

Located on Sarat Bose Road, lane opposite to Barista after you turn left from Desopriyo Park crossing , exactly opposite of Xrong Place.
Beautiful place with fairy lights, film posters from yester years to present on the walls. 

Had their Beer battered chicken and Reshmi kebab. Took Virgin Mojito as drinks.
Both the starters were good and quantity was good too.
In main course we had tandoori rotis, softer and tastier and Chicken Bharta !
We ended the meal with Fried Ice-cream which was a new for me. It was nice but I dint find it to be excellent. 

Service was prompt and courteous. 
Price was a little on the higher side but quantity and quality wise it is okay.

This restaurant has a very peaceful ambience with dim lighting. The interiors are done in a filmy style as it is a themed restaurant. The quality of food served is very good. We had chilli chicken dry for starter and in main course we ordered for chicken biryani and chicken butter masala. Every item was made extremely well and they were so tasty that we forget to even click pictures as we were so busy eating. For dessert, we had the Brownie with ice cream.
The service can be better though and the staff here is not so polite as expected.
The prices are decent.

This one's a cinema themed restro in Southern Avenue.

Ambiance is nice but the dim lighting is a bit on the darker side to my liking...Won't be able to take good pictures if you don't have a high end phone or camera...

Food :- 

Virgin Colada and Polar Bear --- Former one's a pineapple flavoured mocktail blended with vanilla ice-cream...It was a thick n sweet shake...Latter one's also a vanilla ice-cream blended shake...but its mango n litchi mixed flavour...this was also sweet and thick...But somehow both the shakes tasted kinda similar...i feel this was because of the vanilla ice cream which dominated over the other flavours of the shakes...so that should be used less i suppose or the flavours more!!!


Chilli Pepper Fish --- The fish melted in the mouth...and the flavour was great...Liked this one...Worth a try.

I don't remember the name of the chicken steak i tried...can't find it's name here on zomato as well..it had Rose Mary in the name...It was good with boilee veggies on the side...Had a little bit of gravy on top of chicken which was tasty. My first chicken steak and a good one üëçüëç

This place is good for drinkers. The foods are not up to the mark, however, prices are comparatively high. Ambience is good. Kind of old kolkata with lots of photo frames of tollywood movies.

We ordered for - Virgin Mojito, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Drums of Heaven, Fish Tikki, Mutton Biriyani, Veg Hakka Noodles, Veg Manchurian, Ice Cream, Chocolate Brownie with vanilla ice cream, gajar  halua.

Mojito was good. Baby corn was okay. Drums of heaven not good. Fish Tikki not good, Mutton biriyani okay, noodlea okay, Manchurian not good. Deserts are all good, but too costly.

The most Faltu Restaurant we have in Kolkata....
I have read earlier bout this place and foods, never expected this to be happened with us...
We have waited exactly 1hr and 20mns to get a table, ok chalo maan Kiya, festive season that, but, after placing the order they kept us waiting another 1hr. 10mns to serve those items.... After shouting several times at them, they were ready to serve,, if I am not wrong they were busy packing and delivering some foods to outside somewhere..... This is why they kept us waiting for the foods...
Foods were also cold, although they told they have to make those dishes again...it was not available at that moment...
The manager was not at all well behaved person, he was smart and he knows how to steal time from a person...
Thank you for this amazing Experience Tolly Tales...

This restaurant has always been in my wishlist.. and luckily i got chance to visit this treasurehunt den..!!
At first i was worried about taxes becoz of their fine decoration..bt i was proved wrong and U WILL SCREAM IN JOY AFTER HEARING THAT ONLY 5%GST IS APPLICABLE HERE!

DIRECTION: take any transport from kalighat metro station and then get off at deshapriya park.. lake kali bari..!! 7mins walk from there and u will find this place which is opposite to XRONG!

AMBIENCE AND DECOR: The ambience is so nice..decorated with dimlights...peaceful ambience..! This is a themed restaurant.. the walls are decorated with old new movie posters! Even their Washroom is also quirky!
P.s - idk i think if we would go in the evening...then the lights might have been more brighter!!

Food: we ordered lat me kai as starter ... mixed fried rice and chilli garlic chicken!

LAT ME KAI : i will recommend to taste it once...it really tastes good..rather much delicious!! It is a spicy starter that was tossed with chilli sauce and many spicy ingredients.It was recommended by them and i just loved it! There were 7-8 pieces!

MIXED FRIED RICE : nothing new in it.. but it contains less oil which i liked! But quantity wasnot enough for two if u r big foodie! But they didn't compromise in quality!

CHILLI GARLIC CHICKEN : Trust me... it was so so sooooo good! Each nd every chicken piece was so soft...so soft...that those melted in my mouth after taking those inside my mouth!! This gave a taste of different flavour although it was also tossed with chilli sauce! I will recommend this one!

STAFF AND SERVICE : Staffs are so prudent..and the manager also! They greeted each and every guest with warmth which actually amazed me! They cooperated so nicely !!

TAX : 5%gst is applicable here! No fine-dining tax is applicable..neither any service tax!

PROS : They don't compromise the quality ..which made me a happy customer! They don't use extra oil unnecessary in food and lastly I didn't burp after having all these..haha! That clearly indicates the food quality!

CONS: You should turn on all the lights for the sake of good photography! Haha!

Tolly Tales! The name justifies the ambience aptly.A simple & sober interior with Bengali movies' portraits will satiate one's matinee nistalgia for sure! Food is decent in taste & portion.We ordered Chicken Hot & Sour soup, Let me kai Chicken & Beer batter fried fish as starter.Those were too filling ,we(Read 3) ordered only one plate Chicken Biriyani & Kossa Mangso(Mutton) in main Course followed by Fresh Lime Soda.All of the dishes were good but Kossa Mangso seems to be the Man of the Match!
(I would suggest to have this with Roti/Paratha.)The staffs were also very humble.Overall, this eatery could definitely  be your choice for lunch or dinner if you are looking for any multicuisine outlet.

Finally visited, one of my bookmarked places.. As per the reviews on Zomato, this place indeed has an amazing ambience!! While entering the place, you are welcomed by extremely pleasant staff. The decor and dim lighting, instantly makes your mood delight. The menu offers a wide variety of mouth watering starters, from which Chicken Caesar Salad, Orange Ginger Chicken Wings and Draught Beer made their way out to our table üòã The quality and quantity both satisfies our tummy. Please ignore the price of liquor showing under the Bar menu on Zomato, as they are not updated. 1lt of Draught beer costs Rs.450 instead of Rs.360. Overall I had a pleasant dining experience at Tolly Tales. Hope to visit soon for tasting the other dishes from their menu! üòä

Had visited this place last evening with my friend for dinner.Its a restaurant cum lounge.What seemed interesting is that at the waiting area there is this showcase filled with silver ornaments for sale, so you may not get bored while waiting for your turn or do some window shoppingüòâ...

Food: We had ordered for a Polar Bear mocktail which was really nice and for starters Chilli Pepper Fish which was really tasty.For main course we had ordered for Chicken in Hot Garlic sauce and Mixed hakka noodles.The food is delicious.

Ambiance:It's a tollywood & bollywood and a little bit of dhaba themed joint.The crowd is pretty cool,young and happening.(for the lounge feature off course).One can visit this place with friends and family.

Service:The staffs and waiters are courteous and are always ready to help and guide you.

Price: Food is a bit pricey but then again it is ok for the ambience of the place and the quality and quantity of the food they provide.

Considering I love pork, these people have succeeded in making me rethink my choice of meat. If you cannot cook, why do you serve such inedible whatever that you dare call food!!?? 
Please think twice before going to this place. The service too is awful. When the issue was raised with the waiter, he started behaving rudely. As we said that the dish did not taste edible enough, he answered back saying that a dish once ordered cannot ne returned. Well, little did the buffoon know we were not cheap enough to expect a return. We were simply raising the issue as properly as possible.

Nice decorations which reminds of the evolution of Bengali films...... suitable for hanging out with friends and fiancee.....food was just too good. The kingfisher draught beer system is nice and wallet friendly. For food, I will recommend to try Hunan chicken. It's awesome! Prices were also perfect. The most important part is the behavior of the waiters. They are just excellent. Very caring, helpful and super fast service without a minute delay!! Mr. Gurupada Adhikary (Dev's father) himself makes a thorough supervision to ensure that the guests do not face any problem. Best of all!!

It's one of the places that merely runs on name, rather than quality. Extremely unprofessional staff, terrible food surprisingly coupled with a pretty good decor and ambience is what sums up the place.

I had been eyeing the place for a long time, before I finally decided to drop in one evening. Since it is owned by Tollywood actor Dev, the entire decor is mostly centered around him or his films and a few other Tollywood stars of the past or present find their own space in the walls. The interiors are cleverly done, utilising the maximum space available. There is also a larger-than-life TV airing the U-17 World Cup when we dropped in. 

Leaving aside the decor and coming to the food:
1. They were hosting the "happy hours" with discounts only on the cocktails, mocktails and draught beer. Probably I knew the wrong definition of the phrase. I settled for a Polar Bear mocktails nonetheless, which really wasn't even worth the 200 something I paid for 2 glasses.

2. We ordered a Chili Chicken Dry and when undecided for the second one, the waiter suggested the Sesame Dust Chicken. I was a little skeptical seeing the Sesame in front, but he assured me that it's one of their signature dishes. The Dry Chili Chicken was pretty good, I would say compared to what we were served for the rest of the evening. The Sesame Dust Chicken, as I had expected, was an utter disappointment. It was dry, the chicken inside tasted totally bland and the dip didn't help in saving the dish in any way. 

3. We ordered a Fried Rice and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce. Now, have you ever seen people going wrong with Fried Rice? No, right? Well, lo and behold! There's this one place that does! My canteen serves better fried rice than the one they served there. I am not sure if rice topped with a few carrots and peas makes for a Fried Rice, but that's what their definition is of one. And when complained about the tastez they retorted saying that it's one of their most popular dishes! Secondly, the Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce was probably confused with Chicken in Tomato Sauce, because the only taste I got was that of tomato ketchup. 

4. I had ordered a Pan Grilled Fishi for myself that just never arrived! The waiter had repeated the order before me, and yet they blamed me for not putting the order! Kudos to such audacious liars!

5. I had to pay nearly 1400 for what was probably one of the worst food I have ever had in such a posh restaurant. My wallet cried a silent death. 

Overall, not at all recommended.

I was content with their happy hour menu as they served Drought Beer in 1:1. But their food was not really up to mark. First of all,their menu has not been updated on Zomato so there was a huge confusion regarding the food list. The food seemed extremely overpriced and didn't taste very overwhelming. But the ambience is good and I liked their wall decoration!

Visited this place after hearing a lot of praises. The decor instantly impressed me. A projector screened a live cricket match, and the lighting was dim and serene. However, this was short-lived.
We ordered Chilli Chicken for starters, and it was amazing. We got a Polar Bear drink alongside, and it was average.¬†
We decided to order another starter and went for the Sesame Chicken. However, it turned out to be disgusting. Badly fried hard chicken that's hard to swallow and tastes bad.
For the main course, we ordered Veg Fried Rice and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce, and Pan Grilled Fishi with Baby Roasted Potato. This turned out to be a complete and utter disaster. The fried rice WASN'T fried rice. It was some weird bastardization of normal, bland pulao (yes, there is a huge difference between fried rice and pulao) and we were shocked to see someone ruin fried rice. It's the one rice dish that can never be cooked badly; still they managed to screw it up. The chicken in hot garlic sauce tasted disgusting. The sauce contained NO hint of garlic; the gravy was a weird orange-coloured liquid and the chicken marination was repulsive. Add to this that they forgot to write down the fish order, and after twenty minutes of waiting they said that they missed the order accidentally. We had had enough by then, so we decided to not push for the fish order.
Overall, the service was extremely slow and unprofessional. When we approached the staff to complain about the food, he said "We are a very famous name in the entire city, sir. Ask for yourself". This was his professional response. It was utterly shocking and outrageous to see a restaurant encashing on the popularity and love given by the customers and using it to evade responsibility. We repeated our concerns, and it was met with the same nonchalant attitude. Ultimately, we got a bill of over Rs. 1400 for horrible food, and left disappointed.¬†
Dear Tolly Tales, you may be famous in the city but that does not give you a free pass for when you serve us patrons with sub-standard food and then refuse to improve your service. Best of luck sustaining the goodwill and love you have been bestowed upon by us meagre food lovers.

It's one of the places that merely runs on name, rather than quality. Extremely unprofessional staff, terrible food surprisingly coupled with a pretty good decor and ambience is what sums up the place.

I had been eyeing the place for a long time, before I finally decided to drop in one evening. Since it is owned by Tollywood actor Dev, the entire decor is mostly centered around him or his films and a few other Tollywood stars of the past or present find their own space in the walls. The interiors are cleverly done, utilising the maximum space available. There is also a larger-than-life TV airing the U-17 World Cup when we dropped in. 

Leaving aside the decor and coming to the food:
1. They were hosting the "happy hours" with discounts only on the cocktails, mocktails and draught beer. Probably I knew the wrong definition of the phrase. I settled for a Polar Bear mocktails nonetheless, which really wasn't even worth the 200 something I paid for 2 glasses.

2. We ordered a Chili Chicken Dry and when undecided for the second one, the waiter suggested the Sesame Dust Chicken. I was a little skeptical seeing the Sesame in front, but he assured me that it's one of their signature dishes. The Dry Chili Chicken was pretty good, I would say compared to what we were served for the rest of the evening. The Sesame Dust Chicken, as I had expected, was an utter disappointment. It was dry, the chicken inside tasted totally bland and the dip didn't help in saving the dish in any way. 

3. We ordered a Fried Rice and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce. Now, have you ever seen people going wrong with Fried Rice? No, right? Well, lo and behold! There's this one place that does! My canteen serves better fried rice than the one they served there. I am not sure if rice topped with a few carrots and peas makes for a Fried Rice, but that's what their definition is of one. And when complained about the tastez they retorted saying that it's one of their most popular dishes! Secondly, the Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce was probably confused with Chicken in Tomato Sauce, because the only taste I got was that of tomato ketchup. 

4. I had ordered a Pan Grilled Fishi for myself that just never arrived! The waiter had repeated the order before me, and yet they blamed me for not putting the order! Kudos to such audacious liars!

5. I had to pay nearly 1400 for what was probably one of the worst food I have ever had in such a posh restaurant. My wallet cried a silent death. 

Overall, not at all recommended.

I was content with their happy hour menu as they served Drought Beer in 1:1. But their food was not really up to mark. First of all,their menu has not been updated on Zomato so there was a huge confusion regarding the food list. The food seemed extremely overpriced and didn't taste very overwhelming. But the ambience is good and I liked their wall decoration!

Located in a neighbourhood with a handful of restaurants in close proximity, Tolly Tales is decorated in an eye catching manner. There are jewellery items arranged on a showcase as soon as you walk in and a mural of Dev on the facing wall. An inauspicious start, some would say. Anyway, we settled in and the soon, the ambience got to us, and in a bad way. There was deafening music and a music videos being played with a projector. It made the conversation tougher and induced a headache. We were looking for a quick way out hence and ordered minimally.
Draught beer and Crispy chili babycorn was our escape and thankfully, the escape wasn't too bad. The babycorn was nice, crisp and juicy on the inside. Happy hours was also on offer, so we got one on one on the beer. They were short on staff and it showed on the service. However they were polite and very well behaved.

Well, if you are a foodie and a cinephile, Tolly Tales is THE place to go. Filled with artworks related to Bengali movies and moviestars and a series of movie posters, it is a perfect place to enjoy your drink with Beer Battered Fish and Chips and engage in the age old fight of who's better? - Ritwick Ghatak or Satyajit Ray.

Tolly tales, one of those restaurants which is mostly talked about for its tollywood themed decor. Decor is well to do keeping up with the name. 
There are tollywood movie and actor posters which are really fascinating. 

Been there on soshti along with 15 other friends. So they offered us the lounge. Lighting is too dim as per my taste so definitely they should look into it. 

Service was fast and the waiters were very much helpfully‚Äã. Even with such a rush during the pujas yet the food tastes amazing. 

We ordered. 
1. Beer for all of us (definitely needed,haha!)  
We wanted to have the draught beer but it was not available so we settled with tuborg and Budweiser. 

2. Caesar salad 
3. ‚Äéchicken chilli gravy 
4. ‚ÄéChicken fried rice 
5. ‚Äépork chops 
6. ‚ÄéNon veg pasta. 

We had quite an amazing time there. Good food, nice ambiance and heartfull‚Äã people is all you need to celebrate Durga Puja a bit better. 

And thank you Tolly tales for your hospitality. Cheers!

Tolly tales has become my go to place in the recent days! 
A family friendly ambiance and can be visited with a group of friends too. The food there is worth a try. 
Tried their nachos, non veg pasta, chicken kalmi kebab. 
Nachos comes with two types of dip, salsa and yoghurt sort of thing which I'm still confused about. 
Non veg pasta comes in a decent quantity with a white cream ( Sauce of your choice ) and they generously provide you with a tray of oregano, chili flakes, Tabasco sauce, salt n pepper. Adding spices according to your choice. Thanks fir that! 
Chicken kalmi kebab is from the Indian menu corner, succulent leg pieces of chicken grilled over charcoal adding that smoky flavor and a fatty taste from the butter is perfect. The meat simply melts in your mouth, leaving you to crave for some more. 

Lovely to get back there time and again! Glad to have visited it. 

Cheers team Tolly tales! 

Thanks.

Tolly tales, the restaurant with so much review and Expectation and build up. I went there to have a nice dinner with my friends but what I experienced there made me not to recommend tolly Tales to anyone. The house was full packed and we had to wait for more than 40 mins to avail a table for 3. First of all, I was caught by surprise when I found out that the the menu card has changed from what I have seen on zomato. Anyhow after a long wait, we were escorted to a table but the positioning was truly absurd. It was just near the door and we received those chairs which we used to have in pandals (iron chairs rattan woven). The space was clumsy and it was late. So we ordered for food. Smoked chicken arrived and we found it to be little stern and not well cooked. The service was also inattentive. This is really outraging to acquire a service from a well known restaurant.

However,The Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala is a must try here.Combined with tandoori roti,it makes for an amazing platter. Will definitely go back to try this. 


Nachos in salsa and curd dip makes a good starter.

I so wish I could rate them a bit higher. Maybe I went with a lot of expectations and they couldn't live up to them.
We had-
Drinks- Thumbs up and sweet fresh lime soda(nice)
Starters- Chicken reshmi kebab(nice), chilli pork(good), tempura fried fish(nice)
Main course- Smoked chicken in pepper coulis sauce,served on a bed of mashed potatoes and veggies ( It was very average, I wish the chicken was more flavourful. Sauce was on the sweeter side,didn't realise it to be so before ordering. Mashed potatoes were just fine.)
Chicken fried rice,chicken noodles- Okayish.
Hot garlic fish- Probably the best item.
Chilli chicken - Okayish.
I have a little disclaimer for anyone wanting to eat here- The prices in the menu given in the zomato app are not the revised ones,or at least not the same as in the puja special menu which is still going on in the restaurant.
They didn't play any music today as I've heard they do,instead they were showing today's football match on the projector which suited my father and brother-in-law just fine :P
Good ambience,good servers.

The ambience and interiors get full marks! Well decorated and exactly the atmosphere for having booze. They have ample seating capacity, which meant that we didn't have to wait for long even during Durga Pujo rush. 
The food and drinks are a bit over-priced. Maybe, they had a different menu for the Pujas. Just opposite to them, they have Xrong Place, which I hear is quite economical.

Yesterday i went to tolly tales with one of my friend. Although the decor was alright but the waiters weren't enough courteous. They were very lazy in taking orders and delivering them. And the food was very high priced. They wrote that the serve beer that is rs 225 but when we tried to order it they rose the price and made it double because they claimed that they do not keep bottles of 225. Then let's come to the food we ordered a started with the alcohol and a pork rib platter. They served us the platter first and then after a long they gave us the starter although we ordered it on the first shot. And finally we ordered a hot chocolate brownie with icecream. It was so casually served. Just a brownie and by its side a scoop of ice cream. They are not well aware of serving the dishes with proper garnishing and style. And all these 3 dishes and a beer bottle cost us 1600+. Though the wash was okay the total restaurant is decorated with deam lights. It is not pocket friendly neither a moderate restaurant. Even the foods werent that much delicious as thought to be.

I suddenly came aross this place in Zomato once and well I didn‚Äôt keep much expectations because because it seemed a pretty ordinary restaurant in the zomato page.In shoshthi we decided to explore this place and this was one of our best decisions.Ever.
Tolly tales is a hidden gem and you should explore this place for it‚Äôs ambience and specially it‚Äôs food.
The food here is the main USP and you are bound to be thrown away because the dishes are perfect. I had Pork Chops before too but Tolly tales made sure that when I think about having pork chops,this place will be the first one coming to my mind.Quite an ordinary dish but churned out in the most extraordinary way and hell yeah they gave mashed potatoes along with it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòåüòå
You can actually see the juices flowing out of the meat and the flavours are going to burst in your mouth,making it unforgettable.
The beer is very very cheap here and we ordered a pitcher and it was quite within the range.
Now coming to ambience,the place has dim lights which I personally really like because it‚Äôs very romantic but there can be people who are not that comfortable in these kind of lights.The place is quite big and the walls are adorned with the posters of yesteryear movies and also many recent ones,giving it quite a filmy vibe‚ù§Ô∏è
One of my most favourite spots was the mirror which was decorated with colourful lights all around them,perfect instagram picturesüòå
It‚Äôs just opposite to the Xrong Place and it‚Äôs not that difficult to find.
I looooooove this place.I just love it.

Located on the bylanes of Sarat Bose road (near southern avenue and Sarat Bose road crossing) this is a great place to have your food. We went there for  ashtami lunch.As the name suggests this place is a mini Bollywood and tollywood combined together in itself. Just as you enter you get the feeling of a cinemapara as the olden day's camera is fitted on the walls and picures of famous cinemas hanging from the walls. Their is a big mirror where you can take selfies. The decor is excellent and would make you feel like you are in tollywood.
Coming to the food, it is excellent. The continental indian and Chinese all the food are great. We ordered batter fried tempura fish, butter naan, chicken bharta and smoked chicken. All of them were great. They also have a variety of drinks in their bar menu which are quite reasonable and the bar counter is nicely decorated. The staff are also very courteous. All in all a nice place to have your food specially if you want to delve into the world of cinema.
P.S- the song collection contains a lot of remixes and would be better with the original versions. Moreover as it has a feel of Bolly and tolly so a few vintage Hindu and bengali songs will also be good along with the English ones.

The name itself tells a tale. Tolly Tales travels you back to the retro era of tollywood and bollywood. A huge stage light right at the entrance gives you a ‚Äòcinema para‚Äô feeling. To add to the eccentricity of the place there was a pulled rickshaw hanging from the wall. The graffiti on the wall including Dev‚Äôs one giant illustration is impressively done. The posters are carefully selected to represent almost all the genres of Indian cinema. A projector was showing some Bengali music channel on a white screen on the wall. There was also a greenroom -like mirror towards the washroom.

¬†The waiters remained patient as I took numerous pictures running from one end to the other. They were also heedful while taking the orders. We had a brunch on dashami and had to choose from a selective Durga Pujo menu. The starter, Mixed Herbs Pan shear Chicken, was succulent. The rest of the food was average.

At the waiting area some books were hanging from the ceiling as a part of the decoration. Although it looked good but as a booklover I hope they did not destroy good books just for the sake of the interior. One more thing, instead of playing remakes of good old songs I would suggest them to play the originals.

And if accompanied with a super cool ambiance then nothing like that!
Located at the heart of Southern Avenue this place will surely satisfy your tinkering tastebuds. 
Food tasted : 
#Veg_pasta (one of the best I have had).
#Panherbedchicken was soft and juicy. üëå
Starters won our hearts!

Main course: 
#Chicken_hakkanoodles tasted delicious.
#Panfried_chillifish could have been better though. 
Guess the marination needed attention.
Excellent staff and a pocket friendly restaurant on a whole.

Highly recommended üëê

A tollywood themed restaurant with some beauteous d√©cor and a very pleasing ambience. The food was decent but has to do a lot better to bag the 5/5. But the beautiful movie posters & mesmerising lamp shades adds to atmosphere. The staff was too was friendly and cordial but they were a little slow on serving the drinks. Though we didn't have to wait long for the food.

We visited this place on the eve of Durga puja. The place was hustling-bustling with the gen-next youth and the crowd seemed good. The booze out here is pretty pocket friendly which definitely is what attracts the crowd moreover. They they should add some more cocktails to the menu as the options seemed to be limited.

We ordered both continental and north Indian food. Unfortunately the continental dish didn't live upto the expectation. We ordered the smoked chicken in pepper coulis sauce which was served along with veggies and mashed potatoes. The chicken was well cooked but the sauce was definitely nowhere near to pepper coulis sauce. They instead had served it with tomato sauce. In north Indian menu, we opted for the Paneer Lababdar with Butter Naan. This dish was delicious and the gravy was really flavourful. The Naan bread was really soft and tasted great with the Paneer. Their Indian dishes are absolutely delish.

Overall the food was palatable and the setting was great. One should definitely visit this place if they haven't yet and treat yourself in this filmy hub with some good food & drinks. 

Food : 3/5
Ambience : 5/5

The ambience is amazing to be honest. The lighting is a bit too dim in some parts but if that gets you going then you can absolutely add this to one of your go to destinations. 

The booze comes at a reasonable price so hurray ! Now the food. The indian food is better than the continental I feel. They haven't been able to nail the continental food because apart from limited options they have little idea about what goes on the plate for a continental dish. Just a piece of meat with a few vegetables and mashed potato isn't enough. My complaint with the continental dishes were : 
a) the sauce wasn't correct and enough.
b) they used just tomato ketchup to actually bind the dish which is absolutely blasphemous. 
c) the mashed potato was not seasoned at all. 
d) the vegetables were far too few and not sauteed. They were just boiled and plonked in the mashed potato.
e) the pieces of meat were too thin. 

But I am going to praise them for their indian food AND their BBQ Pork chops. They are good with that.

A tollywood themed restaurant with some beauteous d√©cor and a very pleasing ambience. The food was decent but has to do a lot better to bag the 5/5. But the beautiful movie posters & mesmerising lamp shades adds to atmosphere. The staff was too was friendly and cordial but they were a little slow on serving the drinks. Though we didn't have to wait long for the food.

We visited this place on the eve of Durga puja. The place was hustling-bustling with the gen-next youth and the crowd seemed good. The booze out here is pretty pocket friendly which definitely is what attracts the crowd moreover. They they should add some more cocktails to the menu as the options seemed to be limited.

We ordered both continental and north Indian food. Unfortunately the continental dish didn't live upto the expectation. We ordered the smoked chicken in pepper coulis sauce which was served along with veggies and mashed potatoes. The chicken was well cooked but the sauce was definitely nowhere near to pepper coulis sauce. They instead had served it with tomato sauce. In north Indian menu, we opted for the Paneer Lababdar with Butter Naan. This dish was delicious and the gravy was really flavourful. The Naan bread was really soft and tasted great with the Paneer. Their Indian dishes are absolutely delish.

Overall the food was palatable and the setting was great. One should definitely visit this place if they haven't yet and treat yourself in this filmy hub with some good food & drinks. 

Food : 3/5
Ambience : 5/5
Service : 4/5

As the name suggests this is a resto cum lounge with bollywood and tollywood themed. Owned by tollywood star Dev, one can see pictures from movies all around the restaurant. Definitely a place for movie buffs, they will surely enjoy the ambience. The service is pretty and staffs are also polite. The ambience is enjoyable with friends more, the dimly lights are perfect for party people.

Tolly Tale is the perfect place for movie lovers to hang out . I went there this Puja to booze and have some snacks .

Nice decor with legendary movie posters on the wall. Service is up to the mark .

Coming to the food , it's quality wise and quantity wise pretty good. Though it's little high priced. Place was crowded during Durga puja days . Overall we enjoyed a lot there .

The food was delicious and the quantity was good. The ambience was cool. But the hospitality of the staff was missing. One of the waiter stumbled upon our table twice, which was disturbing. They didn't care to serve us and also kept us waiting from serving food to give us the bill. We know there was puja rush but still some sort of hospitality is expected, in absence of which we were disappointed.

First and foremost i loved the ambience of this place and the decor also. Decor is classy with movie posters all around. B/w pics of famous directors and actress all over the place. I visited this place during pujo with friends for a booze.
Coming to food we ordered fish and chips, pahari kabab and another fish dish along with drinks. Every bit of the dishes were tasty. I loved them.
Perfect atmosphere for partying.
Service- the place was really crowded that time so it took long before they can attend us. . 5 minus for service.
Go and have some good time there.

Tolly tales as the name suggests is a bolly and tolly based restaurant... We saw draught beer in the menu card in zomato but it was not in their menu booklet.. So we decided to try their food.. We ordered grilled fish in garlic sauce and it tasted great.. Soft and silky flakes... So we ordered it again this time with lemon sauce... This too was equally good..after that it was mixed fried rice which should have had pork too since the restaurant serves pork.. But it was just chicken and prawn sparsely added... Taste wise it was ok..
Service was quick and we didnt hve to wait very long.. Will surely try their other stuff next time...

Nice ambience. Perfect food. Ordered Barbequed pork spare ribs, got pork chops on risotto instead. But, it was worth every penny spent. The meat just melts in the mouth and a very nice balance of savoury risotto and boiled vegetables (a bit harsh seasoning of the veggies were not a deterrent). The side dishes seem a bit costly and guys please bring your own water bottle. I don't know if they get the water from gangotri itself but a bottle of it was priced at 80 rupees. I would definitely visit again, just for the pork chops.

OVER -HYPED , OVER -PRICED , OVER-CROWDED , EXTREMELY NOISY

Planning to go during festive season? DONT GO!
Planning to have a peaceful meal with friends and family? DONT GO!
VISIT DURING DURGA PUJO? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!

1. Over priced : Yup , all dishes around 300 , you would expect quantity to be around something like served in HATARI? 1 plate of plain rice 100/- sounds good? feeds 2 people? NOPE . Add GST on top of that. So basically 118/- 1 plate plain rice not enough to feed two people . 

2.FOOD QUALITY : Dissapointing would be the appropriate word . During durga pujo its worse. Chilly chicken wether you order dry or gravy , you get served the same thing , enjoy . Ieven heard two waiters having a heated argument on the same matter . As per the over priced dishes you will be dissapointed 

3.NOISY: the noise is unbearable , evryone talking , thats ok but on top of that add a widescreen (basically a projector screening on the wall) countiniously playing movie songs . (hindi/bangla) . BTW this place is DEV obsessed . So the end result is evryone is speaking loudly or shouting becoz you cant even hear yourself .

My personal verdict is GO AT YOUR OWN RISK (double the risk during durga pujo).
we were 5 people ordering 2 side dishes ,2 starters, 4 plates of chicken rice . still didnt feel full , and among us 5 , 3 were girls .¬† Oh , got served 2 bottles of mineral water 110/- , felt like crying . :')

So me and my friends got burned , hope you dont , go and give this place a try , I gurantee you wont give it a second try again.

(oh ! they wont be serving pitchers , though they have it in menu , instead you will be served 350 ml kingfisher for 200/-) 
ENJOY!

After much research, on a day when we desperately wanted to dig into some Continental cuisine, we found Tolly Tales. Easy to locate, lucky to park and reasonably well-lit restaurant.

Ambience :

¬†The first impressions are that of a funky fusion pub which has a restaurant. There is a hand pulled rickshaw stuck on the wall, there is Bengali film art on the other, and a typical SRK pose pick of the owner splattered on the main wall. There is a studio room inside for groups, which looks cozy and well appointed. The bar counter is adequately stocked prima facie and music is , well, techno upbeat.

Menu : 

We ordered Beer Batter Fish, Cheese Balls, Chicken Pop Corn, Pork Ribs, Grilled Fish, and some more forgettable's.

What works : 

The quality of ingredients is par, and I say at par with caution, as the sample data I have is limited to the menu above. The quality of pork was good, and quantity was appropriate. The variety of options on the menu was impressive and the interior decoration is well done. Liked the fact that the steward told us frankly that they had basa fillet and not beckti. Honestly is always appreciated. The cleanliness was good, 'noisy' children tolerant, not too cramped and reasonably well lit and clean loos.

What could've have been better :

For starters, the basa fillet was not too fresh. The steward proudly informed us that they offer Basa fillet, and I was like why not Beckti especially for price point. The quality of preparation left much to be desired even if you compromised on the Basa.A grilled fish in a restaurant of this category, let's say it is upper middle, then they ought to serve Beckti. That apart, the fish was not cooked to perfection, the uneven grill was quite visible and the plating was just about ok. The beer batter fish needs to be careful of reusing the same oil as the smell of the reused oil lingers for a long time. 

The service quality also needs some improvement, some of the stewards gave a feeling of a raised eyebrow rather than being warm and courteous, not quite impolite, but a tad smug, maybe it was just a bad day for a couple of them.

The restaurant also needs to decide on whether it wants to be a funky youngster hangout place or become an upmarket fine dining space or an arty joint with food being secondary, and the experience and ambiance being primary. While all visitors are welcome, a restaurant has to answer a fundamental question on who is their primary target audience, and then the rest can rally around that central thought.

Overall: It was an ok experience, with some tweaks, this restaurant has a potential to become better and I would recommend it to try if you are not too worried about the fine tuning aspect of it.

Tolly tales blew us away with it's continental dishes. The taste, quality of ingredients, portion sizes, and the price everything was perfect. We tried beer battered fish fry served with some french fries and a dollop of creamy tartare sauce. The bacon wrapped prawns were a delight with chilled beer. In the main couse we had prawns, lamb shank, fish la meurinere and roast chicken. All the sides in every dish was perfectly cooked. The quality of the meat, prawns and fishes were fabulous. One of the best eating experiences I have had in Kolkata in the recent past. Great work Tolly tales. Will visit you again.

Went here with my family. I had a Jerk Chicken and Broccoli Pizza while they had Nan Rotis and Mutton Roghan Josh and Fish Do Pyaza.

The Pizza was fantastic, with crisp edges and large chunk of Jerk Chicken and Broccoli branches.

The Mutton was good, with tasty gravy. The fish was by far the best item. Soft Betki fillets fried in a cornflower batter (like Chilly Fish) an then cooked in a slightly sweet gravy.

Had Chocolate ice cream for dessert, and Bacari Carta Blanca as drinks.

A theme restaurant that evokes the environment of what is Kolkata is popularly known as the "Studio Para". The service is very good, stewards friendly and comes up with good suggestions from the a la carte menu. The beer was just right, the chilly chicken was medium rare. Ambience and decor too good. Overall a nice quiet place. I visited in the afternoon and it was not crowded at all. Must recommended.

We went here on a Friday evening, in search for a quiet place to enjoy the prospect of the upcoming weekend. I had heard that they play old Bengali movies on mute on a large screen. But when I went there, I saw they were playing a TV music channel on full volume! However, the ambience isn't bad. The bar counter is decorated with lots of old cameras and the walls are peppered with movie posters. We ordered chicken popcorn, cheese balls and fried rice. The popcorn was a bit chewy and the cheese balls were not properly fried but the filling was good. The dips were yummy! The fried rice was light and delicious. Need to visit this place again on a weekday afternoon I guess to avoid the loud hindi music.

After hearing a lot about this place, we decided to give it a try. The ambience was absolutely top notch. The photo frames with yesteryear's film posters in the wall was beautiful. Being a huge fan of the bygone era's films, this place instantly impressed me with their decors.

Now coming to the food, we ordered Zafrani Murgh Kebab, Murgh Bharta, Chicken Biriyani and Butter Nan. Zafrani Murgh was tasty, chicken was soft and tender. Murgh bharta was brilliant. Biriyani was quite decent.

I would definitely recommend others to this restaurant. And I myself would love to visit this restro again.

Went there this Sunday with my family. While entering,  interiors were so good, as if  it you are entering a film premier. Photos of retro films line up the walls. Ambience was superb.  We were basically looking to eat North Indian food only. Now coming to the food. We ordered :-

1.Tamatar Dhaniya Shorba :- Accompanied with kulcha breads (which is hardly given by any restaurant in city),  this Shorba was quite different in taste and was good. 

2. Veg Au Gratin :- Again accompanied with breads,  the quality and quantity both were above our expectations.  It should be tried at least once!!!!

3.  Corn Tikka :- This starter was good and up to mark. 

4. Cheese Kulcha and Aloo Kulcha :- Delicious but very heavy in terms of consumption. 

5. Paneer Labradar &  Pindi Chole :- Once again the quantity and quality both in terms of price was very high and since we couldn't consume,  we packed it. 

Special mention of Manager who came time and again asking about the food. Staff were good. 

One should definitely visit this place.

It was a rain-drenched Friday. As I was returning home with my daughter after her school bus dropped her off, she wanted to try out Tolly Tales but asked me to bring the food home. The restaurant is within a stone's throw from our house, so it made sense. We tried out Sesame Crusted Chicken that scores a definite distinction (the tartar sauce was a bit soury though), Spaghetti Lamb Bolognese - a confident first division, & Barbecued Pork Sandwich - scores a star. They also serve a decent Galawati Kebab, a very good Chicken Bharta and some great Chilli Pork. With an excellent range of liquor on the menu that includes Draught Beer and some hard-to-resist BOGO offers that run on all weekdays, this is increasingly becoming a favored destination of the young and old; family, friends and colleagues. Last, but not the least, they have some of the most well-behaved stewards on their payroll, and even those staffing the entrance are extremely well-behaved.

Good place to spend the entire afternoon. Tolly tales will make you stay glued to your seats not only for it's fine foods. The huge projector display on the wall playing muted video songs, classic bengali movies' postered walls, feel at ease dimmed ambience and extremely cordial staff will bring a smile on your face now and then. Finally an initiative attempted and executed well by the Tolly actor Dev! :)

Decoration is a bit off track to tell about this place with all tollywood stars posters all around. To talk about we went here on a Friday night to have fun. This place is overrated when it comes to boozing and foodwe only had starters which was okay.

Situated opposite to Xrong Place, Tolly Tales is a nice place to spend time with friends. We had a decent experience here. I really liked the decor. The walls have frames and portraits all related to the Tollywood industry. The bar counter decorated with cassettes particularly caught my attention. We ordered Draught beer, Chicken popcorn and Mango juice. It was weekday and we wanted to avail the 1:1 offer on Draught beer. But they said the offer totally depends on the availability of the drink and it was not applicable for Draught beer at that time. This was a bit disappointing, otherwise staffs were friendly. Ambience is pretty impressive. üòä

Ok, visit to this one had been few days back, somehow missed reviewing it.
It was a Friday evening, my wife and I met up and decided to end our weekday's blues by chilling here for a while.
Lucky, we got here while the happy hours was ongoing.
The funny thing about their happy hour offer is that you get it on cocktails only. Buy one get one free. Being a whiskey man myself it wasn't a really happy offer for me!
Ambience is nice, with pictures and grafittis belonging to the Bengali film scenarios decorate the entire place. Also the place is big, with ample places to seat and a live screen!
Anyhow, the wifey ordered a vodka martini and the other one came along with it. I settled for a peg of teachers.
We ordered a plate of lat mei chicken and beer batter fish fry.
The vodka martini was ok, felt kinda watered down.
The lat mei chicken was nice, a mayonnaise gravyish version of the original lat mei kai chicken. The pieces were decent, soft, crisply fried.
However , the beer batter fish fry was another level of bore. Blander version of fish Orly with no taste,garnish or salt was real pain to finish.
Anyhow, it cost us 1200+.

Overall, the place is pretty much over-hyped and over priced!

It was an impromptu decision to land up in Tolly Tales for a quick dinner. The person who assisted us to get a table on a crowded Sunday evening was Mr. Santosh. The waiting time was less than 10 minutes. We ordered for some Chicken Tikka Salad, Chooza Kebab, Palak Paneer with Garlic Nan. And a Veg Pizza for the kid. The food tasted good.

The quirky interior is refreshing and interesting. Film posters to obsolete LPs hung at the reception area. The Bar counter was ornated with junked cameras around the counter with high stools for perching. The inverted film Shooting lights from the ceiling added an aura by itself. We quite enjoyed the ambience. 

The valet was also quite efficient although the parking fee has to borne by the diner. Would definitely visit again to try out something more.

A real good place to hangout with friends. It's a great mixture of a bar Cum restaurant. The things have been managed in a very simple way. 
Thumbs up - Great food coupled with excellent selection of drinks. The best thing of all its pocket friendly 
Thumbs down - not much really. You can't complain much when you get great deal   without hurting your pocket much.

Dinner for 2 will cost about 1000 including drinks

The moment you are in here , youll be instantly lost into the 90s era , with the traditional edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and a giant painting of Satyajit ray on the wall. Another wall portrays the journey of Indian cinema through the years with different genres of film posters. The tables , chairs everything complements each other, even a simple.glass mat is a picture of Suchitra Sen !! And finally, evergreen songs of kumar sanu , kishor kumar, etc in the background surrly.puts the icing on the cake !! Such an unique and awesome AMBIENCE !!
Coming the FOOD , we had drinks with crispy chilli baby corn and beer batter fish,, and since it was happy hours , we also had a 1:1 cosmopolitan(mocktail), everything tasted good if not awesome, and lacked any woe factor ! But their usp lies in their ambience right?
And lastly their SERVICE, surely deserves dpevial.mention. Each of the waiters are really courteous, and they every ladies are escorted to their chairs !! What more can you expect !!
Surely a place to chill out on another level ...

7 of us visited this multicuisine restaurant at Sarat Banerjee Road, just opposite Xrong Place during happy hours when they provide a 1 on 1 offer on cocktails and mocktails. The drinks were pretty decent - we had polar bear, italian smooch and planter's punch. For starters we had bacon wrapped prawns, beer batter fish fry, chicken wings. The portions were not satisfactory esp. that of the chicken wings though all of them tasted great. Next we had a round of kebabs - kakori and zafrani murg and they were on point, well prepared and delicious. We were almost full but still we shared a couple of onion kulchas and mutton keema and we were in for a treat. We shared one mutton keema among us so that says a lot about the portion. We had a wonderful time - great food and lovely company - that's what matters in life.

Tolly Tales - love the name thats given. Good ambience. However, the lighting is too dim, can improve on the lighting part. Decor is well to do keeping up with the name. Food is good and thats what I would come back for. I came here with a friend. Had ordered Mutton Galouti kebabs for starters along with Jamaican Passion breezer. The kebabs were awesome, quite sumptuous. Tried the Prawn Thermidor and Chicken Mexican pizza in the mains. Prawn thermidor took my heart. Lovely dish!

Tolly tales is all Tollywood.
I had been there in the pujas and I had to wait for almost an hour and a half to secure myself a seat.
The music was so loud that I could hardly converse with the people with I had gone with and also the lights were too dim. So ambience was not very comfortable for me.
The food is fine. Nothing exceptional. But it is good. So you can visit once here and also the pocket pinch is not too high.

I went there last Friday night. Loved the decor. As you enter, theres a cycle rickshaw hanging from the ceiling. They've framed posters of every Tollywood movie possible, hence the name. After a long time, I found a restaurant where all age-groups could feel comfortable and you could visit for a family dinner. They have a multicuisine menu. The continental is slightly limited though. We tried 1. PorkRibs 
2. Oriental chicken steak
3. Fish la meuniere
4. Pan fried bhetki. 
I loved the pork ribs, though slightly spicy. The chicken steak was great as well. The fish dishes were decent. Quantity is good. Generous portions of meat, mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies. 
They have projectors set up for live screening of matches.

It is very easy to find this restaurant, just opposite to Xrong place. I would suggest you to visit this place during its happy hours. The prices of some alcoholic beverages becomes very cheap. 
As it is their draught beer is very cheap. 
The restaurant has a great decor for sure. 
People who loves cinema would love to spend time here. 
A very dim light restaurant perfect for spending quality time. 
It has a big screen also to watch sports. 
Food is affordable and tasty.

Does this place leave an impact on you??? the answer will be YES, just like Dev; love him or hate him you can't ignore him and his presence :p The location is easy and convenient, its right opposite to Xrong place in the Shahnaz Hussain lane. The menu is quite elaborate and you will definitely find something that will attract you. Yes there salads are not nice so do not try otherwise the continental main course is nice. The Chinese is nice as expected and so is the Indian menu. The staff is average though not very warm but just about there. They can give you decent suggestions and be helpful if needed. The pricing is also moderate and should be affordable for most. The decor is highly talked about so need for any mentions here but yes it gives a nice warm feel especially if you are one of those proud Bengalis who love Tollywood and movies.¬†

Located in Southern Avenue (exactly opposite to Xrong Place), this place is an orgasm for any cinephile (especially retro Hindi and Bengali film lovers). Their decor is amazing. Its got some beautiful collection of film posters. Also, that gigantic wall art of the maestro, Satyajit Ray himself.¬†

We got Pizza and Pasta and this beauty, Long Island Iced Tea.¬†The Pizzas (Chicken Mexican Pizza and Margherita with Bacon) were very well made. Delicious with good amount of chicken/pork on them. The crust was pretty thin as well to add to that.The Spaghetti with Meat Balls pasta was very delicious and well cooked.¬†The LIIT's were real nice with just the perfect balance of all the alcohols in them.

The staff was very well mannered and friendly with us. I honestly had a lovely experience here and have no complains what so ever. Will try and come back here again sometime :)

It was our first visit to the restaurant. We ordered for Beer battered fried fish, oriental grilled chicken and Pork chops along with a mixed noodles. Pork chops were horrible and they had put something which tasted like cummin powder in the dish. When I enquired the waiter informed that they have used Moroccan spice which tastes like cummin. What????? why to use it in first place I was there to have pork chops not macher jhol. Beer battered fried fish tasted like the local fish batter fry, it definitely was not the original recipe. Oriental whatever shit chicken had the taste of indian masalas (supposed to be a continental recipe !!!!). Other two dishes were simple bland.

Tolly Tales is located in southern avenue just opposite to Xrong Place. This place had been crossed by me many times but never got an opportunity to explore so today my friend suddenly took me to this place and I was quiet happy with its decor ambiance service and the food. We ordered less(Beer,Dragon Chicken and Virgin Mojito)but we did enjoy every bit of it. The songs being played and the giant screen just changed our moods with the dark lightings. This place has been designed well. Its a cool hangout spot but little expensive.

Sarat bose road located, right opposite xrong place, in the lane to wall. Mp Dev s pic is muralled right at the entry. Suchitra Sen and Satyajit Ray also find space.Environment is english pub like with eclectic lighting and extensive wall posters of movies. Live match viewing is available. 
Menu is neat divided into continental, indian and chinese sections. Liquer menu separate.
Ordered prawn cocktails, a spaheggeti with meatballs, a virgin mojito and an interestingly named mocktail the italian smooch.
The cocktail was awsome, well stuffed with prawn, although I missed an egg in it. The spagetthi was also well sauced and tasty. The mocktails were served in mason jars and tasted jus like described.
The washroom area is the cutest. With bulb lighting and quirky posters. 
A special mention of the staff, who were really well trained and polite.
Overall a nice experience.

A great place for some draught beer. Nice ambience, and very pocket-friendly. Didnt try much of their food, but paneer tikka was ordinary. Must visit for a glass of draught beer with college friends, without hurting much of one's monthly allowance.
P.S.- Happy hours menu consisted only of cocktails and mocktails, contrary to what we found from the reviews. There was no offer on draught,as told to us when we called them.
                    

We visited a second time, had some draught beer with crispy chicken.. The food needs to taste better.

Amazing food, great service and theme decor.Tolly tales in one of my current favorites. Do try their lamb moussaka, which is one of the best dishes i have tried in a while. The blend of spices and the flavor will surely leave you craving for more.Another must try dish is lamb shanks with polenta.The meat is so succulent, it will fall right of the bones. We tried appetizers as well which were also very good.I am definitely going back.

Good ambience, nice decor and good food. That sums up the cafe. Service is good so is their behavior but a tad bit heavy on the pocket. Good to chill out with friends with a beer tower. That's about that.

I had a lot of expectations from this place but the food really disappointed me 
Cheese balls-were oily and a little sour for some reason 
Fish tikka- which was good size of pieces but for some reason they were smelling just too much of the smell that fish gives out which was off putting and not appealing 
Jerk chicken with broccoli jalape√±o-it was so so nothing so great about it very basic flavour didn't stand out 
Fettuccine Alfreda-had less amount of cheese and barely any salt or flavour 
The price of alcohol is reasonable here for every group of people 

The decor is full Tollywood and just picture of dev every where 

The staff is sweet and polite

Retro cinematic themed ambience was the most noticeable thing, and following that were everything,like good food,cordial attendants,light and sober music etc. Among a few dishes that we ordered I will strongly recommend - bacon wrapped prawn,it was mouth watering. Definitely going to visit this place again. @aniruddha kundu

Thematic restaurant located right opposite to the xrong place, very easy to locate. Unique theme, dim light , bengali movie posters, noticible decor & the flawless music will definitely charm you... Neat and clean.. Now coming to the food. We ordered chicken tangri kebab, jafrani chicken, mixed fried rice, crispy chicken. Kebabs are sooo yummy..This place is mainly known for their North indian items.. i was little bit upset with their chinese item, they serve limited dishes in Chinese. There is only one giant screen in the hall.. i think the decor would be completed if they would have provided live screening.. I was so full that I could not try the fried ice cream next time I would surely try it

It was in my wishlist since it was opened. Located at lake gardens area, exactly opposite of xrong place. very easy to locate, There is paid parking area in front of the restaurant.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Ambiance is really so adorable. Just go through the photo gallery u will get to know about the decoration. very neat and clean and all the staffs are very attentive and careful towards all the visitors. The carpet area is not that huge but they are managing it very smartly.There is a big screen where live cricket was going on. Yesterday I went there with my family for a dinner.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†We ordered carlsberg beer, pineapple juice, fish tikka, chicken popcorn as starters. The beer was chilled. And both the starter items were mind blowing. They suggest me to have the fish tikka and believe me ¬†he was so right. It is a must try.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† In the main course we placed the order of noor e mahal chicken biriyani, plain naan, and tolly tales chicken tikka masala. Biriyani was yum, less oily. naan was so soft and served hot. tikka masala was also so scrumptious.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† At last we had brownie with vanilla ice cream. nothing special in it to mention just as like any other place.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Overall we experienced ¬†a very satisfactory dine out. I will recommend all my friends to have a go there. The only flaw which i noticed that when it gets crowdy it becomes a bit noisy. But yes it is very natural. And last but not the least thanks for providing cold drinking water, in this climate it is really required.

This is a nice place to hangout with friends. The interior is obviously full of posters of Bengali cinema of different periods. What really impressed me was their gesture. The restaurant people will come and ask if the food is okay or not. They served quite quickly as well. We ordered tolly tales special chicken Reshmi kebab and fish tikia , orange barbeque chicken wings in starters. Chicken Reshmi kebab was quite delicious. In the main course we ordered butter naan along with murgh bharta. The food lived up to our expectations. Before going there I heard that the Chinese is not that good over here so we decided not to go for it. Well you can definitely pay a visit sometime.

They go the extra mile to make their guests feel special.The food is delightful and reasonably priced.It  is unique in using posters of Tollywood movies as an element of their interiors.A broken down hand pulled rickshaw and flashlight  have been used as props.
It's frequented by youngsters and the family crowd alike.On Mother's day we got Gondhoraj flavored cheesecake complimentary!! Looking forward to be back there soon!

One of the best places I have visited in a long time and in a city brimming up with new restaurants at its every corner this one is an absolute delight.
1.Ambience of the place is massive with the intricate details they have added and the place is huge.
But the painting of Satyajit Ray at one of its wall steals the show.

2.Menu will spoil you of choices and I chose continental Which turned out to be absolutely nice .

3.Staff behaviour is very  warm.

4. This is pretty affordable if you are on a date or you are out to catch up with your friends.

5.Location of the place is easily accessible and it is on the same lane Xrong place is .

I will definitely recommend it if you like dining in a spacious place and have variety to chose from.Alcohol is also available here .
They have a private lounge for parties too.

P.s- One thing that you can't miss at any cost is the original camera of Satyajit Ray that is under their possession .

Tolly tales was not our 1st choice. But as we didnt get a table somewhere else so we happened to come to this place as this was a new dineline & none of us tried here b4.
But thank god the other place couldnot find a table otherwise i wont have been able to write here a review.
Firstly i was amazed seeing the decor. All bangla muvi stuff & that music as in it was in bengali. Those songs which many ppl are not familier with needs really guts to play.
Secondly i was happy to see the menu card as it was not all bengali cuisine but everything that you might luv for dinner. Also to mention the food quality & taste both were upto the mark.
Finally i liked the way they parted the area as in family friends couple etc etc which is quiet commendable.
I generally dnt give 5 on 5 unless it surprises me. Here i would like to cut a mark becoz of the service as they were a little late( it was a crowded saturday so that might also be a reason ). 
Overall you should try this place out.

The first thing that is noticeable about this place is the decor. The welcoming ambiance creates a warm feeling initially and that somewhat extends to the food as well. I specially liked the fettuccini alfredo and the smoked chicken steak. The chicken was tender and the aroma was on point as well. However, I must say service is way too slow. Rated it as above average as the food is not something outstanding, but pretty decent

Food - serves continental, chinese food mainly. And bengali dishes on special occasions. As i was here on poila baishakh i got to taste some special menu. Out of which gandhoraj bhetki was good. I was lucky enough to be welcomed with a gandhoraj ghol and pantua for the special day. Pork chops and chicken sizzler tasted quite good. 

Ambience - Filmy decor. Funky presentation of the interiors. 

Service - Good.

Rates - Appropriate

Yesterday we visited this place to celebrate our anniversary. Heard many times about this place in recent times as this place is owned by Tollywood superstar Dev. Greeted by a beautiful lady we were taken to our seat. The ambience is the main trp of this restaurant. All over the walls they portrayed the journey of bengali cinema..also some banner of hindi old classics too. It was IPL time and their was a huge screen showing the match and the crowd was enjoying thoroughly. Some ladies were busy taking groufies and selfies.
Now coming to the food, we ordered beer batter fish and sesame crispy fried chicken.
Beer batter fish consists of 8pieces of soft juicy basa fish pieces beer battered and fried. It tasted well.
The fried chicken were also tasty but the chicken pieces were a bit fibrous..virgin mojito was accompanying them.
In mains we ordered masala kulcha with butter nun and Chef special Mutton dish.This was not in d menu card but the staff who was helping us suggested this after knowing our taste. This was awesome. 4pieces of mutton with bone in a brown thick gravy with a lovely aroma. We loved it. At the end we had firni..it was okayish type, should have been more thick.
The overall experience was nice and the staffs were really courteous and also took feedback from us.

Searching up for beer around kalighat metro landed up to this place! 
I loved the decor and dimly lighted walls, with posters mostly capturing olden days Tollywood. Uncomfortable sitting arrangement!!
We had ordered corona along with bacon wrapped prawn and dragon chicken. Bacon wrapped prawn was extremely delicious, it had a slight taste of betel leaf cooked in a white sauce. Whereas the dragon chicken couldn't keep ut to dt level. 
The waiters were extremely polite but they did not had enough coronas in stock.
Price was okiesh! Although went fr beer bt would revisit d place fr bacon wrapped prawn as it was a win win dish!!

Been there yesterday for lunch. The entrance leads you to a very cool dining room with pictures, wall hangings and frames of Tollywood stars. There's a lovely 'moviefied' feel to it as soon as you grab your table. Coming to the food, it was simply amazing..
Nachos, Crispy babycorn and the Penne Arrabiata were the items ordered and I was blown away by the pasta specially ‚ù§Ô∏è.
The staff were extremely courteous and friendly. It was happy hours when we visited so we got 1:1 on draught beer....

Located just opposite to xrong place. Fantastic ambiance, with a good movie themed settings. Quite spacious. The fish items were just too delicious having great varieties of North Indian dishes. The hospitality were too good (staffs were very friendly). They definitely deserve a second visit.

Food -
Chicken popcorn was over cooked, no taste! 

Chilly pork- very dry and barely any pork. The person serving us gave the pork on the sauce which was on my plate. 

Never coming back again. I'm writing this review while sitting here!

I liked the ambience. The food was good too. Though there is scope for improvement we had a good time. The menu is exaustive since it has good selection of finger food, Chinese main course along with Indian main course. I liked their Lat Me Chicken and Fish Tikia. I will definitely go again.

A walk down the lanes of bengali cinema. Those film poster plastered walls, dim lights and catchy music Surely set the Mood on but the seating arrangements lack the comfort. The beautifully crafted interiors and life like posters adorned on the walls bring back those tollywood charms. The food although is nothing out of the ordinary, yet good on the tongue.They offer quite an extensive menu with Indian, Chinese and continental food to choose from. Some mention worthy dishes from the menu are Fettuccini Alfredo, lamb shanks, pork ribs ( according to my friend).

Had heard much about this place and finally dined here.  I have in this outing only tried couple of dishes, some of which weren't photographed in a hurry. Tried the chicken reshmi kebab or its equivalent. Found them to be extremely tasty and succulent. For the main course checked out their biryani and also the peas Pulao along with Mutton korma. The rice items were very good. The mutton pieces were well cooked but to me seemed a little too oily and spicy. But the taste of all the food were good. Rounded it up with brownie with ice cream. 
The sad state of affairs in this restaurant is only in their service. The KTT  or kitchen to table timing is enormously great and I on more than one occasion had to prod and ask the gentlemen in service as to how long the order will take.   This is personally feel needs to be looked into.
I would definitely want to go back to check out certain other menus. For the food... so should you.

A Tollywood themed restaurant from the very first step you take in this place. You eyes will definitely try to picturize some beautiful memories from the world of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. A life size painting of actor Dev adorns one of the walls. The ceiling is decorated with chandeliers and classic books. The center point of the place is the hard work put behind the intricate decor syncing every detail with film industry. Multitude of choices are lined out to satiate ranging from Chinese, Indian and Continental cuisines. 
We ordered cheeseballspic, assorted baked vegetable au gratin, fettucine alfredo for the evening and realized that the quantity was suffice for two.
The Au Gratin was delicious with plenitude of cheese baked and garnished with assorted. vegetables. There's a separate liquor section which I would definitely want to try the next time I am here.
The service was snappy and satisfactory.

Service was very good & the Staff (including the Manager) was very courteous & friendly. Being Saturday evening, the place was packed. Draught Beer was very fresh. Reasonable Prices & perfect Location with easy Car parking. As a Family we look forward to visiting again. Personally looking forward to checking out the Offers on Weekdays also.
Improvement areas : Music was too loud & excessively Bollywood. Desserts need improvement.

The people are very polite . The pasta was very sour ,we complained and thought they will not change but they changed it and it was flawless.

Recently visited with my friends to this place after hearing a lot about it from my friends. So the decor of the place is really good which has a "khatiya" as soon as you enter where you can keep your helmets. The decor contains Tollywood movies from the golden era to new ones. This place is also good for IPL days as it features a big screen . Coming down to the food quality , the chicken items are really good ,the pork was bit soggy  lacked bit of flavour. Overall it's a nice place to go with friends and family as it has good ambience and crowd which attracts every age group

Visited Tolly Tales this afternoon for a quick lunch with friends... Fantastic ambience, quite spacious and a wonderful movie themed setting... Makes the experience quite worthwhile... And to top it all, the food is good as well...
We ordered Beer Batter Fried Fish, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Afghani Murg Tikka, Lat Me Kai Chicken and Chicken Margherita Pizza... All these washed down with a couple of towers of draught beer and a couple of cocktails for the girls in the gang... The starters were top notch and perfectly cooked and the thin crust pizza was great as well... We skipped the main course since we were already quite full by now... For the sweet endings we had fried ice-cream... This is an exceptional dish not served at too many places in the city yet and it was just about perfect here... All these for just around 3500 for 5 folks makes it quite a real value for money and an affordable restaurant... And we learnt they also have a 1:1 offer on drinks on the weekdays which would be a real steal at that price... 
The service was prompt and the waiters quite chilled out and helpful... The ambience and decor are definitely the winners here hands down but the other essentials, namely food and service are not too far behind... 
The only negative aspect, if I were to find one, is the fact that there is this lovely charcoal wall painting of the master, Satyajit Ray, hidden behind a large screen playing live sports... Thankfully the screen is retractable and the staff were courteous enough to fold the same on our request... In a movie themed restaurant, it is not a great idea to cover the master's portrait for some random matches... Also, I personally feel, they could work on the music and lighting aspects just to enhance the overall experience... 
But all in all, a memorable first time visit... Would definitely like to go back to taste some of the other stuff on the menu...

Another beautiful dining place in Kolkata. The ambiance is quite good with a beautiful Tollywood theme. Service time is also good. This place offers 1:1 on draught beers from 12-4 every day. So it's a great place to have lunch with some beer. The food is also very delicious.

This was my first time to this place. I heard constant appreciation and recommended regarding this one so it was time I went to find it out myself. Good ambience, posters from all kinds of old and new movies are up all the wall, one hand pulled rickshaw is set up on the wall near the entrance which made me wonder how did they get that up there? Anyway, coming to the important bit, the food. We ordered basic things so overall, the chicken was good, tender and good taste. For all the vegetarians out there, this place has a good list of vegetarian stuff as well so don't shy away from visiting this place. Only one thing which irks me a little is when we ordered for beer, they didn't have the one I wanted. So we had to settle with something else. But yes, undoubtedly great service, friendly staff, good food and great ambience. Definitely deserves a second and third and fourth visit :)
So make sure your Sunday dinner is done right and done there.

Tolly Tales is restaurant-cum-bar which is situated bang opposite to Xrong Place in Southern Avenue and is owned by popular Tollywood actor Dev. It provides food and drinks at affordable prices and is themed on Tollywood cinema, ranging from the times of Satyajit Ray to names comprising of the current industry.¬†
The place is cozy, has a soothing ambience with a giant screen facilitating the running of music videos and football matches. The bar is decorative and boasts of a decent amount of offerings. But that's that.
I found the food to be pretty average, not even remotely matching my expectations I developed when I checked the place out on Zomato. On top of that, drinks were "out of stock" and the attendant's attitude while informing that to us seemed as if that was a reason to rejoice. Out of a dozen beers, they just had two brands available for purchase. Also, the placed lacked charm and the attendants were far from energetic.

A very pleasant place for lunch n dinner. The posters of different films of the 70's n 80's that r displayed on the wall in frames looks cosy! The decor n ambience is quite good n comfort seek. We tried the continental cuisine where we had the spaghetti with meat balls. The tangy tomato with the Italian herbs n spaghetti tossed in it with spicy minced mutton balls n the cheese on top. The baked cheese with the spaghetti gives a wholesome taste n its a complete meal...absolutely delicious n tangy n spicy n just too good..!
Overall it's a very good place with good food n wonderful ambience. Service though a little delayed yet the taste of food would compromise the delay...

Located just opposite Xrong Place , this place is a hidden gem! It's new and it has amazing decor and it is popular among the youth now...and rightly so!
The walls are decorated with tollywood related posters and photos. There is giant screen on which bollywood numbers were playing ! I loved the ambience of this place. Also I went there during happy hours so got the 1:1 offer on draught beer (yay ! :'D) ...We ordered orange ginger chicken wings which was full of flavours!Even after the taxes got added up, the bill was around 400...so pocket-friendly too! ¬†Definitely going there again !

Visited this place a few months back for a drink and my first reaction was nice enough since i ordered beer along with kabab and chicken popcorn..My recent visit wasn't pleasant though. For the main course i ordered fish muniere which was below the level okay.The white sauce had no trace of butter or cheese .the fish fillets had a coating too thick.Overall a bad choice,specially if you are accustomed with real taste of the dish.the malai kabab was good.Pan fried chicken also went off well with the drink .In dessert i tried out tiramisu which again had little or no trace of coffee.The only thing i liked is their liquor pricong as gompared to the others in that area.The 1:1 on draught beer from noon to 8pm is a delight.A nice option for a drink or too.As far ambience is concerned its nice.

It does justice with the 'Tolly' in its name. The cocktails appear a bit overpriced to me. So, I just had a starter with my friends because we were not in a position to just leave after having a look at the menu. We had cheese balls with salsa. It was really nice and worth for money. For die hard Deb fans, please do visit.

Firstly I would like to mention don't judge the restaurant just because you don't like the owner. It was really delightful to get a whole pitcher of draught beer just at 300 something. Which was around 10 large glasses. But yes only draught beer. No other options. This is available in the time of happy hours that's from 12pm to 8pm . 
Coming to the food, well quality and quantity both were satisfying. The service of the waiters are way too good. Specially when you are too drunk and you really need a serving handüòÇ.
It is not really a very expensive a restaurant. 350-400 per head is enough. 
The wall decorations are too good showing up posters of old films and even upcoming bollywood movies.
Dim lighting, soothing music, a good place to sit and drink. What else you need?
Exactly, I personally enjoyed here, keeping personal likings away. I hope you shall too

Tolly Tales is all about celebration of Cinema, more precisely the journey of Bengali Cinema.. Being conceptualized by one of the current superstars of Bengali Movies, this place will take you through a culinary ride amidst the vintage posters and props from some of the immortal creations of bengali films.. Its indeed a surprise to discover such an economical yet posh restaurant located in one of the more happening areas of Kolkata just opposite to Xrong Place.. Given the surroundings this place actually serve alcohols and tasteful dishes at a much lower rates compared to its‚Äô nearby competitors and that too in an elegant and classy set-up..

Though the place was not large per se, dimly lit and even the table mats were made from notable Bengali movie posters adding to the detailing.. The brick finished walls were nicely done but what looked odd was the fact that they were screening some Hindi Music channels while playing some altogether different songs in the box resulting in a confused state.. Service was decent enough though it got a bit slowed and indifferent with the place filing up.. They have a lucrative Happy Hour offer till 7 pm when the price of a large peg of Old Monk effectively came down below Rs.100/-, something unimaginable in any posh South Kolkata restaurant.. Food we sampled:

Roasted Chilli Pork: Loved the tenderness of the meat and special thanks to avoid any pork fat on our request.. The presence of broccoli, green peas and bok choy perfectly balanced the meatiness of pork..

Lat Me Kai Chicken: Crunchy, tangy, garlicky all adding to a foodies‚Äô delight.. It was as good as you can get..

Crispy Chilli Babycorn: Firstly serving such generous portions at such cheap rate is indeed commendable.. Secondly the crunchy babycorn fried to perfection, crisp yet not stiff and the delightful sauce to finish it, just perfect to go with your drinks..

Pan Grilled Bhetki with Baby Roasted Potato: Honestly I never imagined this place to cook up continental dish with such perfection.. Pleasantly surprised with the supreme quality of the river water bhetki fish, nicely seasoned and grilled with a lot of butter, elegantly sauted veggies and bread rolls, making up a drool-worthy platter..

Philadelphia Cheese Cake: A perfect end to a near-perfect evening.. Only issue was the berry compote used on top.. It was way too sweet, overpowering the flavors of the cheese cake..

Overall I am definitely coming back to try some of those Indian starters and to enjoy another decent evening in a wonderful location without burning a bigger hole in the purse.. Our total cheque was approx Rs. 1650/- (all incl.) with 3 large pegs of drinks..

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 5/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambiance: 3.5/5

Visit there on 14th Feb late night. Just the moment we entered,I loved it. Movie records,movie posters,giant screen,beautiful bar decorated with old cameras,loud beats of music,wooden table with a beautiful red rose vase,perfect for valentines day night. coming to the food-we ordered- drinks and virgin pina colada,it was good,dragon chicken- noodles wrapped chicken,noodle portion was more than the chicken,and was very hard bcz it was over fried, then we took masala kulcha-it was OK,cheese kulcha-sorry to say there was no flavour of cheese,it was like eating a plain tandoori roti,and tolly special chicken tikka massla-it was good,nothing extra ordinary taste wise,but the quantity was quite good. The ambiance is really good,filmy and nostalgic,suddenly u will see a film poster and will remember some good filmy moments of ur favourite movies or movie characters, if they improve the food taste,it will be picture perfect.

Tollytales is situated just opposite to the xrong place and an outlet of shawarma nation. They serve Indian, continental, Chinese cuisine. Almost all the dishes are good but I somehow feel starters are better than main dishes. 
Tollytales will take you to a nostalgic journey through the history of Indian movies. 
Mural of Satyajit Ray will surely give you goosebumps.

Located just opposite of xrong place, yeah this place is owned by tollywood hero Dev.
Just as him at the first glance the expectation was high but after experiencing personally i was disappointed. Looking at the hype of this place naturally the craving for good food takes over your stomach but..
Polar bear: over sweetened drink which disabled us to figure out the distinct flavours it offered.
Tolly tales reshmi kebab: a stand out dish of the lot, the chicken was succulent & melted in the mouth.
Beer batter fried fish: very oily preparation, will surely will ruin a month's diet.
Dragon chicken: very uniquely cooked not the usual stuff served in other joints. Noodles wrapped strips of chicken tossed in a tangy sauce.
The rating is solely for the interior, the cleanliness it maintains and the service no points cut in that. A lil on the pricy side but one visit can be afforded.
P.S. Must check their restroom area.

This place is a themed restaurant as the name suggests which gives you an good vibe of the Tollywood World from the very first moment when you step into the place.
This restaurant rent is located in Southern Avenue opposite of the Xrong Place.
The restaurant is well decorated with low light and the walls are decorated with frame of posters of films from different genres and some of the walls have portraits of eminent personality. The collection of different cameras are present in the cage in front of the bar table which will attract you.
Now it's time for the food section. It's not expensive in any way. Foods and drinks are quite nice and quality is also good , the taste is nice. We ordered four things.
‚Ä¢Polar Bear: It's a non alcoholic mocktail. It's a mixture of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. Taste is average.
‚Ä¢Beer batter Fries Fish: It is a average dish. Taste is not that much good but it's not bad also. But it's too oily which I don't like. It's not spicy at all so those people who don't like spicy food they can taste it but I think it's not too good.
‚Ä¢Tolly Tales Reshmi Kebab: This is a starter in which they serve 6 pieces of tasty chicken with puduna chatni. This is good in taste. It was like melting in mouth.
‚Ä¢Dragon Chicken: This dish is quite nice. Little spicy but in taste it is good. It was covered with fried noodles and tossed in sauce and comes with 6 pieces.
We couldn't order dessert as we're full. The food was overall good enough.
The staffs were cooperative and polite.
Overall we had nice experience.

Visited this place last Sunday. What a lovely place with a awesome decoration. Lots of Bengali movies  posters are there on the wall which I have not been before not even now. There has a big Graffiti of SATYAJIT RAY on the wall which is amaze me totally.  The collection of different cameras are present in a cage which'll attract you every time(from 70's look to modern model).

The TOLLY TALES name is totally justified for this place because in this place you can see the pure and original beauty of TOLLYWOOD Films related lots of thing from the camera to the decoration, each and every thing is always touch your heart and make you amaze. Nice decoration with full of old tollywood movies posters and one big Graffiti and the vintage look with dim lights make it more special to you. 

Now come to food and drinks. It's not EXPENSIVE in any way. Drinks,food everything is up to the mark and quantity is good,taste is awesome. The stuffs are very polite and always suggest you the best dishes and drinks also. 

Love this place,want to visit again and suggest everyone who want to visit any themed restaurants with pocket friendly prices and love to know about BENGAL'S TOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY.

Tolly tales is a relatively new place in Kolkata and has gained immense popularity.. On my visit to Kolkata, went here with my husband for a lunch date on New year day. It was quite empty with only 2-3 tables occupied. We settled down and ordered couple of beers along with barbeque pork ribs and pan grilled bhetki. The decor is amazing with posters of old bengali movies.. loved it. Coming to the food, the spare ribs were really good though the mexican rice served with it was not very tasty. Pan grilled bhetki( as they say) was good in taste but the fish was basa and not bhetki so I dont know y they mentioned bhetki in the menu. Pricing is reasonable enough.. Music is current Bollywood numbers. Service was decent and they also gave us a pack of cookies as it was their first anniversary.

We tried the mixed non veg starter platter , loved the smoky chicken wings in it specially , and the beer battered fried fish was light and crispy as it should be .The bacon wrapped prawns are drizzled with the sauce that's mostly butter mixed with bacon fat and this just elevates the classic starter. I loved the galawati kebab which came with laccha paratha and was notable because of its light seasoning and low fat content , I enjoyed the true taste of some fine minced mutton , it was a meaty affair. Ended with cheesecake with raspberry compote , this will linger in your palate for sometime.

Tolly Tales,as the name suggests,is a themed restaurant which gives you an amazing vibe of the tollywood world from the moment you enter.

This restaurant is located in Southern Avenue,near Lake Mall,and was quite easy to find.

The place is beautifully decorated with dim lighting,pictures of posters of films from different genres and some of the walls have portraits of eminent personalities like satyajit ray drawn on them.The ambience pretty much stole our heart.Only one thing was a bit disappointing - the songs they played were english and hindi ones.In a tollywood themed restaurant,bengali songs are the best to complement the decorations.

Coming to the food section,there were three cuisines available - continental,chinese and indian.We went for the indian cuisine.We ordered :

‚ñ™Tolly Tales Reshi Kebab - This is a starter in which they give 6 pieces of succulent tasty chicken along with pudina chatni.The dish was pretty good.

‚ñ™Murgh Noor E Mahal - This is chicken biriyani which was really tasty and they divided the chicken into three pieces before serving which was good and appreciated.They also give a small bowl of raita with the biriyani.Biriyani is recommended !!

‚ñ™ Patiala Gosht - A mutton preparation which tasted really good but it had nothing special.

‚ñ™Onion Kulcha - It was soft and tasty and easily melted in our mouth.Kulchas are a must try !

We could not order desserts as we were full.The food was overall good enough.

The staffs were cooperative and we got good service.

Overall,we had a wonderful experience at this place.Would visit again to try the other cuisines !

I have recently been to this place. I don't usually rate a place this low but this place failed to win. I was looking forward to have some good time on a winter eve but this was a wrong choice from my end. It is a bolly-tolly based theme highlighting cinema. I totally loved the decor, the ambience, the staff selection or say the music but when the plot is flop then how does a film do good on box office? I am extremely unhappy with the food out here. Their periphery is Indian cuisines and except that other Italian or Chinese dishes are actually sad and boring. The have happy hours for drinks which is attractive for some but I warn you of what order you place.Don't get fooled! And, they charge enough tax to build any monument that would sweep you off your feet. Thank you!

Tolly tales is Bengali superstar Dev's restaurant and we decided to have a family lunch on Christmas here. The restaurant was not very large but had adequate sitting and was decorated with a rustic charm. The staff was helpful. 
In starters we ordered Tolly tales Rashmi kebab, Pan fried chicken ( staff's recommendation and also mine ) , fish Gandhoram and Corn kebabs; all of which were quite good. In main course we ordered Tolly tales chicken tikka masala, kadhai chicken, palak paneer, dal tadka, naan, steamed rice and Malabar fish curry. All the items were equally good. And for entertainment we had Dev's movies being screened on a projector.

Coming to the drinks ordered cosmopolitan drink, old monk reserve, blenders pride, grey goose Vodka and some beer. 

Great service by the staff, visiting again the next time am in Kolkata

Nice and cozy place to chill out with friends. Very easy to locate. Extremely courteous staff. They serve draught beer as well. We had ordered beer battered fish for starters and chicken noodles and hunan chicken. Food, although not very great I would say, is priced readonably. 
Restaurant houses a big display screen and is a overall a nice place to spend evenings. Would like to visit again.

I visited this place a couple of months back,so details are hazy.
The beer battered fish and a pasta in white sauce which they prepared for us off the menu was tasty enough for me to take a liking to this place.
Happy Hours were on and we received 1+1 on Tuborg 330 ml.
8 of those plus the food put the bill at around 1600/- which wasn't a bad deal for the look,feel and flavour of the place.

Tip-Ladies, the washroom is very pretty and has excellent lights.

I had higher expectations for Tolly tales. Heard good stuff about this joint, and though I enjoyed myself, and won't recommend against it, Tolly tales needs to up its game. Going on a Sunday night, the place was half empty. The decor was a bit too dimmed, but the music at the right volume so that the people could talk. The staff was also courteous and advised us on various items. The area for complaint comes from the quantity (LIIT, cheese balls were insufficient) and the taste (chocolate brownie was sub par, and the red sauce they served with nachos could've been better). This place is best to be visited during Happy Hours only.

Located exactly opposite to Xrong Place this place is based on Tolly theme. Decor is nice, Staff receptive. Food is ok, I wont say out of the world but not bad either. Good for one time experience. We ordered Chicken Popcorn, Grilled chicken sandwich, Chicken Pasta and orange Chicken wings along with drinks. It was a good experience in all

Cool place to hang around with friends. The ambience is pretty good, service is standard. Dim lights (actually bulbs of various patterns) just add to the atmosphere. The walls are adorned with posters from various bollywood and tollywood movies.The bar was the most glittering section. We tried out the Beer battered fish for starters, and Lamb Moussaka....both the dishes were lip smacking. The service from the kitchen is a bit slow...but personally that's not a complaint. When you are here for an adda you don't mind the occasional slow service actually. Will be back to try out the variety of dishes on board.

Tolly Tales is a restaurant right opposite xrong place, happened to go here for a drink and a bite in the evening. 

Coming to the alcohol, it was really cheap, a tower costed 650 rupees and that's 2 liters of beer. 

For food we ordered nachos and I have never been more disappointed. They simply opened a pack of store bought nachos and put it out on the plate with mayonnaise and salsa, mayonnaise! I mean I get it, some people may like it, but really? Mayonnaise? PLEASE! 

Not too keen on revisiting this restaurant again

Tolly Tales carried the address of "just opposite to xrong" but am sure it will carry his own address one day. Visited on the very second day and it was so much fun. First thing it's a themed restaurant, movie poster reminds you the nostalgic part of Bengali cinema. Songs Playlist was awesome so that u can enjoy the delicious food with the good music. For me it was a nice experience.

Tolly Tales is a multicuisine restaurant located opposite Xrong place on Sarat Bose Road, and can be approached from Lansdowne. It is beautifully decorated with the Bengali film industry as the theme and is rumored to have Satyajit Ray's camera as a part of the decor which the owner of the restaurant especially bought for this place. 
The food is pretty good. We had the lamb shanks and the oriental chicken steak and were favourably impressed with both. The lamb was tender and the sauce was delicious. The chicken steak was also well cooked, although a little spicy, tasted like peri peri. Both came with a side of mashed potatoes and boiled veggies which were pretty good. We took shrimps as an add on to the chicken, but those were somewhat hard. 
The waiters are extremely courteous. However the service is too slow for words. We had ordered a cheese garlic bread with the main course as they don't offer a bread basket. The bread arrived when we were almost done with the main course! 
The prices are reasonable keeping in mind the other restaurants in that part of the city. If the little problems can be resolved, this place will be an excellent restaurant.

Located on Sarat Bose road,  just opposite to Xrong place, this restaurant serves North Indian, Chinese and Continental cuisines. Owned by Tollywood actor Dev, the interior decor is quite interesting... loads of Tollywood  movies' framed posters are hung upon the walls... dimly lit and there's a giant screen hung against one wall, screening football match! Waiters are noticeably courteous, always wearing a welcome-smile on their face. Some Islam Khan was serving us and we were really touched by his hospitality. We had a full course dinner, starting from nibble to dessert , along with beverages. Amongst the dishes we ordered, following are strongly recommended:
‚äôStarter:
#Beer batter fried fish
#Zafrani Murg
‚äôMains:
#Smoked chicken with pepper coulis steak
#Lamb chops with saute veggies & mashed potato 
#Oriental chicken steak
‚äôDessert:
Raspberry Philadelphia cheese cake - the raspberry flavoured, tender cheese slice will melt in your mouth.
The only reason, I could not rate it more than 4, they don't have most of the mentioned dishes available which is little bit disappointing and to some extent, seems to be unprofessional too.  Otherwise it's a nice place to dine out with your friends or family.

Tolly Tales is a very decent establishment serving decent food in a more than a decent locality . Multicuisine restaurants are not a rarety in this part of the city and that's the reason why i was expecting a little more from them. Although it is very popularly known to be owned by Dev, the actor of Tollywood . It will take more than just fame to be amongst the superstars of gastronomic circle . 

¬∞ Location :- Not exactly in the heart of southern avenue . If you are coming from gariahat or rashbehari you have to take the sarat bose road from desopriyo park and then you have to walk towards the  lane that goes to lake road . In that road where sarat bose road post office is situated, you will have to identify the lane that houses xrong place . Tolly Tales us locate just exactly opposite to that .

¬∞ Ambience ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- On entry we were mesmerised by the decor . It was beautifully done .The walls had paintings of uttam , suchitra and satyajitrl ray . There were posters of old bolly and tolly films and the dim lights make the ambience a perfect bolly themed restaurant . The glittering LEDs in the bar makes the place very awesome to look at . The thing that really pissed us of was the loud crowd . Since , it was a Sunday lunch quite expectedly there was some groups with loud conversations . And since it was not a fine dining restaurant , that is something that cannot be prevented . There was a private section in the restaurant which housed a big group and that's where the noise was coming from . Other than this it was a visual treat . But , the noise spoilt our time .

---------------------------------------

¬∞ Food :- Okay , so the menu card contains items from 3 speciality . Continental followed by Indian and oriental . It was very clear from the variety of items that continental could have been their favored section . We on the other hand decided to taste all 3 variety so we took the following :- 

CONTINENTAL 

1. Bacon wrapped prawns ( 4 / 5 ) :- Costs 300 and the dish has 5 pieces . We were very sceptical about this but we were served right . The prawns were king sized , wrapped in our favourite bacon and then fried to perfection . The sauce with which it was done deserves a special mentioned . It was a mild , non spicy and salty combination . It hard parsley and butter and salt . The unique non spicy flavored sauce allowed us to experience the real flavour of the bacon and the prawn . We loved the dish .

INDIAN 

1. Garlic naan  ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Each naan costs 40 rupees and distributed in 3 pieces on bread basket . The best thing about the naan was the taste . It was just about perfect . The not so good part was that it was not that hot like the ones served in any dhaba . Still recommended .

2. Tolly Tales tikka masala ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Costs 220 and serves 6 pieces of boneless mid sized chicken inside a very tasty gravy . This looked like the very basic red orange gravy but trust me it was really really tasty . Mild spicy this dish is good enough to be compared with those served in dhaba . At this price this is the best you can get with your naan . Highly recommended .

CHINESE 

1. Mixed hakka noodles ( 3 / 5 ) :- Priced at 230 this dish serves average hakka noodles just enough for 2 . Although the taste was nothing special to put that price tag , the quantity was not impressive at all . The good part was that it had a decent amount of chicken and prawn pieces . But , not something worth ordering so you better skip this .

DESERT 

1. Darshan with ice cream ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Priced weirdly at 110 this dish serves a very tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream and a moderate quantity of darshan . The taste was good and it was not a bad desert to have considering most of the items were not available .

--------------------------------------- 

Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- Staff is very courteous and warm . The changing of plates from starter to main course , everything was done to good effect . 

VERDICT :- Recommended. Although there are a lot of options in this part of the city , this restaurant serves decent multicuisine experience in standard prices . Following are the main good points :- 

1. Good location .
2. Beautiful decor .
3. Decent continental. Good north Indian .
4. Seating perfect for groups of 4 to 6 .
5. With drinks available it's ideal for an office or family party where a lot of options are needed .

Was almost going to give a 4 if it was not for the small jitters in the experience . The jitters came in the form of average Chinese and loud crowd . I still believe this joint has a lot of potential to be a really good restaurant . I will highly recommend and will surely come back to try more of the continental items .

When the bill came we were really happy because it was only 4.5 k for 8 of us... So basically its a pocket friendly restaurant... So guyz do visit this place m sure u vl like it

How much we mock the owner of this place,this was a wonderful experience. I went there on Saptami, and it was packed. The food was okhayish. I ordered a salad as I was not in a mood to have spicy food,it was not good. My friends however ordered a chicken preparation with white gravy ( I forgot the name) which was very nice. Overall ambience and chit chat with a drink or two- you can visit this place.

Location : Exact opposite to the well known bar of the town - 'Xrong Place'.
Ambience : Well 2 of the total 3 points that I've rated is solely because of the awesome interior,perfect lighting and the way they have done perfect justice to its name,that's surely worth praising.Coming to the staffs,they were kind of okay,were so busy with their phones that couldn't bother to serve or even take the order on time.Disappointing is what I'll like to tag them as. 
Food : We ordered garlic nun,tolly tales special tikka masala,balti chingdi.
Garlic nuns - Soft,perfectly flavoured with saut√®d garlic.A 8 on 10.
Tolly Tales Tikka Masala - Below average.The chicken pieces were undercooked.The 'tikka' thing was missing i.e there was neither softness nor the smokey smell.In a word,the 'special' in the name of the dish is a complete mismatch with the taste.A 5/10.
Balti Chingdi - We expected a this dish to be served in a balti but we were proved wrong.This is a very common prawn dish with a tangy gravy containing 6 pieces of tiger prawns.6/10.
P.S - The prices of the dishes are up by 30-40 rs  each from what's there given in the menu section on zomato.All the dishes are pretty overpriced.They should concentrate on the food and the staffs need to be trained ASAP.

I have been to this place quite a few times but somehow am reviewing this quite late. So, you need good food and great booze, with a relaxed yet groovy ambiance- this is the place you want to be ! For the Dev fans, you have his imposingly large portrait on the front wall long with some other classic Bengali movie posters.
The food here is a one hit-one miss kinda affair. Some dishes would send you licking around the plate, while the others would disappoint you. Also I have once been served over seasoned chicken steak(thanks for the buttery smashed potatoes which saved my life !). ¬†But a must mention is the delectable ilish broth which I has during their Ilish Fevsital. You should try to put something like that in your regular menu.

The atmosphere is perfect for booze and every time I have left the place inebriated.

Okay now this place has become one of my recent favourite. Be it the ambience or the quality and quantity of the food. The cherry on the top is that its reasonable as well. I was waiting to visit this place from a very long time and the wait was worth it.
Me and my friend had ordered corn tikiya for the starter with which they give a coriander chutney which was very tasty and it tasted much like a home made chutney. Next came the drink virgin colada which was also okay as expected. Now the main course, Benarasi Aloo Dum, Daal Baluchi, Lucknawi Paratha, Masala Kulcha was super yummy. I will highly recommend everyone to order for only one dish for two people or else you will end up wasting food unnecessarily. After ordering and eating so much we actually couldn't try dessert but I am sure that will also not be a disappointment. I highly recommend to go to this place if you are a foodie and north indian lover.

I heard about this place from many friends. Wanted to visit it. And I must say, the place really is an interesting one.
The ambience is good, sober and indulging. The service is very good too. Coming to the food, we ordered corn kebab for the starter, and it was a delight to have.
But what really stands out is the Indian cuisine. I order dal makhani and aloo dum. Both of them were simply mind blowing. One of the best Indian cuisine I have recently had. Also the masala kulcha was delicious. 
The only thing to look out for is the quantity. The quantity is too much for all the dishes. So one needs to order conservatively, or you will end up wasting food.

Well this review had been long pending. Had visited this place some time ago with my family. I had heard about this place a lot and finally decided to drop in. 
The ambience was very nice. Perfect for a cosy sit and chat. The beer was the cherry on the cake to set the mood. We enjoyed the beer , which was a BOGO offer till 8 pm and the waiter who was serving us was kind enough to let us have one more pair after 8 O clock since he hadn't reminded us of the clock hitting 8. This was very thoughtful of him.
Coming to the food we ordered for:
Beer battered fish- good portions. Nice to taste. Impressed. 
Lat me kai- it was pretty different from how this thai dish is actually prepared. It is supposed to be a saucy starter,but the one served here was fried. Good to taste though. 
A lamb dish (the name of which i don't remember)- the portion was too less and i was not impressed with its taste. 
The decor of this place is well in sync with the name. 
Wish them all the best.

Located bang opposite to Xrong Place in Southern Avenue. This multi-cuisine restaurant belongs to Dev and we had this really cheesy reason to visit this place, being quite moved by Dev's acting in Zulfiqar üòÖüòÖ 

Coming back to the point. The ambience is great. Dimly lit dining area with movie posters all over. The lady at the entrance politely guided us to our seats. The place can accommodate good number of people at one go with a separate bar section. The staff were extremely well behaved. The menu was varied, loads of options to choose from and quite a pocket friendly one. 

Now we went there with almost empty stomach and for the fact that two of us were really hungry, we quickly ordered Tolly Tales special tikka masala ang plain naan. 
Now where we went wrong is that we did not consult with their staff about the portions of the food and ended up ordering 4 plain naan for the two of us. The naan was huge, divided in 3-4parts. Remember that even for one extremely hungry soul, one naan shall be more than enough. We had as much and packed the rest home. 
The naan however was good. And tikka masala too well prepared. Nothing extraordinary though. The bill came to Rs. 410, quite a deal. 
Will definitely come back again and try out other stuff too.

The restaurant is the brain child of Tollywood actor, Dev. The place is an all day restaurant serving alcohol. They have happy hours from 12 until 6!! Not sure why!!! The decor is brilliant...it epitomises bengali Cinema in every possible way! 
Coming to the food, they really need to get their chefs changed ASAP given how popular the place is! The Indian fare is way better than their conti dishes. The prices are extremely reasonable. Tried their pork ribs which tasted nothing like the usual meat we try. The pork was more on the lines of chicken, had the T bone not been there would have believed it to be pork. The pizza was another disappointment, shredded tasteless chicken served as the topping while the base was of not so good pizza sauce, this goes by the name if Mexican Pizza. Having been disappointed enough we switched to our good old mutton biriyani. The mutton was soft, the biriyani cold. They deserved 2.5 but 3 was for the servers, Manager's politeness, the decor of the place, and the wi fi!!

Very happy with Tolly Tales!
Visited this place on Ashtami for lunch, and we were relieved to find seats immediately.

The location is prime, next to Calif and bang opposite to Xrong. A very peppy neighborhood, I must say.

Coming to the interiors, I loved the dim lighting and the quirky decor. Walls adorned with movie posters, and the washroom, well, was very quirky too.

Coming to the food.
Amazing food. Amazing quantity.

For starters we chose :
‚Ä¢ Pan fried fish - perfect. The food tasted delicious. 8 pieces of tenderly cooked fish. 
‚Ä¢ Lat mei chicken - another stunner of a dish. 8 pieces of chicken as well.

For mains :
‚Ä¢ Garlic naan - very soft and the size was immense.
‚Ä¢ Kadai chicken - 6 pieces of chicken cooked in an amazing gravy. The only letdown was that it had bones. 
‚Ä¢ Tolly Tales tikka masala - this tasted fingerlickingly good. 6 pieces of boneless chicken. 

Quite a spread that was! We were so full by the time we were done. Also, we had to pack stuff home because we were not able to stuff anymore. Full marks for the quantity and taste.

Now, we had also ordered 2 beers as the guys wanted it. Me and my girlfriend, we weren't drinking. The beers were a bit steeply priced. 
Other than that, my Ashtami lunch had no glitches whatsoever. 

Pocket pinch - 1900 for 4, which is very cheap!

Extremely happy with the service. Definitely visiting the place again. All my love to Tolly Tales!

Who ever may be the owner, it is not important. To me food, decor etc is important.
Location is Prime, bang opposite to Xrong Place. I am a foodie and would rate it accordingly.
My Rating :
Food - 3.0
Price - 2
Decor - 1.5
Ambience - 1.5
We ordered Beer Batter Fried Fish, Tandoor Paneer. Yes both the dishes were really good. But after that I ordered Chilli Pork. OMG.... It was horrible..... It was so hard that I had to left the full plate as it is. Called the waiter and told him about it. But he seems so casual and didnot even spoke a word.
Price is really on the higher side according to the food quality.
Sorry friend will think twice before visiting Tolly Tales the 2nd time..

A decent place to hang out with friends. Being right opposite Xrong place, this place is easy to locate and has the potential of doing great business.¬†
I went here on Nabami evening of Durga Puja 2016. Didn't order a lot of food apart from a dry chilly chicken which was fine. The music they play is good and the staff is very responsive.
In all, a fine place to chill out with friends if you don't expect much.

I am being a bit biased while giving this review as it is a venture by my favourite cinestar.the decor is quite simple with paintings and movie posters adorning the wall. Went there on asthami and dashami. The puja special menu was quite simple but service was quick and friendly. Also the soothing background music proved to be an mood enhancher

Been there on nabami, Kolkata pujo, 2016. Well received and high relief from crowded Street and heavy rain. Low decoration with tolly posters, suggest try hand painted posters as well. Loved the dressing table beside washroom. 
Extremely nice hospitality, special mention the manager, an absolute gentleman.

Decently priced alcohol, we chose this over Oly, if ready to speand couple of "ten"s more... And I am talking about whisky.
Lovely finger food. Tender kebabs. Loved the small naans they serve with galouti. Cooked till perfection beer batter fish, however the fish used, I believe is not Kolkata bhetki.
 
Will go back soon with the gang.

Tolly Tales is just bang opposite to Xrong Place. Went there during the Pujas and tried Indian Food. The pricing may seem a bit high, but is actually fine when you take the quantity into account. Ordered Butter Nun, and two chicken dishes and a Brownie with ice cream. The food is great. No complaints whatsoever. The service could have been better, but considering it was a Puja Day, it's entirely justified. Oh and if you consume alcohol, this place is good.

I will be visiting again, to try the other dishes. Overall good location, good food, okayish prices.

Tolly Tales sets up a journey into the Indian cinema. The lively decorated interiors with beautiful collages relive nostalgic memories of golden era of Indian cinema. However, the sharodiya special menu has been extremely brief, lacking any special preparation. Mostly they have stressed on their bar menu. We ordered mixed fried rice and Hunan chicken. Both dishes were good but Hunan chicken was little bit on the saltier side. Rice was extremely well cooked as it was meant to be. We rounded up our meal with chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream. We expected brownie to be hot, but it wasn't the case. Service was polite and attentive. Overall, a nice experience.

Disappointed with lunch today - differed hugely from telecast on 24 ghanta. 1) if u can offer alchoholic welcome drink, why deprive tee to tellers? 2) does shukto go with basanti polao? 3) sweets were definitely sub-standard - suggest try it yourself. Final word - not soo impressive - as of now not worth a second visit. Dr.Mohan Lal Mukherjee

Tolly Tales, just like name the place is fully covered by Tollywood movie posters. Good decoration, loud background music, ambience was good. The outlet is situated in between Desapriyo Park to Lake Road connector, in Dr. Sarat Bose Road and just opposite of Xrong Place. Everything was good except food, it was little disappointed. They use extra tomatoes in some continental foods and some foods are extra salty. But with it taste was good. All over the place is good.

Finally, i could make it to visit this restaurant of the famous Tollywood star 'Deb' located on the lane opposite to Sarat Bose Road Post Office. Amazed with ambience of this eatery which dictates the title of every bengali movie framed as wall paintings. The dining area including the every corner of the restaurant reflects the Tolly studio theme. The decor theme including the portrait of the actor on the wall is fantastic. Love to spend more time..Ordered Polar Bear as shake and Prawn wrapped in Bacon which tasted good. Service was prompt. The staffs need to have some kind of discipline - looks like they were trying to settle some issues which was noisy¬† in front of the customers.

Tolly Tales is the restaurant of "Dev" our star of Tollywood..
‚óèLocated opposite to Xrong Place at Sarat Banerjee Road.
‚óèRestaurant is themed as "Movies" entirely from wall to table. Some wall paintings were very good.. Deco and ambiance was very good.
‚óèFood and drinks quality were not up to the mark. Taste was poor.
‚óèServer intend to stalk you when you're eating and that's a bit annoying for me....

Overall a restaurant's main success pillar is service and food quality and those were not present in there.

Tolly tales  is situated in the bylanes of southern avenue opposite xrong place. The hospitality in this place is very good. The service is pretty fast. The interiors are done in a very interesting manner with all the pictures of tollywood stars. It is very quirky and attractive. The food is also good . We had ordered a lamb dish which was a bit fibrous. The chowmein and the kung pao chicken were good but nothing extraordinary. The ambience at this place is very good and can be visited for spending some good time .:)

Visited yesterday for celebrating my hubby's birthday but unfortunately the quality of food completely ruined the evening. The rating is just for the ambience and the service of the staff. 1st we ordered Ginger Orange chicken wings for starters. 1stly there was no trace of either ginger or orange flavour in it. It was just sweet. Also all the flavour was just on the crust... the chicken was just blant. For main course we ordered lamb shanks and Oriental chicken steak. Both were equally bad. Chicken was dry, mashed potatoe was pathetic, boiled veggies were not boiled enough... was semi raw and the sauces for both the dishes was high on salt content. Lamb shanks was smelling. Ordered for garlic bread to some how balance out and finish our dish. Since it was taking them a little time to serve the bread, they gave us complimentary focaccia bread for the time being. But unfortunately that was equally bad... infact it looked and tasted more like 2 small pieces of cake. Overall a pathetic experience. .. :(

Was on my go to list for long! Finally one of my mom's friend gave me a treat there. Well, the restaurant was completely empty when we arrived and I quite liked that for obvious reasons ;) A life size portrait of Bengali cinestar Dev welcomes the foodies. The restro was has been gifted by Dev to his father who is a renowned restaurateur as a token of love. Posters of old and new bengali movies adorn the walls. The portrait of Satyajit Ray is quite appealing and is a nice selfie spot. The restaurant emulates a small canteen and I quite liked the ambience.

Coming to the food and drinks, we ordered beer batter fish and double fried pork as starters. I liked both the dishes. Double fried pork is a must try, the Thai sauce accentuates it's taste..if you like your food to be spicy, go for this dish! The beer batter fish is ordinary and I have had better ones frankly. Then came Mohito. It was a delightful concoction of Bacardi white rum, mint leaves, lemon and ice. And also we ordered one bottle of Mahou, Spanish beer and got another for free. It was very light and refreshing.

In the main course we ordered masala kulcha, tolly tales special mutton keema, lamb risotto and pork chops. I haven't ever had such succulent pork in years! The mashed potato could have been better though. It was just boiled aloo! A generous amount of butter would have enhanced it's taste. The dish also comes with boiled veggies and is quite filling. The risotto was buttery and the lamb curry was tempting. The dish of the day however was the mutton keema. While the red gravy attracted my attention the moment the dish was served, the taste was provoking. Masala kulcha was regular but dollops of butter just enhanced its zing.

Finally, we ordered Tiramisu. That was a big disappointment. It tasted like a bland cake. Several dishes like bacon wrapped prawns, crispy ice cream were not available which was a let down.

So far as hospitality is concerned, kono kawtha hawbe Na :) we were attended by Mr. S Banerjee, a thorough gentleman. He helped us select our dishes and was just bang on!

I recommend this place. Highly.

I didn't really know about this place. Happened to notice them on my way to Xrong Place, as it's located exactly opposite to Xrong Place.
And paying a visit to this place is worth every penny.
The ambiance is pretty good and innovative; as the name suggests, there actually lie so many tales of Tollywood, of different periods n eras.
So many posters of Bengali Classics that will definitely give you a different feel.
You will see lights hanging from the ceilings that are actually used in Studios.
Their bar counter is decorated with numerous old cameras; that's worth a view.
The seating arrangement is very systemically done, you will not feel as if people from the next table are breathing over your neck.

Coming to the foods. Foods are pretty good both in terms of quality n quantity. They too have 'Happy hours' to make your feel relieved if you plan to drink a few pegs.
Service is not too fast, but not too slow either. The staffs are too polite and attentive. They always keep an eye on you. You don't have to call them if you need anything, they will somehow sense your need n appear in front of you. They are good in explaining the Menu and guiding you through the list.

I simply loved this place. It's good for any kind of gathering or meet-up. I plan to visit again n again.

Ordered one portion Hunan chicken, one portion chicken fried rice and one veg chowmein hoping to have a good food with proper portion for atleast two people. What we receive is simply pathetic with all the containers having half portions of food with extrmly blant taste. The feedback was given over phone to the concerned person Mr. Pradip and there has been no help and willingness to help also. People was waiting for dinner and at the end of the day we had to cook back something for guest. 

AM REPEATING ONCE AGAIN ITS A PATHETIC EXPERINCE FIRST TIME IN RESPECT TO TASTE AND AMOUNT WHICH IS PRETTY DISHEARTENING.

Tolly tales,our group went by default!Last Satday ,we had plans to catch a football match at Xrong place,which was full.Tolly is bang opposite,on southern avenue.Parking is right in front.You enter to find a painting of the owner,actor Dev,and a actual cinema spotlight..The restaurant serves Indian ,Chinese and continental,all of which we couldn't try! We were a medium group,and they led us to a private seating area,which is heaven.They served us all different brands of beer,with Miller being served which was a plus.We ordered drinks and French fries mostly..Inside the room is a original Satyajit ray camera,which gives the added feel of a movie shoot.Nice ambience,although the lighting was a bit low.They have a large screen,plus tv sets,so sports fans will have a gala time.Staff is well mannered,and mildly asked us to tamp it down when we cheered for our team.Pleasant experience. Hope to come back to try the food.:)

The ambience is pretty filmy having pictures of old bengali classics all over the walls.And One thing that u can't ignore when u step inside the restaurant is a big painting of Dev.overall it was a nice experience!üòä

As u enter, the waiting area has Bengali books hanging from the ceiling ,the restaurant has Tollywood movie posters all over and a giant projector plays cricket on the wall. Coming to the food, since we are vegetarians, probably Becoz of that food didn't appeal to our pallette. They serve Chinese, Indian as well as continental. For starters we ordered paneer tikka & corn pepper salt. Though paneer was decent, we didn't like the corn at all as it was oily and very bland. The management changed it and got crispy chilly baby corn. But again it dint taste very good. We decided to opt for the safer option for main course. But again, where the Pindi Chana & kadai paneer tasted yum, Kali dal & yellow dal didn't impress us at all.
Overall a mixed experience. Wouldn't want to repeat again.

Situated in Southern Avenue, opposite to Xrong Place. Tolly Tales , the name suggests it's theme . Tollywood superstar Dev creates a bit of tollywood magic in his own restaurant. Decorated with bunch of super hits Bengali movie posters . The ambience was superb with the decorated walls ,dim lights and music. To celebrate one of my friend's birthday, we were selected Tolly Tales. They arranged it very well. Coming to the food, we ordered beer batter fried fish, orange ginger chicken wings, smoke chicken with pepper coulis steak, Oriental chicken steak, crispy bacon, Tolly Tales special butter keema, butter nun . Apart from beer batter fried fish , rest all the items were very good in taste. Smoke chicken with pepper coulis steak and Tolly Tales special butter keema were special mention. As per quality and quantity prices are reasonable. Overall very good experience.

Visited here on an evening with a lot of expectations but left the place without satisfaction. The interiors are nicely done with Tollywood & Bollywood as a theme. Several photo frames of classic Bengali & Hindi movies are fixed on the walls. However the music which was being played was very loud which were mainly of the "Chaar Bottle Vodka......" Genre. Definitely the songs were not in sync with the restaurant theme. The Menu was a mix of Continental, Chinese & Indian cuisines. We ordered Sesame Dusted Chicken & Pan Fried Fish along with Beer. The chicken was just OK & the accompanying tartar sauce was a bit salty too. But the pan fried fish was too hot. I have had much better varieties of these two dishes in places of much lesser fame. My expectations from Tolly Tales was definitely much higher.

This was my second visit to the place. But the experience that I had on my first one that was a 5/5 unlike my last visit on 28.07.2016. 
Please go back to the happy hour menus that was there earlier. 
Secondly quality of food is no longer the same.
There server who served us actually saved the day for team tolly tales otherwise our group of 8 and our respective families wouldn't like to visit again.

Tolly Tales aims to recreate a slice of Kolkata's "studio para" at Southern Avenue. This hotel has Dev as one of its founders, so expect a lot of movie posters and memorabilia from movies. The old-fashioned wooden door welcomes into into a warm interior. You can see the movie camera used by the maestro himself. Dim light, snug interiors, walls laden with posters of famous movies and giant LED TVs to enjoy a cricket match....things Cnt get any better. 
Tolly Tales has a decent liquor menu; the prices are affordable. The food section has continental, Asian (Chinese actually) and Indian selections. I visited there twice and tried the following items:
Beer battered fried fish: Light coating, flaky fish, good one.
Seasame crusted chicken: This one is also good; thin coating and the crust has seasame seeds to give it an extra crunch.
Fried Fish and egg yellow trio salad: A hearty salad with mayo, cheese, egg yolk and bite sized fish pieces; highly recommended if you can overlook the calories associated with mayo and cheese. 
Chicken Caesar Salad: Classic Caesar Salad with crunchy crotons; however the portion size was less.
Pan fried chilli fish: This one was a bit bland to my liking. I expected more spiciness. The fish pieces were decent though. 
Chicken Hakka Noodles: Ordinary stuff
Hunan Chicken: Mildly spicy, goes well with noodles or rice.
Fusilli Chicken Pesto: Tender morsels of chicken with al-Dante fusilli in a basil pesto sauce. This one was surely heavy from the pesto and the cheese. 
The Chinese preparations are good, but they lack the wow factor. I personally feel that their continental preparations are far better. I will opt to have a full continental fare the next time I'm there. The pocket pinch isn't too high. 
Tolly Tales delivers a great ambience and good food at affordable prices. They run offers on drinks mostly during the weekdays, so if you and a friend are craving for some chilled beer, hop in during lunchtime or early evening and you can avail of some cool offers.

This is a new restaurant that has opened in southern avenue, just opposite to xrong place. Went with friends just for few drinks. Happy hours were from 12 to 8pm, on selected brands. As u enter this place the ceiling is amazingly designed with all different kind of movie magazines, on the entrance you have a huge pic of deb and on the adjacent you have uttam kumar. On the wall you get lot of frames of different tolly movie posters. 
Background music is purely bollywood and punjabi(did not get the link between tolly tales and the music). We got nachos as our accompaniment to alcohol, salsa was very good! Prices are decent at this place and even food items are affordable. 
Next time i will make sure to visit this place for tasting the food. It was really a nice ambience at reasonable prices, and service was prompt but the servers need to be little less uptight, probably a bit more friendlier. üëç

As we were walking down the lanes of southern avenue/ deshapriya park, we stumbled upon this new gem of a place situated opposite to Xrong Place. For some reason we decided to try out this new place instead of xrong which we have visited on numerous occasions. This place is so trippy! üòÇ We entered around 5 in the evening and though the name of this place is 'tolly' tales which kind of makes you presume that the ambience and music would be of a certain kind. However it was not so. They were playing hardcore Punjabi music üòÇThe area has been very well decorated by beautiful lights, interesting film posters, a fantastic looking bar counter and comfortable seats. It is like a fusion place. They have a very good deal on happy hours which is a bonus. The food too is impressive. We mainly went there to drink and so we just had nachos and baby corn from the food menu both of which were tasty. The staff was more or less helpful and accomodative. However a little more effort could be given to the presentation of food plus the waiters could be a little more attentive. Over all had a great time. üôÇ Would love to visit again.

Celebrated my wife's birthday at Tolly Tales today. It was my first visit to the place and found it quite satisfactory. 
Decor is bit different and a filmy flavour is all around the place. Each and every decorative item is very choosy. This restaurant belongs to Deb. Our tollywood super star.
No doubt Deb has done a great job with his team. 
Now coming to the food. We have opted for buffet. Foods were fresh and delicious. Surprisingly the price is quite cheap considering the food quality number of dishes and quality. They have charged only @Rs.450/- including tax per head with soup starter main course and dessert.The staffs were so well behaved and cooperative.
Highly recommended and must visit place. You will love it.

Located near southern avenue, Tolly tales is probably one of the best places to hang out in south Kolkata. Not only the food served is delicious, but also the ambiance and lighting adds glamour to the place. The service and behaviour of the staff is friendly and professional. They keep on having offers on different days which adds to the excitement of visiting this place.
Some of their delicacies include the Caesar salad, tolly tales reshmi kabab and pan fried fish

The Continental food was terrible. The service was sluggish and took ages. When the beer battered fish finally arrived, it was bland and under seasoned. We needed lashings of tobasco to make it taste of something. But the worst of the lot was the smoked lamb burger, the bun was crumbly and disgusting. After one bite the 'burger' disintegrates into mush on the plate. The unholy trio is complete with the cottage cheese cake. For 200 rupees, we got two tiny triangles of what seemed to be fluffy icing. 
There was a rickshaw showpiece dangling above us. The only way the meal could have gotten worse is if it fell on our table from up above.

A nicely lit up and nicely set up place. For all the nostalgic people like me, this place would take you to the different eras of Bollywood. The d√©cor is quite nice and interesting. The food and service would not disappoint you as well.

I‚Äôve had beer batterd fish, pork ribs, virgin colada and chicken popcorn from here. I absolutely loved the fish. I went here on a weekday at first and therefore it was comparatively less crowded but for weekends, I would suggest you to reserve a table before going here :)

Recently I went to this place, searching for a new place to it out.  Heard that it's dev's restaurant so wanted to give it a try.
We went there during the afternoon. So it was almost empty. 
The decor is very good. The walls are adorned with pictures of movie posters. And the have a huge screen showing matches and play good music. 
Coming to the food, we had tandoori chicken which was soft and yummy, dragon chicken which was spicy and tasted great though the chicken was not very soft. Then we had aloo masala kulcha and tolly tales chicken tikka, both of which tasted good.
The service was good and I'm quite impressed with this place.

The other name for this place could be Dev's masterpiece. Away from his silver screen image he has created this fascinating place that serves some reall good food. We were the last guests for the brunch and the restaurant team ensured that we enjoy our meal to the fullest. They had actually served each and every course on our table. The fish and chicken tikka were crazy. Specially the Chicken tikka is the best have tried till date. The texture color and format of the chicken was simply heaven. Moving on to the main course, this brunch meal came across as a king size meal with huge quantity and equal quality of good food served. 
I enjoyed the combination of food and decor to the fullest and is indeed one of the memorable visits for me. But I am looking forward to another visit very soon. Cheers! !

Ambience

This place is in one word, lovely for an eat out!!
The walls, the ceiling, the seating arrangement is just perfect. The decor of the bar is mind blowing as well!!

Service

The staff members are very courteous, and they ensured that we were content with the food and the service.

Appetizers

In this section, we ordered for Orange Ginger Chicken Wings. There were 6 pieces of succulent chicken wings glazed in a tangy orange gravy. The ginger added an additional x factor to the dish. We would recommend this one! ( A 4/5 for this!)

Mocktails

As we are a bit partial towards mocktails, hence we ordered for two of them! We chose Polar Bear and Italian Smooch. Polar Bear is a drink worth having while Italian Smooch has a name more alluring than the taste! We would give this section a 3.5 on 5.

Main course

Oriental chicken steak was our pick. It was a lovely surprise! Wrapped up in egg, the chicken steak was beautifully flavoured in fresh spices seated on a base of mashed potatoes. A 4/5 for this dish.

Dessert

This section hugely disappointed us. Most of the desserts mentioned on the menu were unavailable and we had to settle for Tiramasu, which wasnt worth the effort.

Landed up here on a rainy Sunday afternoon after having read about the place on Zomato. The Tollywood theme is evident in the decor which is kitschy but not overpoweringly so. The tables are well spaced out, the lights are pleasantly dim(not dark) and the music is not overly loud. Liked the overall ambience.

Tried their Beer Batter Fried Fish along with a Caprioska and a Whiskey Sour. Drinks were decent, nothing special, nothing to complain about either. The fried fish was served along with french fries, a side of cucumber and tomato slices topped with coleslaw and their version of the classic tartar sauce. The batter was light and the fish really melted in my mouth. Loved it, although it could have been just a little less oily.

The staff are well-spoken and the service is quick. Not extremely pricey either. Overall, a solid 4 out of 5.

Note: When we were about to leave it was raining heavily outside and the doorman asked us if we would need an umbrella while we waited for our Ola to arrive. It was a nice touch and made the whole experiene of Tolly Tales a little bit sweeter for us. Kudos to him and the management for going the extra mile.

This place is a newbie in the food scenario of Kolkata. It's known more for its owner, Dev the 'Mahanayak' of today's Tollywood (üòú) than the food it actually intends to serve at Tolly Tales.
The pictures of the place on my sister's phone, the quirky filmy ambience made me decide to come here or not. I was a bit sceptical about the food. But after an experience over here, I must say, that Dev has at least managed some really good cooks to cook for his restaurant.
The entrance is adorned by an old discoloured French door. The waiting area has a 'khatiya' with a camera and a big wall graffiti of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen, something to woo your bangali sentiment for sure. The same would go with the Satyajit Ray graffiti on the wall opposite to the bar counter. There are a number of film posters, from the oldest of Indian cinema to the latest releases which quirks up the walls. You will also see them finding their position on table mats and coasters and even a few inside the washroom. That was funny! I loved the collection of vintage cameras hung at the bar counter. That's surely a delight to the eyes. Camera lovers are definitely going to go gaga over it once they see the rarest of the cameras stored in there, as I went.
After a lot of talking about the ambience and decor, let's come to the serious and most important part, that is food! Oh yes! Except for a dish or two, everything was good.
At first we took the Garlic Topped Seafood Pizza. They only used tuna and prawns in it. I think adding a little bit of crabmeat would make it greater. Otherwise, the essence of garlic infused in the pizza base and also on top made the item even more delicious. My sisters had ordered the Penne With Shrimps in Alfredo Sauce. Shocked to know that the man who waited us at such a 'ketwala' place didn't know that white sauce is Alfredo itself. Whatever be the thing, this dish was absolutely amazing. I tasted a spoon or two from them and it tasted heavenly. We had taken Pork Ribs. This came in with the veggies and mashed potatoes. This is one dish which disappointed us a little. The brown sauce tasted too bland, even the mashed potatoes and wilted greens were not done well. Took down points for this. Even the portion was so little that we had to order another platter - Grilled Fish, suggested by the man at the table. It was very good, well done, the vegetables were cooked well and they served foccacia garlic bread along with it which was also very delicious.
For desserts, they had a variety listed in the menu most of which were not available. They asked us to take the Pannacotta which was not written there. The pannacotta itself was good but what I didn't like was the too sweet synthetic syrup they used as the sauce. Otherwise everything was alright.
Tolly Tales also has an ongoing mango festival right now. We didn't get chance to try any of those dishes. But the dishes we tried were mostly good.
This place is trying to serve good food preparing with expert recipes. I loved their effort and courteousness starting from the manager to the security at the gate. What I feel is that they just need to add a touch of finesse to it to make things even more perfect so that there's no scope of any complaint. Happy Dining! :)

Tolly Tales was an amazing experience. Right from the decor to the service - it was all fab. Ordered starters : the galouti kabab was smooth, the beer battered chicken was to die for ...the sesame fried chicken was lip smacking and the starter of the day was orange garlic chicken wings. .The main course was ordered from a range of chicken steak and chicken salad...pomphret fish....overall worth trying

As the name suggests, the amazing interior of Tolly Tales takes you to the world of movies with framed movie posters hanging on the wall and the beautiful portraits of the maestro Satyajit Ray and many other celebrities painted on the wall.
The place is beautifully lit up which adds to the already mesmerising decor.
I visited the place along with my family last night for dinner. However the food though tasty and well cooked does not match upto the look and feel of the place.
We ordered for Lat me chicken for the starter, Smoke Chicken with pepper Coulis steak,Pan Grilled Bhetki with baby roasted potato and a dish made on special request which was not available on the menu because of my love for cheese. Chicken with cheese on a bed of pasta. And fresh lime soda to go with all of this.
As soon as the food arrives you will be a little alarmed with the quantity because it seems like you won't be satisfied. Though it's not as less as it looks because it is presented in a very compact manner but the quantity of the portions must be worked upon with more veggies and mashed potato maybe.
Lat me Chicken: this dish had six pieces of chicken which were crispy and tasty. Nothing out of the ordinary but good nevertheless.
Smoke chicken with pepper Coulis steak: It had two chicken leg pieces cooked in red sauce on a bed of mashed potato. The sauce was very well cooked with the dominant taste of pepper and the chicken teamed up with the sauce and potato tasted pretty good.
Pan Grilled Bhetki with baby roasted potato:
This dish would be my pick of the evening. The quality of the bhetki was awesome. It was juicy and soft and very well cooked. However the portion being really less. You'll be left wanting for more.
Chicken with cheese on a bed of pasta: This dish was extremely filling. Though the expectations were a lot higher. But if you're a cheese and pasta fanatic,this is just the dish for you.
All of this was served with complimentary bread rolls.
All in all it is a beautiful place to hang out with friends and family. The music adds to the glamour of the place. But what stands out in the place is the modest price. We had all of these for just a little over 2000 rupees. Great going,Tolly tales. Apart from the quantity of the portions being a little less than satisfactory, this place is great to dine at.

After being bored of the Lansdowne Food Festival at Salt Lake,suddenly dropping in at Tolly Tales was worth a decision.First of all,the food was awesome....the staff,very much cordial.....they helped us a lot with the food options.Starting with Virgin Mojito,we were served peanuts to munch on as the starter Beer Batter Fried Fish was being prepared. Coming on to the main course,the Smoked Chicken with Pepper Coulis Steak was superb with the vegetables perfectly boiled....the chicken was perfectly cooked and Pan Grilled Bhetki with Roasted Baby Potato was also excellent....very light and vegetables perfectly boiled. Liking the food,we even ordered Onion Kulcha and Chicken Kurma for parcel.Coming on to the final stage that is the desserts,Fried Ice Cream was better than what I had tasted at Benjarong and Hot Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream was really superb......overall the experience was an excellent one.....the only disadvantage I found was the narrow lane leading to the restro but as it was Saturday,we luckily got a convenient parking space just in front of the entrance....looking forward to enjoy their buffet which was a suggestion from the restro staff only.....

Firstly if I criticize this place, don't take me too seriously. This place was grateful to oblige us with food very late at night, when no one would. So thanks tolly tales.

Coming to the point, it's an interesting decor and as you must've guessed it's movie themed. (Don't have any wrong feelings if you see the picture of deb!!!) . We ordered a bacon wrapped prawn with a chicken starter, and kept it simple for the mains with butter chicken and naan. The prawn was a disappointment. But again as I said at that late a time, you are thankful you at least got food.

One more thing which striked is the staff. They are so friendly and well behaved. Affording smiling faces after a hard day's work really takes a toll. So yes, kudos!

This place will give you a homely feel. And I am very glad that such places are coming up in this city. Look forward to visit again. Cheers!

Yet another eating out location added to my list of favourites. The ambience, the decor, the food, the hospitality- everything was perfect.
In the afternoon they have happy hours, so alcohol is a bit inexpensive. I loved their music collection. I went there with my besties and we had a perfect afternoon. We ordered Chicken Parmessani with egg, Smoke chicken with pepper coulis steak and Risotto of chicken with veg. Every item was tasty but the smoke chicken was delectable. It's a must try. All in all, a wonderful experience being there.

Dropped in at this place a couple of days back for lunch.Situated near the Southern Avenue crossing in the lane opposite the Indian Post office, this new and happening place does pack a punch.Though the place is a bit dimly lighted and seemed to have a gloomy ambiance at first, gradually we became accustomed to it.Place is quite big and can house around 30-40 people at a go.Staff is courteous and well mannered.But what really stands out is the quality and deliciousness of the delicacies served.All the items are extremely tasty and can delight our taste buds to the maximum.However, the time taken to serve the dishes is way too long and we ended up waiting for a really long time before we could enjoy the delicacies.Overall a decent new addition to the city's already rich and diversified food hub..few minor flaws are there but definitely the place is here to stay and delight people.

Visit to tolly tales was a tale indeed... Right from the entrance you will be in a different world all together. That Hand pulled Rickshaw on the roof to film posters all around to Dev and the Maestro Mr. Satyajit Ray's black and white oil paints, its my kinda ambiance. I so loved the place. And come to the selection of songs playing in the back ground. Its my playlist of all those soft rock numbers. It was all so cozy. Coming to the food they have a variety to offer and we ended up ordering a salad (Fried fish and egg yellow trio) and Smoke chicken with pepper coulis steak. The quality was too good and was cooked to perfection. The Chicken steak was so very tender. The staffs were really courteous to take account of the quality of the food and if we were happy with the place. That's really worth mentioning.  Price is ok but they have too look into the quantity they serve in comparison to the price. The salad was too less at that price. Otherwise overall a great experience . Would visit back soon.

Unappetizing and horrible food. It felt as if the hero of each dish was tomato ketchup! Our server did not care about any of our requests or suggestions  about the dishes. There is a huge scope for improvement!

Southern Avenue and the nearby area is now crowded by food joints but none as interesting as this one. 
The interior is done up in a way that somewhat feels dated but ultra comforting at the same time.
Lets talk food.
I had ordered a pizza along with a glass of fresh lime.
The pizza was, to be honest... amazing. Thin crust lots of veggies topped off with generous amounts of cheese. 
Fresh lime was perfectly refreshing. 
I then ordered a falafel wrap.
Now this wrap just blew me away as I was expecting a usual shawarma which it wasn't.
Perfectly plated wrap accompanied by amazingly crispy onion rings and fries was served and damn... it was tasty. It wasn't overwhelmingly soggy like a usual shawarma and the pita was thin and light. 

Highly recommended. üëç #ZenFood

I first went to Tolly Tales with a couple of foodies for our monthly meet. As usual we had a pre set menu available to us where in the vegetarian selection we had - Falafel with hummus , Crispy chili baby corn, Cheese balls, Paneer Lababdar, Bilaiti Sabji  , Veg biryani and Bread basket. After a long time I came across a place which actually made the cheese balls instead of serving the McCain ones. The babycorn was perfectly crisp and the cheese balls were quite nice. The falafel by itself was ok but the sandwich version was kinda strange. I loved the bilaiti sabzi a whole lot more than the paneer one. Even the veg biryani was quite decent. In desserts we had Caramel custard  and Chocolate Brownie. The brownies stole the show for me as they had this home made cake flavor to them and Im extremely partial to that taste. 

Overall I liked the place more for the ambiance than the food. Which is not to say that it is bad in any manner. There are some things that they do really well like the bilaiti sabzi. Recently I went back for the mango festival they are holding and the mango, paneer and kasundi sabzi is simply amazing and unlike anything I have ever tasted. They offer you a mixed bag of stuff when it comes to taste and since they are fairly new it is expected.  Do check out the mango festival as they some interesting stuff going on in that.

Visited here two days before with my best friend to catch up over a long due conversation. This restaurant is situated just opposite to the Xrong place. The decor is really nice as the name suggests. The walls are decorated with the photographs of our tollywood actors and actresses and different movie posters along with graphiti done over the walls. The perfect lightings gave an extremely cozy feeling while enjoying the drink. Coming to food we opted for their happy hours which comprised of 4 fosters @ Rs. 400 along with it we ordered pork in oyester sauce from appetizers. It tasted good. The music was perfect and the staffs were courteous. Overall, we had a great evening here.

In one word I can describe Tolly Tales is overrated...me with my gang was gone there in hoping for fun & good food but disappointed though staffs were courteaus,  food was average we had ordered for many items out of those main course dishes really tastes like roadside takeaway counters nothing extraordinary cheese kulcha, tolly tales chicken tikka masala , peas pulao & bharta ....though their beer batter fish was amazing to taste...decor & ambience thumbs up but  I guess they believe in keeping their AC off as even after requesting them to turn temperature low they didn't bother to pay any heed...

Nice little place in Southern Avenue. South Kolkata anyway faces a dearth of good places to enjoy an alcoholic beverage complimented with some lovely food, thus a refreshing change ! Not priced too high as well. Had the Kancha Aam fish fry as well as the zafrani kebab both were great ! If your in the area a good place to drop by !

"Pathetic" is such an understatement. I have no idea about there quality of food in case of Ala Carte...but don't try the buffet. Starters were fine though not upto the quality I had expected. Main course is just not upto the mark. They have a strange combination of Chinese and Indian which sounded fine but the service, the taste, the portions and almost everything will thoroughly disappoint. Finally the nail in the coffin...the mango firni which the manager was vouching on. Having a sweet tooth I love everything which forms part of this section but alas!!! the mango firni came and I can bet on my life I have never had something so bad calling itself a desert....!!! Don't try buffet in this place...P.S. Another strange thing the manager said that they don't charge tax for buffet so they won't accept card payment. But finally they accepted payment by card. I don't know whether he was trying to fool the customer, the owner of the place or he himself was out of his minds while making such a comment. 2 out of 5 for the ambience, soothing music and one Bacardi white rum/ Mojito that they are offering in buffet. For food it's a big zero out of 5.

Finding out a break from work and meeting fellow mates on a luncheon is a bliss in these hectic schedules , and trying out a long time wishlisted eatery is the best way we make our day. And so it was in last mid week , we checked in the much talked about Deb's restaurant Tolly tales near deshapriya.The decor has a filmy touch with few tons of film posters on beige brick walls, a bar counter at one end, gloomy lighting from the hanging bulbs, some bengali fm channel playing in background . The staff seemed to be courteous and efficient but took pretty a long time to serve the food. We ordered for three items : LAMB MOUSSAKA , GARLIC TOSSED SEAFOOD PIZZA , SMOKE CHICKEN WITH PEPPER COULIS STEAK.
The dishes were really well made , the only thing that saddened us were the portions. The moussaka that charged 360++ came in a quantity of a small inverted bowl, the pizza had a personal size diameter with four pieces.
The only dish worth recommending was the Smoke chicken steak, two well portioned breast and leg peices very well seasoned , moist and tender with some gooey mashed potato was definitely a real good stuff than the rest. I wanted a cheesecake that had a blueberry or raspberry compote as written on the menu , but on asking we were said the compote is missing , they can just serve the vanilla flavoured cheesecake. Silly thing! So we spent 1200 bucks but came out not even half fed due to the ridiculously compromised portions. It would be good if the management gets my point , and resize thier portions to make them worth paying for our future visits.

With amazing interiors to boast of, this place was a major let down when it came to food. Apart from the Caesar Salad which was still fair in taste, the Roasted Pork was very coarse, and the less i say about the Fish we took, the better. The name of the dish was Fish La Meuni√®re. First the fish they served was stale. We asked them to change, which they very reluctantly and hesitantly did. The next time they served the fish, it was just the oil part of the fish and not meat. The fillet was filled with oil and not meat, I repeat. It was a lunch date gone wrong. And, the sadder part was that this place was my recommendation to a friend.

One word to describe this place...BHAAT. Food is poorly prepared and awful in taste. We had BEER BATTER FISH (3.5/5), FISH LA MENUIRE (1.5/5) too salty with no seasoning, very dry from the inside, SMOKED CHICKEN WITH PEPPER COULIS STEAK(1.5/5) steak overcooked, rather burnt, usage of low quality tomato sauce, very dissapointing. Even the cocktails BLUE HAWAIIAN and MARGARITA were poorly prepared. A word of advice to the management, usage of good quality photos of the ingenious creations of legends like SATYAJIT RAY and RITWIK GHATAK with crap food like this is totally unacceptable.

The ambience is good.. These days off late one gets to see such interiors a lot.. Use of simple, cheap yet interesting stuff.. It's on the ground floor of an old house converted into a restaurant..
Coming to the food part.. Well.. I personally din't like it.. I had ordered veg lasagne & I was a lil surprised to see the tiny stoop of something on the plate.. I have tried lasagne at a lot of places but it never was this little & tasted so..... bland!!
To top it all, the person serving, tried to serve it & it was all a mess..
Trust me I was pissed to the core..
I wouldn't be going here again for sure!
Pst... My observation.. Mostly people go here for the great deals on beer..

We chose the buffet lunch which was quite nice and was served at our table. The food was good especially the hakka noodles and the chilly prawns. The caramel custard was a winner. Loved the service. The staff was really helpful. Highly recommended if you want to experience something which will stay with you.

It was on the wishlist for pretty long time and finally got the chance to visit last weekend. Located bang opposite to Xrong Place, its not at all difficult to look for it. The interior is themed on classics of indian cinema especially bengali... Oops did i see some posters of recent bengali craps... Period.Nevertheless decent interiors with giant screen showing ipl matches.The place has got amazing round the clock offers on booze and decently priced. Service was prompt and courteous. Coming to food, well the management should give a serious food for thought on the quality on offer. We ordered for beer battered fried fish(8 pieces @‚Çπ300)-nothing special for a signature dish,fish la meuniere (‚Çπ370)- the most disappointing meuniere you will ever have in the town,mixed haka noodles(‚Çπ230) and pan fried chilli prawn (‚Çπ300)-nothing praiseworthy and tasted just okeyish.

Tolly Tales came as big surprise . I am all for quirky , but thus is very tastefully done , one can see the love for cinema . when you enter , you are welcomed with the camera once used by Satyajit Ray ... followed by a lot of movie posters , i particularly liked the mirror with studio rainbow lights .¬†

The service is very warm and friendly . the staff is courteous and serves with a smile .¬†

Coming to recommendations do try the falafel with hummus and the cheese balls , vegetarians are sure to love this . even the crispy chili babycorn is decent .¬†

For the non vegetarians , The chicken tikka , the lat me kai , the twice cooked chicken ¬†are great starters .¬†

There are some nice mains as well . I really liked the malabar fish curry and for vegetarians the vilaiti sabzi is really good too . the chicken tikka butter masala was very tasty too .¬†Overall the place is not very heavy on the pocket and serves food which is delicious . ¬†Go there on a weekday , its not too busy and the service is fast ¬†and please click a lot of pictures , the interiors are stunning !¬†

Cheers !

Wonderful decor. Neatly done. Film industry themed restaurant. Sport screening is an adde bonus. Very responsive and courteous staff. But that's about it. Coming to the main part i.e food. Quite average. Nothing to boast about. We took Dragon chicken, Lat me chicken, Fish in beer batter fry and chip. All just about okay.

But the pros of the place is cheap alcohol and more happy hours. And another is the free assured gift u get if u order 2 large peg of blender's pride whisky. We got a coffee mug and 2 leather card-cash holder. :)

Go there for the alcohol. Worth it. Tread with caution with the food. !

Interesting decor. Average alcohol prices which is good. But the food is a real let down. The biriyani is a disaster. Raan biriyani has nothing to do with an actual raan. We had rib pieces and too much rose water. Please avoid. The kakori was hard and have the impression of being some days old. The pizza had a very hard crust... You had to find chicken with magnifying glass and unduly spicy. I will recommend the special keema and the garlic naan. Please avoid pudina parantha... They have no idea of how to make that one.
The service is very good though the place has a shortage of menu cards

Tolly Tales was the venue of our food group's latest meet up.This movie themed restaurant stays true to the cinema loving Bengali traditions. The ambiance and overall vibe of this place is bound to attract your fancy. The posters of Bengali movie stalwarts and iconic Bengali movies, the reel camera and the bar covered with cassettes and cameras all give this place a different dimension all together.

Coming to the food,we started off with the lat me kai chicken which was very different to the versions you would have elsewhere. It was slightly bland with a hint of coconut and soft succulent pieces of chicken. As a lover of non spicy food I quite liked this dish. The crispy chilli fish was a tad soggy. The quality of the fish was nice and fresh. The chicken tikka was delightfully tender and juicy. It was a little on the spicier side. Considering the other starters were a little bland this rather spicy chicken tikka was a big hit amongst all.

The veg starters comprised of falafel with hummus,crispy chilli babycorn,cheese balls. The cheese balls were excellent and we ended up gobbling them up one after the other. The babycorn was about decent. Although the falafel sandwich was disastrous , the plain falafel with hummus was lovely. The hummus was one of the best I have had anywhere.

For mains, we had the oriental style chicken steak, the ghost biryani, malabar fish and paneer lababdar. The Oriental style chicken steak was pretty average with way too much salt in it. The Ghost biryani was decent and the mutton was well cooked. The malabar fish with good quality fresh fish in a coconut flavoured creamy gravy was lovely. The Paneer lababdar was another preparation which was rich and full of flavours and something we all liked.It went really well with the nan.

Desserts comprised of caramel custard and chocolate brownie.Both of them though nothing extra ordinary were pretty standard fare.

They have a pretty well stocked bar and at a very decent pricing too. The management offered us Chivas regal as part of our deal which i felt was a very generous gesture from their part. I sampled a few of their cocktails too and they were quite nice too.

The staff are swift and very helpful. The pricing on the whole is rather reasonable. They have a private dining section if you have a group of about 10-20 people or so. The giant screen gives this place a provision for movie screenings may be. They also have an attractive lunch buffet offer going on at a very pocket friendly price which i guess would be another good deal.

Tolly Tales is a relatively new place to have come up with a lot of potential. There are a few issues that can be looked at but overall this place impressed us with the ambiance vibe and also the quality of the food. We had an enjoyable time here.
Cheers!

There have been many "film themed" restaurants in the country but very rare have I come across an establishment that stays true to its cultural heritage, bringing Cinema to the forefront and Tolly Tales is one such establishment.

Staying true to it's name, the restaurant takes you down memory lane of the evolution of Bengali Cinema in its own distinctive ways.
You'll find the iconic film reel camera resting on a wooden tripod and spotlights right as you enter; making you feel like a star. Step right in and you're surrounded with hand painted film posters of the bygone days dawning the walls, table mats and coasters or old cassettes and portable reel cameras making a beautiful 3D collage down at the bar.

But a dining experience isn't complete without food so here goes an honest take for the same. First of all being called Tolly Tales makes me wish the speciality was Bengali Cuisine or maybe something that was quite close to the hearts of big stall worths like Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen, Satyajit Ray or Ritwik Ghatak. Serving Chinese, Continental and North Indian just makes them another run of the mill joint. 
Coming back, as a part of the Food Blogger's meet we were served the following:

For starters there was Crispy chilli babycorn, Falafal with Hummus, Cheese balls, Chicken tikka, Lat Mei Kai and Crispy Chilli Fish.

For Main Course there was Paneer Lababdar, Bilaiti sabji, Malabar Fish curry, Oriental Chicken Steak, Raan/Veg Biryani And an assorted bread basket.

While the portions of the starters were disappointing, what I ended up fancying were the Chicken Tikkas and the Falafal with Hummus. The Lat Me kai was a complete disaster- Extra hard and crispy, making it impossible to consume.

The Biryani and the Malabar fish curry were a delight to savour but what stood out as the absolute favourite amongst our group was the Paneer Lababdar - Succulent and full of flavour. The rest of the dishes in all honesty didn't catch my eye or my pallet and something I wouldn't take a second glance on quite frankly.

Coming to the desserts, we were served Caramel Custard and Chocolate Brownie. Again nothing quite exceptional to rave about but decent in flavour nonetheless.

I won't be too harsh on my verdict and will be elated in saying the service was commendable. Will I return again? Well surely for the ambiance and the warmth. Food comes secondary. But please do give this a visit nonetheless.

Tolly Tales was one of the restaurants which was there in my wishlist for the last couple of months. I finally had a coincidental chance of dining out there yesterday night. Below is my detailed review on various parameters of this outlet :

LOCATION : Located on the Sarat Banerjee Road or what I call is the new happening lane of the Sarat Bose Road. To put it more conveniently, the outlet is located in the same lane opposite to Xrong Place and beside Calif.¬†

DECOR AND AMBIENCE : A one of a kind decor implying the pre-independent Bengal ¬†(as are its walls, the ceiling angular designs, the switches and other accessories) with the who's who of Tollywood and their posters imprinted all over. The ambience is lively with proper sound systems and projector in place. So, the decor and ambience aspect gets a full mark.

FOOD : We ordered for the following :
Chicken Tikka Kebab - Too hard for a kebab. So not recommended.
Beer Batter Fried Fish - A good one. Soft and succulent with subtle flavor. So, recommended.
Chicken Popcorn - A replica of what Colonel Sanders produces and that is definitely not what I looked for. I was expecting a twist, but they kept it the same conventional way. Taste is okay though.
Raan Biriyani - Very bad with simply blatant taste. Only the mutton was soft and was cooked well. So, didnt like it.
Mutton Rogan Josh - The best of them all ! Brilliantly cooked with a zip and tang. A highly recommended dish from my side.
Tolly Tales Tikka Masala - An okayish Tikka Butter Masala just like what is found in any other Mughlai restaurant. so nothing special, yet not bad.
Mocktails (Chef's special and Virgin Mojito) - Both are presented well but tasted okayish due to the strong Tulsi like flavor of coming from both of them.
Fried ice-cream - I had it for the first time in Kolkata after I had it in Bangalore. A very well made dessert with superb taste.

SERVICE : The person who took our order was a decent guy who served us really well. Besides, the lady at the reception as well as the lady serving us drinks were very cordial in their interaction. So, all in all, we received a satisfactory service.

So, to conclude, I would request the restaurant to pull their socks in the culinary part to make a mark. The other aspects seemed well in place to go high up. So, cheers to the team and keep rocking !

Tolly Tales...the name speaks for itself. This new restaurant opposite Xrong Place welcomes you with an antique Camera used by the legend Satyajit Ray and old film magazines all around the ceiling...The walls of the main dining area are covered with paintings of Dev and other Bengali legendary actors. Overall, the ambience will really give you a feeling of the old studios of Bengali films...really appealing and charming.
Coming to the food, we ordered chicken kebabs and fish..taste is quite good..In the main course, biryani didn't taste good to me..it lacked the awadhi flavor..potato was not well cooked..but the mutton was soft and juicy..mutton rogan josh and tolly tales tikka masala were fantastic...
At last I would like to comment about the service of the waiter...it didn't satisfied me..while serving they spilled some food...no spoon at the table..
Verdict : I would recommend Tolly Tales as the Ambience will really give you a different feeling..Food is Good..U can give a try..!!!

I absolutely loved the vibe and decor of the place as soon as I stepped in. Its obvious a lot of thought and attention has gone into doing up the place. The rickshaw suspended overhead , Satyajit Ray's imposing camera , the bar covered with Cameras and the door with old audio tapes , the movie posters all add to the atmosphere. ¬†Its a lovely place to chill out and has a nice private dining area as well incase your a group of 15 odd people. They also have a lunch buffet that is very pocket friendly daily though I have yet to try it out.
I dropped by with a couple of friends and though service was a bit slow but most of what we ate was very nice. I loved the Cheese Balls and Crispy Chilli Babycorn was also quite good. The Chilli Chicken was good and would pair well with a drink.The Mutton Seekh Kebab and Paneer Tikka were good but not great I felt they could have had more depth of flavor.
Overall I had a good experience .... a good place to hangout with friends I look forward to going back for a full course meal there as this visit we just had starters.

The first line i would like to mention about this place is the ambience and the choice of music...dimlit..beautiful bengali songs like "amar mwote tor moton keu nei", √∂ gaanwala" and more...
Coming to the waiters and service, well not so fast and it would have been great if they wouldnot have stared constantly!
the walls are beautiful...
coming to the main thing err food, the bacon wrapped prawn was good, so was italian smooch...the mushroom starter was too spicy for me....the chicken steak was okay-ish so for food exclusively it will be a 3..but that xtra .5 for the ambience! :)

Tolly tales surprised me. I walked in expecting a fancy restaurant with not much substance but was bowled over by the quality of food.
The d√©cor of the place is very tastefully done with rickshaws, movie posters, cameras , cassettes and even a movie camera of the one and only Satyajit Ray. In fact the d√©cor takes u back so much to the bygone golden era of Bengali cinema that the new music system on the walls stands out as a sore thumb.
For the starters the tai pai chicken was absolutely amazing with just a touch of coconut and really juicy tender chicken. The crispy chilli fish was a bit soggy the first time but on the second batch they were absolutely perfect! The chicken tikka was again perfectly cooked but a bit over spiced in my opinion.
The veg starters were great as well with delectable crispy cheese balls and a great hummus. But the Mediterranean type sandwich was a total letdown and the crispy chilli baby corn was OK at best.
For the mains the oriental style chicken steak
was bad with way too much salt thrown in. It was a bad slip up in a line of near perfect dishes. The gosht biryani followed which was perfectly cooked again with succulent mutton pieces. The Malabar fish served with it was absolutely mesmerising with its creamy coconuty flavour. The paneer labardar was a hit as well paired with the butter naan.
I opted for the pina colada which I found to be over creamed with no coconutty flavour at all. The mojito was good.
The desserts consisted of caramel custards and brownies both of which were nicely done .
Service is prompt, friendly and obliging. A special mention to the giant screen and projector which would be great for a movie if they wish to screen one .
Cheers to tolly tales!

Decor and ambience is great. Loved the songs they played all along. 
Staffs as well as service are very pleasing.
Coming to food; we had ordered a plate of seasame dust chicken as a starter which was being served with a white sauce. Tasted great! In the main course; chicken hakka noodles was average taste wise but quantity was indeed good. Lemon chicken tasted perfect and can be a very good choice for the ones who want to avoid spice. 
On the whole it was a lovely lunch out there and is a stand out amongst the themed restros in the city.
Its a must try :)

My friend told me to give this place a try. I had no idea that it is owned by Dev the Tollywood Actor. It is a themed restaurant where you see wallpapers , stickers , small billboards of famous and iconic Bollywood and Tollywood movies.
There is a giant wall painting of Dev and Satyajit Ray the famous director who is world famous and known to every individual in Bengal irrespective of caste , creed and economic status.

Coming to the food here are the following items we tried:

‚ô° Starters:

# Tandoori Aloo - It was soft and tender , made well had a good flavour attached to it.

# Fish Fry - loved it. Soft and chewy , quantity of fish was good.

# Dream Chicken - This item was exquisite , we thought it was fish because it was so tender and melted right away as it approached our taste buds. It certainly was superb.

#Chicken Soup - One of the best Chicken Soups I have had in a long time. It had a distinct aroma which bewitched me and made me crave for more.

#Virgin Mojito - Nothing special , its like you get in other joints but the quantity was good.

‚ô° Main Course:

# Mixed Chowmein - Went for the Veg Mixed Chowmein it was excellent.

#Cauliflower In Chilli Sauce - Wow , this item was really good didn't except it to be so good.

#Schezwan Chicken - Yummy and delicious but it was not cooked well as it felt raw in some bites.

# Prawn Curry - This was the best by a country mile , though it was a little cold.

#Red Rice (Thai Rice) - This item has to be my least favourite , didn't like it at all.

‚ô° Desserts:

# Cheese Cake - Tasted ordinary not that good. Satisfactory to be honest.

#Chocolate Icecream - Yummy , best way to end a meal I guess.

Overall a very good experience. Cheers!

Visited for dinner on May 7th.

Easy to locate.
I waited for 10-15 minutes till I got a table for four. The manager at the gate helped me get the table faster.

It is a theme based restaurant and therefore the interior was eye pleasing. It takes you back to the golden era of cinema. 

I ordered for 2 portions of Mushroom Trifolati (starter) as it was recommended to me by a lot of people. It was lip smacking. Very tasty. Beware, those who can't bear a spicy treat. I found the quantity too less though.
Fresh Lime Soda was rightly prepared.
They lack variety in their menu. That's one drawback.
For the Main Course I ordered for a Lemon Chilli Barley Risotto and Spinach & Ricotta Cannelloni, both being really good in taste. You could actually sense the flavour used. The quantity, again, seemed less to me.

One other major drawback was the service. It was really slow. The dishes took so long to come that we couldn't eat to our heart's content.

We paid ‚Çπ1,036/- , so the pocket pinch is not hard. It would be advisable to increase the rates if that means increase in the quantity served per dish as well.

It was a good experience amidst the Tales of T/B-ollywood!üé¨

Ambience of the place is excellent although at times the music tends to get too loud.

The biggest disappointment is the staff, they are very raw and lack antiques to serve guests. Service staff do not know how to speak politely with guests giving an impression of them being temp hires that caterers  use.

Would like to come back provided the quality of staff improves otherwise there are many more options in Kolkata.

Located in Sarat Bose Road, right opposite Xrong place, Tolly Tales is a new restaurant In the fun dining space.
The place has a quirky and fun vibe to it.
Tollywood posters, the ceiling installation and the quirky richshaw installation add an interesting depth to the interiors. The hanging lights, white rugged walls, dim interiors are definitely something to watch out for.
I was here yesterday for snacks and drinks and here goes my experience-

Between the three of us, we ordered
DRINKS:
2 beers, 2 Polar bears ( mango and litchi based mocktail, blended with ice cream). The mocktail was delicious and quite filling

APPETIZERS:
Mushroom Trifolate which is sauteed assorted mushrooms ( three types) tossed in olive oil, garlic, chilli and lemon! Was a very very good dish and I literally licked the plate of this one!

The crispy chilli baby corn was spicy and crispy and tasted very well!

We were in no mood to order main course but the staff seemed adamant in making us order some. ( I didnt like this behavior). Overall service however was okay.

We spent 880 for our evening so prices are fairly decent.

Will return again to try out the main course.

Cheers!

Located right opposite to xrong place, the carefully planned out decor in accordance with the theme and the low lit ambience is a treat for the eyes. At the entrance, the ceiling is decorated with books of acclaimed Bengali literature that have inspired some masterful movies. The walls are hung with framed posters of timeless classics of bengali cinema as well as potraits of famous tollywood persona, that we know only too well. Coming to the food, it was not as impressive as the decor, however it did not disappoint as well. The sesame dust chicken was good, but what we liked best was the lamb shanks with@ peloney sauce, even better than the oriental chicken steak which could have used a little refinement with the taste. The dessert (cottage cheesecake with rasperry sauce) was a disappointment though, it was more cream that actual cheesecake. The staff is very cordial..and the service is prompt which will again warm you up to the place. Kudos to the management!!

Situated very conveniently in the by lanes of southern avenue, it is just opposite to the Xrong Place.....a restaurant that belongs to tollywood superstar Deb, the name is extremely apt with the interiors, the cameras, the lights and the Easter year and new tollywood posters....the dim light and music in the backdrop is perfect to set the mood for a cozy dinner with some drinks....

we ordered kakori kebab, beer batter fish, half roasted chicken, penne with shrimps (happy that they called it shrimps and not prawns) polar beer for my wife which is supposed to be some mocktail and a beer for myself and french fries for my son...coming to the food one by one, the beer batter fish had the best quality of fish but the batter could have been better and the fish lacked seasoning/ enough marinating....the crunch was missing and the fish lacked the lemon punch but the fish itself was so good that it still was great to eat...8 pieces for about 280 is good value for money....kakori kebab was juicy and fresh out of the oven though i personally don‚Äôt like the reddish color for kebabs which are served across restaurants, ou can understand by the picture given....the penne with shrimps was smooth and creamy and tasted great...simple dish and great results and again more than enough for 1 person, however should have been served with some accompaniments like garlic breads.....half roasted chicken was again very good in portion and presentation....chicken breast and leg on top of mash surrounded by mushroom sauce and some vegetables like spinach and beans....the spinach was a letdown which tasted like simply boiled without any seasoning....just a mere toss in garlic butter with little seasoning and nutmeg would have made a big difference....it should have been wilted spinach instead of normal blanched spinach....the chicken otherwise was tender and juicy.....

service was pretty prompt and the servers had a smile in their face....they just need to know the menu a little better, like portion size, sauces etc but then they may b new and i don‚Äôt mind till the time they don‚Äôt give wrong information and check with the kitchen.....overall we had a great time and was very impressed with the setting....gave it a score of 4.5 because i think it can still improve little things in their food section which otherwise is great....keep up the good work....CHEERS!!

Located across the road from Xrong Place, Tolly Tales is a surprisingly spacious restaurant with a great ambience. It combines old-world detailing and cinema posters to great effect in a contemporary setting.

We went there earlier this month as part of a foodie meet. The hummus and falafel were my favourites from the night. The lat me kai and chicken tikka were packed with flavour. Points also for the bilaiti sabji, which had a wonderful smokiness to it. The rann biryani was decent as well.

What missed the mark for me was the oriental chicken steak‚Äîthe piece I got was a bit dry. The falafel sandwiches that came at the start did not work either‚Äîthe bread was dry and falling apart, and hence did serious disservice to the filling. 

Both the desserts we tried‚Äîcaramel custard and chocolate brownies‚Äîwere excellent. The brownies especially were moist, not overly sweet, and totally yum.

Located at the heart of southern avenue right beside Xrong place, This themed restaurant has an enigmatic feel to it....
1: Service excellent, the staff are communicate and apt,very good with their suggestion and do their work to the hilt.
2: I simply am in love with the decor,the theme as per the name is based in Bengali film industry with a rustic retro studio feel to it. Wall graphitti of Film Industy legends adorns different walls along with film posters framed up reminding of the golden moments of different eras, along side a mirror set up in studio mirror theme welcomes the selfie lovers.

3: Food is simply delicious,be it starters or main course,they have done a fab job and the pricing is brilliant alongside the bar is well stocked up to quench your thirst and during match days they have a large screen for the sports freaks aswl. Keeping in mind large groups who want to celebrate occasions they have a specific small lounge area segmented including tv screen which ensures you and your group isnt disturbed at all.

4: We ordered pan grilled bhetki with baby roasted potatoes and Half roast chicken with mashed potatoes & mushrooms,along with aerated drinks. I simply loved the bhetki as they grilled it to perfection with the potatoes and the sauce adding the right taste that made it a sheer delight to dig in,this folks is a must try for all,simply delicious to say the least,coming to the ¬†roasted chicken well lets just say it was delicious to say the least,they whole preparation in the right process ensure that the roasted chicken still had tenderness it should alongside the trademark feel of the dish captures your palate.¬†5: The bill came upto 900+ inclusive of all taxes which I must say is fab,keeping in mind the quality and quantity they cater,this is a must must try joint hands down anytime if you want a good meal.

The experience depends totally on the mindset u go with. The pub menu is pretty limited, conservative choices. 
But the food, although limited in variety is mind blowing. The bacon wrapped prawn comes in my dreams and the seafood pizza and galawti kebab will definitely be my repeat orders.
In other things, the location is fantastic. Right opposite xrong place and the price is unbelievably reasonable.

This place has been on my bucket list for quite some time, and what attracted me to it in the first place was the interiors. I was not disappointed. One has to visit to understand what I'm talking about. The ambience was extremely good. The staffs are well-behaved and very helpful. On the menu there is a mix of Continental, Chinese and Indian. Not much of Bengali cuisine, though. They also serve cocktails, mocktails and other hard drinks. We tried some dishes from the ala-carte menu - Fish Tikhia, Cheese Kulcha, Tolly Tales Tikka Masala and Rann Biriyani along with some drinks. No complaints about th@at. It might be on an expensive side for some, but its definitely worth a try. Especially if you are a movie buff and one of the filmy types. The location is favourable too, just opposite Xrong Place.
PS: Don't miss out on the original camera that Satyajit Ray used to shoot Pather Pachali!

We were a group of 5, and after hearing so much about this place thought of giving it a try. We went there last night for dinner, we ordered beer batter fried fish, dragon chicken and chilli pork for starters, the fish was still good, the chicken had tiny pieces and the pork was nothing extraordinary. In main course we ordered risotto in sea food style, which was the only worth it item, apart from that the mixed Hakka chowmein was bad with no salt in it, mixed fried rice was horrible, it was too dry and tasteless, the hot n sour chicken n human chicken was too less in quantity, like the chicken pieces were tiny, half of the size of a regular chicken piece that we eat in any normal restaurant!! When we ordered desserts fried ice cream n cheese cake were not available on a weekend, so having not much options had chocolate brownie with ice cream, which was okish!! Quantity overall was horrible, food is not at all tasty. The decor is good and the behavior of the staff is friendly but that doesn't give points to this restaurant!! Hugely dissapointed with this place, had expectations but it's completely a myth!! I will not recommend this restaurant to anybody at all!! This place is just over hyped!!

Ambience: Extremely good. Worth a visit just for the ambience. Wall decorations and other artifacts are amazing. The place is owned by Dev, the actor cum MP cum Mahanayok. Ambience rated 9/10.
Food: Menu has a mix of continental, indian and chinese. They have liquor and cocktails as well. Although the name is 'Tolly Tales', the menu lacks Bengali cuisine. Its only in the buffet that you may have bengali dishes. Food rated 7/10.
Price: Not too expensive but be prepared to shed 1500 for two on the ala-carte menu. The buffet is cheaper at 550 although we did not try it.
Location: Great location. Its between Deshapriya and Southern Avenue, opposite Xrong place.

Owned by the superstar himself Dev, this place surely has the Tollywood feel wrapped around it. Located conveniently opposite to The Xrong Place on Southern Avenue, this place is kind of a jack of all trade kinda place catering Indian, Chinese & Continental under the same roof. The place is very elegantly done with a very rustic look with walls painted in white and old school bulbs hanging from the ceilings. You cant help but appreciate some the wall arts specially the one of our very own Satyajit Ray. One more offering at this place are the numerous posters of yesteryear's classics. Dont miss the Vintage movie shooting camera right at the entrance. The music was at the optimum level and i really liked their playlist of bengali old and new movie and band songs.

Now coming to their food, they were serving a lunch buffet reasonably priced at 450/- including a mojito and one of my uncle decided to opt for it. Me and my mom preferred the A-la-Carte as we wanted to have chinese and the buffet was dominated by Mughlai dishes. The starters of the buffet was very ordinary according to my Uncle and even the main course failed to impress him. I tasted a few items and i would surely agree with him. My mother ordered for a portion of Chilli Fish as a starter. The item was tasty but somehow the fish could have been soft and i felt they fried the fish pieces a bit too much. I ordered for a portion of Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. The Fried Rice was absolute worst you can get. Very very dry and every bite felt like a punishment. Even the meat put inside was very tiny in pieces and fried to the extreme thus hampering the taste. The Chilli Chiken was just okayish. The quantity is an issue here. I decided to pack a portion of Mixed Noodles and Hunan Chicken for home. The Noodles was way better than the rice but still a bit dry. The Hunan Chicken was the best of the lot. The white gravy was really tasty but the quantity of cornflour is something that could have been decreased.

Speaking of their cocktail, the Mojito again was a big big disappointment. A bit too much strong for my liking and even lacking the necessary ingredients.

Price of the Chinese items are very less but that is not at all an excuse for the very ordinary dishes. They also have an affinity towards sesame seeds. Dont be surprised if you see them on top of a lot of items irrespective of the cuisine. The menu is also very limited and it can disappoint you.

They need to work a lot to improve their dishes in terms of taste and visual appeal to compliment the ambiance and decor.

The difference between a typical Park Street Restaurant and a typical south calcutta Restaurant is the attitude and Pricing. Tolly Tales is no different. We were there on Bengali New year eve and there was the special bengali cuisine served, which probably was with a target with the restaurateurs !! The food was really good specially their prawns and risotto! But the service was disappointing !! Probably because of the day we went...but still I think a mark of a good place is its quality of service without any prejudice! I really think this place if nurtured well by the promoters will be THE place in southern avenue !! Special mention of the Decor !! Super Decor !!

The Dev factor is a major crowdpuller and I admit it worked for me too. I expected the place to be expensive but was pleasantly surprised at the rates. We got the private lounge for 20 people, but I shall not review based on that experience
¬†
The positives:
1) Food is good, especially Continental
2) Portions are healthy
3) Decor and ambiance are particularly attractive
4) Prices are reasonable¬†

A few negatives too:
1) Chinese food borders on the ordinary

Located in Southern Avenue near to the Mandarin Restaurant.

As soon as we entered, it gave me a pleasant treat to my eyes because of the posters on the walls ! Yes, it has posters of both old Bengali and Hindi movies.
And the Bar counter had different models of cameras. Sets the name 'Tolly Tales' justified. Feels great, right ?

The ambience is good and it was even better as we went for Poila Boisakh Lunch. Staffs were dressed in traditional attires. So you can well imagine how the decor would have been ! Seating arrangements are fine. And it played great musics.

Coming to the Food -
*Starters - Sesame Crusted Chicken and Golden Fried Prawns
*Main Course - Hakka Noodles, Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken and Chilli Fish.
And Fresh Lime Soda, of course !

Sesame Crusted Chicken was good but Golden Fried Prawns lacked in taste.
Fried Rice was good. Hunan Chicken can be improved. Whereas, Chilli Fish was very bad (It had fish scales on it and also smelled bad). Fresh Lime Soda was fine.

Staffs are very reluctant to take the orders, don't have proper knowledge of the Food items available, not so professional as they must be ! So it needs an immediate check.

So, you may visit this place by the Review or the Name or the traditional decor and you won't regret it, Only If they improve certain things and come up with much positivity. :)

A relatively new place in Southern Avenue, I've been trying to visit this place for long. Well located we entered this place for some evening snack! Dimly lit lights, devdas types songs and very thematically decorated place. We had wait for some good time for someone to come and take an order, the person who wore a tie... Assuming he's a manager knew nothing in the menu so he sent someone who knew the menu well to us. We called for a kesar kebab... It was yummy but a little hard. A fish batter fry which was not upto the mark. The man who served us was good to us but at the end the food matters :(

1. The decor is good. Pictures of old movies, attractive bar. But all that glitters isn't gold. 

2. Very laid back service crew ( apart from the manager, who seemed to be a well spoken fellow ). One lady who was a part of the service crew was shouting and telling about her miserable  time she is having while working at this place. Well, whatever she needs to say, can be said at the back area to the manager and not make the manager embarrassed in front of other guests. Don't think she deserves the job. 

3. Very average food. The buffet was absolutely cold and the staff didn't see that the fuel had stopped burning ages ago. The pulao has gone back to it's form of rice. The picture I have uploaded of HALF ROASTED CHICKEN ( if I remember the name correctly) looks attractive only after editing. Well, how on earth can someone be served so much of mashed potato ( without cream and not being so soft ). An absolute NO NO  to so much of mashed potato being served. Too much of green in the chicken item, well it should a combination of flavours, however the bitter taste of the green ( which was served a lot ) spoiled the flavour. 

4. No water served until I asked for a glass of water to save my dying life out of being thristy. 

5. Crowd, well a group of young individuals was present. The way they were behaving and shouting, it seemed that after a lot of trouble they have saved money to come to a restaurant and eat and that's why there is an outburst and outbreak of cheap enthusiasm. Had to inform the manager to ask them to shut up. 

MONEY DOESN'T WORRY ME, TASTE DOES. 

Thank you.

Location: Lane opposite Mandarin Restaurant in southern avenue where Xrong place is located

Ambience and Decor: Perhaps the USP of the place is the decor which is a film studio themed one with posters from tollywood and bollywood sprinkled all over the walls and a fantastically lit ceiling with bulbs and other lights used in film studios. I specially liked the bar decor which was studded with cameras.

Menu and Food: Menu consists of Indian Chinese and Continental.
We ordered Sesame crusted chicken which was good and crispy, the golden fried prawn was not dat good and felt soggy in the crust
The noodle and fried rice were good as is the case in most jonts, the huanan chicken was nice and tasted good but the chilly fish seemed stale and smelt bad. This was something which was unexpected from a big joint.

Service and Staff: Confused staff I would say but courteous, service time is average.

Overall verdict: Can always hop in for the ambience and the music.

Only thing i found strange was a hanging hand drawn rickshaw right at the entrance..  Coming to the food,  had only the continental part of the menu..  The food was good..  Although i found the beer battered fish fries a bit bland..  The pasta was good enough..  And the girls and the guys serving you are very well behaved..  Overall a very good experience..

Located bang opposite south calcutta's famous pub Xrong Place, Tolly Tales is the new kid on the block. The giant screen at the dining area is good for match days. Decor boasts of retro bolly and tolly posters. (I happened to sit at close proximity to the poster which screamt - Iran ki ek raat). We had to ask for water and table napkins. Coming to food: Risotto was a disappointment. So was the dragon chicken whose pieces were smaller than my pinkie which came with absolutely no side garnishes.  Reshmi kebab was a savior. Staff was busy with their internal group discussions and hardly had time for guests. We decided to move out and head to another place. Don't think we are going back to just see the decor and the screen. :)

P.S: Wish stardom ensured good experiences and happy customers.

The decor of the place is impressive. Vintage posters of both bollywood and tollywood , different cameras , cassettes. The washroom is very unique.  But although the background music is according to their theme but I personally don't like loud music while dining. Lets talk about food. The quality is good. They serve indian continental and chinese. We ordered for reshmi kebab for the starter. I would give 4 on 5. We ordered for two mocktails -polar bear and italian smooch. Both were refreshing. For mains we ordered smoke chicken with pepper coulis steak and Fish la meuniere. The fish was really good. But the size of the fillet is medium , thus they serve two medium sized fillet along with bread and veggies.  Fish was very fresh and tender. If you are a weightwatcher the chicken steak is perfect for you. Properly smoked ( thank god not overcooked) and tasty chicken serve in the bed of mashed potatoes with veggies.  Quality is good. Price is reasonable. Give it a visit :)

I went to Tolly Tales today for lunch. The d√©cor is a film buff's paradise-more so for Dev fans because he owns this place. What first greets you as you enter the restaurant  is a camera which was used for filming 'Pather Panchali' by Satyajit Ray. Next comes a hand pulled rickshaw which you may miss if you don't look up because it is placed above on the ceiling. The ambience is that of a film lover's home-the walls have been done up by posters of bengali films both old and new. There is a wall dedicated each to Satyajit Ray and Dev Adhikari.
We tried their lunch buffet and were overall very pleased with the food. The dishes were Indian with a choice of veg and non veg items. The buffet is affordable and the menu includes a beverage, soup,veg and non veg starters as well as mains,rice,bread and finally dessert.
Will definitely visit again.

Tolly Tales will beautifully depict the inside tales of movie. The theme of the restaurant is easy to get from the name. Decorated as a movie set with some painted pictures of actors and posters of some old classic Bollywood and Tollywood movies on the wall. A mirror with colourful lights on the edges, hanging lights as seen in movie sets, many models of old cameras and other decorations of pillars and walls as seen in old houses, all these will take you to another time. Cricket match on the big screen, bengali band music on the background, calm dimmed lights, a perfect blend of everything. All these gives the restaurant cum bar a great ambience to hangout. They provide foods of different cuisines including Continental, Indian or Chinese on the menu. Ordered Chicken Tolly Tales Reshmi Kabab as starters from the Indian menu and for main course checked into the Chinese menu to order Chicken Hakka Noodles and Hunana Chicken. Yummy in taste and reasonable prices. But not much of variety to choose from and felt quantity could have been increased. So won't be able to rate it more than 8 out of 10.

The place is located opposite Xrong place at deshapriya park. We went here recently for some snacks and wernt disappointed by the experience . the ambience and decor is lovely , with the highlight being all those cameras and paintings. The manager was very helpful and gave us a full tour of the place. Coming to the food, it wasnt as exquisite as the decor. There is room for improvement
Pros:
1. Nice place for unwinding 
2. Prominent location
3. The charm and aura of Bengali movies
Cons:
1. Could do a bit more justice to food

Great food, reasonable price, great ambience particularly for the Bengali sentiment and marvellous hospitality.
However, there is scope for improving the quality of Biryani.

A very cozy and wonderful ambience with super decor in tollywood theme. Cinema posters all over, really loved the place. If u go in a big group of more than 7-8 they can give seat in the lounge. It is a very cozy and relaxing place. Since we didn't order any main course,can't comment on the food this time. Among starters, beer batter fried fish is just too good. Simply loved it.
Chicken popcorn is not so good, small pieces of chicken fried not much crunchy. all food had less salt.
Mocktails are very good. I loved the polar bear mocktail...mango and litchi juice with ice cream. Other mocktails are also good.
Price is pretty reasonable, the staffs are very well behaved. Must go for many times now.

Located right opposite xrong place. This place is as the name suggests themed on tollywood and i did like the fact that it was really spacious and well lit. 

We ordered for the mushroom burger and pan fried fish and also had a couple of drinks along with it. The burger was really nice and filling maybe they could add some other sauces other than tomato ketchup and mustard. The pan fried fish was decent as i would have like it to be a bit more spicy and a bit more tender.

The waiter was courteous and helpful. I had a good time.

The place is quite inexpensive as out bill was 600 only. A different place worth giving a try!

I was lucky to discover this place. On the way to The Wall, I found Tolly Tales. First of all, the name is intriguing. So I kept it in my bucket list. Today I visited Tolly Tales, and I was amazed. The interiors were speaking loud about Tollywood, the Kolkata Cinema's alias. The ambience was great, even though there was a private party full of cheeky loud kids. Now the food, we ordered mock tails, Italian Smooch and Virgin Mojito, lipsmacking they were. Next, we had beer battered fish. Amazing! It was served with fries and a tartar sauce. The party got too loud, hence we decided to leave. But I shall be coming soon to savour some more from its menu.l

I have visited this place for about 6-7 times, and have never been disappointed. The decor and ambience are beautiful, especially the posters and the paintings. The staff here is hospitable and courteous and the service is good, as well,. And above all, the food is brilliant. I, personally recommend, the bacon wrapped prawns, beer batter fish fry for starters, lamb chops in continental and patiala gosht in Indian cuisine. Overall, an amazing food joint and highly recommended.

Tolly tales is a good restaurant.. It's not cramped ..it has space for movement .. The ambiance is good.. I liked the way they have done up the washroom.. The chairs could have been bit more comfortable.. We took corona beer , cheese cherry pineapple and corn tikka. The corn tikka was good the cheese wasn't fresh.. Then we took dal dal makhni and roti. Dal was also good. The staff focussed on giving personalised service... They have many places for selfie with posters of the superstar and fans took the snaps ..I will drop in again...

Ambience is the only thing i liked about the place. One negative point in this area are their chairs which are not so comfortable.  Very well decorated which you can see in the puctures attached.Another plus point is the service. Extremely courteous and always on their toes to serve you. We opted for indian dishes and it was kind of ok sort of and  nothing special. The pasta was very tasty though. The cocktails were the worst part. Whiskey sour was not upto the mark..they dont serve tom collins. Price was pretty reasonable comparable to other restos in southern avenue. Overall would recommend it to try it atleast once. Would give a another try to taste their continental nd chinese dishes.

located just opposite to xrong place , Tolly tales is  a surefire winner , when  it  comes to  Moderate Tax rates ( lower than Xrong place & others ) . 

Ambiance is good . The walls are decorated with all time  tolly superhit graffitis & hung pictures . Rather dimly lit for my liking , but more than makes it up with the urbane & hip  crowd of south kolkata .

What makes this place even better is that the 27% WBST is included in the displayed  Menu price of alcoholic beverages . which means there are No hidden Charges . You Pay what you see . Of course They charge VAT & service tax , But that's everywhere .

If you're Lucky you may run into some LIve Band performance as well . 

when we went we found the Fiddler's Band  performing , & yes they aced it . 

coming  to  our  evening  , we were  a small group of 3 & we had both alcohol & food . 

we  started  off  with beer  battered fried fish ( Rs 280 )  & tandoori mushroom ( rs 170 )

The Beer Battered  fish had 8 medium sized chunks & was exquisitely done. The tandoori mushroom was heavenly but had only 8 medium sized mushroom pieces . when i  am paying 170 bucks for a mushroom dish ( + Tax )  I expect more Quantity & portions 

we  later  moved to  mushroom trifolati , which was again  a  huge disappointment , only small  slices of mushroom  there too .  hence i deducted some points .  

in the main course we had 1 plate of nalli ghost ( mutton ) [ Rs 290 ]  & 1 plain naan ( Rs 30 ) . 

the nalli ghost & naan  were satisfactory .

we also drank 4 Small ( 30ml ) pegs of captain morgain = 4X 110= 440

8 small pegs of blenders pride reserve = 8 X 110 = 880

4 thums up -= 60 X 4 = 240 

2 soda = 30 x 2 = 60

= 1620 

¬†+++ Food = 860 

therefore food + alcohol = 2480 + tax = Rs 2749 for  a group of 3 

Overall verdict  : good place with hip urbane crowd & Moderate tax rates .   However Food portions need to improve .

3.5 / 5 from my side 

Cheers !!!

I would recommend this place for a welcome change in Kolkata dineouts as it comes with the following Pros:
1) Unique decor¬†
2) Nice Ambience
3) Courteous staff and not over friendly or too much interfering
4) Good food and authentic..

We tried Crispy Sesame Chicken and zafrani murgh for starters. For the mains we went ahead with Bhetki Grill and Oriental Steak. I must say the Oriental Chicken steak was mindblowing. I cannot comment on the chinese as I could not try them..But I found a steady crowdd everyone coming out well satisfied. Thanks to Dev for being authentic and knowing what he is venturing into.. Only cons is the location is in such a narrrow lane that you feel unsure of a good parking place for your SUV or sedan.

We had Continental fare ~ Fish Muniere & Lamb Moussaka ~ which were very tasty, if a little Indianised with just a little bit more salt, spices and oil than what would have been optimal. The interesting Bengali-movie themed interiors, helpful & courteous staff as well as fast and efficient service added to the charm. Warmly recommended.

Tolly superstar Dev's family venture into the food world, located right opposite Xrong Place  in Sarat Chatterjee Street. The decor is lovely with all the framed film posters, the camera at the entrance, the Satyajit Ray wall mural and all the old models of cameras at the bar! The first time my husband visited with a colleague, Dev  had been humble enough to walk up, shake hands and thank them for visiting. He had been all praises for the place since then, in spite of not being a Dev fan. On my first visit and his second, with our parents this time, we found the place to be decent, well done-up and serving good food; yet nothing to get crazy about, so to say. We had beer battered fish fingers, sesame crusted chicken and mutton sheekh kebab for starters. All were good, though I suggest that portions should be a bit bigger. For the mains, we got a chicken steak for the husband, which he reported to be good. Rest of us shared between ourselves naan, mutton keema and mutton biriyani. I actually liked the biriyani a lot. It had oil-free, white, long grained rice and generous pieces of mutton and potatao ( which had to be taken back to the kitchen and reboiled)! Keema was also tasty. Overall, nothing extraordinary, but nice, decent place. If you are a Dev fan, can visit for a chance to meet him or his family members.

I celebrated my birthday lunch with friends at Tolly Tales. Had rung them in advance asking for a table and they had us seated in the lounge which was very cosy and plush. They greeted us with a chocolate cake on the house with Happy Birthday written on it and provided a candle as well. The decor was stunning...everything has been very well thought out. Must mention the Make-up Mirror as a selfie spot and Ray's camera used to shoot Pather Panchali...really awesome memorabilia.¬†
Coming to the food: the mocktails were yummy and the Tolly Tales Kebab was succulent and cheesy but the Chicken Popcorn pieces were tiny and wasn't all that tasty. For the main course we stuck to continental fare: m friends had the chicken steak with pepper sauce which was delicious, I had the half-roast chicken which was also nice with the meat falling off the bone and the last member of our party had the Lamb shanks with creamy polenta. The last dish was a disappointment as it was all bone and very little meat.¬†
Altogether our experience at this restaurant was memorable and we will surely go back again!

I visited 14fb 2016 with my partner. We had lunch. We wanted to go with me to a different place where we can feel the moment and togetherness. Its was very classic choice by him and impressive . Service very good , and management of that place is very good. I specially wana thanks to manager for giving brief description about the restaurant and provide special attention to each and every customers. It is a Tollywood theme restaurant own by Tollywood star Deepak Adhikari. It was wow buffet by 800 with unlimited food and a glass of red wine /white.
ONE THING I Really WANT TO TELL U GUYS, WHILE U ENTER TO THAT RESTAURANT U WILL B AMAZED BY DISCOVERING A REAL VINTAGE OLD CAMERA OF SATYAJIT RAY . YES IT IS A REAL CAMERA WILL MAKE U FEEL JUST BOOM. üòÇ I loved all the masterpiece 3d painting specially mr. Dev's and and Satyajit rays painting by an artist of mumbai. In shot its very much worthy to visit this place again and again.

Had heard a lot about Tolly Tales and finally went there on Valentine's eve with my husband. I must say that the decor is very nicely made. With all the classic Bengali movie posters , along with some new ones, the camouflaged hand pull rickshaw, the big Satyajit Ray on a wall and a stylish Dev adoring another wall, Tolly Tales justifies its name.
Coming to the food , we had ordered two starters, Double Fried Pork and Bacon Wrapped Prawns. Both were above average. I had expected the pork to be a bit more soft. The cocktails were nice to taste. For the main course, we had ordered Margherita Chicken Pizza and it was quite filling.
The staffs were courteous and trying their bit to deliver their best service to all the guests.
All and all, its a nice place. However, I didnt quite like the music they were playing. I wish they work on that soon. I would like to visit Tolly Tales again.
Just a suggestion - I hope they change the songs they play. Keeping up with the name and decor of the place, old and a few new Bengali movie songs would work just fine.

Tolly Tales brings to you the triple bounty of a great ambience, good food and reasonably-priced liquor/food. Though I just had a starter (Sesame Fried Chicken), the food menu looks quite enticing with a wide range of items, a great place for those who love Continental cuisine. The chicken was juicy, the crust rightly crunchy with the texture of the sesame kept intact. The price point is reasonable and will please foodies as well as those who love their alcohol. The staff is courteous and service prompt. The decor is tastefully done and the restaurant is quite spacious. The framed posters of many movies indeed tell you many tales, a delight for cine lovers. Will definitely be back for more.

Visited this restaurant today, had a lovely time here. Filmy ambiance is charming, staffs are very friendly, serving time is minimal and the food is great. They serve continental, indian and chinese-a true multicuisine restaurant, it would be wonderful if they can add bengali cuisine to their menu as well. We ordered only indian items like fish tikka, chicken reshmi, aloo masala kulcha, pindi chana, murg bharta and some mocktails. All the items were excellent and its quite pocket friendly also, prices are not that steep. Had a wonderful time with family and have desire to go there again in future.

The service was excellent and they have one very efficient and hands on manager by the name Pedro. He makes you special, and gives a service with warmth and sincerity. If you want something away from the regular menu, he calls his chefs and gives you tem@pting choices.

This is an awe inspiring place if you are a movie buff. The intricate designing of the place is to be admired throughout while you're sitting there. 150 odd cameras at the bar counter, one big camera at the entrance. Movie posters all over the walls. The staff is extremely courteous and looks after you all the time.¬†

They had exciting offers on beer and happy hours. The food tastes great and is one of the few GENUINE multi-cuisine restaurants with continental, chinese and Indian stuff and all taste well. After a long time found a place which has apt amount of sugar is desserts - no less no more. Will pay you a visit again, soon!

"Just Superb" is my overall experience once I came out of this place.

Great innovative decor (illumination inside could be more intelligently done so that reading the menu card at times could have been less eye straining)...

Always smiling & attentive stewards & stewardess...prompt service, constant feedback taking & engaging dialogues make you feel special as a customer.

Being a Vegetarian I ordered 'Cheese Ball Spic' 'Vegetable Fritto Misto' & 'Mushroom Trifolati'...my friend ordered 'Beer Batter Fried Fish' & 'Tolly Tales Sheekh Kebab'. Dishes were nicely done.

Price point-wise moderate - 

If they maintain this food quality & over all service standard & courteous nature of the crew - this place is going to be a sure hit - really really soon...

Pork Ribs is a must at Tolly Tales , been there yesterday ... Must say a well crafted and decorated space . The ambience makes you feel as if you are in an Tollywood museum, more so with the essence of all great movies hangouts at large. Satyajit Rays potrayal is brilliance personified , but the missing link is Mahan Nayak Uttam Kumars touch at large.. Could have been more. Only tasted Pork ribs since the initial reviews were good, found it to be absolutely 10/10.... Keep it Up

Walking down the sarat bose road... the name just caught my eyes........ "Tolly Tales".... Ever since I was a child I always have this fancy towards names.... The next step was type down the name in zomato...I entered and the first thing that drove me crazy is the vintage camera,uttam suchitra potrait and the gramaphone disc.... This place surprised me in every step and then I was awestruck after looking at the next wall.... The legend - Satyajit Ray being sketched down and the rest... its inexplicable....plethora of movie posters and the bar designed with cameras..... The food was magnificent and the service was very warming and I do rate 10/10.... Owner of  "Tolly Tales" thanks for this gift to "The City of Joy"....
