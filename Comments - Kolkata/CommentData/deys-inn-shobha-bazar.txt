Tried There Gravy Chou/Chicken Rice/Chilli Chicken and I must say All are Relatively cheap and Tasty! They also don't Compromise with Quantity..

This is a very small joint located at deep inside the shobabazar area towards the A.v school alley road. Its a small fast food joint who serves some decent chinese food for your hunger buds. There is no such sitting available just a bench and few chairs up for grabs beside the shop.
Dropped in here with a friend while we were walking hungry on the streets of Sobhabazar. Tried their Veg Chowmien and Chicken Steam Momo. Chowmien was decent and momo was okayish with the taste, needed more fillings inside whereas the soup was spot on.

A small food joint located at Shovabazar mainly serves Chinese & Tibetan quickbites.

No point for ambience .

Tried Chicken gravy chowmein, which was nice with sufficient quantity along with a low price tag.

Dey's Inn in Shovabazar is close to Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar. I visited here one evening. Food is Chinese here. The outlet is small with very less seating arrangement. I had their Chicken Chowmine and Chilli Chicken. Both the food tasted really good. The chicken pieces were decent in size. Outlet like this serving good quality food at such a low price is hard to find.
Service was good too.

Small food joint situated in Shyambazar AV school area, near to the famous chittaranjan mistanna vandar. There GRAVY CHOWMEIN is quite good. FISH PAKORA having thin covering and generous amount of fish stuffing  tastes good. MOMOs are average. They have a small road side sitting arrangement which is very inconvenient. I always prefer takeaway. They should maintain cleanliness and proper hygiene.

This is a small local outlet located few meters from the legendary Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar. They have few benches and chairs kept on road beside the shop. Best is to pack the food for home. 

Best item I had here was the fish pakora. Thin cover and fat filling of fish. The fish was juicy and tasty. Excellent. 

The momos here are quite filling. The proportion of chicken in the filling is good. Though the stuffing tastes decent, the outer cover is a bit too thick and at times remain uncooked near the edges and under the folds. The soup tastes decent too. The sauce served along with the momo is a bit uncommon. It is made with onions fried in masala. Tastes a bit sweet. Personally didn't like it.

The gravy chowmein tastes decent. The amount is huge and the small serving is more than enough for one.

In all if you are nearby and hungry their gravy noodles is a good option. Even if you are not, do try their fish pakora. They are awesome.

Fairly run-of-the-mill place serving "Mughlai" and "Chinese" food. Very little seating space, so takeaways or food you can eat on the trot (rolls and chops, for example) are more commonly ordered. Not too sure about the hygiene either - it looks dingy, and when it rains, rainwater gets everywhere. The food tastes all right, though, sometimes even tending to good. As a rule, the non-Chinese items are better.
