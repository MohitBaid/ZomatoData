The place is quite pocket friendly specially if you opt their special combo in which they give one bowl of fried rice,one bowl of hakka noodles,2 pieces of chilli fish and 2 pieces of chilli chicken and 2 glasses of soft drinks @Rs.150. The hookah section is also reasonable and the behaviour of the staff is also good and humble.

A stuffy & shabby space(place won't do justice) with all forms of clumsy dance & music. Better to be avoided even on a carfew or a black day with all the bars shut. The only saving grace is the pocket friendliness & it's location,  but then one has oly pub within 10mins from this place. With the passing time the dancing tends to get nastier ;). So better watch your steps.

Never actually been to the place but ordered lunch from there almost every day. Value for money bro.

given it's  small & rather crowded  place , this joint is overpriced  to say  the least .....  a peg of VAT-69  here will  cost  you rs  250/ 60 ml  peg ,  whereas  you   can get the same at starlit garden  bar at rs 196 /  60 ml peg  , food is also overpriced plus there  are taxes  , in short  avoid this place at  all  costs  unless ofcourse you have  a  lot to  spare  ....  ambience is very  very  average ...  nothing special to write home about...  a very average place  in  the heart  of  kolkata with  ABOVE average prices ,  the menu you see here is out dated  atleast it was when i wrote my  review...  the  menu is dated 2009  when i wrote my review  ... so  be careful  guys .....
