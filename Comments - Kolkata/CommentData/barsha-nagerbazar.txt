Stale and tasteless aloo to accompany with their chicken mughlai that too was burnt. Even their chicken roll is not good at all . 1.5 stars only for the general cleanliness in their kitchen area. 

Service is very slow- whether you are at the take away counter or at the main restaurant.

Avoid this place at all costs unless this is the only outlet open for food in entire dumdum!!

Located at Nagerbazar, this restaurant is great in terms of food quality, taste and service. Though the place is small, but it serves some amazing food. It is indeed a good place to have food at a reasonable price. I would recommend Chinese and Pan Fried Momos here. The Schezwan Fried chicken is a must try.

A really small food joint in Nagerbazar locality which serves quality food, specially indian cuisine. Waiters are real quick with the orders.

Just a week back, I came to Kolkata on a trip and landed at  Barsha for some noodles. The chilli garlic Veg chowmein  served was awesome. Enjoyed it thoroughly with the creamy soup. Good going Barsha. Keep up the good service. Would come again :)
