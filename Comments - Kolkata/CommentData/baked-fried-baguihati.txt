This one is inside Ecospace just beside the hangout area. It's a small take away counter. I had burgers, crispy chicken, nuggets, french fries from here on different occasions. So so nothing special. Now they have introduced fish fry, Chicken batter fry etc alongside ðŸ˜‚ which aren't listed here

Perfect place for a quick bite. I love their crispy chicken....crispy outside and juicy inside.
They also serve tasty burger.. The size of the burger is huge and really worth the money.

The best chicken burger that I have ever had in my life is from the baked and fried.
The baked and fried in Rajarhat is located in sector 3B of Ecospace.

Perfect place for chicken lovers... Especially fir the employees in Ecospace. It's a take away counter , so do not expect anything for ambiance !! So directly coming to the food. We had ordered the non veg family meal, price is on the lower side, the best part it's inclusive of taxes so no extra charges applicable. It's a family meal where 3 people can have stomach full meal. The chicken wrap and burger were mind blowing and the best served. We also had had 4 huge pieces of crispy fried chicken....This can compete with kfc crispy chicken but it's tooo oily the only flaw here.. you also get 2 pet coke bottles !! So it will be recommended.

I have tried both Burgers and Sub Sandwiches of this place. they make quality and awesome stuff.

Chicken Steak Sub-Sandwiche is highly recommended as the steaks are really thick in size and rightly cooked.

The Burger costs 150 bucks which is bit costly but worth it.

The drinks like Aam Panna and all are very chilled with the full drink served with crushed ice which is not of my liking.

My first visit to Baked and fried was at Diamond plaza where I tried the burger and crispy chicken. Within a budget cost, the taste was nice. Again I visited this branch and tried spicy chicken wrap which cost only 80 rupees. A soft bread roll stuffed with enough chicken, salad and mayo sauce and the bite you get is really mouthgasmic. Definitely this wrap and crispy chicken with any splush drink should be a must try at this place.

The Baked and Fried here at Ecospace business park has got fast service and you don't have to worry about the seating much because you have a whole food court to yourself. For a Friday evening munching along with my colleagues we had a 12 pcs chicken nuggets box. The nuggets were hot, juicy and delicious. Recommended.

The staff don't know how to value their customers and how to behave with them. Very unprofessional behaviors from the boys at the counter. Strictly avoid.

Delicious burger and also a great value for money at 70 bucks for an extra cheese burger. You won't complete the burger without dropping any mayonnaise on your hands and that is exactly the way to eat an extra cheese burger full of mess.

Went to baked and fried with my friends today. We had ordered for one chicken burger, one paneer wrap, one paneer tikka sub and pne coke to go with them. The chicken burger was the best. The wrap was delicious as well. The sub tasted a bit off.

Situated inside our office complex, Eco Space. a small kiosk, manned by three employees. They serve burgers, wraps, and a bunch of other fried items and colored drinks. They have takeaways and office doorstep delivery options as well. Try their chicken burger, for 70 bucks it's almost like a complete meal. The patty is good.

This snacks joint is located within my office campus and is a fair choice for a quick snack or a meal. If I have to make a choice between KFC and Baked & Fried, the latter is a clear winner. The entire menu is within pocket pocket pinch and no extra tax is levied on the consumers. Their Fried chicken of B&F is more crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside. The fries are more fresh and tastier. The B&F chicken burger is something that I like in spite of that fact that I am not being a fan of burgers. The patty of the burger is really meaty and the choice of dressings are pretty neat. The chicken nuggets are as big as mini burger patties and comes in a pack of six pieces for only 100 bucks. B&F offers various submarine sandwiches, of which Chicken Steak Sandwich and cold cut sandwich are something That I would recommend (Don't forget to ask for thousand island dressing). The spicy chicken wrap is a perfect choice for those who don't like oily wraps. The meal combos are sufficient for one person.Among the negatives, the crushers are a bit too icy and bland, and the sandwich bread have been a bit dry on certain occasions, which is totally unacceptable.

I remember checking in to baked and fried over Facebook, while having lunch with the friend. The admin from the B&F commented over my status and wanted feedback for the food. That was indeed a sweet and courteous gesture.

The menu of B&F is pretty appealing however the staffs need to gear up and the service needs to be more prompt.

I had a breakfast on a busy Saturday.
The burger the providers pretty good but I am not really satisfied with the  Fried Chicken.
From the price tag perspective its pretty cheap and a good alternative from KFC.
So the bottom line is it could be a good option but cannot be a preference.

Baked & Fried serves you various types of food starting from Burger ,Sandwiches and fried chickens etc.
Well I personally prefer Baked and Fried over KFC as I find their product to be more tasty. Also I love the sandwiches they have in their menu also the Slushy is one of the favorite. For the burgers the quality of the bread is extremely soft and firm. Only problem with the bread is they tend to get broken because of the extreme softness.

This outlet is located at the Ecospace Rajarhat food park area.A small kiosk with a lot of variety in their menu.Â 

I feel the the staffs need to be more proactive and increase their ability to deal with customers. Not very quick at all , they slag for speed in rush hours. A good training could make a little difference may be. Also Its suggested to give cooking training properly as at times the taste differs.
