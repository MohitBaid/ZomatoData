A few weeks back my friends and be had paid a visit to the vedic village for celebrating our friend's birthday. All of us had forgotten to get a birthday cake for him sadly and thus decided to order it from this place. Since we were a little tight on the budget we went for the basic chocolate cake. None of us had much expectations from the way it looked. But lo and behold! The cake was absolutely delicious. Soft and juicy and the perfect amount of sweet. Loved it.

Great tea and great company makes up anyone's day! :) Chai has a great ambience located centrally with pretty views of the resort making it picturesque. With the serene environment it's a place for good talks. We had ordered corn n chese puff and veg puff with masala tea. The puffs were amazing with the taste of freshly baked stuff. The cafe steals the heart of a chai lover with its myriad varieties of tea it offers . Masala tea was perfect. Overall it's a place with value for money! :)

Visited here yesterday to purchase a cake on my friends birthday, which we celebrated there in Vedic.
We ordered a Black Forest. The Cake was decent enough. But pocket pinch was too much. The Black Forest was charged Rs.720 which is too much for a 500gm cake. Really too much.

Ordered a Black Forest cake for a friend's birthday party at Vedic Village. The cake tasted okayish but it was thoroughly overpriced. Rs. 723 for a pound of cake, really? 
It is recommended that you carry a cake if you are heading towards Vedic Village for a celebration. Because the cakes here are not worth the price.

Terrible food. It should be called Stale Food Corner. Please shoot this up to the management. The cheese cake lacks flavour of cheese cake. It's only pineapple. Pineapple! Only! 
Then the next was the quiche. We had the chicken quiche and that again was stale. It smelled of a rotten cat.

All set to raise a toast to a rain-soaked Monsoon, Indulge Your Senses to the all new tea lounge at the Vedic Village. Tea amidst the laps of nature. 
As the name suggests, Chai - The Tea Lounge at The Vedic Village Resort is surely going to drive you crazy with the range of tea they serve.

 Location :  Vedic Village Spa Resort at Shikharpur, at just 15 minutes drive from Rajarhat.

Decor and ambience :  Overlooking the lotus-shaped pool, with greenery around and rattan furniture, Chai – The Lounge has a great ambience, and is an ideal place to unwind, to detox the mind. 


Add to this soothing environment in the Vedic Village a cup or two of hot chai, from the all-time favourite Darjeeling tea to fragrant lemon ginger, they have it all. There are quite a few varieties of traditional- and flavoured-leaves from all over the world, which are all served in clear-glass teapots. A range of eats are on offer, like Focaccia, fruit cakes, baguettes, muffins, an in-house assortment of fresh patisserie and home-made breads, among others.  The iced tea served was quite good although I felt it was too concentrated. The darjeeling tea served along with bakery-made cookied just nailed it all.  Featuring specialty teas from India and the world over, treat your taste buds to some of the finest and most exotic flavors available.


Surrounded by greenery and consumed in sensational aroma, the lounge provides the perfect backdrop to unwind and relax and spend a great weekend sipping your tea solemnly.

The simplistic tea lounge at the reception of vedic village. Nothing fancy, however one not to missed . Wide selection of tea available. On our arrival to vedic village for the sunday brunch we decided to kill some time here. also after the whole day had a cup of tea & some cookies. the bakery products are definitely tasty & noteworthy. the tea too excellent, however the pocket pinch quite on the higher side.

This place is inside Vedic village and can be called a tea junction. Different varieties of tea are served here. If you are a tea lover then go for it otherwise avoid it.

This is a specialty restaurant serving only tea.  We were in midst of a discussion and thought we might as well as have some tea.   

The menu is quite exhaustive with a wide variety of tea on display.  I  ordered the Darjeeling tea.  

It was good served in a teapot.     A good experience overall  if you are willing to spend like Rs.200 for a cup of tea.
