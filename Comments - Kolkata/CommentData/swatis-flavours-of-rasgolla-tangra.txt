Flavours, full of those. Tasted quite a few flavours of good ol' rosogolla at 2 different food festivals, and have not been disappointed. Strawberry, Green chili, fuchka to name a few..

I braved the rains on a chilly winter evening and fought my way through the jostling crowd at the Ahare Bangla food festival to try their flavoured rasgullas that have been breaking the internet for quite some time now.

Between my mother and I, we tried their butterscotch,green chilli, chocolate and orange rasgullas.

My verdict-
~Overpriced.(25 rs per piece)
~Pretty small in size(single-bite-wonders).
~Mediocre in taste.

I mean the flavours they promise definitely come through but they don't add to the experience.

Like they say on Masterchef Australia,if you play and innovate with classics but don't come up with a better version,it's of no use.Totally sums up my verdict.

Over a hundred flavours of Rasgolla is staggering but when you realise that they are rather delicious to boot then its an even more wonderful concept. I have had the pleasure of eating these soft, melt in your mouth and delicious Rasgolla's for over a year now and I have never been disappointed. The Green Chilly and Coffee flavoured ones are my personal favourites but with the variety on offer I am quite sure there is a flavour to please everyone. Go ahead and add some sweetness to your life !

It’s definitely a new concept to serve rosogollas in various flavours and also the variety of flavours is excellent, right from litchis to black currant to vodka. The syrups are very tasty too and you can bask in their flavour. However the rosogollas are way too spongy and small in size and I felt it wasn’t worth the price. This would have been a superhit in other cities, but in Kolkata there are numerous outlets that serve excellent quality rosogollas, hence very difficult to satiate the taste buds of Kolkatans.
All the best!

pathetic rasgollas. don''t even think of trying1. Size is that of Rs. 5 rasgolla---very very small2. when we called they said the price was Rs. 25 and when we reached there they said its Rs. 50 . We ordered on day before and when we went they they said did not have the flavour which we ordered.---pathetic servicedon't think of even trying.

Absolutely third class and worthless Rosogolla. The first thing is that it is difficult to locate the outlet since the owner prepares the Rosogolla in her flat at Active Acres at Tangra. You have to get your name signed by the security of the Apartment and then you have to wait for the Owner's permission. Absolutely worthless. Then come to the hygiene of the place. two dogs were constantly straying over the place where the rosogollas are being prepared and you wont get all the varieties at a time. The fact is that none of the varieties are good since all the flavours are artificial. Bengalis who are the originators of Rosogolla can't think of preparing 250 rosogollas so how come this lady prepares I dont know. None of the Rosogollas are worthy of money and price is too high. Can you imagine Rs 25 for a piece. This lady is fooling the Bengalis of Kolkata. Madam pls do not mislead Kolkatans. Do not try the artificial flavours of Rosogolla as those are harmful for your body. In short Zomato should remove her platform. Before offering platform to any outlet, Zomato should personally check whether the outlet is worthy of getting a platform or not. The outlet has no delivery option, nor any Rosogolla sample for trying out and you require patience to go to the outlet. Pls remove this shitty outlet Zomato.

Rosogolla is something for which I can die for and I can give a damn to my Diet.
And when I found flavors in Rosogolla it's like I found Heaven through Rosogolla.

Swati and her mom both are so sweet and the gesture that we got was super touchy. I can't write more about this cause I want you to experience this by yourself.

I just can suggest you some must try Rosogollas - PUCHKA, VODKA, BLUEBERRY, CHOCOLATE, ORANGE, KESAR PISTA, ROSE, WATERMELON.

Actually you can get more than 100 flavors of Rosogolla, that too 25/- each and some specials are of 50/-.

For party orders please feel free to call her and place the order.

Thanks for the invitation.

Thank you team Panch Phoron. I am a proud member of team Panch Phoron.

One will never be able to have enough of Swati's Flavored Rasgullas. There are over 60-80 (or even more) flavored varieties ! Oh YES YES YES ! You shall surely be stunned and impressed. Every single one is incredible in taste.

While those who like it tangy can go for the Hot-and-Sour, Chatpata, Puchka (Pani Puri) or the Kaala Khatta flavored Rasgullas.

Health conscious humans, worry not ! Swati makes Clove, Tulsi, Cinnamon, Coriander, Curry Patta, Capsicum and Tomato flavored Rasgullas.

For the sweet tooth and the fruity hearts AND the child in you, there is Bubblegum, Chocolate, Strawberry, Kiwi, Litchi, Orange, Black Current, Watermelon, Very Berry and WAIT FOR IT, wait for it, wait for it, WAIT FOR IT - MAGGI-Flavored Rasgullas as well ! (OMG ! *Faints*) 

Party animals ! You would wouldn't be sorry for rocking ! There are alcohol based flavors for you guys. Yes, (You can read it again.) Who want's some Vodka Rasgullas ? (She sold almost 10,000 pieces at a party.)

Get ready for Holi, with her Bhaang and Thandai Rasgullas ! And for Diwali, with her Crackle flavored Rasgullas !

Some of the other flavors she does are - 

Rose, Organic Rose, Alphonso, Cappuccino, Gundi Paan, Green Chilli etc. Some pretty unusuals, like Karela (Bitter Gourd), Kiwi, Pomegranate and Mint and Ginger. She can even make a football-sized Rasgulla for you !

So, the next time you see colorful balls at an event, be sure it's the Rasgulla Woman.

Rasgulla is a syrupy dessert very much popular in Indian subcontinent & regions. It is made from ball shaped dumplings of chhena and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. The local variety of Rasgulla known as 'Banglar Rasogolla' Their product is different from ours both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturin like plain rasgulla ,gurer rasgulla ,kamolavog (yellow) rasgulla, and many more.....

Recently I and my fellow foodies were invited to a sweet tasting session in a popular modern generation sweet shop known as “Swati’s Flavours of Rasgulla”

 located in Active Acres, near Tangra in Kolkata.  

Swati Saraf has curated more than 100 flavours, some pretty unusual, like karela, clove , kiwi, kesar, choclate, blueberry,rose flavours and more more ....

Price: Rs. 25/- each .

Rasgulla is a syrupy dessert very much popular in Indian subcontinent & regions. well, first of all, it is a ball-shaped dumpling made from chana or Indian cottage cheese with semolina dough, cooked in the light syrup made of sugar.this is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. Rasgulla or Rosogolla is a traditional & authentic sweet of Bengal. very popular among the Bengali’s. being a bong Rasgulla is a weak point for us. in every sweet shop, there are varieties of Rasgulla like plain white Rasgulla, yellow color Komolabhog, in winter season another variant like Gurer Rasgulla. eating 2-3 sweets per day is a common thing for most of the Bengali’s. well now, this particular sweet has different variant like in color, texture, taste,juice content.

Aamantran a food festival on mangoes was going on at taltola grounds where they had set up a stall.I tried their rasogollas from there.There were so many varities that i was totally spoilt for choice.Finally chose blackcurrent,hot and sweet,chilli and orange flavours.The rasogollas were very soft and each one was unique in its own way.I totally loved the hot and sweet one ,it had a complete chinese flavour.But the orange one won the competition by majority votes.(as my ma,baba,uncle ,aunty all liked it more than any other flavour).

Was new to the complex and heard a lot about her food so ordered chinese for 6 people. I or any of my family member has never tasted such pathetic chinese in our entire life. The dinner was ordered for 8 pm but got it at 9 pm after repeated reminders. We ate only 10% of the food and rest was eaten by the DUSTBIN.

Few days back we got some rasgulla from one of our relative and we were not aware that it was from swati. After having a single bite we again gave it to the DUSTBIN.

Ordered 12 pieces of rasgolla on holi. I called them up to give my order, originally being 12 pieces of organic rose rasgolla. Most of the flavours are not available, I wanted to have strawberry but that wasn't available too. So I had no other option but choose this. We reached Active Acres in half an hour and the security was such a pain in the ___! We had to log ourself in for security purposes. They had us waiting outside and told us to call the person who we wanted to meet. The line was busy and was unable to call them. Finally they let us enter. Another problem was finding the building. We found it, again the security being a big pain. So we finally reached there and it was just a normal residential flat. With two big dogs. This kinda makes you question the hygiene level of the rasgolla. The ground was really messy and guess what. They dont have 12 pieces of rose that we ordered. So they gave us 2 black current and 3 of something  ( green ). It is not only expensive but not worth it. 12 pieces costed me rs350. The black current and the green one tasted so bad that i had to throw it away. Rose one was acceptable. Never ordering again.

I have not been to this place. But yes I have tasted those heavenly mounds of joy quite unknowingly. I always make it a point to visit food festivals inspite of busy schedules. Had tried green chilli flavored rosogolla and rose flavored ones at the stall out up at the food fest. Loved them both. Actually I was quite full after and could not try other flavors even though I wanted to. I did not know that this lady actually has a place up and running! It was only a couple of days ago when I noticed her name and fascinating pictures of flavored rosogollas in the newspaper that I came to know about the existence of this place. Would love to visit here someday. Looking forward to it. Kudos to the Innovation :)

Feb 2017:

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

Swati's Flavours of Rasgolla was one of the participants there.

In the past, twice I have reviewed Swati's flavored rasgollas, and still there are so many flavors pending to get reviewed. No surprise here, as there are around 200 of them in total!

This time I opted for Kiwi Rasgolla and Puchka Rasgolla. Both the rasgollas tasted quite nice. The former had the expectant citric fruity taste. But I was simply bowled by the latter one's puchka flavor. How to ever associate a chaat item with a rasgolla? No brain storming is going to work here. Simply eat it, relish it and believe it!

Colour Splashed Rosogollas @ Swati’s Flavours of Rasgolla..!

Bangali and their roots. Imagine how intricately rosogollas have intertwined with the Bengali culture that Kolkata is signified and greatly associated with rosogollas. Too much of these boring sweet rosogollas that you gulp down. Its time to ogle at those pretty little spongy, ball shaped dumplings, made of cottage cheese (chhena). Infusing the white rosogolla with different flavours and making it colourful is a recent, popular trend to create variations.
                    

An innovative attempt to bring about  this variation is none other than Swati Saraf, the Kolkata (India) based home chef who has made a den of flavoured rosogollas out of her home in Active Acres Tower.

Swati Saraf has curated more than 100 flavours, some pretty unusual, like karela, clove and kiwi. Some of the other variants that I got to taste was Pomegranate and Mint, Ginger, Kesar Cardamom, Green Chilli, Rose Petal and more.
                                                                ...
