Mutton was stale and had a bad odour, be it in biryani or gravy, the biryani rice and flavor was still ok, but the stale mutton pieces ruined it, service was poor and extremely slow, would never recommend, this was our 1st and last visit.

A small, not so famous outlet it is. But even in the rush hours of puja the food they served was quite appealing. The ambience would get a 3.5/5 and the service a 4/5. I would rate the food 3.7/5.

Though the name has its origin in Pakistan but the place has nothing to do with Pakistan or Pakistani food. This place is purely a casual dining with a fusion of North Indian and Chinese delicacies. The food quality and taste is moderate, there is not so many things to enjoy about it but you will not be disappointed either. The ambience is however not that much interesting only some golden couched sofas and tables and a few furnishing lamps giving it a gloomy look. Location is the main advantage of this place it is located just at the crossing of Triangular park hence it's a pretty good option for a family dine out.

A fairly old outlet on a busy road. Strangely it's not much crowded in here. A fairly simple interior with no maintenance at all. Staff are very nice though and the service is indeed commendable. Food is pretty decent as per the taste is concerned. Dishes may not be visually appealing but they do taste good. Price are reasonable.
We had
1. Khyber special soup. Awesome soup
2. Chicken Patrik kebab. This is brilliant.
3. Chilly prawn. Too much sauce.
4. Mixed fried rice. Nice
5. Chicken biryani. Good.
6. Mutton kasha. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.
7. Masala cold drink and fresh lime soda.

Maybe with better cooking skills this place can get more customers.

Went for family lunch. The ambiance is good. Staff is polite.
Only thing the serving is quiet slow.
Now comig to food :
We ordered chicken tikka kabab, crispy chicken, chicken sweet corn soup, naan, chicken korma, veg chowmin and hot garlic chicken.
Chicken tikka kabab was gud but they didn't serve the customary green chutney that goes so well . Quantity as compared pricing was less.
Crispy chicken was awsome. Quantity and taste was sufficient.
Naan was soft . Chicken korma is real nice. Soft and juicy chicken. The gravy was tasty. I specially do not like the over dose of kawra water and rose water taste in any mughlai dish. And korma didn't have any of them. Therefore nice.
Chowmin was good . Quantity was sufficient.
Hot garlic chicken was equally gud.
Overall a good experience.

Extremely dreadful experience.. Quality of food is below average.. and worst of them is the quality of service.. We saw the waiter only once while taking the order, next after half n hour later to inform us that it will take another 15 mins just to prepare 3 chicken biriyanis.. It will be the last place I would suggest to any of my friends our foodies out here.. atleast carry your own drinking water, coz we didn't get that in repeat...

Decent place opposite to City Style. The ambiance is good.
I had chicken noodle soup and chicken drumsticks for starters, sweet and sour chicken, and veg hakka noodles for the main course. Most of the ordered dishes were average/satisfactory. The soup was a little bland for my taste. The prices are high, and do not begin to justify the quantity served. Service can be better.

This restaurant is exactly opposite of city style, just beside the manyabar.
Ambience is pretty simple & decent. I find it quite beautiful. You will feel that this is an expensive one, although its not 😛. I like their lights hanging from the ceiling
So coming to the food we totally skipped the starter because we (7 people) were so hungry. We orderd their chinese items
Egg chicken fried rice
Mixed fried rice
Egg chicken garlic fried rice.
Hot garlic chicken
Bang bang chicken
Chicken olyster sauce.

All the prices are including tax. Though i feel their mixed fried rice is overpriced.
Quality & quantity both are good. 1plate of rice is enough for two people.
Loved their olyster chicken sauce. But bang bang chicken failed to impress us. And yeah they didn't serve us anything. We had to do it on our own.

Location: Rashbehari Avenue Triangular Park. You can easily locate the restaurant as it is on the main road. Just beside Manyavaar Showroom.

Ambiance: Simple and decent. The seatings were good enough. The decor was eye pleasing and I found it quite beautiful. The ambience was a plus point to this place though it was pretty simple and nothing fancy!
.
.
Food: Before commenting on the taste, let me tell you a bitter truth- the restaurant is humongously overpriced. I don't know how can they can charge such a huge amount for their normal and nothing fancy food. A simple plate of Mixed Fried Rice for 330INR+tax. Well, I'll not pay that much!
.
We ordered Chicken Hot and Sour Soup and Crispy Lemon Honey Chicken.
.
.
To be brutally honest, the soup was quite good. With the right amount of ingredients and taste, it was satisfying for my taste buds.
.
.
The Lemon Honey Crispy chicken was disastrous. I literally felt that this is nothing more than crispy chicken strips dipped in just honey. It was too sweet in reality. The quality of chicken was good but the preparation was really not upto the mark.

There are ample of other options in and around this area. Better to skip it! 😐

Khyber pass is not what I really expected.
First of all they increase their price too much
Quantity was not enough
Quality -good
Service-they gave us water just one-time after we finished our lunch they gave another glass..very poor service.
Ambience-good but they need to clean their wall hanging lights...
And they accept cash and card
But zomato shows only cash it's wrong..
Just because of the taste of food(egg fried rice & schezwan chicken)I gave 3.5

Located at Rashbehari Avenue, right opposite City Style, this small yet neat restaurant will provide you with a choice of handful known dishes. Working on the two most known cuisines Mughal and Chinese , Khyber pass is doing an appreciable job.
This place is not so high on pocket but definitely on taste , though quantity is less in comparison to the expense. Also, dessert that we ordered was out of stock.
The interior is no doubt attractive. They've made good use of low light conditions.
Personal advice: The staff should be more prompt in service.
What we ordered: Egg fried rice, Pan fried chicken , gulab jamun ( not served )
Taste : 3.5/5
Ambience : 3.5/5
Value for money : 3.5/ 5

Today we went there, as a huge gang of 16 people. This happens rarely that I don't deduct even a .5 from a restro.
But everything impressed me today. The simple ambience, the taste of the food, the price as well as the service.
We ordered:
Chicken Banzara. The kebabs were soft and flavours awesome.
Mutton Biryani. The mutton was soft although some found it oily.
Chicken Pasinda. It was a mild gravy but tasted good.
Onion cheese chilly kulcha. I just loved it.
Other items that were ordered were Malai kebab, Schezwan chicken, Chicken fried rice, special biryani, Lemon Coriander chicken, Mongolian chicken, Drums of heaven.
I loved the chutney they served with the momo.. it's the ideal sauce in my opinion.
The other items were liked by people too.
Their prices are so reasonable, and the waiters handled our big group efficiently and there were no confusions in the orders.
I can totally visit the place again. I loved this simple but amazing restaurant.

Nice place with nice location and nice decor,once inside you get a nice feel.Waiters are all well behaved you feel awesome , order the food and here starts the nightmare.
Went with my family , ordered a chicken tandoori , chilli fish , crispy chilli chicken and thums up.
Dunno how all the items were cold.Imagine a cold chicken tandoori.
And their full chicken tandoori is in no way a full chicken.They probably made 8 pieces out of half a chicken.
Served us with coca cola.When complained we were informed thums up was not in stock.
Next we ordered chicken momo and drums of heaven.Momo was not too good.Drums of heaven was nice.
Not value for money,not recommended.

This restaurant was in my bookmark list since it had opened. Today finally visited to have a lunch but my experience is not so satisfying. I have bought one little coupon worth 449 Rs of Biryani combo which include 1 Chicken Tikka kebab, 2 Chicken Biryani and 2 Cold drinks. When I told them about the coupon firstly they was confused with the menu and secondly they were not aware of the quantity also. It was clearly mentioned in the little menu that the deal includes 2 plates of Biryani but they were continuously saying that they could be able to serve only 1 plate. Seriously a very bad management. Lastly they called someone and after a prolonged discussion they served the mentioned items in the Little menu. So my first impression for this place is negative due to their lack of proper management. If the staffs are not aware of the ongoing deal then it could only cause of customer's harassment.

Apart from this incident, the interiors are well arranged and spacious. The service is quite slow. Biryani tasted as usual but nothing extra ordinary. Tikka kebabs are comparatively good.

My suggestions for this place is to improve their service. The staffs need to be more professional and skilled. Better management could help this place to run well.

Just visited this outlet at  gariahut.. Just opposite of city style..I and my food partner went there for lunch.. The first thing that should be mentioned is the service.. They must be careful about that.. We had a little coupon of beryani combo.. But unfortunately they didn't even know about that coupon that they are offering..It took time for a long to make them understand what they should serve.. That's irritating.. We also had to ask for water.. They serve then the food.. 
Coming to food, that was included beryani, tikka kabab and drink.. 
Beryani was good and not over smelled.. Tasty but light that I liked.kabab was really good... 
Decoration is good , arrangement is proper.. This is a good restaurant but management should be better.. 
But overall its an ok experience..can be tried...

I just don't know how this restaurant is running. Such a worthless place! What a service we got! We ordered chicken spring roll, egg fried rice and chilli prawn. All of 1 quantity. They just have 2-3 untrained and confused waiters. They even failed to understand what we were saying. Finally after waiting for 30 minutes they served us the starter. The spring roll was not served hot and it was not at all crispy. There is no coordination among anybody. All were confused about who ordered what. They were serving wrong food in wrong table. Meanwhile other customers left the place after waiting for hours as they failed to serve them. Then 20 minutes after they served us the starter we heard them placing our main course order. Then and there we told them to cancel the order and we left the place.

Such a harrassment! It was a normal day and only few tables had customers, yet such a service! I feel they just have the inner decor and nothing else. If somebody goes for having lunch, they will serve dinner. This much slow they are. I rated this restaurant 1 because that's the minimum, but to be very honest they don't deserve any rating.

A decent restaurant situated just opposite to City Style. We had ordered a special chicken biryani and a sweet lime soda. The biryani was quite tasty and its aroma was lovely. Wish to taste some Chinese dishes here in the future.

This place has been on my mind since quite sometime and finally I with my friends made it there in the evening. This place is spacious and cozy. An ideal place for enjoying dinner or lunch with huge group of friends.. the ambience and decor deserves loads of appreciation.. coming to food, the price is reasonable. The quantity and quality both couldn't disappoint me in any way! The service was quick. The waiter was courteous and helpful! 
Over all the experience was nice the bonus being the reasonable price and no extra VAT!

Pleasant ambience. Coming to the food, we had ordered crispy chilli chicken as starter, mixed hakka noodles and chilli fish as the main course. We received all the three items at one go, instead of receiving the starter first. The chicken was tasty but a little bit hard and chewy. The noodles and fish were delicious but not mouth watering - we liked it, but not loved it. Anyway, it is definitely a good place to visit. You won't regret it.

Seats were full at 9 but we managed to get a couple of seats for us.
We ordered a Chef special Kebab and biryani which they claimed to be the best in city.
It took average waiting time to get the food
The kebabs were so soft and well garnished that I was really surprised to see at this cheap rate.
Biryani is really special there.
I had no problem at all at night after having their biryani in such hot summer season.

Service - A complete 0 out of ten.The one who came to take the order had absolutely no idea about what the restaurants have on the menu card.He took our order first,went upstairs,came down and told us the tandoor was closed.So we had to shift to chinese.When we placed the new order,the waiter didn't pen it down and completely messed up the quantity.Wrong amount was served.And on complaining this,we received a rather unapologetic response.
Food - The prawn fried rice was good.The starter se ordered was crispy honey lemon chicken - was too crispy and hardly had any honey-lemon flavour.The schezwan chicken didn't taste the way it should,instead had a manchurian kind of taste.
Certainly not going back again.

Last month I went here with my family.A nice place to go..food is amazing which includes range and even quality..

 Couldnt find any issue in any of the dish except slight issue in mushroom soup . No doubt service needs to improve and place needs a good manager
.
On a sunday night it was packed . It felt cramped and noise level was high . 

We were five of us with different taste. Lungfong Soup was shared and loved by both of us . Others had the Chicken clear soup which was not the clear variety they were hoping for. . 

overall for the food i am giving a 4.5....

Well.. it was my bro's birthday..So we went there wid a huge hope and with lots and lots of hunger..First of all the ambiance was nice and simple... Especially the lamps were pretty eye-catching. Now coming to their service. VERY POOR. We were so disappointed as it was not at all expected. After we completed our starters we had to wait for like 30 minutes for our main course. Now food..We ordered lemon corriander chicken, chicken Pahari kebab, Khyber special mutton and chicken biryani, butter nun, chicken tikka masala and sweet and salty lemon soda. Each and every item was BRILLIANT. Biryani's were mouth watering and the quantity was more than required.. ample amount to be specific. Kebabs were soft and delicious. Very flavourful. Nun was huge..like one was enough. Tikka masala was superb and very tasty.. each and every dish was of enough quantity and was equally tasty!! But many dishes were unavailable . Like we ordered chicken pasinda and Kashmiri nun. But it was not available.
Guys we had a great lunch out there.. but the experience would have been much much better if their service would have met our expectation. Worst service I have experienced so far. Apart from that it was okay.

Well we went there during the opening hours keeping in mind about the kind of treatment we were to rcv there. We were to celebrate a birthday, therefore we took with us a cake n all the other arrangements necessary for the celebration. The most shocking part was that the staffs there gladly confessed that they can't arrange anything for us to aid the celebration. We had fortunately a backup that's y we were saved. When asked for a mere knife they couldn't even supply us with that (now this was shocking as in a well known restro a complete cutlery sets are a mandate). Now coming to d food. I really lack words. In terms of quality n quantity it was flabbergasting. Although their usage of spices was a bit less (I felt it coz I prefer spicy foods). N most importantly the taste of every delicacies were mindblowing. The best part is all items are inclusive of taxes therefore visitors aren't entitled to pay extra service taxes even. Here my 3/5 rating is just coz f d quality food they serve. But a bit of improvement in terms of their service will be appreciated for the future visit.

This small restraunt is located just opposite to City Style at Gariahat.It is a multicusine restraunt offering North Indian & Kolkata style chinese.
We had a surprising experience here as we had our Starters at the restraunt and we had to get our main course parcelled due to a power failure .
When it came to ordering food we went for Chinese.

Dry Veg Manchurian as Starters was lightly spicy and the vegetable balls were soft and very well seasoned.
Schezwan Chicken had bell peppers and star annies and again lightly spicy, and tasted like a another version of kolkata chinese.Mixed Fried Rice was just ok to taste, but portion size was adequate for two for all items .
Prices are on the higher side at least for the Chinese items on the menu.Rates are inclusive of tax and totall billing was for Rs 565/-.
Due to the inconvinience , the restraunt staff apologised to us profusely and no extra parcel charges were added. Overall food taste wise , it was just stomach filling experience , nothing much to rave about. Sudeepta Dey

9 of us went to this relatively new restaurant just beside Mud, our favourite hangout. It was about 3:30pm and the staff there was visibly unprepared and reluctant to welcome such a huge gang. We ordered a couple of plates of honey lemon chicken, fish fingers and another fish starter with tea/coffee. Service was really slow and they were quite flustered as each of us ordered different preparations of tea/coffee, with/without sugar, with/without milk according to our preferences. Food was average, nothing to talk about. Prices are at par too. The staff needs to gear up if they want to be noticed in this competitive market.
