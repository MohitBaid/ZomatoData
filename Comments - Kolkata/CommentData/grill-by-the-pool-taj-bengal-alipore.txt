Attended their special party here on the new year's eve.. the place is itself sooo beautifully decorated with a manageable dance floor.. coming the food, they had huge spread of buffet dinner !! Evrything was soo beyond expectations there! I loved all those deserts they had.. tried their macaroons, assorted berries.. so glad to try champagne for the first time there!! The dj played all sorts of english international tracks which managed to make us happy! I simply loved the party, but expected a lil bit of fire works..!

I visited Grill by the Pool for Christmas. It has a very odd way of taking bookings, which created a lot of hassle for us. We had to keep calling at least 4-5 times (mind you each of the 2 of us called 4-5 times) to get a reservation, as they kept saying we’d get a call back, but sadly we didn’t. 
Never mind , coming to the ambience of the place- it has looks to die for! Centred around a pool, it has the most beautiful setting. So full marks on that! Coming to the menu- it has very limited vegetarian options, much to our disappointment. So they could add more of these, so that we could also enjoy good food by the pool. 
We ordered a cream of tomato soup (I’m really thankful, as it was not there on the menu still they managed one)- which was amazing! Next came a potato with asparagus starter. It was good!However, the roastie sort of disappointed us. It was okay and not Taj standard. 
Overall, barring the average food taste, the experience was amazing, aided by excellent staff and service and beautiful ambience. Would surely visit again should more veg dishes be added to the limited options.

After reading the feedback in Zomato I was just waiting for a chance to visit the place and I should say as always Grill By The Pool was a delight to the taste buds. We had ordered Char Grilled Kolkata Bhetki with raw mango salsa with was absolutely amazing ! Next was Steak : Lamb Rack which also matched our expectations.  More than the food I loved the ambience.. light.. music.. decor. . It's just too perfect !

Celebrated my birthday here this year and totally enjoyed the experience. The hotel also provided a complimentary birthday cake to our group which was a very thoughtful gesture...Taj is well known for their hospitality and this one lived upto that standard!

Just outstanding food. They only remain open through the winters. I was treated to a birthday dinner by my wife one day before the joint closed for the season this year. Any one reading this please have a meal here next winter.

We celebrated my birthday on a cold winter evening with a candlelight dinner at the Taj. Thank god for advance reservations since the place has limited seating as was packed when we arrived. A beautiful setting, non intrusive atmosphere and the heavenly smell of meat being grilled, what else do you want!! The both of us ordered grilled tenderloin steak with pepper and red wine sauce respectively, different sides, his were mashed potatoes and wedges, mine were grilled veggies and roast potatoes. Yep we are potato fanatics and what we also are is mad for good steaks, so we have done our little homework on the better ones in the city. This one arrived on a separate plate and then a platter which housed the sides as well as a hot stone platter. You are supposed to place your steak on the stone platter and it keeps it sizzling till you have your last bite. Buttery, yummy, perfectly seasoned and everything I would look for in a good steak were there. The portions are big too! Two huge medallions of steak and I was huffing and puffing through 3/4th of the first. Next time maybe we shall stick to one portion of steak and a salad or a appetizer on the side!! Overall a very memorable birthday with some memorable food!!!

Perfect ambience for a family dinner. The chilly weather and the dimly lit effect of trees by the blue water makes it feel so serene, add the heater stands to keep you warm and the warmth of Taj hospitality can't keep you asking for more. The options of grills though limited, rock totally if you choose the right marinade and the sauce that suites your taste buds. Have indulged in Thai curries but the Penang curry here was totally out of the world and richly added with vegetables. You might find it a little sweeter than Thai curries but to me it was just so perfect. 

What more to say! You have to go there once atleast in the winters to pamper your taste buds luxuriously...

I had heard a lot about this restaurant, and yesterday being my birthday, I decided to visit this place along with my family. We were very warmly welcomed as we stepped out into the rather chilly poolside.
The ambience, i must say, was amazing, next to the still and well lit-up pool. the open air kitchen added to the beauty of the scene. The menu was a short and crisp two-pager, with starters, pre-set and customisable grills and desserts.

As we waited for our order, we were provided with a small holder, fit with salted peanuts and very surprisingly, Lay's Chips!

We ordered an asparagus dish for starters, and were stunned by the juiciness of it, and the way it was accompanied with a bittersweet condiment. For the main course, we ordered a Chilean Sea-Bass, with lime risotto, a stuffed potato with feta cheese and vegetable panache and a Medium-Rare tenderloin, with XO-salma oelek, balsamic glaze and potato wedges.

The Sea-Bass was done really well, with a sweet and spicy sauce. I did not try the stuffed potato, but as according to what i heard, it was 'lovely'. The tenderloin was done to perfection, with the Salma-oelek providing a very appetising flavour and aroma. Wondering whether there would be any accompaniment to the tenderloin, i asked the waiter, but was offered tomato sauce, which to be honest left me embarrassed and surprised.

In between the meal, we were greeted by the Chef, Mr. Abhiskek with whom we had a little chat regarding the food. After the food, we ordered for the bill, and were surprised with a cake, complimentary from the chef. After cutting it, we were once again amazed upon receiving three personalised chocolates. 

Overall, I'd say that the food was mind-blowing, but they must fix a few things, for example, offering ketchup along with a tenderloin. And also the lighting, which kept at the bare minimum does offer a better ambience, but instead forces the guests to literally use torches to see the menu. But all said, it is a place where i would surely be going again for its amazing food!

Romantic ambience, delicious food and warm personalized service. We spent our 6th wedding anniversary eve here and we we're delighted! The suggestions of dishes were fantastic! The best part was when we were pleasantly surprised to see a cake from La Patisserie, the cake shop and deli of Taj Bengal, on our table with an advance wish of our anniversary! 
Mr Rajib Dubey, the manager and Mr Avisek Biswas, senior Chef de Partie personally greeted us. My wife had an issue with mosquito and Mr Dubey personally resolved it.
Thank you Taj Bengal team for the memorable evening! Definitely looking forward to visiting again.

Good ambience and food.
I have been coming here each year and never go back disappointed. 
However this year I was not fully satisfied. The south east asian cuisine was not suitable for the grill - at least for vegetarian options. 
Moreover the ambience was spoilt by a loud wedding reception going on next door. The singer was drowned out by the music next door. 
That said the curry was probably the best I have had outside of Vietnam and Thailand. 
Overall I am still happy I came here but will probably not visit again this winter.

The ambience is the only thing nice about this place. The service was mediocre. The food was below average. We ordered a steak but they had no steak knives.  The steaks went cold while they went looking around the hotel for a steak knife. Came back woth what looked like a butter knife and told us it was a steak knife. The menu is only 2 pages. The fish was stale. The chicken absolutely flavourless.  On top of that they charged us for for extra drinks. Absolute waste of time. Never again.
