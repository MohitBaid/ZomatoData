One of the best chicken roll that i had was here. The ambience was so-so. But those pieces of soft tender chicken is amazing. A good take on a pocket worrying day to kepp the tummy yummy and full.

A perennial favourite for evening snacks since childhood. The soft chicken and fish pakoras are the best among many mid priced snacks bar. The egg rolls, chicken rolls will surely overcome your hunger pangs at any time of the day. 
It is also famed for its sumptuous biryani. People from far and near do not think twice to make repeat visits for Zaika 's Biryani. 
I have many fond memories with Zaika.

Good place for takeway menus. Their speciality remains their rolls and biriyani. The only flipside is their usage of stale salads and excessive oil as you would find with other street food outlets in the city too. Price-wise, a good option for hogging street food when you are cash strapped.

I stay near this restaurant and eat most of the time chicken biriyani and rolls.
Quality of chicken biriyani never improved.It remained same. Sometimes its deteriorates during festival times.Its full of dalda no ghee. Sometimes they make good taste (rarely).Quantity less price high compared to quantity.
And roll is  tasteless.If you eat one roll the you don't have to eat lunch or dinner.They fry in dalda. No special taste. Chicken roll has normally 3-4 pieces small chicken but during rush or special ocassion you may get 2 pieces of chicken with full of onions and sauces. Overall you can fill your stomach, plus will get taste of sauces and onions.And you will burp after eating egg roll.

This has been a place since my childhood days when I used to save my pocket money to have foooood!!! But what a disappointment today... went into the restaurant today to have my lunch when I was superrr hungry... ordered chicken drumsticks, mixed fried rice and chilly chicken. Drumsticks were not cooked properly, chicken was not done from inside,  garnished with raw beans, carrots and rotten cabbages.  Next came mixed fried rice  for which ordinary is an understatement. The tiny prawns which were hard to fine were smelling like anything, the eggs were over fried and burned and the chilly chicken was more like a mix of sweet and sour and manchurian. So pathetic... apart from that the restaurant is very very very unhygenic. The crockeries and the sauce pots were having cracks, flies here and there and the most amazing fact is they switched off the ac to clean it when we were having food. And that too was done by the only manager cum staff present there.... after this review, enter the restaurant at your own risk.

The food served had an awful stink of bad quality oil being used and also to add the dishes on which it was served wasn't clean either.

This place is probably the worst Zaika outlet that I have ever eaten from: overpriced but low quality food, poor ambience and unfriendly staff. Never going back to it ever again. The Mixed Fried Rice was uncooked in some parts and overfried in others, while the Biriyani had no real taste.

Please avoid this joint at all costs.

I guess this is the first food outlet which opened in Garfa that served Biryani. Oh!!! One should see the long queue that is formed in front of the outlet during weekends and/or any festival. The Biryani is really nice. They also serve lip-smacking and pocket-friendly rolls and pakoras. The Chicken Pakora is really nice. Overall, a decent food joint.

It's located near Jadabpur Railway Station & Jheel Road.

 I had chicken rolls from it which is good, but not extraordinary. Tasted mutton biriyani & mutton curry also when I used to stay in a flat near 8B, Jadavpur. Again it's not bad but there is nothing very special about it.

But I can say that it's better than other street food stalls around Jadavpur. You can try if you want to have good rolls or biriyani at moderate price near jadavpur!

Tried almost everything. there food quantity is really good,the best things out there are drums of heaven, roasted drumsticks one of best,the sos tossed chickens can compete with many big places,we love it.

This place is located just beside Jadavpur railway station and serves average quality food..their fish pakodas,chicken lollipop are very average kindof..chicken pakoras are still better.Had tried their chicken chowmin once..though it was filled with huge chunks of chicken, yet was not good enough and was dry. Prices are very reasonable but service is slow and the staff is inattentive.I seriously don't agree with those who are saying they serve the best snacks in the locality.There are places which serve much better in the same prices.

Location : Just near the Jadavpur label crossing( beside Bedouin).

Growing up, I used to grab a roll from here before heading towards tuition.

Absolutely love their chicken roll, better than Bedouin any day. That's why they have all the crowd while the adjoining Bedouin has minimal customers asking for rolls.

Got mixed fried rice and chilli chicken from this place for a small get together. The rice was loaded with shrimps, chicken and egg. And though the chilli chicken was not at all, it was garlicky and hence something I loved. 

In all this is one of those budget places, perfect for take away.

First of all, I don't know why it is tagged as ' no sitting available'. It has a dining place. Ask in the counter and they will show you. It's a small place but offers taste at very low price. We ordered mutton biryani and hot garlic chicken. Biryani was quite good. Hot garlic was tasty.
 But the cons are-
     foods are a bit rich and you can't expect much of services.
But if you want to please both your tongue and moneybag, it's your place.

the most important go to place for evening snacks in jadavpur. I have been their regular customer for the past 10years. This food joint located near the jadavpur railway crossing offers the cheapest tasty food in the locality. Mainly known for their takeaway service which is instant and quick. Excellent for evening snacks like rolls and pakodas. Chowmein and fried rice are the other viable option but not that good. The best thing of this place are the pakoras, fish fries, chicken drumsticks and chicken lollipops. Those are the items you should be vying for.Overall excellent food on a budget. I have tasted everything from their menu and the quality is good but not extraordinary. Sufficient in quantity.

Small place,  just across the Jadavpur Train line. It is a basic take away joint, serving a fare share of Indo-chinese options, rolls and stir fries. 

The place makes a decent mutton biriyani, enough to serve two, without much of a pocket pinch. Another thing you must try here is the chicken pakora. They make it fresh every afternoon, that is about the time I generally used to cross the area. They are soft, succulent and double friend to crispy perfection.

This very tiny takeaway place has been a local favourite ever since they have started operating. It is very hard to find this place empty after 7pm which signifies its popularity. 

Their Chinese items are very average like roadside stalls. Their rolls sells the most but are quite disappointing according to me. The Chicken rolls are deprived of chicken and the egg roll is bland. The item which you must try out here are the Pakora's. The Chicken Pakora is an absolute favourite. The coating is absolute crispy and quantity of chicken inside is wholesome. The Fish Pakora is also very good because of the fish filling inside. Also try their Chicken Drumstick. Quite handsome in size and having a crispy coating. The Biriyani again is full of Rose Water smell and it will annoy while you eat. Even the piece of meat inside can be rubbery at times.

My rating is strictly based on the rolls and the biryanis available here on the take away counters

Situated at a prime loction in palbazaar, this joint is one of the most famous eatery options for the local residents.

I have had chicken rolls from here and they taste quite good. Generous fillings of chicken will make you happy.. and the paratha is crisp but greasy.. the paratha they use is not the typical flaky laccha paratha but a tawa paratha in which lot of dalda is used to mk it crisp..
The rolls are heavy and taste wise it is just about good.

The biryani here is good in taste but very greasy. Also the portions of chicken or mutton are generally good. The price is on the lower side compared to the quantity they provide..
Taste is primary for them and they ignore the health part by using lot of dalda.
However 1ce in a while it is good to have such lipsmacking food at such low price.

Good place to hangout with your friends. Certainly not a fine dining restaurant. Located at the first floor, this place doesn't look good from outside. But, they serve some delicious food. Their momos and chilli chicken are top on the menu, apart from their Biriyani.

My rating is strictly based on the rolls and the biryanis available here on the take away counters

Situated at a prime loction in palbazaar, this joint is one of the most famous eatery options for the local residents.

I have had chicken rolls from here and they taste quite good. Generous fillings of chicken will make you happy.. and the paratha is crisp but greasy.. the paratha they use is not the typical flaky laccha paratha but a tawa paratha in which lot of dalda is used to mk it crisp..
The rolls are heavy and taste wise it is just about good.

The biryani here is good in taste but very greasy. Also the portions of chicken or mutton are generally good. The price is on the lower side compared to the quantity they provide..
Taste is primary for them and they ignore the health part by using lot of dalda.
However 1ce in a while it is good to have such lipsmacking food at such low price.

i'm a regular customer here. The pakoda and lollipop are simply mamma mia!!! you should steer clear of the fish fry, but the finger is quite reasonably priced and tasty. Two things that you should try are the chowmein (all flavors) and the biryani (specially the special chicken one)
            

UPDATE - 17.08.2016

So... Had their special chicken biryani after a long time today. A wonderful partner in crime on a rainy day - this 150 rupee-Biryani is still too much for one single person. Even for a food lover such as me. Also, the flavor and quality has actually improved. So Thumbs up for Zaika and their Biryani crew.

This one is for the counter on the road and not restaurant. The biriyani is something to try out. It's different. Flavor does the talking in their biriyani and not spices. It tastes beautiful yet not heavy on your stomach. And quantity is great. Go for the 150 a plate and its good for two average eating person. Apart from biriyani try their chicken roll. That's one of the best in the entire Jadavpur locality. And also do try their chicken pakodas. True pakodas not filled with unwanted stuffing and smells and tastes great. Overall a nice place for takeaway or over the counter. Good food at great prices.

If you expect Arsalan biriyani at Rs. 100, go to Arsalan and try your luck on that. Zaika's Biriyani is really great and they offer a competitive price at their take-away outlet, which is always crowded. Their biriyani always sells out fast. Their chicken rolls are also equally great!
They also have a restaurant. Their seating area is not too large, but food quality for all dishes is much above average. Kashmiri pulao, gravy chowmein and biriyani are the best. But hate to climb the dingy stairs to the restaurant inside- it stinks!

Very common an outlet for people on the other side of the railway line.. A little offbeat for those who stay this side( towards 8b).. Nevermind still, this is as busy an outlet as the ones running in the 8b bus stand area.. They are famous for rolls, pakoras, and biriyanis.. I have tried a variety of rolls from here.. Nice to be gastronomic on days when one is tight on pocket..

Average outlet now-a-days. Started up as a very prominent roll and snacks counter. I was a fan of their chicken pakora and was a regular customer. Slowly with time the quality degraded. Also started offering low quality biriyani and few Indian Chinese dishes. Still exists but not offering good quality food.

Great joint to grab a hot roll / biriyani / chowmein ..Despite the number of people waiting for their food their service is pretty quick.. If you love fast food you know where to be.. ;)

I can only comment on the fast-food take-away counter of Zaika. 
The first thing I can or I should say is that they know how to keep their kitchen clean, which is of course, a relief for the hygiene-nazis. 
I am a big fan of their Veg or Egg-Veg roll. That stuffing they use in their veg rolls tastes just awesome. Chicken roll will also come in the recommendation list. Plus, you get the rolls at a really affordable price. 
Tried fish fry and fish chops as well but they don't come close to the standard set by their rolls. 
Will order Biriyani soon as that amazingly low price mentioned in the price chart caught my eyes last day.

I rather prefer the fast food than the Dine-in. I often have my lunch and supper from there. Yes the food is cheaper than many restaurant and the ambiance, everything else is nice and sound but I would not prefer it unless there is any reason, like tight budget or no where else to go. The entry to the restaurant sucks though. Outside foods are even allowed but  I suggest to consult before proceeding with outside food.  One thing that is noticeable in almost all Zaika restaurant is the use of Dalda. yes they still use it so it taste good but really unhealthy.

I've passed through this restaurant many times,but never got the chance to get in.
It was during this puja that we were low on budget & my gf suggested the name ZAIKA.
Its located in the Palbazar more,the connector which leads to Garfa,Jheel Rd & Jadavpur Station.
Zaika is famous for its fast food & not much for dine-in. U'll see more people in the fast food counter rather than in the restaurant.
The food tastes ok, the air condition works fine & the greatest benefit one can get is that the food is tax free.
We were extremely hungry,so didn't bother about the quantity.
But still the quantity of the rice wasn't sufficient.
Overall our experience was satisfactory.

This place was suggested by a friend for a post-exam 'chilling out session'.
Believe me, I would have never found this place had I gone there alone!
Below the Zaika board is tiny door (mind your head!) opening to a flight of steps which leads to the restaurant in the first floor.
We entered to find the place deserted and the AC's turned off. The interiors were pretty simple.
A couple of waiters inside helped us with water and the menu cards.

Coming to the food, the items were SUPER DUPER CHEAP. And service was equally slow; we got the food after 1 hour.
The quality and taste of the food would be judged as average. The momos were okayish, the chicken drumsticks were a bit tough, while the dry chilly chicken was pretty good. I liked the American Chopsuey as well.
Portions were sufficient and appreciable.

I suggest you not to go if you are in a hurry or inclined towards ambience.

ZAIKA

Location: 
The outlet of Zaika is not so convincingly located in Paul Bazar, pretty close to the once-busy level-crossing between Jadavpur and Garfa. One of its branches is a small one, noted for the takeaway items and the other one is a family restaurant, which one finds after mounting quite a number of wooden steps against the backdrop of some precariously-hung-on-wall meter-boxes and emergency generators.

Decor:
The restaurant on the first floor is moderately spacious. One side of the restaurant overlooks the busy street underneath. Some of the tables line the glass facade to give the customers an opportunity to enjoy their meal while relishing the view. However, the place is dimly lit.

Dishes Ordered:
For The Restaurant:
(1) Mutton Fried Rice
(2) Chili Chicken
The Mutton Fried Rice was not up to the mark. The ingredients were not properly mixed in adequate proportions and it lacked the charming taste. The Chili Chicken tasted better and it is because of this side dish that we were able to complete one full plate of the ordered main dish.

For The Small Outlet:
(1) Chicken Roll
(2) Fish Fry
(3) Chicken Lollypop 
All the three items were large in size. The prices were also reasonable compared to the other eateries in the vicinity.

Drawbacks:
(1) The dishes in the restaurant took around almost 30 minutes to arrive after they were ordered.
(2) The restaurant did (and probably do) not have a card-punching machine. So having hard cash before visiting this food joint would be time-saving.

Summary: 
Decor: 3.5/5 
Hospitality: 3/5 (Appeared conceited)
Food Quantity: 3/5
Food Quality: 3/5
Taste: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 3/5

Conclusion:
The small outlet just adjacent to the main road is way better than the restaurant on the first floor.

Typically known for the fast food, which is also not that good, Zaika's biriyani is one of the worst in the city. The rolls are pre-made and oil-soakedand is not at all edible afterwards. The pakoras are good but the rest of the food does not even come at par with what you have had at cheap foot-stalls. The service is bad and is always crowded, too many cooks spoil the broth. 

P.S. If you are an Arsalan or Rahmania biriyani lover, please stay away.

I have had a chance to eat at Zaika since it's very near to my house. The rolls made here are extremely, extremely poor. They actually pre-make the rolls and keep it very near to the fire, whenever a customer orders for it, they give it from the stack. A very poor attempt in attracting customers. However, the Biriyani tastes absolutely fine and they provide you with big chunky pieces of chicken or mutton, accordingly. The Zaika take-away counter is always brimming with people due to the tidbits that they provide with the young tuition-goers and college students.

They should improve the condition of their rolls as most of the people who wants to have a good egg roll strolls over to their immediate competitor- Bedwin, next door.

After a leisurely walk around the Jadavpur University campus today evening, we felt the need to refresh our tummies, and thus we decided to try out a new place. And just a few paces after crossing the railway tracks at Jadavpur station, there was Zaika. It may be better to point out that there are two Zaika outlets here. The one famous for the rolls and takeaways, and the other - a family restaurant, which was our destination today.

 Just before you prepare to enter the doorway onto the wooden staircase that leads to the restaurant on the first floor, you might have the feeling to take a step back. The reason- visible blatantly and somewhat inappropriately, is the sight of oil drums and pumps and electric metre boxes and stuff – of which I don’t know the purpose but most probably, may be to act as backup generators. Maybe. But the way the entire electric arrangement is visible, right behind the wooden staircase, is quite a bit unpleasant to the eyes. Okay, so after overcoming the initial hiccup we made our way to the first floor and got seated. We initially wanted to sit at a table for two, but had to shift as it was quite away from the air conditioning, and the wall fan nearby couldn’t be moved to face us, due to some technical problems. The overall ambiance isn’t much to write about. Average in that respect, I would say. Might seem a bit cramped if all the seats are taken. But anyway, these are restraints any restaurant has to work with. And not much to comment on, hence. You want to set up shop in a congested place, there would always be a problem with the space. So I would leave that as room for improvement. Moving on to the food now. We initially wanted to order Indian dishes, mainly biriyani but finally went for a combo kinda. We ordered Vegetable Fried Rice, a Chinese dish, and Chicken Tikka Masala, an Indian meal. The first thing that I should comment on is the quantity. The quantity of Vegetable Fried Rice that was served was, practically, much bigger than my expectation. In fact, it was after the dish was served that we realized that we should have order one dish only. The quantity was really very good. The taste was also quite good. And along with that, the combination of Chicken Tikka Masala worked really good as well. There were six pieces of Chicken in all, and all were of average size. The gravy tasted nice, not too spicy and hence was light on the tummy. And finally the cost was very reasonable in my opinion as two plates of vegetable fried rice and one Chicken Tikka Masala cost us Rs. 220.

The best biriani in Kolkata at present. And NO this is not a random claim. I have had Bedwin when it was the best, spent my school days gorging on Zeeshan and then Arsalan. But definitely, at the present time, this is THE best. It is a very small shop, almost a roadside one. It has now expanded with an AC seating arrangement. 

Rolls are good as well.

My Picks: Chicken n mutton biriani and chicken pokora.

Almost every alternate day I go to Zaika on Pal Bazar for having something or other. It has been my habit for the past 2 and half years almost. You can tell that you are nearing the joint and mark Pal Bazar seeing the huge line of people standing over there waiting for their turn to get the desired item. I generally go for my favorite chicken roll. The best thing about this item is the aroma and stuffed chicken pieces. The waiting in queue is really worth it as the quality of any food item is really unparallel. I would suggest anyone to try this place once.

Quite decent food at a comparatively cheaper rate. The Tandoori chicken is a must try item.
