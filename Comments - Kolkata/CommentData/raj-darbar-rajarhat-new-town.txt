It is one of the restaurants in the vicinity of City Centre II,Rajarhat which remains open after 11 pm.This one of the main things.But the service is poor.It takes a long time to serve food.The price is moderate.But the quality of food is average.I opted for chicken with vegetable,which was an improperly improvised version of lemon chicken. Didn't really liked the taste.Mixed Fried Rice was just good.Nothing special.

One of my friends suggested this place to try out bengali food. Situated near CC2 rajarhat, we reached this place with no difficulties to find. They have a single page of bengali menu attached to their main menu,so don't get confused if u are unable to see the bengali menu page on zomato. It exists...üòú
We ordered rice, mug dal, alu posto...and chicken kosha. The ambiance was clean, staffs were nice and helpful. üòÑ

The food arrived after a long wait though. üòê
The quality and quantity of rice was good. ü§ó
Mug dal was tasty and cooked to perfection. üòá
Loved the alu posto,with mustard oil drops on top. ü§ó
Chicken dish was okayish ..üëç
Price is really reasonable,and really a good place to have some bengali food . ‚ò∫
Next time I am gonna try their biriyani and other dishes for sure. üòõ

We went to the mall which is just next to it , i.e cc2. I have tried almost all eat out places in that mall and wanted to try something different alongside avoiding the crowd so headed to this place. I have seen this almost everyday I have passed by it but never given it a try. Thank God that finally I did. This place is so underrated. We ordered CHICKEN LOLLIPOP, MUTTON BIRIYANI and GRAVY NODDLES for the two of us. Oh my god , that is the best lollipop I have ever had in my life. So succulent and juicy and spicey , yuummmyy!!!
Mutton biriyani was average in taste , mutton pieces could have been better. Gravy noddles were perfect as well. It has good amount of all the non veg items.¬†
IF you are visiting this place do try their chicken lollipop. Prices are reasonable here

These are the place I personally rarely bother to visit if not for anyone pressurizing me. ¬†Couple of years back during the new year's eve, I got to accompany here with a friend of mine and hence got treated.
It is located on Rajarhat New Town very near to Chinar Park. the interiors are okayish so are the staffs out there. The food was litte on the lower side or it may be due to the festive rush it was resisting. I did not have much of a fun being there, as it is evident from the fact that I cannot construct sentences while writing the review for this restaurant.

Today we went to Raj darbar for having dinner. I booked it from Nearbuy. Location is good but the other experience was very bad. We had a meal with - 
1. Starter 
2. Dal 
3. Main course (chicken item) 
4. Rice and Ruti
5. Papad 
6. Salad 
7. Desert.. 
When we entered the restaurant no one was present to open the door,  after having seat they served a small glass of cold drinks. And according to the meal they served chicken pokora ( small 3 pieces) as a stater, then come to the main course they served one small bowl rice, Dal and the main things the chicken item that was Chicken Curry comes with only 2 pieces ( very small)  and salad was Just nothing( 2 pieces of cucumber and 2 pieces of onion),  we Just shocked to see this item. That makes its quality very low.  They served only one scope of vanilla ice cream in a bowl that looks like we having our dinner at footpath restaurant.  Overall the experience was very horrible. We'll never go there and request to all that avoid this restaurant..

Visited this place on Navami night, as all other places were extremely crowded in Rajarhat area. I was little skeptical to try this place as I never heard abt it before. As we got places, i quickly checkd on zomato to see decent reviews abt the place. Tried their Chicken Tikka Kebabs and Chicken Hot n Sour Soups fr starters, followed by Chilly Paneer, Veg Fried Rice, Tandoori Roti, Kadhai Paneer, Dal and Pineapple Raita. Serving time was slightly more than usual places, but the food was nice. The place is neat and clean and it also has Valet parking for customers.

This is one of my fav pocket friendly restaurants in kolkata...! The ambience is less than average but they serve tasty food. So this was my 15th visit.. 
Sadly i din like the food this time...
We ordered chicken tandoor and chicken 65 as starters. The starters were disappointing as chicken 65 didn't taste like the actual chicken 65...  And tandoor was okay.
In main course we had shezwan fried rice (non-veg) and chicken korma. Yeah u read it ri8. Chinese with north indian. The rice was not spicy at all. And chiken korma was a disaster. 

 May be it was a bad day fr them and fr me as well. 
Hope next time i wont get disappointed... Otherwise it will be my last visit fr sure :)

Noodles were a little salty, though it has good amount of chicken in it , but i don't think that is of no use if the taste is not good. I have not tried their Indian cuisine yet , but definitely i will not try the Chinese here.

This place is very close to my residence. So I was actually planning to try it out for quite sometime now. Last week this idea got materialized and we ordered (home-delivery) from Raj Darbar. We had ordered for Chicken biriyanis and a plate of Chicken bharta from this place, some basic Indian dishes where you can not really go wrong. The delivery took bit more than 45 minutes to reach our place, maybe due to inclement weather outside. Opening the food packets we found - One of the two biriyanis was strangely having a chicken tandoori piece in it, maybe there were no biriyani chicken pieces left when our order was received. It's always very good to have chicken tandoori but that was not what we ordered for also it being more spicy than normal biriyani chicken the chemistry it shares with the rice and sweet potato in the biriyani gets marred. Also found that the potato was having very little salt in it, but it was well cooked and boiled. The quality of rice used in the biriyani though was satisfactory. Overall the taste was okay. The chicken bharta was bit different from what we usually have at joints like Rahamania, Aminia, etc. I enjoyed the texture it was having with minced onions,etc, overall taste was again okay. Cost-wise, the biriyani at 125/- bucks was a fair bet I guess. Overall to me, it is quite rightly priced. So, if you are around this place you can try out some Indian dishes from this joint at quite reasonable prices. Cheers!

One of my friends suggested this place to try out bengali food. Situated near CC2 rajarhat, we reached this place with no difficulties to find. They have a single page of bengali menu attached to their main menu,so don't get confused if u are unable to see the bengali menu page on zomato. It exists...üòú
We ordered rice, mug dal, alu posto...and chicken kosha. The ambiance was clean, staffs were nice and helpful. üòÑ

The food arrived after a long wait though. üòê
The quality and quantity of rice was good. ü§ó
Mug dal was tasty and cooked to perfection. üòá
Loved the alu posto,with mustard oil drops on top. ü§ó
Chicken dish was okayish ..üëç
Price is really reasonable,and really a good place to have some bengali food . ‚ò∫
Next time I am gonna try their biriyani and other dishes for sure. üòõ

Haven't tried recently but this restaurant stood out in my memory because of the dishes of chicken and fish with lemon grass. Must try, even if in starters.

We went to the mall which is just next to it , i.e cc2. I have tried almost all eat out places in that mall and wanted to try something different alongside avoiding the crowd so headed to this place. I have seen this almost everyday I have passed by it but never given it a try. Thank God that finally I did. This place is so underrated. We ordered CHICKEN LOLLIPOP, MUTTON BIRIYANI and GRAVY NODDLES for the two of us. Oh my god , that is the best lollipop I have ever had in my life. So succulent and juicy and spicey , yuummmyy!!!
Mutton biriyani was average in taste , mutton pieces could have been better. Gravy noddles were perfect as well. It has good amount of all the non veg items.¬†
IF you are visiting this place do try their chicken lollipop. Prices are reasonable here

This place is very near to city centre Rajarhat but remains mostly empty. The food at this place is quite ordinary with no specialty in the items. The decor is also quite ordinary. Nothing much to redeem at this place.

These are the place I personally rarely bother to visit if not for anyone pressurizing me. ¬†Couple of years back during the new year's eve, I got to accompany here with a friend of mine and hence got treated.
It is located on Rajarhat New Town very near to Chinar Park. the interiors are okayish so are the staffs out there. The food was litte on the lower side or it may be due to the festive rush it was resisting. I did not have much of a fun being there, as it is evident from the fact that I cannot construct sentences while writing the review for this restaurant.

Yes d food is d only draw back.its just simply FLAT. No spice, no salt ...just flat.. They must take a note that people come to their place mainly to eat and if d food is not good then its hard to run d business specially when everyday a new restaurant is opening up ....

Today we went to Raj darbar for having dinner. I booked it from Nearbuy. Location is good but the other experience was very bad. We had a meal with - 
1. Starter 
2. Dal 
3. Main course (chicken item) 
4. Rice and Ruti
5. Papad 
6. Salad 
7. Desert.. 
When we entered the restaurant no one was present to open the door,  after having seat they served a small glass of cold drinks. And according to the meal they served chicken pokora ( small 3 pieces) as a stater, then come to the main course they served one small bowl rice, Dal and the main things the chicken item that was Chicken Curry comes with only 2 pieces ( very small)  and salad was Just nothing( 2 pieces of cucumber and 2 pieces of onion),  we Just shocked to see this item. That makes its quality very low.  They served only one scope of vanilla ice cream in a bowl that looks like we having our dinner at footpath restaurant.  Overall the experience was very horrible. We'll never go there and request to all that avoid this restaurant..

Visited this place on Navami night, as all other places were extremely crowded in Rajarhat area. I was little skeptical to try this place as I never heard abt it before. As we got places, i quickly checkd on zomato to see decent reviews abt the place. Tried their Chicken Tikka Kebabs and Chicken Hot n Sour Soups fr starters, followed by Chilly Paneer, Veg Fried Rice, Tandoori Roti, Kadhai Paneer, Dal and Pineapple Raita. Serving time was slightly more than usual places, but the food was nice. The place is neat and clean and it also has Valet parking for customers.

This is one of my fav pocket friendly restaurants in kolkata...! The ambience is less than average but they serve tasty food. So this was my 15th visit.. 
Sadly i din like the food this time...
We ordered chicken tandoor and chicken 65 as starters. The starters were disappointing as chicken 65 didn't taste like the actual chicken 65...  And tandoor was okay.
In main course we had shezwan fried rice (non-veg) and chicken korma. Yeah u read it ri8. Chinese with north indian. The rice was not spicy at all. And chiken korma was a disaster. 

 May be it was a bad day fr them and fr me as well. 
Hope next time i wont get disappointed... Otherwise it will be my last visit fr sure :)

Food is not up to the mark. I tried their Chinese dishes (Chicken Noodles , Chicken Fried Rice , Chilli Chicken gravy) and i am certainly not happy with the taste.¬†
Noodles were a little salty, though it has good amount of chicken in it , but i don't think that is of no use if the taste is not good. I have not tried their Indian cuisine yet , but definitely i will not try the Chinese here.

This place is very close to my residence. So I was actually planning to try it out for quite sometime now. Last week this idea got materialized and we ordered (home-delivery) from Raj Darbar. We had ordered for Chicken biriyanis and a plate of Chicken bharta from this place, some basic Indian dishes where you can not really go wrong. The delivery took bit more than 45 minutes to reach our place, maybe due to inclement weather outside. Opening the food packets we found - One of the two biriyanis was strangely having a chicken tandoori piece in it, maybe there were no biriyani chicken pieces left when our order was received. It's always very good to have chicken tandoori but that was not what we ordered for also it being more spicy than normal biriyani chicken the chemistry it shares with the rice and sweet potato in the biriyani gets marred. Also found that the potato was having very little salt in it, but it was well cooked and boiled. The quality of rice used in the biriyani though was satisfactory. Overall the taste was okay. The chicken bharta was bit different from what we usually have at joints like Rahamania, Aminia, etc. I enjoyed the texture it was having with minced onions,etc, overall taste was again okay. Cost-wise, the biriyani at 125/- bucks was a fair bet I guess. Overall to me, it is quite rightly priced. So, if you are around this place you can try out some Indian dishes from this joint at quite reasonable prices. Cheers!

If you go in not expecting much - as you shouldn't given the location, decor and prices - then you will be very pleasantly surprised by their Indian fare, partcularly kebabs.
