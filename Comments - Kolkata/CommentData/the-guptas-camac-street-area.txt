Being a hardcore meat eater I seldom visit restaurants that don‚Äôt serve non veg, but my experience at gupta‚Äôs was pretty good. For those that have not heard about this place, Guptas is located on theatre road (Shakespeare sarani). 

I don‚Äôt claim to be an expert on Gupta‚Äôs (having visited this place only once). However, during that visit I ended up ordering a malai kofta along with butter naan. The service was really quick and the waiters were extremely polite and responsive. The food was pretty tasty but not mind blowing. The ambience interiors were decent and the place was very hygienic.

Though I have been here couple of times earlier and had loved the food so I planned for a dinner with my family and friends on 25th June 2017. We were 8 of them and they could not provide us place to seat together rather they insisted to sit on 2 different seats due to which we had to move out even after Restuarant was 90% empty as there was only 1 family with 8-10 members dining there. When we were moving out of the restaurant I was surprised to see that they are least bothered if any customer leaves after checking in....I think they are doing so well that if any 1 group leaves it hardly matters. God bless.

Bad food. Bad service and boring ambiance. I went there with my family and clearly it isn't a place to go with large group. The place is too small. The waiters are ill mannered. We ordered Chinese bhel as a starter, they used tomato ketchup as sauce and had too much of cabbage. Instead of using noodles, they put in namkin (a savory made out of maida). Veg Au Gratin was next, which was delicious and tasted too good. My 1.5 goes to gratin only. Main course was kadhai paneer, Kali Dal and mixed vegetables with Naan, Kulcha and tandoori roti. Kali Dal was too spicy and was bland in taste. I didn't dare to eat Kadhi paneer after I saw the oil floating. Mixed vegetables was nothing special. But everything was too spicy. Naan was too fat but decent amount of butter made it taste OK. I didn't try the Kulcha. Tandoori roti was nicely toasted and taste was fine. Lastly we ordered a veg Biryani which was a horiffic accident. I never heard a Biryani without onion or garlic and we came to know of it only after it was served. The waiter didn't point out the same even when we ordered a Biryani with onion and one without onion. I heard a lot about this restaurant and I am truly disappointed and clearly it is no heaven for vegetarians. You could try Bombay Shiv Sagar instead to taste what heaven could feel like.

Small restaurant however is pretty good. I  not very fond of veg dishes however this place is very good. I went there several occasions due to proximity of my previous office and some of my colleagues were pure vegetarian. The veg thali they serve is quite good and the quantity is more than sufficient, but my favourite there is 'Kumbh Hara Matar' (Mushroom with Green Peas).

My quest for perfect North Indian food (veg) ends here. I dropped in here for dinner with my family after shopping at Westside, Pantaloons which is at 6mins distance from the Guptas. The ambience here is nothing fancy and the space too is not that huge but is decent enough with comfortable seats to spend a quality time. 
The Dal Makhani and achari aloo dum was heaven with ample quantity. It's a MUST order. Pineapple raita was both sweet and sour and was absolutely delicious. 
One can expect Courteous and timely service with delicious food which won't hurt your pocket.

Quality of the food is good no doubt but i felt a bit less in quantity. Other than that, good behaviour of the staffs and management is nice. Parking is a bit hectic and since it's situated on a one way road one has to take a round or two to locate for the first time.

Location-Camac street,Kolkata.

Guptas is an old and renowned name in the field of restaurants.This place deals in  pure vegetarian delicacies and serves north indian,fast food and south indian cuisines.Its a small restaurant which can accomodate approx 40 people at a time.

Service-The service at this place was quite fast and the staff was also very cooperative.

Ambiance-This place was extremely calm and soothing.Though the interiors are simple but the seating is very comfortable.

Food-This place is mainly known for its thalis but along with its thali we also tried some of its north indian delicacies which was also good.We had
1:Sarso wali tikka
2:Ghar ki thali
3:Nawabi paneer tikka
4:Cream of tomato soup

All the above item were good and the price was also cost effective.

A pure veg joint on Wood Street - Theatre Road crossing. The Thali is its signature item and a favorite amongst hungry office crowd of the area in the lunch hours. Also serves a decent variety of South Indian snacks. But the must try is their Corn Palak! One of the best I have ever had. But if u r going ala carte'...be prepared for a long waiting time.

The Gupta's is a pure veg restaurant located near Camac St./Theatre road crossing. It's a small place with a very ordinary ambience. We went there for a lunch on Sat afternoon and place was not very crowded. We decided to order standard North Indian cuisine with Dal, Paneer, Mix veg and breads. Mix veg was not that great. Paneer was awesome and Kali Dal was good. Breads were soft and kulchas had good stuffing. Service is a little slow due to shortage of staff and a small kitchen. Price is ok. Good place for a quick bite.

The idly sambhar was nice too with the waiter on attention ever willing to refill the sambhar. 
Really loved the chaat over here though. That was. The deal dealer for me. 
Will definitely come here again for chaat.

Now to d kulchas- well totally worth trying, my hav being masala kulcha

What I also like abt this place is d variety of raitas they offer- my fav being boondi raita and mixed raita,
Cucumber raita is gud nt nt dat great

Now to d desserts- definitely go for d hot gulabjamun and rabri. It's heaven served on a plateüòá

Visited the place yesterday evening with my wife.

Location: Crossing of Wood Street and Theatre Road. You will not miss it. But parking is a problem. Especially on office days.

D√©cor: A small place of about 40 seating capacity. Nicely done up bright interior. Comfortable table and chairs.

Food: It is a vegetarian restaurant with the main focus on North Indian cuisine. They also serve basic items of South Indian, Italian, Mexican and Chinese cuisines.
They also have a North Indian thali just during lunch time about 12.30 to 3.00 pm. The thali is very good, and reasonably priced so a super hit with the office people of the area. Have sampled it many a time earlier.

A point to note- their lunch time is from 12.30 to 3.00 pm. Post that they only serve snack items on the menu and South Indian till 6.30 pm. Dinner time is from 7.30 pm onwards.

In this visit we ordered plain dhosa, vada , Margareta cheese tomatoes pizza and cold coffee. Quality and taste of food is really good and price is reasonable.

Service: The service is excellent. Mr. Jai Singh who was serving us recognised us,greeted us with a smile and asked why we were visiting the place after such a long time. Thank you so much Mr. Singh.

Pocket Pinch: for two persons snacks Rs. 300+ and for dinner it would be 600+. Thali is about Rs. 130 per person. Really reasonable for the quality of food they serve. Good value for money veg restaurant.

Started visiting this restaurant some 15 years ago but started reviewing it on Zomato only today (ROFL!). 1 of our favourites, this place indeed provides great value for money, coupled with good food and nice service. ¬†
The place is conveniently situated at some distance from St. Xaviers‚Äô College and you can park your car in the adjoining gully! The place is quite small, grossly cramped up and forcefully accommodates 40 odd people. Seating arrangements include only wooden furniture, which don‚Äôt give you the cosiness which you seek. Often customers have difficulty placing food plates, food containers and personal stuff on their tables.

Coming to food, indeed, 1 of the better ones in town. We started off with cream of tomato with crotons ‚Äì which was served hot-n-fresh and was nice. It was followed up with Babycorn ‚Äì which was nice but a tad too sweet. Paneer tikka, again, was not really upto the mark today ‚Äì it lacked the desired taste, although the cold Mint chutney served along with it was fantastic. Moving to main course, palak corn was served, which was tasty ‚Äì but not like they usually serve. Paneer makhani was nice and kali daal ‚Äì mediocre. Pudina parantha was good, but the only disappointment was that it was maida base instead of atta. Same for the onion kulcha! Subz Biryani did not exactly give the feel of a biryani ‚Äì was too yellowish ‚Äì although, it did not taste bad and had decent vegetable content. I had requested for a Sweet Lime (MIX), but was served Sweet Lime (SALTED) ‚Äì which just had too much of salt in it. Otherwise, their sweet lime sugar is very tasty. We have had much better experiences here in the past, but today, we seemed somewhat unfortunate.

At the end, we all still had some empty space in our stomach, so we just decided to try out an item which we had never tasted before, their onion rava masala dosa. 1 of the best rava masala we ever had ‚Äì ohhhhhh, the beautiful red colour of the dosa, served with cold white chutney and piping hot sambhar ‚Äì too full of vegetables. We might now visit this place just for their south indian delicacies.

Service is nice and quick, barring the fact that the attendant yelled at us when we followed up for the dosa. Prices are not high, but sad to see that they do not accept Sodexo vouchers ‚Äì although, they operate in a hardcore office environment. Also, ambience is pretty ordinary but if your primary focus is food, then you can definitely try out this place!

A good vegetarian option on Shakespeare Sarani. We had ordered thali. The delivery was quick.  The food was really good and tasted home cooked. The staff was polite.  The place is pretty pocket friendly. Heavily recommended.

After a long gap visited this restaurant with family. Masala kulchas were good, so were dal and naan. Service was good. Panneer makhan masala was a disappointment. A rude shock - they accept only cash.

Started visiting this restaurant some 15 years ago but started reviewing it on Zomato only today (ROFL!). 1 of our favourites, this place indeed provides great value for money, coupled with good food and nice service. ¬†
The place is conveniently situated at some distance from St. Xaviers‚Äô College and you can park your car in the adjoining gully! The place is quite small, grossly cramped up and forcefully accommodates 40 odd people. Seating arrangements include only wooden furniture, which don‚Äôt give you the cosiness which you seek. Often customers have difficulty placing food plates, food containers and personal stuff on their tables.

Coming to food, indeed, 1 of the better ones in town. We started off with cream of tomato with crotons ‚Äì which was served hot-n-fresh and was nice. It was followed up with Babycorn ‚Äì which was nice but a tad too sweet. Paneer tikka, again, was not really upto the mark today ‚Äì it lacked the desired taste, although the cold Mint chutney served along with it was fantastic. Moving to main course, palak corn was served, which was tasty ‚Äì but not like they usually serve. Paneer makhani was nice and kali daal ‚Äì mediocre. Pudina parantha was good, but the only disappointment was that it was maida base instead of atta. Same for the onion kulcha! Subz Biryani did not exactly give the feel of a biryani ‚Äì was too yellowish ‚Äì although, it did not taste bad and had decent vegetable content. I had requested for a Sweet Lime (MIX), but was served Sweet Lime (SALTED) ‚Äì which just had too much of salt in it. Otherwise, their sweet lime sugar is very tasty. We have had much better experiences here in the past, but today, we seemed somewhat unfortunate.

At the end, we all still had some empty space in our stomach, so we just decided to try out an item which we had never tasted before, their onion rava masala dosa. 1 of the best rava masala we ever had ‚Äì ohhhhhh, the beautiful red colour of the dosa, served with cold white chutney and piping hot sambhar ‚Äì too full of vegetables. We might now visit this place just for their south indian delicacies.

Service is nice and quick, barring the fact that the attendant yelled at us when we followed up for the dosa. Prices are not high, but sad to see that they do not accept Sodexo vouchers ‚Äì although, they operate in a hardcore office environment. Also, ambience is pretty ordinary but if your primary focus is food, then you can definitely try out this place!

Had a family party there with around 15 people. Food was good. Although not very spacious but surely a pocket friendly restra. You can try it out if you looking for good north indian food. Interiors not that extra ordinary nor it is a place for fine dining.  Just a simple place to eat with simple food.

We were hungry @ParkStreet, hubby and I. We wanted to eat north Indian food and not fast food (OK, believe me we don't crave for non fast 'food that often peeps ;-) ). We stopped at The Guptas thinking if we had chosen the right place. We weren't looking for too rich food or a fine dining experience and hence this place fit perfectly. 
The ambience is simple yet quiet and calm, not very pleasant looking waiters. But assured clean plates n cutlery (these days u need to be worried about these things at fine dining tables too!!), yummy north Indian food. I have concluded that this is my favourite north Indian joint as of today! Food is decently priced. Modest portion size. Thali was good, I would have liked more sabzis on the plate however. Thali had two naans, a small portion of jeera rice, 3 types of sabzis, raita and 1 gulab jamun(wasn't that great though!). So thaali is not for big eaters but was yummy tummy full enough for us. So a definite 'must try' reco from me here folks!

This was my experience last night at the restaurant:
I entered the restaurant and asked for a seat for 3. The manager said to sit in the mid column. While seeing that the restaurant was not filled, I asked that if we could be seated in the place of 6 since the whole column was empty and no reservation or waiting was there.
The manager was so rude that he said if you want to be seated then you have only the mid column empty or else you can leave.
I have visited this restaurant innumerous amount of times and i asked him how can he react to any customer.
After an argument he finally asked us to sit but we left and i recommend not to visit the place.
This place doesn't deserve a star.

Though im not much into veg, but I have to admit their awesome taste in the category. Tried the butter naan, paneer butter masala being oh! so tasty & ofcourse the kali daal.. Mouth watering! Good quantity too..Also had hot Gulab jamuns for  dessert. Will surely visit soon :)

I donot gave a record of how many times have I visited this place.

Easy to locate. Located near Shibuji's outlet at Theatre road. The place is well maintained and ambience is cool and simple. A good place to dine out with family.

I have possibly tasted everything on their menu to say the least. For starters, I would recommed crispy chilly babycorn and paneer tikka. For the mains, American corn palak, kadae paneer, yellow dal, butter naan, jeera rice, roasted papad is our order. However, the augratin tastes horrible (tried twice) and is recommended to not take risk of having that dangerously cooked dish.

The place is packed with vegetarian food lovers. The quantity is enough for four heads. Very pocket friendly. A reasonably priced place. 

However with passage of time, service is getting affected. During peak hours, service is slow. Also, a few staff on complaining about the uncooked food or the bad taste tend to become aggressive.

Overall a good experience.

I have not kept track of how many times have I visited this place...Guptas for me is the most flavourful and the tastiest vegetarian food in Kolkata.
I have possibly tasted everything on their menu... the buttery garlicky thin naan with the creamy kali dal the after taste of which will make you keep coming back.
Try their simple yellow dal with jeera rice and you will long for more...  oh and the chana masala absolutely delectable... the kashmiri alu dum..The paneer koftas in rich white gravy can give a stiff competition to any non vegetarian fare ...I would choose the former any day.
Even the bhature  ( 1 the size of a football!) tastes absolutely divine...The pav bhaji with overload of maska bliss, the pudina naan,  the masala kulcha. ..divine !!!!
No photographs sorry...The smell and the site will not give you time to wait and click but attack :)

I've visited this outlet twice, its just next to Shibuji's outlet at Theatre Road - easy to find spot. The place is well maintained and the songs are played softly to keep the atmosphere cool and simple. This is the place where you can go and have fun with family rather than a group of fun loving chatty friends.. It is because you have to keep your enjoying moody tone low ( as they told us to be less noisy when I with my group of 7 friends went to have lunch and our so called "chatting" disturbed the waiter who told us to be less noisy xD ).

If you are in the mood for good vegetarian food, look no further. Located in the prime of the city in Theatre road, a few blocks from Pantaloons and Westside lies The Gupta's. ¬†A group of us went there recently for dinner and ordered Paneer Tikka Hariyali, Tandoori Aloo and Crispy Babycorn for starters. While the Aloo and Babycorn were tasty and favourful, the Paneer was a bit bland even with the chutney provided. For main course we had the Cheese Kulcha, Masala Kulcha, Butter nan, Aloo meethi masala, Palak Paneer and Dal Makhani.The Kulchas were tasty and I really like the Aloo meethi masala, it had a very light flavour. The Palak Paneer and Dal tasted good, like in any other hotel.¬†¬†Overall, the food was good.¬†
I have also on earlier occasions had their Thali, which is very reasonable at about Rs 120 and it is more than enough for 1 person. Their dahi vada and papri chaat is also good.From their Chinese section, the gravy noodles are really good.

I used to go here during my school days as it was near my school but sort of forgot about it after that. However, I rediscovered the place a couple of years earlier and have been going here regularly ever since; almost once every two months. My favourite here is the Veg Thali. Priced very nominally, the Thali has two sabzis (mostly Paneer butter masala and Alu Dum) and Kaali Daal ¬†alone with one rice item, two Roti items, one cup raita, one paapad and one sweet. All of the items are quite delicious and will fill you completely. This tahli, though, is only available during lunch. If you want to try something else, I would suggest Corn Palak which is my absolute favourite here. I have tried Corn Palak at different restaurants too but the Guptas one beats everyone hands down. Their Veg Biriyani is excellent and so are most of their paneer items. A highly recommended place for its nominal charges (they don't even take VAT) and excellent food. A haven for veg-food lovers like me.

Hv bn visitng this plc fr a really long tym and never the less i hv not bn dissapointed no matter wht i try.. The Ambience out here is calm and composed.. This is a vegetarian restaurant which serves one of the best vegetarian food out thr and the prices are reasonably done! This plc offers u frm the indian thali's to mexican food, south indian and a few italian cuisine too.. I hv mostly tried all cuisines out here.. B it the dosas, idly, the sambar vadas, uttapam.. The south indian section is really well done.. The north indian cuisine however is my favourite.. I really love thr dal makhani, moong dal tarka, shahi paneer, makai corn jhal farezi, paneer makhani to name a few.. Thr corn augratine and the veg sandwiches are grt too.. However the pizza's out here is sumthing tht i dont lyk.. The last tym tht i visited the plc i tried out thr veg thali which included 2 rotis, jeera rice, papad, raita,dal makhani, shahi paneer, and aloon ki sabzi along wid 1 gulab jamun. The thali was v reasonably priced and the food was jst too tasty! The staff out here are v friendly and thy hv maintained this plc really well..
However the best thing that i found recently was tht thy properly explained the increased cost of mineral water and soft drinks which is also illustrated in one the images tht i hv attached in the review.. Over all i hv had a v good exprnc no matter how mny tyms i visit out thr!

The place is quite pocket friendly too.

Definitely haves :
Masala papad
Ice cream (they've got fantastic multi scooped ice creams at dirt cheap prices). 

I went here with my family for dinner.
We had everything. Soups and appetizers, starters, 2 course meal, dessert and ice cream.
And footed a bill of 1100 for 5.
Yup. The food was great. The service was a bit slow since we went too early but it was neat nonetheless. The tandoori roti was especially delightful. Most dishes were generically tasted but the whole package was quite good.

The Guptas is one of the best pure Vegetarian restaurants in Kolkata. It's a small restaurant, it can accommodate 52 people only. The ambience is simple. Whenever I visit to Kolkata I try to visit this restaurant as it serves yummy & delicious food. Minestrone soup, Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta, Pindi Chana, Methi Mutter Malai, Masala Kulcha, Crispy Fried Baby Corn are must try options. Cost wise, it's reasonable.

[Date: January 17, 2015]

Location: A minute away from Shibuji, Theatre Road.

The Guptas (Savera) was introduced to me by one of my friends this morning and being a Saturday, we decided to visit for luncheon. The AMBIANCE out here is calm and soothing with light Bollywood songs (which can be replaced by instrumentals) in the background, bell-shaped lamps across the walls, spots and decked false ceiling with tray lights, the cute colored tissue paper holder with perforations of different designs and a seating arrangement which can accommodate around fifty heads at one go. Isn't a big place but, yes the food they serve would surely keep bringing you back here.

We reached this place around 15:00 hours and were warmly greeted by one of the servers. In a minute we were shown our seats and thereafter, a couple of minutes to contemplate through the fare. The available fare consisted of South Indian, North Indian and a couple of dishes from the Italian and Mexican cuisine. After a bit of contemplation, we zeroed on going with the North Indian Cuisine (leaving the rest for future visits) and ordered the following:

- Dahi Kebab [4 pieces]
Now, this wasn't quite expected. We were expecting the usual griddle-cooked kebab with a filling of seasoned curd served along with mint chutney, but, we got kebabs which were made of mashed potatoes and veggies served along with raita. Nevertheless, the kebabs were good to eat so, didn't have much of a complaint.

- Dal Makhani
Absolutely delectable!
Black lentils simmered at the right temperature, seasoned with the right balance of spices except cinnamon powder which was a tad higher & topped with a drizzle of cream. Even after a little flaw, it tasted amazing!
Recommended.

- Pindi Chana (Dry)
Yes, they also have a gravy option. 
The dry one tasted good as it had the spot on amount of spices, but, the Chana wasn't perfectly boiled. Thus, a slight disappointment here.

- Masala Kulcha
Flavorful filling of perfectly seasoned and saut√©ed mashed potatoes. I could eat it without any curry. :P
Recommended.

- Naan Lehsuni (Garlic Naan)
A long bread topped with garlic and baked at the right temperature in the tandoor. Crisp and served with a slight brush of butter. Oh so good it was to taste!
Recommended.

- Boondi Raita
The whipped curd was fresh and a spoon of raita hinted that the boondis were still crisp. Thus, made to order and not stocked. Happy. 

‚Ä¢The quantity (main course) was found to be adequate enough for three heads.

The STAFF served its customers with utmost courteousness and politeness. The SERVICE was also found to be at a standard speed.

A reasonably PRICED place.

Overall was a good experience. 
- Coming back soon for the remaining fare.

A pure veg restaurant located in theatre road..It is a typical family restaurant where one can go and enjoy a dinner or maybe lunch..
They serve nice north-indian but the richness of a high-end restaurant is missing but still the food is nice at the price..
If you are looking for a budgeted dinner ,go hit this place..it will not disappoint you..

Located round the corner to Shibhuji, this, a pure veg restaurant is my family favourite. You could come here and eat to your heart's content and still not feel like you've eaten too much. Do try out the Baby corn dishes they serve and the Dal Makhani :)

A pure veg restaurant located in theatre road..It is a typical family restaurant where one can go and enjoy a dinner or maybe lunch..
They serve nice north-indian but the richness of a high-end restaurant is missing but still the food is nice at the price..
If you are looking for a budgeted dinner ,go hit this place..it will not disappoint you..

I have never visited this place. But my mom does it quite often as most of her kitty parties are held here. She generally packs something or the other for us while returning. So this review is solely based on that and there would be no comments on the service or ambiance. Recently she had packed an entire meal which consisted of

pav bhaji
plain dosa
veg noodles
crispy babycorn
dal makhani
tikka haryali masala
naan

All the items were quite good but special mention to crispy baby corn which stood out in the traditional dishes. Surprisingly it remained crisp till the time the parcel reached us and we enjoyed every bite of.
Will be paying a visit soon to this joint.

The place is located opp std chartered bank in theater road. The place is mostly crowded during lunch hours, as the office crowd n shopping crowd is quite frequent.  Decor is simple n clean.  The food tasted average. The service a little slow in the peak time. Very pocket friendly pricing, no extra taxes added. 
If caterer disappoints again will go there, otherwise not.

One of the best FAMILY restaurant which will be light on your pocket and heavy on your stomach:) Best word to describe this place is "value for money".  Our whole family i.e. five of us went there to have our weekend dinner around 8 pm. We were lucky enough to get seats during peak hours as the place was almost full. The ambience is not great but descent enough for a family chit chat on the table. At first go we thought of ordering combination of South and North Indian cuisine but they apprised us that after 7pm only North Indian food is being served. So we zeroed in to order North Indian food dat is Dal makhni, matar methi malai, mix veg, subz biryani, papad, breads and gulab jamun at the end. The food was descent and tasty. Service time was around 15 minutes and the staff courteous enough to serve properly. We shelled out in total INR 899 for the meal.  Perhaps will like to visit this place again in near future.

A lot of my colg memories are attached with this restaurant..Close to my colg in theatre road, guptas serve North Indian and continental.The place is compact but serves great food.The only place I guess which serves lunch till 4.
The stewards are warm at their behaviour.... Service is quick... Prices are reasonable too
A must try

Just had a delicious outing with Rawa masala dosa and feeling great. In this land of fish and some great non vegetarian dishes, its really good to find a well designed and quiet South indian outlet. The ambience is perfect for people who do not like to be surrounded by all the noise of bustling street nearby.Service is good and you do not have to wait more than 10 minutes for your order. The sambar and the coconut chutney tasted great .Only letdown was the masala which I feel could have had a few more ingredients to spice it up just a little.  The tutti fruity was a perfect parting shot and Guptas is sure a place I recommend for all South Indian delicacy lovers !!!!

The guptas is a small restaurant in theater road ( cross the road from arun tea stall towards shakespare sarani, keep going left) 
They serve north indian as well as well as select continental fare.The interiers are very cosy and warm however the place is very small and compact. The waiters literally sqeeze between chairs to serve up your order.However the service is surprisingly quick.
Must trys include dal makhni,malai kofta, paneer makkhan masala,pindi chana,subzi salan hyderabadi(prepared in spicy gravy),tikka hariyali masala.Starters like paneer tikka ,sarso wali tikka are yum.The lehsuni nan,pudina paratha are my favourite. 
Though the food here is good, i find the place to be very compact and small.But otherwise a nice place to try.

Ive been going to  the 'The Guptas' for over last 10 years and 90% times ive been satisfied with their quality and service except for a few times when there quality was bit here and there specially during rush hours but overall my experience had been great. I would recommend this restaurant to all veg foodies for their north indian fare who are looking for quality food at resonable price!!

My ratings is strictly based on the dosa I tasted. After seeing such amazing ratings on zomato, we decided to try the south indian there. Its situated almost at the junction of camac street and wood street, just a few minutes from Pantaloons, Camac Street. Decor and ambience is pretty impressive. The staff is also very helpful and service really fast. We reached there around 5pm following the gps. The whole restaurant was empty much to our amazement. We ordered a Butter Onion Masala Dosa. I loved the dosa but the filling was just above average. Nothing special. I loved the chutneys, especially the coconut chutney.

I always find this place critical to reach, so I never try it alone; always have a guide to lead my way. I always find this restaurant a bit crowded whenever I visited. May be this is a paradise for vegan foodies. This place is medium spaced diner, with wooden carvings for decoration. Mahogany furniture gave this place a classy look. 
Since my first visit I never forget their one dish, the taste of it. They named it ‚ÄòCorn Palak‚Äô. But I said, it‚Äôs a taste master. Fine gravy of Palak loaded with sweet corn. It‚Äôs loaded with savors and absolutely well balanced.  It perfectly went with ‚ÄòKulcha‚Äô. Their Kashmiri Pulao is very picturesque, colorful veggies and fruits enhanced the flavors. Once I have tried their ‚ÄòCrispy Fired Babycorn‚Äô. I have found it very appealing on my taste buds. 
The stewards are warm at their behavior. They know their job. But I found their service a bit sloth, I longed for my food. I find their menu a bit of overpriced, but in some cases the food overlapped the complaints. It can be a nice hang out place for vegan foodies and who loves to veggies but with a little twist in it.

A place on Theatre Road, offering North Indian, South Food...

The place is completely vegetarian also serves Jain Food.   Have always ate their North Indian Food.

Decor: The place has dim lights. Reaching the place early is a good option since the place is small and it gets filled up fast. 

Paneer Tikka, Dahi Kabab were good. From the main coruse, Methi Matar Malai, Veg Jhalfrazi is good.

Price: Very pocket friendly prices.

Will recommend this place for sure...

This is one place where satisfaction is de facto whenever I go out to dine there. I remember once the owner of the restaurant humbly said that his motto is to make good food available to families at affordable prices. The restaurant, at a very good location just beside Shibuji, attracts almost all types of crowd whether office goers, families, couples or college goers who want to treat friends affordably. The ambiance has dim lights, menu is vast and the service is good. Some must haves:
- Dahi Kabab, Nawabi Paneer tikka (Starters)
- Paneer Makhani,  Kashmiri Aludum, Pindi Chana, Dal Makhani (Main course)
- Hari Moti Ka Pulao (Rice prep)
- Nan Lehsuni, Pudina Paratha (Breads)
- Veg AuGratin (A must try Side Dish)
Pocket Pinch for 2 - Rs 600/=, for 4 people - 1100/=
I have also availed their catering service few years back and I must add this that apart from excellent service and delicious food, their entire process from the start to the end was neat and clean and my hall was left spic and span!

A nice place for a quick bite situated a stone's throw from Sibuji on Theatre Road. The fare is vegetarian but quite tasty and pocket friendly. I have sampled the Cheese Plain Dosa,  Papri Chaat  and Pav Bhaji all of which were quite well prepared. The Chole Bhature though was quite average in taste , I have had much better. I have also eaten the Kashmiri Alu Dum with the Meethi Paneer and Naan and found all of them to be tasty dishes.

This place is quite surprisingly amazing. It perfectly satisfies the cravings for pure North Indian veg cuisines. The items on the menu are delicious, especially Tandoori Aaloo, Dahi Kabab, Sabzi Jaipuri, Hariyali Kofta and Tikka Hariyali Masala. Didn't try the South Indian and the pizza stuff, because I went to this place solely to eat North Indian cuisines....
.....and was extremely delighted.

I highly recommend.

This place looks nice with the dim lights and simple decor. When we entered, the place was totally empty and the staff were eagerly waiting for us to order. We ordered for a butter onion masala dosa and a cheese masala dosa. The cheese masala dosa was the best with a consistent layer of cheese on the inner side of the dosa. The servers were nice enough to promptly fill up our emptying bowls of sambhar and coconut chutney. The prices are affordable and the food is filling. The only thing that disgusted me was the lack of a washbasin as the tiny washroom was worse than horrible. Hope they take care of this problem.

I had gone to The Guptas on a sunday evening along with a few of my friends. The place has gorgeous interiors but is too small for a good restaurant. The people working are kind and serve well. Before going to the place we felt that the restaurant was expensive but after the mouth-watering delicious food we felt value for the money that we had paid. It has amazing food and well behaved and good people working around. The ambience isn't that great and it lacks a decent waiting area. But overall its a great experience.
