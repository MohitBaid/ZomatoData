Not so well decorated but the food is good. Cheap as well. The food quality is good. Do visit with your family or friends. Aaand the main thing is here tax isn't applicable.

Well this is a multicuisine eatery with limited seating capacity but conveniently located.The seats are cramped and there is nothing special about this place.The food out here is above average but the quantity is appropriate and noteworthy in regards to the pricing.The service is quick.we gorged on Tandoori Chicken for starters and had mainly the Chinese items like the Chili Chicken , schezwan chicken and sweet n sour fish with mixed fried rice and hakkka noodles to make it a wholesome meal altogether.This pocketfriendly place being close to College street is best for college goers and is also a good choice for ardent shoppers who need some binge break between their shopping sprees.

Located at the lane of Town school,this place looks quite big from outside but as we entered I did not quite like the ambience of the place,a small narrow space.The seating is comfortable though but the place looks shabby and dingy.We were two people and just ordered a plate of chicken hakka noodles and chicken with vegetables and mushroom.The noodles were oily and basically like home cooked noodles.The chicken gravy only had onion and capsicum in the 'vegetable part' and the gravy was a bit sweet to my taste.The pickled chillies and chilli sauce became a savior here for me.The quality of chicken was good.

The menu in Zomato is highly outdated,the item prices are more by atleast Rs 40 or Rs 50 now.

This might be a really small and old place but then it is really budget friendly and serves some very generous amounts of quantity in the dishes. We ordered chicken and mutton biriyani along with chicken tikka masala and mutton curry.

Last year during puja, I had take away from here. Bought chicken biryani. Very sorry to say the biryani was rotten. It tasted like sour. The pickle given with it also sour. Thumbs down. Not recomended.

This place is located among the group of eateries in the Hatibagan market area along with Arsalan, Bagicha and has a history as it has been there from a long while. I went there with a friend for dinner. The place is very small, the passage to reach the seats is narrow and even the seats do not have enough leg space. Nothing much to say about the ambience, nothing about the place was eye catching. Looks wise, very ordinary. The staff were prompt in taking orders and food was served within 10 minutes. We ordered a 'tandoori chicken' half which was two pieces. It was served with a yoghurt mint sour chutney which was yummy. The chicken was well cooked and tasty though nothing over the top. Then we ordered one mixed fried rice and a chicken reshmi butter masala. The fried rice was okay, but the pieces of prawn were not property done as some still had shells and it gave out a smell when I ate it. The side dish had six pieces of boneless chicken and was nice and tasty. But one thing to mention is the quantity. We both could not finish the main course dishes. It was too much for us. My friend still finished the rice somehow but 2-3 pieces of the chicken side dish had to be packed for takeaway. So quantity wise, super. We were charged a tax amount of 21% which to me was quite unbelievable as the place was so very dull and an extra â‚¹5 for the packing of food.
So, ordinary place with zero ambience, prompt service, good food, great quantity. Overall okayish experience.
