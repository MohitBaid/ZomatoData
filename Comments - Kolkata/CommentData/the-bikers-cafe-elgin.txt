This is a wonderful cafe with a great ambiance. The best part about the cafe is that it is not concentrated only on Indian cuisine but it has a variety of cuisines to serve. I liked the chocolate shake the most. The price however is on a higher side. It was a good experience.

One of the best themed restaurants in Kolkata. Lovely ambience and great vibes! Its perfect for a date with your better half or a fun outing with your pals. My centre of attraction is the great foosball table! 
Food is good, but the quantity isn't that great. 
The place is quite costly and the prices are definitely on the higher side.

This one is the best cafe for me so far.
They serve small bites whose recipe belongs to different countries.
They serve alcoholic beverages as well.
The interior decor is pretty much interesting with all those helmets,gears bikes etc which perfectly suuts its name.
The serve here is spontaneous.
As a whole a nice place to hangout when u r out for a ride on your bike.

A nice cozy cafe with a great ambience to hang out for. The biker's decor, cool music, comfortable seating and wide genre of food on the menu made my experience a good one here. 
Their thin trust pizza was perfectly done. Recommend the Malaysian Chicken Satay. Kudos to their Detox Drink menu. The service was brisk and the food was good. The pocket pinch was moderate. Will be visiting again soon.

It is a nice place which can turn out to be amazing if you are with your group of friends. The service is good, ambience is is good and happy. They have hookah and free wifi as well! The food we had tasty really delicious üòã but the thing I didn't like personally is that their starters & sizzlers come in more quantity than the main course. Talking about the cost, I would rather say the cost is OK according to the service and food we get here - neither too expensive nor too cheap!

Right kind of Continental- American cuisine place.
I loved the food - specially the chicken wings are a definite try for this place.
We were 4 people.
Chicken wings in starters - we ordered twice.
Burger was good - served with french fries.
Pizza was nice - sausages we're yummy.
We had a Sizzler too - that was delicious.
Cocktails were excellent.
We ordered some chocolate sandwich and chocolate pan cakes at the end - which was the perfect dessert - and made it an awesome lunch.
Decor was OK.
However, the food is quite expensive - infact, if you have an average appetite , it would cost you a thousand bucks per head - quantity in each plate is quite less compared to the price.

 So a bit heavier on pocket.

Definitely, at least one time try - a slightly different Cafe feel in Kolkata.

To start with, the ambience is good. The crowd was good, responsible drinkers, students mainly. Service was prompt. However food could be better. Not that its bad, but I've had better Fish Fingers. The Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler was good. The quantity was ample. A Moscow Mule to wet the throat. Not bad again.

This is the best place to chill as it is next to my college, been there many times. The service is absolute remarkable and the food is amazing too. Presentation is on point and for all the various reason this is one of my favorite spot. They do not charge anything such as service tax but only gst. There is a separate place for hookah so that rest of the customers are not bothered. The decor is very unique which justify its name. Overall this place needs a visit if you are looking for good food.

This is an amazing cafe at Elgin Road that serves Italians, Mexicans and many other genres of food, alongside with drinks, both alcoholic and non alcoholic.
Before I start, I'd like to mention that I personally do not drink alcohol so my entire review will based on the rest of their menu.
The place, to start off with, has a lovely ambience that really catches the eye. It's a spacious, comforting place accompanied with good music and great service.
The food available here, including the desserts, are an absolute treat. Whatever we had, were delicious and worthwhile. It may seem a bit expensive from the menu but you get a lot in quantity as well as quality, so in the end, it's pretty reasonable.
What we had :-
1. Chicken Lasagna - must try
2. Knucklehead Peri Peri Chicken Burger - must try
3. Italian Chicken Saltimbocca - must try
4. Hungarian Style Grilled Fish
5. Chocochip Monte Carlo
6. Muddie on a Sundae

Like I said, the experience was amazing at this place and I'd definitely recommend it to everyone else.¬†Do check out my Instagram with username @foodieraja for daily posts.

This is a requests to all the people willing to visit the cafe to drop the plan if you don't want to fall in such an un-welcoming situation..

Awesome experience. Had one of our Sunday lunch with my friend. Theme cafe, you feel like a roadie here. Nearest metro station Rabindra Sadan. Nearest land marks are Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, Netaji Bhavan, Brand Factory & Elgin forum mall. The place is very convenient. Ambience is awesome. But the music is bit louder and the tables are not very spacious. There have some indoor games options also. Sevice is also good but little time taking to place the order. But above all pros & cons the food & cocktail quality & quantity are fabulous. If you like continental cuisine, then this is one of the best place in Kolkata.

Must try:

Food:
Spaghetti meatballs (spaghetti pasta, coated with marinara sauce, topped with Lamb meatballs, & served with crostini)
Bikers chicken fusion discovery (2 boneless chicken fillet, 1 cooked with peri peri & other one cooked in pesto sauce, served with Steamed rice topped with fried egg & one portion of chicken roulade.)

Report card:
Ambience: 4/5
Convenience: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Quality: 4/5
Quantity: 5/5

I had been here, for the first time, during the start of this year, just tried their brainfreezer hookah and pizza. I didn't like the pizza much, but the hookah was the best for me. I haven't found the same anywhere else. Recently I went their again with my friend. We had ordered nutella waffle, paratha with egg bhurjee, paneer burst sandwich and a cold coffee. The waffle was so amazing. It was literally foodgasm. The egg bhurji and paratha and paneer sandwich were excellent too. The cold coffee was something I didn't like. It tasted bland to me.
The service was really good. Also, their ambiance is something I really like.
It's a little more pricey than the average, but, worth going.

Well this was my second visit to this destination, I would rather describe this place as a lovely pocket friendly restro-pub to hangout. Our choice for the evening was a Caesar Salad with bacon a common dish we all have normally now a days. The dish was very nicely made. The item that was new to me was the Cajun Chicken Tenders... a Perfect name for the dish made... a juicy meat preparation cooked to perfection, which was holding a lovely crispness with an even balance of spices. I had both the dishes with 2 pints of Budweiser which was amazingly complementing each other. The place also serves Hookah. A place if you are looking for a family time or for a date for your mate... a Perfect place to go.

The Mexican Non-veg sizzler was quite nice. And so was the main course and there was "plenty" of "nutella" pancakes for dessert even though I don't understand how they only applied "nutella" to only the top pancake. Was quite unfair to find no nutella inside. Another thing I didn't like was the service charge added but no special service provided. I mean there are a lot of other high-end cafes and restaurants that goes without the service tax. Was disappointing at the end when you see things like that added to a bill after a highly satisfying meal. Food is moderately priced however.

*Chocolate Pancakes (3/5) : those who like sweet, will like this .
*Virgin Mojito (4/5)

Bikers cafe is a pretty decent place to hang out with friends. The environment is nice with good music. 
We ordered.. 
1. Honey chili cajun potato - It is French fries tossed in honey with chili flakes sprinkled. It is served with mustard sauce and mayonnaise. If you like dishes which are sweet in taste, like I do, then you are going to like it. Other wise don't order this. But the French fries were perfectly tossed. I liked it. 
2. Chicken wings - It did not taste like conventional chicken wings. Since it was tossed in BBQ sauce, it tasted much more juicy. Also served with ranch dressing. It was very tasty. 
The price was fine, not very much expensive. 

P. S.  : You can play foosball and air hockey to kill boredom.

I have visited the Bikers cafe multiple times and have always had good things to say.¬†

The restaurant was busy during Saturday lunch time, I was sated straight away at an available table. My order was take professionally without any hassle and was give the Wi-Fi code when asked.¬†

I ordered the BBQ chicken wings for starters and the penne pasta in alfredo sauce with the addition of chicken for main course. Though the main was served before the stater, both dishes were above my expectation. The BBQ wings were nice and crispy with a finger linking BBQ sauce, the pasta dish was full of flavour¬†and fresh ingredients. The taste of the white sauce transported me to a dish I have had in Europe, a difficult taste to achieve here in Kolkata.
¬†

Awesome¬†food, great decor and ambience, it‚Äôs a perfect place to grab a good tasty meal.¬†

Awesome place for breakfast. Went there based on Zomato ratings and wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all!

Ordered the Chocolate Milkshake, House special cold coffee, The Full throttle, Nutella Waffle and the classic French toast (savory).

The chocolate milkshake was really good...quite rich n thick with the perfect balance of flavour. The cold coffee too was really good!

The Full Throttle is your English breakfast... two eggs, chicken sausages, hash brown, bacon (we requested not to serve n hence not in the picture), cereal of choice with milk and of course bread. Sausages were perfectly done... soft and juicy... really good hash brown (could do with two though üòâ).... a must try dish!

The waffle was well done and crisp.

The ambience of the place is as the name suggests ... quite well done!

The staff is courteous and service was quick (for the kind of rush that was there).

Also there are games for kids to play... you can enjoy ur breakfast while ur kiddo is playing ... a very good thing to offer and was unexpected for us given the name of the place!

Biker's Cafe, I don't know how the hell you run business here. Let me remind you are at hospitality services. Ordered breakfast through Zomato at 11:05 am, had to wait till 1:20 pm for breakfast. That's 2 hours to count on. And when you guys delivered the food, you delivered the wrong order ! 
I placed order for Chicken Sandwich and Chicken burgers which I payed through card, you guys accepted the order and delivered Bacon. Come on, I don't eat Bacon.
I just ordered through Biker's cafe because I am HOG myself that was my sole purpose to order from you guys. There are plenty of options available in the Park Circus vicinity and guess I made the wrong choice. If you don't know what that means, that's Harley Owner's Group, India. What the point, just run a roadside dhaba or stall ! I will be obliged handle this kind of services at those places but not a place which charges a premium to deliver wrong orders while wasting client's time and money. As I am regular visitor over weekends to your restaurants here in Kolkata and Gurgaon, request the management to up the charts and see to it that it doesn't happen.

This is an example of a themed caf√© done right. Absolutely loved the cheerful ambience and attention to detail. There are helmets and biking gear adorning the walls and even a foosball table. Even the spoons and forks are shaped like spanners. One thing I really liked was that they had a separate enclosed hookah zone, so as not to bother the people who just came for dining.

Coming to the food, it was absolutely amazing, and they also serve large quantities. We ordered BBQ CHICKEN WINGS and PORTUGUESE ROAD KING. The wings had a lovely smoky flavour and the accompanying ranch dip was very tasty. The second dish looked as awesome as it tasted. It had two grilled chicken steaks doused in a very flavourful Peri Peri sauce, and the potato mash served with it was made to perfection.

The only downer I felt was that the dishes are priced on quite the heavier side. The staff really know their menu and are very cordial, but the service is a tad slow. Deducted 0.5 marks for the pricing.

Visited this place for the first time yesterday with a couple of friends...
Better late than never i guess!! üòé
This place looks really cool...nice warm decor & the bar counter looks classy n modern with the wooden finish in the entire restaurant interior...
Our orders :
1) Drinks - Well they have a great variety to offer üòÅ...
 We ordered...
üîπLIIT ( Our go to drink at every place )
üîπSangria üòç ( This was really special...filled with fresh apples & the aroma of wine! )
üîπMojito
We liked each of them but offcourse the sangria was the best!
2) Food - I never expected them to be so yummy!  üòä
üî∏Mezze non veg platter ( This platter is the one to order surely with your friends...chicken kebabs, pita, falafal, hummus!!
Ps. We loved the hummus ‚ô•Ô∏è )
üî∏Meat lasagna üòçüòò‚ô•Ô∏è ( Words will fall short to describe how well they prepared it!! )
üî∏Cajun spiced chicken tenders ( They served up an amazing dip!! Smoky, sweet & a lot like bacon üëå)
3) Back to drinks! üòÄ 
Yes they have a great offer on selected drinks...we took 6shots ( 30ml each ) of Jim beam @799...
The bill came up to only 2837!!
( They had actually added up service taxes at first...but on our saying, we were immediately provided with a new bill minus the service taxes! 
üòÄüòç )
The only downside i felt was the music which was repititive & a bit too loud at times...And the AC being very very low...( May be because of the weather now )
Overall a great place to chill with your gang...great drinks, great great food & cool decor with such a convenient location!!

I went to this place with one of my friend    and we had to wait for more than a hour to get seated as there was some kids birthday party going on  inside.The staffs were courteous enough to inform us that it will take a lot of time and we should rather come some other time.As we both preplanned to go there we had no other option rather than waiting.Then when we were finally seated after hours of waiting in the hookah section and the worst part is we were not allowed to order Hookah because there was few more kids celebrating birthday inside the Hookah area.So the point is when they take party bookings they should not entertain any walk-in guest or they should have informed us in the beginning.Coming to the food part we ordered Cold coffee, Malaysian satay Chicken,Pizza,Jack Daniel's Bbq Lamb steak .Cold coffee was watery and we returned it.They remade it on our request which was not upto the mark.And rest of the food were pretty good .Overall it's a nice place to hang out with friends,accompanied by a quirky decor.Service is quick and staffs are courteous.Slightly on the expensive side but the decor and ambience of the place make up for it.I would definitely like to visit try other dishes

Both of the dishes were extremly yummy.. the lasagna really deserved appreciation it was very well made. It was really very yummy plz order it whenever you go here. Its near bhawanipur college which needs a walking of around 5 mins. A nice experience!

Amongst all the bars and cafes mushrooming in the city this place stands apart tall because of its unique merge of a cafe and a bar.What I liked most about this place was they have well maintained the standards of both the genres on their arsenal,it has great hookah(good news for sheesha lovers they serve amazing mixture of flavours) great food (must try the pancakes and the waffles they are the show stoppers), great offers on alchohol(6 shots of jim beam 30ml @799) and many more,must also try the grilled stuffed chicken stuffed with veggies.As far as the decor is concerned they have done a great job segregating the hookah section with alcohol and the section only with alcohol,smart move on that for the non sheesha lovers ,pretty good ambience obviously themed for the bikers but pretty legit for Normal crowd as well ,it's more like a one stop shop for having a great evening with friends and colleagues or a dinner date as well .Cant wait to go back again.

Bikers cafe is a themed cafe, and man, it has such amazing ambience and standards! I've visited the place twice by now, once on my friend's birthday, and once on breakfast. I've had pasta, garlic bread, some shakes, pancakes, sandwiches, pizza, and two-three more items over here. The shakes and pancakes I had over here are amazing, the sandwich was good too. However, the pasta seemed a bit dry, and lacked the generous amount of sauce it must had have. The cafe also has few games including the table soccer, and some bikes kept, as it is a bike themed cafe.

A note worthy thing about bikers cafe is that their breakfast spread is amazing. From waffles, to the English breakfast , you get it over here. This opens up number of options for breakfast for us. Breakfast menu is definitely recommend.

Simple yet appealing ambience, courteous staff, good music and some really delicious food pretty much sums up Bikers Cafe for me.
The separate room for hookah has a far better atmosphere overall, compared to the normal dining place which is nice but has a mall food court feel which kind of adds to the depriation,along with somewhat uncomfortable chairs.
Now coming to the food -
1)Grilled Jerk Chicken with Honey Mustard Sandwich            - Simple presentation, okayish in taste.
2)Dijon Chicken Pizza - Beautiful in appearance and equally marvellous in taste.One of the best pizzas I've had in Kolkata, was cheezy, with the right amount of toppings.Highly RECOMMEND it !!
3)Penne(creamy Pesto) Pasta - Had a herbal tinge to it, well-made, tasty but nothing out of the world.Was good.

Overall, it's a nice place to hang out with friends or family,have good conversations accompanied by a quirky decor, including some good-looking bikes which could work up your cameras.The food is top-class but yes, the biggest drawback is the price which is considerably on the higher side.So,if you're ready to spend, say, around Rs.1000-1200 for 2 people, Bikers Cafe would be a nice option among others in the area.

So this 4.2 rated place does not have the courtesy to attend people who are waiting for a table. Surprisingly after asking the person who sat behind the billing counter, the person was passing the responsibility pointing at few other waiters around. After waiting for almost 25 minutes and one or two empty tables around we left not to return

I am quite a regular at the food places in an around Elgin given that we stay right there. Somehow we had missed going to Bikers cafe and therefore this evening we went there with a lot to expectations. Also given the high rating at Zomato thought it will be at par with the best in the city.
However after waiting for half an hour, NOT A SINGLE WAITER OR THE PERSON SITTING AT THE COUNTER attended to our request for a table for two!!! 
Being in a hospitality industry this kind of shocking callousness is rarely seen. 
I don't think a place which has little sense about how to cater to their customers can serve high quality food. 
Would never recommend and surely will not go back.

A separate room is there for hookah
Then I come to the food quality..I took a sandwich!Though it was veg but it tasted brilliant..perfect!
It is pocket friendly and service is too good..

Its one of those feelings when one watches hollywood movies wherein, there is always a man behind the bar catering to rough & tough guys wearing bikers jackets . Donning that rugged look! Something similar to life of bikers & what they are fond of the most : Bikes & things related to it has been created at Bikers Cafe, Elgin road, in close proximity to Forum.. Let‚Äôs start the Gupshup:

The very first thing that is striking when the elevator takes one to the cafe is The Bike parked. The entire floor is wooden and made the most use of Iron. Significant of strength & vigour of bike & bikers! Loved the detailing of forks & spoons done for the theme.. The outcome: Thumbs up for the Ambience!

This place has two sections: one being for friends & family, other being for hookah lovers or more of a private place.. It has breakfast & as well as normal dining options. I had gone for both of them. Leme talk ‚Äòbout dinner First & foremost.. 
here‚Äôs what I ordered

Ratatouille: Nothing like the authentic one, they have created their own version using cottage cheese, Potatoes, zucchini, bell peppers & cheese sauce as a topping. It tasted yum & I really loved their version. 

Crispy chilli Babycorn: The babycorn was tossed nicely in the sauces & Garlic sauntered to perfection. 

Pink sauce Pasta: So the first time when I ordered this dish twas not that saucy. The steward Rajaram serving us looked into this and got another dish made for us. This was commendable. The second time the dish was superb..

The breakfast comprises of many veg. & non veg items.. Sandwiches being my favourite..
Ordered Mushroom on toast: Twas creamy mushroom n the bread was roasted. Nicely done! 

Chilli Cheese Toast: twas cheese toast grilled brown.. was basic & okayish..

Samui Benedict Burger: the Aloo tikki dint entice me but the paneer bhurji that was seated at the base of burger n below tikki was delicious..

The Service was excellent. Staffs cater to each customer and ask bout the food served. However this cafe is slightly overpriced given the quantity of food. The Outcome: Great place to be!

Visited this "happening" place for dinner with my family yesterday. Being a Saturday night....it was too full with some waiting period. I detest places that allow patrons to wait inside the dining area. Saw tables in the middle of waiting guests. Totally a turn off to see peoples' back sides and glares while enjoying a meal. Blaring live music was not appreciated. The line outside the toilet made me feel as if it was a Sulabh Swachalay franchisee. Is it not disgusting to have a queue of bladder fulls in the middle of a dining area! Now the food....we ordered a Classic Margherita pizza...veg lasagna....garlic bread and a veg burger. The food was very average and did not justify the minuses like the noise...queue...waiting crowd and poor house keeping. Yet this place has admirers. Intriguing....my suggestion....just steer clear of this place!

It is suitable for a perfect hangout for both friends and family. The food tastes heavenly, is ample in quantity and is served quite fast. The service provided is honestly friendly. Located at an easy distance from rabindra sadan Metro Station, this place on elgin road is a must visit.

The much hyped and grossly overpriced joint (sample this Rs. 420.00???!!!for a club sandwich!!! Rs. 150.00 for a 330 ml of Tuborg!!!!)......for the "young & trendy" (???!!!) this may be a "paradise" but as is the case with most "theme-based" joints, food takes a back seat here. Thankfully we were not bowled over by most of the reviews and feedback, and cautiously ordered just one plate of "All American & Bacon", virtually an all-day breakfast minus the milk, cereals and tea/coffee. Below average would be an understatement! Any outlet on Chowringhee Lane is better any day!!
It would be unfair to compare this place with Flury's (as it would certainly be a great insult to the legendary breakfast joint of the city), but for the sake of information, if Flury's is Brazil (soccer), this place is no better than Bhutan (soccer)!!!!! All the more surprising was the television channel that was turned on - Sony Pix!!! When the entire country is suffering from soccer fever and a match was actually on when we were there!!!! Another disappointment was our inability to connect with them over phone - one line remained unanswered on all occasions, whereas the other one was always busy!!!!! Surely no harm would have happened to the culinary world had this joint never existed!!!!!

I have been here on two occasions before and this was my third visit. I really like the food here and the ambiance with the rock and roll music and good vibes.

Ordered Potato Potholes and Italian Sizzler today. Both were delicious. The Potato Potholes were soooo brilliantly cooked. When they were served, I was skeptical about them but they turned out great! The Italian Sizzler is also really good. The fries with it didn't have any salt though. :P We wanted to try out the choco chip pancakes but we were too full. The virgin mojito and cream mocha were the drinks we ordered. The Cream Mocha was average, nothing great. The Mojito was good and minty! 

The only reason I have marked this place down from an otherwise 4.5 it would have received is that the service is pathetic. It is super slow. The server took our order down after about 20 minutes or so and after multiple attempts at catching someone's eye and trying to wave. This kept happening. Food was super slowwww to arrive. Had to ask them to fill glasses, etc. Service can be improved so much. :/ It gets frustrating when the service is like this. It overshadows the quality food and ambiance. 

The place is value for money! Reasonably priced and good stuff!

A friend and I were looking for a place to go for breakfast before heading to a movie. We hit this place at 7.30 am and were more than surprised at the courteous staff and amazing ambience of the place. The food was great. We ordered sandwich, sausages, alu paratha, tea and watermelon juice. None of which disappointed even a tad. Although the place is a little more on the pricier side, yet I'm not going to complain about it as it was totally worth it.

So it was a get together with two of my college friends, a small reunion. It was a very late lunch for us. And so the venue we decided was biker's cafe. In the drinks we ordered virgin mojito, watermelon mojito and a lychee and kiwi smoothie. The drinks were quite good and refreshing. In the food section we ordered Europeanushroom burger, Hungarian styled grilled fish and biker's chicken fusion discovery. This chicken preparation was quite unique. They served two grilled chicken breasts marinated in peri peri sauce and pesto sauce in each served with steamed rice and a fried egg. I would definitely give a thumbs up to the presentation of the food. The waiters are extremely courteous. Now for the dessert we ordered chocochip montecarlo which I personally did not like.much, that is maybe because I am not too fond of chocolates in desserts. Overall it was a good experience and definitely a joint where I would like to come back again

This place is perhaps one of my most favourite cafes in all of Kolkata. The decor here is absolutely stunning. It has a Harvey Davidson at the entrance which automatically tilts it towards positive in your head. The insides look like a 70s Texas diner, rough and earthy with a tinge of suave. I loved the seating arrangements and the cute little bottles. There is a separate enclosure for people who'd have the hookah.¬†The food is brilliant. The burger was succulent, juicy and big in size. The pizza was very light and generously topped with the most amount of topping I've ever seen. And the choco chip pancakes make me want to get a tent and live there.¬†Bonus: They have a Foos Ball table, for the Channoey in you!

This used to be a great place to hang out with superlative breakfasts,  boardgames and good service.  Unfortunately,  it seems to have gone downhill on all counts in the last two months.  The eggs benedict that I ordered arrived in no time but the bread was soggy and the eggs underdone.  These guys used to make their own hollandaise sauce and their French benedict was fantastic.  No longer the case,  sadly.  I went to the boardgames shelf to get Scrabble but the board was missing.  Finally,  when I tried to pay with a two grand note,  they made me change because someone had written in ink on the note.  They said the banks would not accept such a note.  Where such a rule exists I wonder.  Not going back.

This is the first and most probably would be the only cafe getting a 5.0/5.0 
I regret not visiting this cafe before and missing one of the best culinary experience. 
The ambience here is a perfect mood setter for any conversation. A Harley Bike, a fuss ball table and the seating overlooking the road sets up a perfect experience. The bike themed restaurant even has its cutlery based on the theme of the cafe.
We ordered Kiwi Twister, Mushromm Chardonnay, Watermelon Mohito and and Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler.
While waiting for our order, we kept ourselves busy with the puzzles put up on the table. These are some things which makes a cafe different from the rest. 

Tangy, fruity and semi liquid glass full of red devil or Watermelon Mohito was not only a refreshing drink but it also rejuvenated my tastebuds. The taste has stuck in my tastebuds forever.
A big dish with lots of mushrooms bread peices and dip arrived next. The crispiest mushroom and a perfect blend and saute of sauces added icing on the cake. 
We couldn't resist on trying the Kiwi Twister and it didn't disappoint us. Abundant Kiwi pieces were the usp of the drink; the perfect winner.
Finally came the spicy Sizzler which consisted of vintage mexican rice, chicken, nachos with abundant sauce and mayonnaise garnishing. 
Wow! what an experience, Wow! what food and simply Wow!
A must visit place for all.

The decor here is brilliant. The service is good. They play good songs on speakers but it gets too loud at times. The staff is courteous.

Texas Spicy Chicken Cowboy Pizza: The crust is way too crunchy. They put the right amount of cheese, there are enough chicken pieces. However, it's not really spicy. Enough for two people.

Oreo Shake: Disappointed with this drink. Not worth the money.

Buttermilk Pancakes with Maple Syrup: Soft and fluffy but a tad too dry. Quite filling.

Waffles with Choco chips and ice-cream: A better dessert than buttermilk pancakes. Just the right amount of crunchy.

Slightly on the expensive side but the decor and feel of the place makes up for it.

Today I had lunch at Bikers Cafe with my friends. The place is easy to locate, but I had a little trouble parking my car as the allotted parking space for the restaurant was small and full. The ambience of the place is the first thing that attracted me....very aptly decorated..goes with its name...and of course great music. The menu was quite sorted. For starters we ordered Cajun Chicken and Malaysian Chicken Satay. Both were good, specially the second one..must try. Main course was Portuguese Road King and Hungarian Style grilled fish. Portuguese Road King was one of the best dishes that I liked. The staff was cordial. Probably one of the best places to hang out. Undoubtedly a place one must try...Wish to visit again...

One of the best breakfast places in the town if one is interested in starting the day by filling tummy to the brim :P. What i particularly liked about the place is the location of the cafe its right around the corner of a road which makes easy to approach, plus the ambience and the layout is intriguing as well. Nothing new to say about the English breakfast that we had here only thing the quantity served is worth every penny. The waiters are courteous and they are quite knowledgeable regarding the food that they serve. Overall a great place to hangout with close friends or one plans to have a heavy breakfast or maybe quickbite in the evening over a cup of coffee or maybe few pegs of scotch or if one wants to have few bottles of beer.

Had a bitter experience and have been a victim of racism when visited this place. 
When entered the cafe it was not that crowded but with a very few vacate tables, approached the reception guy for a table for two but he was least bothered to get us one and just asked us find a table by ourselves , we found a nice one at the corner and when we were about to occupy the same, immediately the manager came rushing  and said its already booked , when I told him that I was asked to find it myself , he told me to wait for 2 mins before he could find another one , so stood aside and started waiting , its was more than 10.mins no one came and we were still standing starving , in the meanwhile three white foreigner lady entered the cafe and from nowhere 5 to 6 waiters just appeared to attend them , before they asked for a table the manager escorted them to a nearby one and the waiters were like "welcome ma'am" "can I get you a table ma'am" "how May I help you ma'am" while we were standing at the corner. Finally got the table when felt disgusted and had to raise my voice to point out we came first and have been waiting for a table for more than 10 mins. 
It feels pathetic when we face racism in our country by our own people.

"The bikers cafe" located on elgin road just opposite of SSKM hospital. The cafe has 2 sections, one for having hookah and the other for casual dining. The ambience was amazing, food quality was no doubtedly good.. However, the service was very very slow and for this reason I have deducted my ratings.. We ordered hookah, chicken wings, dijon chicken pizza (which they served almost after an hour, when we were about to finish our hookah) and dessert- chocochip waffle with ice cream (it was truly amazing). Overall experience was good, however service quality needs to be improved.

Bikers cafe is located on Elgin road just mins from Forum. This place is mostly filled with college/high school going crowd. Sitting space is not too big either. Interiors and decor are ok. We went on a Sunday noon. Started with wheel-o-chilla a mushroom paneer stuffed chilla. Nothing great about it was bland and okayish. Then we went for Mexican pizza. Was thin crust, nice toppings pretty good. Best part was our sweet dish - waffles with maple syrup which made our day. 
They had Bira which was good for our drinks. Service was quick. Little pricey.

Well where do i start about this concept cafe themed on the famed roadsters..prominently located just a stone‚Äôs throw away from forum on one side and rabindra sadan metro on the other.. by the time you enter this place you r greeted with a harley davidson which does add to its vibe..seating is pretty basic but the music is what soothes your nerves..they play a from wide range of artistes from rock and roll 60s to next gen pop..u can have a shot at boardgames which are readily available or play foosball which we did after a long time..finally over to the food..we had malaysian chicken satay and mexican chitpotle chicken sizzlers..well the satays were wholesome with a tangy homemade sauce which i liked..the sizzlers were sufficient for two but the taste could have been better..also had a couple of budweisers since miller was not available..d‚Äôuh!..they levy an optional 6% service charge which is optional..lack of happy hours wont let my mind opt for a repeat visit considering TGIF offers the same next door..

This place is located on Elgin road just opposite SSKM hospital and is clearly visible from the road because of their huge glass displays. Foodwise they have quite a lot of vareity on the menu. However, incase you happen to visit this place, try their sizzlesrs. I tried their veg sizzlers and wasn't disappointed at all. The quantity, look and taste of the sizzler were all perfect. The place has recently started serving booze too, but their forte is the soda based drinks which were like the cherry on the cake during my visit. Visited them only once but won't hesitate to revisit these guys. One can visit them for sure.

I visited this place for breakfast and the place was great as I had expected. I loved the decor. They have a wooden decor and also a few board games. Even the tablemats are interesting with jigsaw puzzles. We ordered Coffee and Oreo Shake and both of them were great. The Oreo Shake was very very good and it is one of my favorites. We also tried the All American Bacon n Eggs and it was also lovely! I would give this place total 5 on 5 for the lovely ambiance, decor,food and service!
This place is one of my personal favorite and I am sure you will love it too.

This is the worst restaurant I had ever went to.
Service was not good at all.
The taste of the food is terrible.
The waiters were rude and their behavior was horrible.
In the bill, service tax was included , which is not acceptable as they were also including GST.
What the hell is wrong with restaurant I don't know.
I went to this restaurant after checking their Zomato ratings which was very high. They r also very popular. But now due to overconfidence, they can't maintain their service and quality.
I will never go to this restaurant ever.

On a Sunday at 10:30am this place was packed. I reckoned this must be a good breakfast place and I was not wrong. It was indeed a great Sunday breakfast. 
The coffee mocha was good
The pancakes were soft and great 
The jerk chicken sandwich was also yummy and quite a lot in quantity with 4 portions. 
But the winner was the peri peri chicken burger! 
What I do wish they had was more of chicken options. Mostly they had ham options. 
Otherwise great place for breakfast. Also the service was quite fast.

This place is nice. They serve really nice Hukkah. And by really nice I mean, one of the best in Kolkata. 
The ambienece was good but they need to work on their hospitality. 
Everytime we needed something, one of us had to go out of the smoking area and call the waitier and this can get irritating. I recommend you huys to use some bell system or whetever.
Overall, it was a decent experience.

Awesome place. The food is great. The drinks are reasonably priced. Ambience is pretty nice. Would like to see more items on the menu especially in the non veg starters section. Some pork items would be good. Also deep fried onion rings. But all in all had a great time. Keep up the good work. There was live music as well which was a pleasant surprise.

The service was good but expected quicker response time.Price was Little bit higher than the quality.Had chicken wings in starters (Though we had ordered Cajun chicken but the dish appeared to be chicken wings) followed by DIJON chicken pizza(mouth watering) and Mexican sizzler (it was a disaster)in main course.Loved the dessert choco chip waffle with ice cream.It's a must try dish.Ambiance was nice for hangout with friends.Yamaha cocktail was refreshing and beer was served perfectly chilled.

Went there along with a friend for the Sunday lunch. Firstly, when I went there, the place was almost full. However, there were extra seats laid and the staff were too courteous. We ordered Jacob's Creek Red wine and Biker's Chicken Fusion Discovery and Portugese Road King for the main course. Portugese Road King tasted pretty much average. Plus, our order took a long time to arrive. However, the quantity of food is good.

The cafe z located just off the corner of brand factory at Elgin Road. The ambience of the place is really stunning,  starting with the bike at the entrance to the auto DJ and the small play area,  the place is good for family lunch. Coming to the food,  we ordered a sizzler and a soft drink (u need to ask for soft drink menu card,  they generally provide only the hard drink menu card).  The food was a bit spicy and very saucy, more than required by our taste. Overall a good place.

I think I am running on a bad luck with the popular joints of Kolkata. Today in the morning I came for breakfast at this place. Decor was great. Loved the place at the first go. 
Ordered a Mezze Platter non veg, the terminator burger, and samosa chat (yeah, I know- I just wanted to try). Burger was okayish. Small, but okayish. No complains like my other encounters elsewhere. Photo attached. Platter was platter of disappointment. There was 2 fried chicken pieces, and 3 non veg cutlets. How can you call that a non veg platter? Other things were 4 pita bread, and 4 veg falafels! (I don't know why). Phew! Bye Bikers cafe.

A theme based cafe sporting an awesome white machine at the entrance.. It has a rustic ambiance with lights shaped like bike headlights.. Harley davidson posters etc.. Wooden chairs and tables.. The place was almost full even on a wednesday afternoon. We were lucky enough to get a place beside the glass window. We ordered moroccan tagine.,mezze platter( non veg), gambas pil pil and grilled salmon teriyaki.. Moroccan tagine had a tasty couscous and a tangy zuccini curry. The mezze platter had yummy dips.. Hummus.. A tasty fried chicken and yummy mutton kabab and a veg something. The salmon was fresh.. Succulent and came with equally tasty mashed potato and veggies. The gambas pil pil was a prawn dish accompanied with fragrant rice and mashed potatoes. It had a very delicious sauce on it.. We enjoyed the food too much.. And were full.. Still had to order their chocochip waffle.. Hot waffle with chocolate sauce and chips.. Forgot to mention our mocktails... A watermelon cooler and a kiwi based cooler. Both tasty but the kiwi won hands down. It was so tasty had to order a second round.

Went here on a sat night to unwind after a long day at office. The ambience is good and there was a live band performing. We ordered a couple of beers, shisha, the veg Italian sizzler, chicken Satay and bacon wrapped chicken. The alcohol is pretty reasonable here. The sizzler was a big disappointment. While the Satay was standard, the bacon wrapped chicken was good. However the food is a bit over priced here. The shisha was nicely made and lasted for more than an hour. Recommended if in mood for a nice chill.

The first time I ever went to Bikers was to celebrate my birthday and their service was commendable. Since then I‚Äôve been an ardent regular. 
Right from Chilli Chicken to their Chicken Burger, the items are top notch. Both white sauce & mix sauce pasta have the right kind of creamy texture. However the lasagna and ferrero rocher shake are simply average. 
Their pizzas are to die for, personal favourite. 
Great place with wonderful theme & amazing ambience.

The best part about the place is that it is open early in the morning. We ordered Latin egg combo, Arabian eggzee combo,chocolate chip pancakes and Irish coffee. Food was delicious. The service was bit slow though. The quantity were huge for the panacakes. The dips provided alongside the eggs were delicious.  The coffee was average. The only major drawback were the table sizes which being too small made it difficult to accommodate the plates.

Located in one of the prime locations...The Bikers Cafe comes with a great ambience. They have decorated the place in a cool manner giving the feel of 'Biker'. You will get a proper view if you sit beside the glass window.¬†
Food wise it was great and the portions are good.
They made the Pasta in the customised manner that we asked for (with red sauce and extra spice)We preferred to go light on the drinks and ordered just Fresh lime soda
I specially liked the waffles. But was disappointed for not getting the mango one (the funniest part was when there was mango festival going on around the city, the waiter said it is not available as the mango season is over)

Went on Saturday evening to have a lovely evening and this was on my list from long.

Ambience: Location was its perfect and very easy to locate. The cafe is divided into 2 sections. One section is for having hookah and other is complete dine in section. The cafe is beautifully decorated with all bike related photos, instruments and loads of posters. The dine in section seating arrangement looks good on eyes but I feel those steel chairs are not too comfortable to have a relaxing dine in. But the hookah section where I opted for was perfect. Comfortable sofas with dim lights! The ambience became rocking when they started live music performance and mood just kicked off. Good song no.s was played by dj and the dim bulb light just created that perfect feel. Only drawback I found is they only have one washroom for both.

Food: I opted for hookah which was great if not probably among the bestest in kolkata. I was there for more than 1.5hrs and believe me it dint choke. And the smoke was still coming out dense when I left the table. I also opted for 2 cold coffee which was ferroro rocher shake and bikers cafe special cold coffee. I loved the way the special cold coffee was presented in a bulb kind of dish but taste wise lacked that punch. Ferrero rocher shake tasted good but not the best. I also opted for Dijon chicken pizza which was among the best pizza I had recently. Pizza was awesome. Topping were filled with chicken and with loads of cheese.

Service: This is where I deducted the ratings. When I entered and I asked for hookah section and they asked us to wait in the dine in area as it was filled. I had no issue with that but it was not good on their part to not to attend me once in 15-20 mins. I had to call them after 5-10 mins for menu card and it was shocking to see even glass of water was not offered. Also the same when we entered the hookah section. A glass which already kept from before was lying on the table had to be used by us as we were thirsty. They dint check also 2 glasses are there or not or put water from the bottle in the glass. I had to open the bottle fill the glass myself. The service was also very slow. All the items came very late after ordering. 
Service need to be improved! More attention towards your customer should be given because all the good vibe you create by the soothing ambience goes to waste when we get irritated by the lack of good service.

Well, the art of cooking is marveled by few. Even the most common and simplest dish turns out to be extraordinary if it is cooked by the right chef. Here is one of the dish I present before you which is available in every cafes and restaurants but the best taste is discovered by less. This place will provide you with the great ambiance, satisfaction along with the astounding dishes. Cocktails and Liquor are also available.

In frame: Crispy Chilli Chicken.

This place is very easy to locate. Hearing the name of this place pretty much gives you an idea what the theme is. The coolest part of it is the crockery. They give you spoons and forks in the shape of rangers and other tools. It also has some cool decor which are actually bike parts. But do not have this notion that you not being a Bike lover, will not find this place good. This place serves great food and has very prompt service. Hoping to visit this place for the third time very soon.

So this was the 2nd time I visited this amazing place located in Elgin road (Forum lane).
We had our Friend's Birthday and so thought to visit the place for breakfast and we made the best decision ever!
The place has a perfect cafe cum American lounge ambience. Good music that would soothe your ears and allow you to talk to each other as well.
Everything we ordered was Veg. 
The pictures attached are of Veg Burger, Vegetable Maggi, Cheese Maggi, Cafe Latte and the Teen Paan Rajni Shisha! 
However, we also had ordered Cheese Toast which we forgot to click üòú
Now Maggi and Hookah were a surprise. Firstly Maggi wasnt available but on our request they got it done and Hookah was available post 9 am.
They even played the Birthday song for my Friend. üòä
Shisha is something that should and should be tried in here.
Friendly staff, Great ambience and Amazing Food that too at a worthy price.
Its a place thats a must visit!

Located near Forum Mall on Elgin Road,Bikers cafe is an american cafe which has become quite famous over the past couple of years.It is a hard rock themed cafe and the deco≈ï is also unique with the landmark being the harley davidson bike that is placed at the enterance,the ambience is pretty cool as old school rock songs are played in the background and they have a couple of board games which serve as a good time pass.Coming to the food,we were here to try their breakfast menu and we had ordered-

Latin Egg-Fast: It was a platter consiting of an omlette along        with salsa some kidney beans and a dip.It was quite impressive

ChocoChip Pancakes: It tasted heavenly not too sweet and    the chocochips on top were great and it was very filling too.

Ferrero Rocher Shake: It was a thick chocolate shake with a Ferrero Rocher  on top and tasted great.

The food was great and it is a place which is worth a second visit,the only drawback I found was that their service was not upto the mark,the servers need to be a little more attentive.
The pocket pinch was a little high but totally worth it.

P.S. They have a seperate room where they serve hookah.

This place fills the lacuna of themed restaurants in the city. The rustic and customized decor mimicks Cowboy dens across Uncle Sam's land. 
On a Sunday evening Peri Peri Chicken Burger combo, Dragon grilled Chicken did the trick of transportation to the land of opportunities. Couple of drinking options kept the evening going. Although desserts interest me, but was happy to indulge myself in the Foosball table. Service and Hospitality was at par with Industry standards. A must sneak in place if you're around Elgin Road and digging historical archives from the near by Netaji Bhavan.

This one's a fun breakfast place which is quiet and quirky. Kolkata is still short on themed restaurants and the bikers cafe aims to fill that lacuna. The decor is very rustic and a homage to all the hell's angels watering holes across America. Totally loved the customised decor. 
Coming to the food we ordered a eggs Benedict with bacon and an all American breakfast platter. The first one is lovely take on eggs Benedict and served with herbd potatoes. The American breakfast is a usual fare though the hash browns were more oily than desired. I don't know where they source their bacon from , but it's really great and without the tons of fat. They make lovely coffee too. lovely ambiance upped by the excellent music choice will make you relive the 80's.

The quality of food is no doubt good and the amount is adequate. The ambience is extraordinary. But the hookah bar is always crowdy and it is difficult to get a seat there. Waiting times vary from 20 minutes to one hour sometimes .

Arguably my favourite cafe in the city....Such a wonderful combination of good food, ambience and service....Precisely the reason why I've been to dis place a dozen times n I'll continue doing so....The mustard chicken sandwich is to die for....The chicken wings are just perfect....And the oh so creamy Thai green curry on a rainy day outside is all that you need....Thumbs up,!!....Highly recommended..

I personally being a bike lover get excited when I see a ride and as I entered in the cafe, what I get to see is cruiser custom made bike and then I was like, "I'm getting those good place vibes bro. :D " 
The ambiance, food, service was great, but wait it's not over until you order the dessert(TooHotToHandle) and guys you better do that, just amazing.

It is said eat your breakfast like a king,but finding a place in Kolkata for healthy breakfast is a tough job. You keep on strolling places but you end up with no results. It is when bikers cafe come to the rescue.

Bikers cafe is beautiful cafe tucked in the lanes of elgin. A cool place to hangout with your friends, musty decor, vintage ambience with groovy music.

A fine day we went for a breakfast and our joy knew no bound when were served with amazing English breakfast. We had ordered watermelon juice along with it had Spanish omellete Haven combo and Greek omellete. It was well cooked and bursted with flavors.

Some points to be joted down:
‚Ä¢never say no to choco chip pancake.
‚Ä¢visit on Sunday mornings for live music.
‚Ä¢ rustic bikes at display justifies it's name. 
‚Ä¢cool board games to enjoy with drinks.
‚Ä¢hookah and bike lovers where are you?
‚Ä¢little over priced but food makes it all worth.

Must try things at the Bikers Club:
Bikers club sandwich stuffed with all things yum (egg, chicken & bacon). 
The refreshing coconut mocktail consisting of coconut malai is something that cannot be missed. 
Ambience: It's got a young and rugged look just like a biker would. Props like bikes and jackets hone the place that make great props for pictures / selfies.

A good place for their breakfast offers .. loved the pancakes & paranthas there. Also their pizza is pretty amazing. The ambience is pretty quirky and the service is also good . Definitely worth a visit
Unfortunately Had a bad experience when I went there last week there was rush in the restaurant even though there was pizza being made the staff wrongly said the pizza oven is out of order ( I caught his lie as I saw pizza being served on another table ) and then I was wrongly billed , which they had thought they could easily get away with. When a restaurant starts applying such tactics obviously doubts about that place arise

Starting from the location to the ambience, then moving over food and the staff demeanour-- what's there to not love at this joint? üôÇ Had a great experience! We ordered Ferraro Rocher shakes, Veg Bruschetta, Cappucino, Chocolate Pancakes and Grilled Jerk Chicken Sandwich with honey. The ambience brings back the old American world charm with an option for live music and there's a separate hookah chamber. Highly recommend! ‚ù§Ô∏è

It has fun ambience with a foosball, air hockey and tons of other games. It has large windows instead of regular walls with strong light streaming in. The view isn't great though as it's located on a busy road surrounded by buildings. 

The service ranges from average to good. The food unfortunately was very average. We ordered for a Greek omelette , mushroom and cheese toast (horrible), Mexican jalape√±o burger, and some beverages. 

I wouldn't say that I am excited to visit the place again. The price per head is about ‚Çπ500, inclusive of taxes. 

P.S. The breakfast left most of us with a queasy stomach.

Biker's cafe has come to be really famous for its food and breakfast. It attracts all the bike enthusiasts around the city. The ambience seems that like an old tavern , where bikers come to quench their thirst or fulfill their appetite. Biker's cafe lives up to its theme. 
We ordered a cola float, ice tea and virgin mojito, all of which were good. We also ordered the mezze platter, consisting of pita , falafel, lavash, spanakopita , with four dips namely hummus , red pepper hummus , tziki and cous cous. Everything on the platter tasted really good. The pita bread was soft and warm , the falafel was really tasty , as it had some ingredient which really uplifted the dish , the two kinds of hummus were creamy as ever and the cous could was light. We also ordered the gourmet pizza which was square in shape with a delicious crust. 
For mains we had Nutella waffles where the waffles were crunchy and one could tell that the batter they used was good. We also had the chicken saltimbocca , an Italian dish I've always wanted to try. It was served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. Two chicken breasts stuffed with spinach and cheese  and drenched in black pepper sauce with a hint of soy in it. The dish was a complete meal in itself and was wonderful both to look at and eat. 
Biker's cafe has a good ambience , good pricing of the food and a very friendly staff. But the only problem is that their service is very slow. We had to keep asking for when our order would arrive. 
Apart from that , it's a good place to hang out. They have a fooseball table , air hockey table and numerous board games too. People can even enjoy hookah here.

Good food , Good decor , Good service .
Tried the American bacon and eggs and wild wild west pizza, the quality and quantity were both pleasing. The thin crust pizza is one of the best you can find in kolkata. The pricing is also fair given the quality and service. However i still cnt rate it more than 4 for their rates on their machine and menu card did not match!! Thought they charged the price printed on the menu but it was after i had to point it out to them. SIGH!! Also you could mayb make aure that the drinks listed in your menu are all available.
Address it and next time would love to give you a 4.5

Was dying to go to this place since the time I had a look at it on Zomato. Was totally worth the worth the wait. Being just walking distance from the Quest Mall the location is easily accessible. The cafe is brilliant with the bike at the entrance to greet you and the headlights of bikes inside the cafe. The cafe has a air hockey table and fussball table, perfect for college students. More over has some amazing posters and astonishingly good choices of music :p.
Coming to the food, the food is delicious and is well served. Has a very courteous staff.  Would suggest anyone who goes to The Bikers Cafe to try the
1. Barbecue Wings
2. Lasagna (Non Veg)
3. Chocochip Montecarlo

Ambience 5/5

I had received mixed reviews with respect to bikers cafe. Some told me its a shady place, others had recommended it. After taking a visit, I see why. 
The decor and ambiance is nice and is representative of the typical youth cafes in the city. The song list however gave off the "shady vibe" people told me about. That being said, I didn't find any problems with that. 
Coming to the food, we ordered a gourmet pizza, babycorn for starters and white sauce pasta. Taste wise nothing stood out which couldn't be found anywhere else,  but they were decent enough. We had also ordered a hookah, which my friends told me, was choking too much, and seems priced above other places. Food pricing was reasonable however. It's worth mentioning that the thin crust pizza looked especially good and I recommend it to anyone who goes to this place. 
A disappointment however, was the service. We had to request to the staff multiple times to fix our hookah, and though that was done, we had to wait quite a bit. Even apart from that, the service was sub par. Overall, though, this place is worth a visit.

Ambiance - 5/5
Food - 4/5
Service - 2/5 (3/5)

After a breathtaking morning walk, I was looking out for some breakfast options and opened up Zomato app to look for recommendation. Among the few which were open that time came up the option of Biker's Cafe. Checked out some photographs and found it interesting. Back in Hyderabad, there is a similar cafe which rents out luxurious bikes and cars and serves great range of coffee.

I zoomed in to this place and settled on a cozy corner. The decor is very hep and chic. I got into instant admiration mode. They have made lot of efforts to add elements which enhances their concept. Quickly ran through the menu and ordered for my breakfast. While I glanced through everything, requested them to provide the Wifi password, which they offered readily. While I couldn't connect, they said it isn't working. I wasn't amused with such attitude.

They served my Bone Soother, a detox drink based of avocado, spinach & cucumber. It was really refreshing after a sweaty walk. As I cooled down a bit, my Spanish Haven Combo was served. Spanish omelette with chunks of sausages served hash brown, grilled tomato & corn cob. I ordered for some bacon on the sides as add on. It was a huge portion and "breakfast like a king" sounds more appropriate here. Only down vote for so much of potato added to the omelette (you can ask the chef to keep that at bay). To end the meal, I couldn't wait for a my doze of black beauty (Americano)

Happy & content, I asked for the cheque. They took eternal time to get that on the table, that too a manual bill. On enquiry they said their systems aren't working. They charged me Rs. 875. I was little skeptic but didn't bother to add up and cleared my bills to rush home. Just to take a cue, I went through the bill and added up to find the total to be Rs. 660 and it also mentioned inclusive of all taxes. So I made an effort to return the next day to check on the copy of my printed bill. They checked through and couldn't explain me the bill. The figures on taxes they were giving couldn't add up to the total. They promised to email me back. It has been more than a month now, alas I am still waiting an email (after sending them 2 reminder emails).

Though I have no qualms with the food and ambiance, however their attitude and disrespect for customers will deter me from going back again.
                    

Edit: After reading the review the the establishment replied back to my emails and sent me the duplicate bill. Hence updated the ratings.

A very classy cafe. Very well designed and stands true to its core theme.
We, unfortunately had to wait for half an hour to get a table.
The menu is tastefully designed but they really need to work on their service time. The hookah was served in no time but the Greek salad took close to 40 minutes.
A complementary platter of lavash and a dip was served and I must say the dip was very flavoursome.
The salad was perfect too. The flavour, texture was great. The dressing was delicious and the elements were crunchy and fresh.
The staff was courteous but need to work on effectively communicating orders to each other.

FINAL VERDICT- I had a lot of expectations from this place and it did not fail to deliver. This is the perfect place to hangout with friends as well as enjoy some quality food. Highly recommended!!

It is a long pending review for this lovely Cafe. I went here were family for a brunch- the ambience is fun and youthful. The music was some of my all time English Pop and Soft Rock favorites. Loved, loved, loved the cutlery! 

We ordered for the Mediterranean Grilled Vegetables Sandwich which was yummy- a burst of flavors. Another dish was the Mumbaiyya Chutney Sandwich which was pretty much like how we make it at home- nothing exceptional but it was tasty. The cutting chai along with the Chutney Sandwich made a complete, satiating meal. A family member had ordered for the Mexican Jalapeno Burger and she rated it as a 4 on a scale of 5, so I guess she liked that :) 

The Hot Chocolate that we ordered was so-so. And, the mushroom on toast, ordered by another family member was a great let down in terms of both the helping (the portion size was TINY) as well as the taste. These were the only 2 let-downs. 

The best part of our meal was the Chocochip Waffle- AMAZING! And the helping was just right for the 3 of us.  

The pricing of the dishes is neither too high nor low- standard rates that one nowadays has to pay when going out for a meal. Overall, it was a good meal with good company and I would definitely give Biker's Cafe another try some day soon.

Located in a somber but prime location just 5mins from forum mall this place is a delicate music. Delicious food, beautiful ambience topped with effervescent weather. We had a Malaysian chicken satay and a jerk grilled sandwich. The sandwich crisp and succulent as if it is an beautiful omnibus of tales. The satay was tangy in tasty with right mixture of dips. Overall, an excellent avenue.

We have been to this place earlier but never got our hands on reviewing until our recent visit!
This time we visited on a Sunday morning to enjoy some breakfast.
We ordered a Mediterranean Veg Sandwich which much to our distaste, did not look appetizing..Although tasted just fine! After that, we did not feel like eating anything else, so that was so.

This place is famous for its food and earlier we have tried the waffles, pan cakes and many other stuff, but after the recent breakfast.. we feel there is a need to improve!

Just the right place if you want to spend some super quality time with your friends accompanied by tasty appetizers. 
Biker's Cafe - The decor is alluding to the name and is done with info and curios from bikes. The place is rugged but classy and cosy with the perfect music. 
They have a separate 'smoking allowed' section where Hookah is served too. The hookah was cheap in price but the flavour n coal refills were lil expensive as per the hookah. 
They have a small play zone area with variety of board games and there is a air hockey and foosball table to entertain oneself too. 

Coming to food,you can hunt into some real good options.A wide menu covering dishes from varied countries. A place where you can have a day long dining experience which serves breakfast too.

We 1st opted for chicken wings,and trust me it was as good as heaven. 2nd thing we ordered was fish and chips with tartare dip which was very scrumptious. Next up was Garlic Prawn Pizza something different to try and definitely enjoyable. The combination of garlic and prawns is very rare to find and this place definitely nailed it. Thin crust, spicy, cheesy, garlicky and crisp at the same time. 
For beverages we had ordered Watermelon Mint Mojito which was super refreshing, very tasty and the mojito was just made right. 

Lastly for dessert there was Choco chip Pancake.Nothing can be delicious,a complete yum dessert to end with.It had 3 pan cakes with absolute marvelous taste.
And the other dessert was Too Hot To Handle which was sizzling brownie and chocolate sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was an epitome of the perfect dessert. 

All in all a great place to chill and enjoy food with ur kiths.

One of its kind! The ambience and decor are an instant mood lifter. A fine place with rugged and sporty interiors will give your heart a throb the moment you step in. An ideal den for hangout with friends. Not, to miss the bike parked at the entrance which deserves a special mention.[5/5]
We had ordered chicken lasagne, a pasta tossed in exotic herbs and spices as oregano and dipped in white sauce and served with garlic bread was a true gastronomical bliss; the texas spicy chicken cowboy pizza didn't loose it's place when it came to tossing up the taste buds. A definite yes! We also ordered an hookah (sex on the beach) which wasn't either a bad choice. [3.5/5]
Pocket pinch was pit on the higher side, but considering the ambience, the place is a definite visit for friends in group. Staffs were cordial. Overall a good experience.

"It was okay."

That's the summary of all the food items that I and my friends tried at this place.
We ordered,
1. Crispy Chilli Babycorn
2. Cajun Chicken Tenders
3. Classic Margherita (Pizza)
4. Spaghetti Meatballs
5. Mexican Chipotle Sizzler
6. Ginger Ale (Drink)

The Ginger Ale was good, I liked it. But if you consider the food, none of them were really 'that' good! The thin crust pizza was really thin and crispy. I don't think a pizza should be this crispy. Spaghetti lacked some good taste. The ambiance was nice. They had a couple of games like a Foosball Table and an AirHockey Table but the conditions of those tables were not very good. Didn't enjoy playing. Finally the price, it was around 850 per person so if you are on a budget and looking for great food, maybe think it through.

Situated near Forum Mall Elgin road this place is a real head turner. Be it the ambience this is someplace which upholds the spirit of Indian motorcycling, by that I mean of the good old "Bikers" all around and snookers added some more spice to the experience. The food was served real neat and BOY.... !!! the pancakes were something...

The ambience as told earlier resembled a tribute to "Bikers" all around with some cool retro evergreen songs from Guns and Roses, Iron Maiden, Lynyrd Skynyrd and many more. The thing which amazed me was the concept of making two of the legendary "bullet" headlamps serve the purpose of more of a dim lit lamp inside the cafe. The ambience at the same time was also sobrely lit which added a cool retro feel to the cafe as well.

Coming to the food we ordered for a Malaysian Chicken Satay, Crispy Chilli Chicken and the fabulous choco chip pancakes. The Malaysian Chicken Satay was quite amazing be it the way it was served or how it tasted. The meat was well cooked and had that special smoky feel in it. The Crispy Chilli Chicken was also amazingly done with spices balanced at its best. The crust was fine and tasted just amazing. Lastly coming to the dish of the day the Choco Chip Pancakes it was so well made that we ended up ordering the same again for the second time. The Pancakes were served hot with hot chocolate syrup on it. And boy the way it blended inside the mouth is something which can make anyone go bonkers over it. All in all this added almost one full star to this place.

Lastly coming to the staff I will say that they were well trained and well behaved as well as extremely courteous to explain us the dishes and which will go better with what. The food was served well in time and that too was served hot. Definitely a place worth visiting again.

Word to the Management will be this place is really an eye catcher cannot be more better. Thumbs up for this cool place in town.

A cool place to hangout in town. Good food, great ambience. I ordered "The all American breakfast"; toast, eggs, sausages (chicken üòú), bacon and PANCAKES. I found the pancakes to be the best here. Yummy. üòã
Had a good time and enjoyed myself.

Situated at Elgin, a beautifully decorated cafe.
The ambiance and music compliments each other.
We ordered french eggs benedict and Texas cowboy pizza. The eggs benedict was fresh. Two poached eggs topped on English muffin with butter and mashed potatoes on the plate.
The pizza was thin crust, spicy. Good amount for two people.
They offer a diverse menu and good taste of food.
Service is also good.

Visited this place few months back. The experience was awesome. I must say their ambience is one of the best I've ever seen in Kolkata. It's totally different from other cafes. So coming to food, I've ordered Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler & their famous Choco Chip Pancake. Sizzler was awesome in taste and by far the best sizzler I've ever tried. And pancake tasted mesmerizing..out of the world.üòãüòã One must try this place.üòÉ

Located near Forum Mall, Bikers Cafe is a themed cafe. The decor and ambiance is of a hard rock cafe, playing traditional rock songs. Harley Davidson is their landmark. The atmosphere here is amazing‚Äã and decorated with some bike accessories. There is a separate smoking room for hookah and cigarette smokers. They also have some board games to keep people busy. Overall this place has an amazing vibe.

We went here for trying out their famous breakfast menu. After 12pm they serve their lunch menu.

Coming to the food we opted for :
Latino Egg-Fast : (4/5)
Choco chip pancakes : (5/5)

Drinks
Ferrero Rocher Shake : (5/5)

The service here is moderate and the staff needs to improve their skills

Pocket pinch : A bit costly, they charge 30% tax.

Atlast got the chance to visit this place. Well it's just near the forum mall. 
I will have to say I am totally impressed with the ambience and decor. Starting from the spoon and fork everything about the place will grab your attention. 
Coming to the food. Two of us were there. Being cheese lovers we ordered cheese rolls with sweet chili sauce as starters: it was absolutely cheesy.. Crunchy outside. Loved it. 
Next we ordered a texas chicken cowboy pizza: so this was thin crust, with chicken and mozzarella toppings. What I felt the crust was too crunchy which kind of gives you a dry feeling. It would have been still okay if there were good amount of cheese in the pizza which I did not find either. So pizza was okay. 
Lastly, basically I was totally looking forward for the waffles of this place and I am not even near disappointed.. Nutella waffles.. What can possibly go wrong? Absolute bliss! Totally satisfied.. 
Lastly the service was really good.. The prices I won't say it's pocket pinch. 
I am definitely looking forward to visit this place again. I am thinking about trying their lasagna too..

Located just around the corner, opposite of Tyre Patty. 
The shisha room is too small. 
Ambience is quite litted up. 
Food quality is okay-ish. 
Mocktails are a special mention and you should definitely try it out. 
Shisha is also good. 
Pocket pinch: Moderate.

I had heard so much about this place that I had to finally go there and eat. So, I went with another friend of mine, and we ordered nachos, lasagna, garlic bread, and our respective shakes to drink. I won't deny, the food was brilliant and the quantity was also pretty huge. It's not a place over-hyped or anything. The staff is friendly and nice, the food is great and the prices are also worth the taste! It is definitely a must go for everyone!!

It's a good cafe with a serene ambience..had a separate hookah place..although I opted for the normal lounge space as I dislike hookah..but the main plus points were  the food..we took some ferrero rocher frappe which was awesome..bruschetta which was also good inspite of being vegetarian.. & some jerk chicken sandwich & choco chip pancake which was also awesome..but the main down points were that it was a bit costly with the added taxes but at the end of the day it was justified because of the service..easily visitable for future outings.

Being a biker at heart, I am in love with the ambience of this place. It is conveniently located, however parking can be an issue at times specially weekends. The food here is good specially burgers and steaks. Sizzlers were a big let down though. Waffles and pancakes in desserts, a perfect end to a good meal.

With so many cafes serving breakfast around , if you happen to repeat one often  it speaks volumes about the quality of the place. This is a really wonderful place to be. The menu is extensive catering  right from Indian to American palates,and from young and old palates as well. The ambience with live music is entertaining and the puzzles and games really excite the kids and the young at heart as well. The long  waiting time for some orders is sometimes a put off,  otherwise the place gets a big A from me.

We waited for more than 40 mins for our ordered to be delivered on our table. In our omelette we wanted mushrooms instead of tomato so they charged us extra for that mushroom.

Visited ths place on a Sunday afternoon.Had huge expectations as people have spoken a lot about this place.
To begin with,they have wrongly given their location on google maps.It says its near Forum courtyard whereas its near Forum main gate.
I had expected a better ambience,but it wasnt another like a theme cafe.
We had just ordered 2 dishes.
They did not bother to serve us water.We had to call them for this.
virgin mojito was refreshing.
Italian sizzler was throughly disappointing.The garlic bread pieces seemed soaked up..It was pain eating them.The spaghetti had too much of herbs making it rather bitter.We were struggling to finish it up.
The only good thing was the staff was courteous.
Bill was too pricey.

This brilliantly themed placed nestled on the Elgin road was a tad difficult to find. The lift entrance to the restaurant is blocked, so I advice the readers to take the stairs. The setup is slightly complicated. There are two areas separated by a glass door. One area designated as a smoking zone is meant only for hookah and smoking (cigs) and drinking is prohibited here. You can have your cold beer outside (where hookah is not available). 
The restaurant is reasonably priced and the food is decent at best.  I would request you to avoid the sizzlers. The best part is the hookah which offers some exciting bases and flavours. (Do try the energy drink base)
Overall the place is suitable for non drinking hookah lovers who want to have a chat and/ or play a few board games. On my hit and miss chart this is definitely a miss.

PS the cutlery is in the shape of spanners (theme is followed to the core)

Three of us went to the much rated breakfast place on Zomato.And to our delight,it was better than expected.Located in Elgin,it is conveniently located.It has a wide variety of breakfast options right from Indian to American.It also had some amazing combos like the Egg Bhurji one my friends tried.The platter had two maida parathas,butter chiplet,sufficient portion of egg bhurji and accompaniments to go with.The only complaint we had was they didn't cater to the extra plain paratha we needed,because it is only part of the combo.We would have appreciated if the place would have provided extra piece and charged accordingly.But then the aloo pyaaz paratha(which had only aloo) and paneer paratha,were delight to the taste buds.They were perfectly made,enough stuffing of aloo and paneer respectively and not very oily.The pudina chutney served along with was refreshing and yummy.I am personally not a very delighted by pudina chutney but it was so mouth watering ,I couldn't stop myself.The cutting chai was hot and cutting.I liked the authenticity maintained.The hazelnut cold coffee was served in a very attractive bulb shaped bottle that I enjoyed and adored alonwith.Overall my breakfast experience with my friends was fun and frolic.Also to mention was its environment,friendliness and everything so breakfast about the place.It will surely make your morning.Bright and gay.Also it is in price range of moderate to high.

Located in Elgin road, this cafe has been done up so nicely. The moment you enter a bike is there which is a great place for photos. :P The ambience is super good, with the staffs very polite and courteous. Coming to the food, it offers a variety of both veg and non veg options. We ordered Cajun chicken, jerk sandwich and choco chip pancakes. Though I am not much of a pancake fan, still it was good. The sandwich was quite heavy with lots of chicken and cheese. The quantity served is more than enough. Overall it's a good experience.

Some people go to Cafes to work-- the description of this place said "WiFi available". But they have a bizarre 120 MB limit which has to be auto-renewed. I found this extremely putting off & unsatisfying. Just putting this review up so other folks looking for a quiet place in the afternoon to work over a drink/coffee-- should steer clear of here.

It's hard for a food joint to achieve a 5-star rating, but seldom does a place get so attached to oneself, that a full rating is definitely in order. The Bikers Cafe is one such place.

Having been introduced to this place by a friend of mine way back in 2013, Bikers has become my second home over the time. 

It's biker-theme and classy English rock music all add up to the ambience. Known for its delicious cuisine and flavoursome shisha, Bikers is a must-visit on anyone's folding list. 

My favorite items on the menu include the Fully Loaded Nachos, the Mediterranean pizza, the Chinese sizzlers and the orgasmic Choco Chip pancakes. 

A special mention to the Iron Head Bikers BBQ Ranch burger, as it's probably the best burger I've ever had.

The shisha is exquisitely made and as a connoisseur, I rate it as the best shisha in town.

Cheers, team Bikers. Thank you for an amazingly wholesome experience whenever I visit. Keep up the good work! :D

Great place for casual hangout with friends. From the decor, to the bottles, plates, etc. every beat screamed but attention and wonder. A lot of times, good for the eye goes down on the food scale but this place scored in that domain as well. The food was very tasty and made expertly. But yes, it's a costly place, so plan accordingly :)

Quite a good place for breakfast here. We each took either an All American or A Spanish breakfast. The All American had 2 slices of brown bread with either butter or jam, a hash brown, a roasted tomato, lots of crispy bacon, baked beans (which were quite tasty) smoky chicken sausages (yum!) And a TRIPLE egg omelette! (Too much.) The Spanish one also had a Spanish triple egg omelette with potatoes, sausages and all; it was quite tasty too, with sausages, hash brown, a corn dip and a roasted tomato on the side. One of this each was way too filling for a brunch. We also took a varsity of drinks like cola float, chocolate shake, jasmine tea, Irish coffee etc. For desserts we took chocolate pancakes. We were too full to even walk. The pocket pinch was 550 per head. The staff was friendly and patient. The ambience was quite nice in the morning. Overall a very good food experience.

Bikers cafe is very close to the place of my residence and yet it was my very first time here. Had always crossed this place hoping I could find a suitable time to try it out but it never really happened until last Sunday. I went in straight at five to grab a beer when it was still one of those summer days when you looked outside, it felt like noon. I postponed the idea of grabbing the beer right away instead ordered a kiwi cocktail. My friend ordered himself a blue lagoon. With that we also ordered a plate of fish fingers. Now that's all I hoped in that dish but they added fries with a tangy dip to add some drama to the dish. Guns n Roses is the theme of music here. If you are one such fan of the legendary band, do pay a visit to a place, because that's what they play! Now the decor is so interesting with foosball table that occupied one corner. The kiwi drink was so so yummy and fish fingers were fried perfectly. I was already happy that I did not make a wrong decision visiting the place, even though I was late. I wanted to stay there for as long as I could because I was thoroughly enjoying the well lit cafe's ambience with the lovely music playing in the background. I had decided right there that I am paying a visit to this place as often as I can. We grabbed beer much later during the evening. Even if you are not a fan of guns n Roses or Rock music or bikes, don't miss out the opportunity to try this place out. You will not be disappointed!! Oh and this place does also serve hukkah in case alcohol is not your first choice ;)
Thanks for the great experience team. Cheers !! :)

The Bikers Cafe is yet another theme based cafe but unlike others this one has the fascinating theme instilled across every inch of this place.

What is really appealing about this cafe is its ambience, it has a Rustic feel to it with live performance resonating across the hall,having a very healthy seating capacity and a separate section for hookah lovers with a view overlooking the Elgin Road.

The management efforts go unnoticed on Weekends when everything runs smoothly and are up for criticism when they don't, I deliberately look out for this. They were efficiently smooth and didn't disappoint.

‚úîThe Bikers Cafe gets a thumbs up for the fine service and very courteous staff.

‚úîThe food was excellent and prices were a bit high but feels edible for the service and ambience they have. One should try the Mexican Platter, the Lasagne and The Aglio Olio Spaghetti pasta.

‚úî The ambience had me push the rating from 3.5 to 4. It was boisterous yet pleasant.

I visited the place based on the recommendation of a friend. Apparently the standards have fallen since that friend visited because the experience was a disappointing one. The foosball table and the air hockey table were poorly maintained and the condition of the board games wasn't good either. The food was average and did not blow my mind away. The biggest disappointment was the hygiene because a cockroach climbed up my leg at the caf√©. Overall, I would not suggest the place to anyone.

A great location, soothing music, smartly styled interior and ample space- these are the plus points that we noticed when we entered this cafe. We ordered for brain freezer hookah(they have separate room for hookah- that was impressive). Then we took watermelon‚Äã mojito, Ferrero rocher shake, virgin mojito. All of them were tasty and refreshing. Then we took French Benedict - I tried the item for the first time and it was lip smacking good. In main course we had Mexican Chipotle chicken sizzler, penne pasta with white sauce and veggies. The sizzler was a bit different from the other sizzlers which we have generally. Pasta was properly cooked. In dessert we took choco chip pancake about which I have heard a lot. Though I thought it was a bit overrated. The pocket pinch was on the higher side. We were 3 people and our bill was almost 3k. The only thing that let us down was their service is a bit slow.

Very very strange that I have been here before and loved it and did not leave a rave. Good that I came here again and loved it more.¬†

I had the kulcha matar which totally lived up to expectations. The regular sweet french toast was far from it; it was great. My companions had the huge breakfast platters and loved them too. The eggs benedict looked especially awesome (I only looked, didn't eat). The mushroom burger was mouth watering delicious. 
The scene stealers were the drinks - watermelon and coconut mojitos. Just the best summertime drinks. Of course we ended with the special berry compote waffle. As waffles usually do, the honey gave me a toothache but man, was it a satisfying end to the meal. ¬†

Clearly the above order is not normal for a group of 3. Everything was so bloody good that we went berserk ordering stuff. Thank you Biker's Cafe. You have a spot in my top 3.

Situated near SN Pandit Hospital this cafe is very happening these days. Ambience is perfect for bike lovers, being welcomed by a Harley Davidson at the entrance. The interior is very good and there are separate areas for smoking hookah and also separate game zone.
We ordered Malaysian chicken satay and fish fingers in d starter. The presentation is very eye catching and food is very tasty. We also oredered Pizza..thin crusted and adequately spiced. In mains we had one of their signature dishes- Bikers chicken fusion discovery- very unique to taste and also colourful as it is prepared in two sauces green and red, tender chicken breast pieces. Sphaghetti Meatballs also was ordered..it tasted ok.
The experience is nice and dont forget to pose wid HD while leaving.

My personal experience was not so nice as expected, as we can see this place has a good rating here too and even some of my friends recommended it therefore I had very high expectations but it was not upto the mark.
You have a better option at a mere distance of 5-10 mins, for example Dugout and Fan Club.

Coming to food, Malaysian chicken satay tasted quite good.. and the detoxifier was also good.
If you are a bike lover, you must pay a visit

Visited this restaurant with a friend after a movie! The place is located very near to firun mall and hence its very convenient for grabbing a bite. The ambience us quite unique with all kinds of graphics of bike! The food is okayish not too diffrent. Though the mocktails were quite good and refreshing. We ordered burger and pasta along with virgin mojito and watermelon mojito. It is quite an ideal place for 'adda' . For that might visit again.

I went to this place today... Nice joint situated at Platinum mall. I loved the dacor the biker vibe. I initially ordered American breakfast, Peri peri burger, Strawberry monte carlo , waffle. The waiter told me that the American breakfast is not available even though its from all day breakfast menu. Monte carlo was not available as well. So we had to go with waffle and becon wrapped chicken. Becon wrapped chicken was ok, peri peri burger was extremely spicy, waffle was nice. My overall experience was not so good. Because of the decor and vibe I am giving 3.5. They should have every thing on the menu.

One of a kind, the entire decor reflects a biker's world, right from the spoons, to the lights, the whole ambience is filled with bike freak related stuffs.
Few games to refresh your mood.
Hookah is served in a separate room.

We ordered:

Pasta As you like it(with extra cheese and veggies):
#Cheeseliciously 

Lichy kiwi soothi:

Virgin mojito:

A really good place to hangout.

For all those looking to brunch at a good place on a lazy sunday, Bikers is the place to be. Everything that we ordered from the Latino egg fast combo to the waffles at the end, all tickled the right senses. You can even play foosball while you wait for your food to arrive. A truly delightful experience.

This place is close to forum mall. The look and feel is exactly as the name states. The decor and the ambience is amazing enough to woo you.Every little detailing has been taken care of,from the cutlery to the flooring and ceiling. This place offers board games for recreation as well. The main attraction of this place is the giant bike at the entrance.
The food here  is nice and and the drinks are quite refreshing. We had peri peri chicken burger ,non veg lasagne and chicken wings. They were all delicious but my only complaint would  be regarding the chicken lasagne which was way too sour. Must try beverage is watermelon mojito.
This place is a must visit place according to me  as I am a big fan of themed restaurants or cafe.

So this place happens to be one of my favorite spots in town. I have visited the cafe a couple of times and have never been disappointed. Tried a few good number of dishes and mocktail's which are carefully dished and served. However the one thing I believe can be worked on is the Lasagna. Rather than using fettuccine or tagliatelle pasta, using  lasagnette  sheets would actually be perfection. I have had it twice and both the time the trouble was to get it on the plate, as it keeps falling apart and gets all jumbled up rather than being in layers. Overall some very interesting decor, great ambiance and amazing food!

A Biker's den indeed. As I walked in, I was just captivated at the sheer delight with which everything inside the cafe was set up. From the chopper at the entrance to the foosball table and to the 70s rock collection on the stereo, everything about the cafe screams one word "Legendary". The place has an awesome ambience and the transparent glass wall at the roadside end allows lot of natural light which is pretty soothing. Moving on to the food section, everything they have on the menu is pretty cool. I ordered a Carlsberg beer, the Chicken Wings and Veg Pasta with extra cheese and veggies. The Chickenüêî wings were spicy and superbly garnished and tasted so good that KFC Chicken wings feels more like crap from then on. By the time I finished the beer and Wings, I was pretty full and thought of taking the pasta as take-out but when the Pasta arrived I couldn't resist as it smelled mouthwatering. Stuffed myself with it to the point where I thought I'm gonna die. All in all, a pretty awesome place to hangout with friends, specially your Biker friends. Will be back to this place again. Have a lot on the menu that I gotta try. 
{Suggestion: Please provide Silent Glides underneath the chair legs as it generates an annoying sound when moved against the floor}

A delightful experience last evening.Wanted to visit since long but finally was able to after being persuaded by a brother of mine.One of the smoothest shisha 's out there.Being a former biker,the ambience can't get better than this for me.But,I think it'll appeal to ones who aren't that much fond of bikes too.The food was really cooked well and tasted nice too.Mushroom Chardonnay and Biker's Chicken Fusion Discovery are the ones we tasted after being suggested by a brother who happens to be a regular.

This Biker therm cafe is a great pit stop to catch up with old friends and maybe also make some new ones . Done up with a fresh light feel , the place serves great breakfasts , was there with an old friend for a late breakfast ¬†, ordered a French Benedict ( Rs. 258/-) and ¬†a Americano ( Rs.96/-) , while my friend had The Spanish Haven Omelette ( Rs.258/-) accompanied by ¬†a Cappiccino (141/-) , , both egg dishes , cooked to perfection and a perfect hearty breakfast ¬†.

The service was efficient and friendly and the decor bright and welcoming , with a fusball table and some board games spread around , a great pit stop to spend some leisurely time with friends , definitely and highly recommended .¬†

ENJOY

At last when you reach a destination what was in the list from a long, long time. At last we were here, on a lovely evening. And yes, it was just for a coffee / thirst cooler visit. So, in this review we actually didn't cover their food much.

Location: 
______________
it's in Elgin road. A walking distance from the P C Chandra jewellery shop at Elgin.

Decoration:
_______________

Yes, the decoration will simply blow your mind. On the entrance itself you will find a beast ( bike). That will set the tone and theme of the restaurant straight away. It's a wooden decorated restaurant. You will have some indoor board games also to play around.

Now coming to food and beverage:
____________________________________

‚úì Malaysian Chicken Satay : good one. Slightly on spicey side. And served with peanut dip.

‚úì Bikers Club sandwich: excellent one. Made with pieces of grilled chicken. Must try.

Beverages:
_____________
‚úì Irish Coffee: okay type. The coffee amount is stronger than the Irish syrup. So, people who likes the strong coffee, would love it more.

‚úì Choco Rose Latte : it's so so in taste.

‚úì fresh watermelon mojito: very refreshing. Loved it.
‚úì Ginger Ale : it's the best refreshing mocktail we had on that evening.
‚úì Ferraro Rocher Shake : excellent one. The server it with a round piece of brownie also.
‚úì Elixir of youth: now one main thing what you can get here is fresh juice of veggies. This one is simply owsum.
‚úì Open Bud can : they served it with a big glass mug.

So, now coming to the experience. It's very satisfying. Now please note this review is totally on the items we had.

They have many excellent items we are yet to try. American breakfast, pan cakes and many more. So, we will visit it again for sure.

The staffs are very helpful, service is prompt also.

It was 2613 for 4 heads. Yes if you try the food cost will be higher.

So, don't wait... Just go there to get an owsum experience. :)

The Bikers Cafe is easy to locate and is at only 5 minutes walking distance from Forum.
The ambience is great but the music collection could have been better.
The mint shisha was true to it's name and gave a soothing sensation in the throat.
The food that we ordered included Spicy Mediterranean Pizza (which wasn't spicy at all),Veg Lasagne ( definitely better as compared to the pizza),
Virgin Mojito and Iced Latte.
The service was nice.

The name is quite intriguing and their decor definitely justifies it. Located quite visibly near Brand Factory on Elgin road, its on the first floor of a tiny mall. The menu puts forth quite a number of options but sadly, the food is not upto the mark. Okay, not all but most of them. The waiter served us the wrong order twice. When he got it right, the Alfredo Pasta made our palettes beg for mercy. We couldn't have more than 2 bites. That was a deal breaker. Even though the drinks and the sandwhiches are fine I think the only thing commendable about the place is it's decor.

I went for lunch with my SO, one thing I'd love to point out are all the interesting games at the entrance! I love foosball now üòç
Coming to the food, we had a Lasagne and  prawn dish which was served at its best. Matched it with a beer. If you're sitting at the window side then it gives you a good view to enjoy and they have ample board games which u can pick and play! 
Good place but I don't see myself going back to it.

The perfect place for a good breakfast / brunch. We got really lucky with an amazing live band. The decor is really cool and small details like the cutlery, the lamps over the bar, the accessories and the perfect seating distance between tables makes it all the more enjoyable. The food is affordable and packed with flavour. Too many yummy things to list down. Personal favourites include : Irish Cappucino with Grilled Jerk Chicken with Honey Mustard Sandwich. Their pancakes are yum too. Does not help the midnight munchies - all this nostalgia.

My brother in law gave a breakfast treat today in this place. It's a Sunday and as expected was fully packed. We opted for the sofa seats inside since we expected it to be calm and quite but it wasnt. A large speaker stood just beside our table. Live music was going on and frankly speaking i am not a great fan of live music while having food. The service was slow but once the food arrived there was little to complaint about. Sugarcane Mojito was good and the chicken satay was excellent. Could have given a high five if all the options given in the menu were available. They didnt have fish finger and cajun chicken available since it was not a regular item to be ordered for breakfast. We were not in the mood to have eggs which they had in plenty. Ambience was really something to talk about. Overall a nice place to hang out since they take a lot of time to serve.üòã

The bikers cafe, one of the best chillout place in kolkata. Trust me, this place one of my personal favourites, i ordered one of their signature hookahs "bold and beautiful" , its very smooth and a mixture of flavours come in my mouth whenever i take a puff . Ambience wise its very soothing, music is nice , crowd is very good . Food is also very good and i have also come in the morning for  breakfast, its very good. 
Nasim bhaiyaa is the person who makes the hookah and i have never had any complaints whatsoever.

The Bikers Cafe is close to the Brand Factory on Elgin Road. The 1st thing that impressed me was its ambiance and decor. A bike kept at the very entrance, the bike theme was something new I have been.
Coming to the food. We went there for evening snacks. Ordered their Peri Peri Burger which came in a beautiful presentation. The Burger was excellent in taste.
Next we ordered the Chicken Wings in BarBQ sauce, this was also very good in taste. Completely finger licking.
.
Service was average. They took about 25mins to serve this two dishes.
Ambiance is magnificent.
They also have a hookha bar inside. With a separate seating arrangement.
Pocket pinch was very high. Two simple dish costed us about Rs.750, they charge 30‚ÑÖ tax.

I'll not deny that bikers cafe does provide some lip smacking food, but a few dishes here I didn't find that tasty. Coming to the arabiata sauce pasta, I didn't find it quite nice. But the alfredo sauce one was very yummy. The chicken wings was too sour. And I didn't like the taste of it at all. The drinks and shakes are quite nice, though extremely sweet. And among desserts, I simply adored the strawberry pancake. The aloo parathas were fine. Do visit cause the ambience willl blow your mind!

The cafe is wonderful. The decor is amazing. It is a bikes-themed cafe and hence one would find bikes all around, especially in the entrance, crazy washroom doors. Try their chocolate chip pancakes. They are complete bliss.

Best place in town for some really amazing food and some very different yet refreshing mocktails. Sandwiches, Pastas, Shisha (when it was legal üòÅ), Burgers and Chicken dishes.. They make them the best!
Games, live music (on select days) and the wonderful staff, in addition to the food, makes me want to visit regularly.
Special shout out to the chef for making the roasted stuffed chicken with pepper sauce! One of the best, if not the best, chicken dishes I've ever had (and I have a LOT of chicken).

Restaurant on 1st floor, nice atmosphere, good music but Bikers Cafe falls short to deliver. Missing the friendly attitude of waiters, hard to get their attention. Side order delivered 15 minutes before main course and the lamb burger was spiced up - not what you expect in an american-style joint.
The Mexican food is good. We had two burgers and they were really tasty. Ambience is OK

This is hip cafe in the city located on the 1st floor of Platinum mall in Elgin Road. The mall itself is located very close to Brand Factory.
The decor is great. The interiors were done in wood which gave it a rustic yet smart look. There is a bar and also a disque for the DJ to take over during the evenings. On entering the cafe you'll fall in love with the sight--------A Harley Davidson! :D
It's pretty quiet inside the cafe during mornings and afternoons but the quietness is mostly replaced with really good music that always improves your mood during your dining sessions.

The food that my friend and I ordered were:
1) Cold coffee (This is served in bulb shaped glasses which are so cute. The coffee itself is extremely delicious. It's low sugar and very yummy.)
2) The Chicken Lasagna was so very delicious. It was perfect. Not too spicy and not too cheesy. We loved the pasta. It was the perfect meal for brunch. Highly recommended.
3) Chocolate and Strawberry Monte Carlos (They were fine. I enjoyed how the chocolate chunks mixed with the chocolate icecream and tasted really good. Also we enjoyed the strawberries with the icecream. We were too full to finish both the Monte Carlos. These tasted good.)

The service was great. The guys were very cool. They should really keep up their good work. :)

The menu is a bit overpriced I think. But it's a great place for hanging out with friends so it's all good. Very cool.

An amazing place with a delightful ambience. Located on the first floor of the Platinum Mall in Elgin Road. As the name goes, the decor inside blend with it. The place is spacious and the staffs are well behaved. They have a really good collection of music and Carrom and other other games are there to keep your kid busy! The food is lips-smacking and you can let out a satisfied burp after eating. There is also a bike in display right outside the caf√© which is an ideal spot of clicking pictures. All in all, it was a good experience there. Planning to go back soon and try out the other dishes in the menu.

Bikers Caf√© stays true to its name as the d√©cor definitely incorporates a very distinct theme. The layout is really fun and there is a live band that plays really great music on Friday + Saturday nights and  Sunday mornings. This just adds to the overall dining experience. 
This is a great Brunch place to spend a few hours with great company. The food is very good and the portions are impeccable. (try the French Benedict and the Cuban Sandwich)
I've been here a lot of times and keep going back because the overall experience is always superb.

I had ordered chicken wings, pasta in white sauce and Portuguese road king. The flavours in the chicken wings played riot in my mouth. The pasta tasted amazing. The Portuguese road king will be my pick of the lot though. Great tasting peri peri chicken with very tasty vegetables. I definitely plan to visit this place many more times in the future.

Biker's Bafe as the name suggests is themed around the tough harley davidson riders salons in America. Although you wouldn't find anyone in big beards, leather jackets and bandana but you might get the feel. The food is varied and not limited to the salon style finger food and burgers. I visited the place for breakfast and was amazed. The food tasted great, the shake was good and service great.¬†

Can everybody just take a moment and appreciate the feel bad vibe of this place? Super fun, young and so cheerful! The decor is of course so cool and does justice to the name. Usually food is the first element of judgement for me. ..but I just had to talk about ambience first. ..now, food is amazing! I love their burger! We had ordered around 7 dishes. .. amd the bill was around 4000. That's pretty decent. Thumbs up to this place! Also servings are for one person only. But it's enough for one.

This is my first review, am doing it just because I want others to visit this place. This is the only place that gave me an urge to write a review. May be this is for those wonderful groovy music or the theme of cafe. A bike themed cafe at the heart of Kolkata . Ambience pushed me in the era of 70's southern american highway life, when Blackfoot used to create their magic. Behaviour of staffs is really good.And their attire is just like bikers, these all things made me feel that am sitting inside a poised Dhaba & taking a break after a long ride. Food is also good. 
So it's a fantastic place, everyone should visit.

A biker themed cafe with rustic furnishing, a real Harley Davidson bike and rock music in the background? Count me in! This place recreates the American diner experience surprisingly well, and dishes up some marvellous food to boot. The French Benedict with ham is scrumptious, with eggs poached just enough so that the yolk is still lovely and runny. The pancakes are - praise the Lord - exactly what pancakes should be. I've tasted some real horrors that pass off as the American breakfast classic. These are not too sweet, nice and soft, and come with a yummy blueberry compote. The cutting chai is real proper Indian chai, which isn't that easy to get at cafes, and they do nice coffees as well. I tried the Texas chicken pizza too, once, and it's a flavour explosion in the mouth. I'd say, though, come here for the breakfast items! Love the menu layout, love the prompt service, love the taste. And I'm telling you, few things go as well with pancakes and coffee as 'Highway to Hell' pounding away in the background! :D

This place is easy to find. Quality of the food is really good but the quantity of the food is not as the price they charge for & also the service is a bit slow.
But the ambiance is quite good, its a very small place but the way they decorated within the same is really good. There is a separate room for those who want to smoke hookah.
We ordered two drinks, one starter i.e. potato potholes which is a must try, though it is a veg starter dish but its really good & in main course we had knucklehead peri peri chicken burger which was cut in half since we were two people. We also ordered portugese road king but then one of the waiter told us not to because it will be too much for two people to eat which in a way he helped us saving our money :'D.
Anyways this is a good place to hangout with friends with the good ambiance & tasty food.

The Bikers Cafe- located @ elgin road, nearby forum mall. there are two sections inside, 1 for sheesha & the other half as a cafe just for food. the interior is the best part about this place. utilised the ample amount of space cleverly. we ordered hookah which was quite good, did not choke even once (which is a sign of a good hookah), did not try there food, so no comments in that section. hopefully by next visit, will try even there food :) the crowd is really good. the staff is quite attentive & courteous. as of now, RECOMMENDED.

Well indeed, the name is justified, going by what we came across when we visited the outlet on the afternoon of 25th december...the enitre decor and ambience reflects a biker's world..at the entrance you are greeted with a fancy bike stationed where the passionate bikers and everyone alike can take some pictures to flaunt..they have a separate sheesha lounge..n the restaurant area is decorated sophisticatedly...located near the brand factory at the elgin road, this place is crowded with people, owing to a fairly large dining area..the food menu is diverse...we had ordered an irish coffee and the desert of the day - chocolate monte carlo...the irish coffee tasted as good as it looked...and the chocolate monte carlo (ice creams blended with choco chips till the last spoon u have) helped us get through a game of chess...well yes , they have numerous board games including air hockey and fusball for free....the staffs are clad in a biker's look and the service is fantastic..they r very well trained and would definitely make you leave a happy customer...had a great experience..looking forward to visiting again in the future..

25th Christmas evening was Perfect at this place. Music was groovy, the food was delicious and most importantly Crowd which was amazing. I'm giving 4point and they lack 1point in service which was slow and bit confusing from there side. I ordered Soup which was simply tasty, Gourmet Vegetarian Pizza which was good, White Sauce veg Pasta and last order was Chico Chip Pancake which they forgot to place it. As I sat for 15mins for Pancake after finishing everything they didn't brought so I asked them again. Pancake took time around 10mins and as I was getting late I had to take away it. All round Bikers cafe is nice place to chill.

The food is spot on, from the drinks right to the pasta and desserts. Service here is reasonably prompt. There is also a Foosball table and an air hockey board!!

Recommendations:

1. Cajun chicken tenders
2. Chicken lasagna
3. Lime Cola ***** (must try)

Definitely going back again despite the location which is a little unassuming.

The makers of Biker's cafe have tried their best to truly represent it's name. From paper crosswords about bikes to real bike models, one can find them all. They have also setup some board games like air hockey and billiards which I really liked.

Our main intention of going to this place was hookah. They have a very small section for hookah and it gets very congested once all seats are full. We tried the bold and beautiful flavour. It was mild and its flavours were really nice.

In food we had potato chilli and chicken sandwhich. Although, Potato chilli was very spicy and crispy, just the way I like, the winner dish was the chicken sandwich. It was filled with chicken drenched in mayonise and cheese. It was served hot which made the cheesy chicken melt in our mouth. I totally loved it.

Overall, it is a great place for hanging out with friends. My only suggestion would be increasing the hookah space. That would definitely increase the crowd.

Another significant addition to the collection of themed restaurants in Kolkata. As the name says, this restaurant is based on the theme of Motorbikes. Wooden flooring... dinning table and chairs are made out of timber like woods which has added a rugged look to it's interior. At the entrance you'll bumped into a retro model of Harley Davidson. The illumination and interior decor will remind you of a road side cafe, often screened in Hollywood movies. The cutlery here also got unique touch... spoon or fork resemble range or spanner! Now, coming to the main part...food! They have done a tremendous job here... Whatever we had ordered were delicious!
#Cajun chicken tender - served with triple dipper
#BBQ chicken wings
#Jack Daniel BBQ Lamb Steak
#Bikers Chicken fusion discovery - two chicken breast pieces of chicken one is in peri peri and other one in pesto sauce, a chicken roulade, a sunny side up. served on a bed of steam rice, accompanied with saute veggies.
Waiters are quite courteous and assist you to order dishes according to your choice. They are flexible enough to let you customize your dishes.

Initially my plan was to enjoy the evening with a good sheesha but the ambiance and the live music which was being played came up as a surprise. The band was wonderful added with good food, I had to cancel the seating arrangement for shreesha as I would not be able to witness the exhilarating performance. To sum it up it was a well spent evening.

I don't generally write reviews about cafes. But this place has forced me to write one. The first n foremost thing that I liked about the cafe was it had a separate hookah section, so we were relived that we won't have to cough our lungs out unlike other cafes. Coming to the foods. It was all good starting from the garlic bread to fully loaded nachos and the strawberry lemonade & the chcochip waffles were too good. All in all a good place to hang out with friends with some very good food and ambience.

I had visited The Biker's Cafe a long time ago in May, yet i remember the food very well. ¬†We had ordered the gourmet Vegetarian pizza, Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler, The potuguese Road King ¬†with Virgin Mojitos on the side. The food was just great, perfect. The pizza crust was thin , crisp with just the perfect amount of toppings. The Chicken Sizzler was just awesome! The flavours great. My favourite was the The Portuguese Road king. It was ¬†piri piri grilled chicken with mashed potatoes, grilled veggies and garlic bread on the side. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, not too spicy and the mashed potatoes were creamy, smooth and buttery and provided the perfect balance to the chicken. The mojitos were very refreshing! We came out as happy souls from the restaurant! :)¬†
The ambiance is very good. A chilled out place. Great place for hangouts with friends. The staff was very friendly and always eager to help with the menu. The service was good. Even if it takes a bit longer, the food you get will compensate for that, no doubt!
Definitely recommended.

A nice place to hangout with your friends. Went their for breakfast & was quite impressed with the decor. Ambience was cozy & staff were attentive. The price reasonable.
Now, the food. The three items which we ordered, The Spanish Haven, All American Bacon n Eggs & The Thai Egg-Spectation were all excellent & very filling. Only the bacon was a little tasteless as it was too crispy.
The Thai Egg Spectation was my favourite. Will go back again to explore their other items. Don't miss the brownie. It was just yummy.

Situated right at the Elgin road and Lee road crossing this place is one of the most well known and happening cafes in the city. Ambiance is excellent and the place has a great and positive vibe to it. Its divided into two parts..one for people having sheesha and the other for ones not having it. The hookah served i.e Tangy Twister was good and lasted for quite a long time. Food ordered tasted delicious in the form of the Chicken Pasta and Chicken Satay. Overall it was a wonderful experience, but prices are quite high and the evening snack along with the hookah costed around 1.5k. But overall a highly recommended place if someone has the bucks to pay.

We went on Saturday noon to this place, and i was quite shocked to see this place empty on a weekend day.. but it worked for us as we were damn hungry n they were serving food very quickly..
About the place - ambience of the place is as the name says..
We ordered 4-5 dishes and had mix reviews.
Nachos- my personal favourite.. it had enough cheese and toppings.. it was good¬†
Fish fingers- I have had better than these somewhere else. .so was disappointed by the dish..
Garlic bread- it wasn't that good
Crispy chilli chicken - this dish topped all the dishes we ordered.. was tasty..
For dessert we ordered- Choco chip pancakes - we really loved it..it was neatly baked & fluffy, had ample amount of chocolate sauce..
Yes..last and not the least..music was also good..not loud..just perfect..

My love for my kind of food...

That's the exact feeling when you pass by the Harley Davidson with Alan Walker in the background and enter this miniature West Virginia...

We ordered Grilled Jerk Chicken with Honey mustard sandwich.. It was pretty good to go with the fresh Watermelon and olives...
Then their Signature dishes one after another... Hungarian Style Grilled Fish, Bikers Cafe Fusion Discovery and Italian Chicken Saltimbocca...
The fish was tender and subtle... Their discovery dish impressed me coz of the use of pesto sauce in grilled chicken... But the Saltimbocca was class apart, and the sauce was as unique as it can be....
Lastly to sign off, Special Berry Compote in our list and it made the day!!! I can come here again and again for this one only!!!!

A 0.5 deduction for the missing handle on the board football... Never mind Guys!!!

The bikers cafe is exactly decorated as the name. It has bikes, photos of bikes, parts of bikes stuck to the wall and even the cutlery look like tools. 

We had a variety of dishes and had a mixed response to them:

Fully loaded nachos - this was a great dish, the nachos had enough cheese and enough toppings to taste awesome 

Penne pasta with Alfredo and vegetables - great pasta, no issues here 

Gourmet pizza - this is where I was disappointed, now a lot of people think that the topping or the cheese is what makes the pizza but actually, it's the sauce that makes it and sadly, there was very scanty sauce on the base, so it was just like eating cheese and vegetables on dough, disappointing 

Chocolate shake - it comes in Coool bulb shaped glass and tastes good too :D

Chocolate pancakes - the pancake was nice and fluffy but the chocolate sauce was too syrupy and defeated the fluff of the pancake.

A good thing I want to point out about this restaurant is that they had a separate area for the hookah part which keeps the smoke away. No complaints from the service either, going to visit again early some day for the breakfast. 

            

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name there as here)

Located in the first floor of the Platinum mall just before the forum mall. Amazing ambience with theme and accessories of a bikers choices all around.¬† Coming to food - ordered Hazelnut Choco Shake served in an innovative crockery - glass bulb - best shake i ever had, the staffs recommended to try out their signature dish chicken wings - tasted delicious with a perfect blend of sweet and sour sauce tossed with the wings. Coming to sweet tooth ordered banana caramel crepe sprayed with chcoco sauce which was too yummy. Staffs are friendly pocket pinch is a bit high, but its worth it.

Now this place clearly belongs to one of the coolest cafes in Kolkata. As their line goes some people have therapies and some have motorcycles, the interior of this place does give a hell load of biker feel and The Harley Davidson dream. Today though it was quite an empty room given a Friday night but what I loved the most was the music these guys where playing, Hallelujah to Daddy cool, from Born to be wild to Hotel California all my favourites. Now coming to the service, it was decent and quick enough. Started with the tender fish fingers with mayonese dip along with watermelon Mojito. Their Mexican chicken sizzler was quite amazing. The rice came with red beans and corn, and the chicken was tossed in spicey pepper sauce. Yum. Tortured by the sweet tooth we ended our meal with the nicely baked Choco chip pancakes. A place with a bike, good food, and a foosball table can never go wrong.

So finally i visited this place after hearing lot about it. Its located near forum mall. The cafe ts totally based on the theme. There is a showcase of a bike at the entrance. Coming to the food we ordered Texas Spicy Chicken Cowboy Pizza and Spaghetti Meatballs. The pizza was of thin crust and it tasted good. Coming to the spaghetti it was really spicy. The lamb in it tasted good however it could have been more jucy. Overall i liked the food. The service is also good. A perfect place for meetups and hanging out.

Overpriced. Though I don't except it to be less because it is themed. 
I was with friends and we ordered a drink which had exquisite amount of strawberries. The waiter suggested that one,but to my personal taste it was not worth the price. One friend being a vegetarian ordered a Ratatouille. I myself went for the Italian Chicken Saltimboca,which was chicken breast stuffed with spinach. And the other dish we ordered was Fish Kafila which was up to the mark. 
Oh,and in starters,the Malaysian chicken satay tasted like some kind of seafish which was served in a red sauce. The ambience was really built up,there was a foosball table!

Ambience: The ambience was great the AC was bad. The the ppl and their service was prompt and friendly. If you like themed restaurants...then this is a good place. 

Food: Not value for money at all. Overpriced and overrated in terms of food quantity as well as taste. We ordered pizzas(pure pepperoni and dijon) which lacked spice or that pizza crunchy feel. We also ordered mexican chipotle chicken sizzler...its damn spicey but the taste wasnt something I enjoyed, lacked good spices...wasnt tasty at all. We took the terminator burger. The burger patty felt like it needed more softening even for lamb. Then we took a mezze  platter non veg...which was a let down in the lamb kebab and chicken samosa department. The cold coffee was a disaster. Best to avoid it.  All in all the food needs a total remake in my opinion. Hope to see this place improve its dishes the next time we consider it.

Located on the 1st floor of Platinum Mall in Elgin Road, The Biker's Cafe has a fresh, woody look which is decently appealing.¬†

Seating arrangements are good & spacious. We chose to sit at one of the corner tables (the rubber caps of the chair legs were missing leading to an irritating sound whenever we moved/dragged the chairs).

We ordered a Herbal Green Tea and a Green Lemon Tea, both of which were served with Tea bags.¬†
Now, had the tea been served in a pot, we would have considered it, but Rs.96 for a cup of tea, that too with tea bag? Too much.¬†

Next we ordered "Pink of Health", which is a detoxifying drink...watermelon based with a pinch of rock salt and certain other ingredients. LOVED IT!

For starter, we ordered Chicken Wings in smoky BBQ sauce. It was crispy and succulent. Tasted good. 4/5.

Next we ordered Peri Peri Grilled Chicken Burger. Filling had mustard mayo, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion, cheddar, gherkin/pickle and some dressing. It was served with french fries, coleslaw and a dip. The burger tasted great. 4.5/5.

For main course, we ordered a Hungarian style Grilled Fish with Parsley Lemon Butter Sauce. This dish was presented beautifully and served with garlic mashed potato & vegetables. Loved it! 4.5/5.

For Dessert we ordered a Brownie. Served hot with chocolate sauce and ice-cream, this item disappointed us. The ice cream tasted weird. Quality of brownie could have been better. It was hard at places and smelled like flour. 2/5.

Service : Much scope for improvement. The waiters, though not rude on your face, neither do they look very jovial or helpful. Also, they just put the dish on the table and leave. They do not offer to serve the dishes.¬†

Price : On the higher side.

Portion : Good.

After shopping hard at Forum mall, just sit back and relax at this beautifully crafted cafe lounge. Huge menu variety and totay doing justice with its theme look. Separate hookah area or can be used for private dinning. Few games for entertainment. Service is fairly good. The place is not very big in size but still it is a good place to eat out in town. In here, I had ice cream waffles in kolkata for the  first time so i really like this place.

Visited the place a month back.
Location : 4/5 right opposite forum but parking can be an issue in rush hours.
Food: 4/5 the prices are on the higher side but then the quantity is huge. For 2 people, we called for nachos and pasta and it was too much to finish. Bill amount roughly 1000rs
Service: 3/5 since it was my first visit, I was looking forward to some suggestions from the waiter but he was absolutely of no help. He could not suggest any dish or chef's recommendations. Also it took them 30 mins and 5 reminders to serve us water.
Ambience 3/5 ordinary setup and also the place we were seated, the ac vent was leaking and there was water on the table and the floor but they were least bothered to fix that up or apologize for the same.

A FOODIE TURNS A ROADIE THIS TIME

My lunch ride at the Bikers' Cafe was super smooth so that while eating I felt like humming the timeless tune of Saptapadi in the lips of the immortal pair Uttam-Suchitra : Ei poth jodi na shesh hoy! Our choice this time in a vintage yet punk, bohemian ambiance was Hungarian Styled Grilled Fish, Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler and Italian Chicken Saltimboca accompanied with a Kiwi Twister Mocktail and Cardiabrainac i.e., a detoxifying watermelon juice, finally summed up with a Classic waffle in drizzled maple syrup, topped with Chocolate ice cream scoop.
The service was smart, suaved, cordial, attendant and spaced out and so was the food - intelligent, delicious, succulent, presentable with distinct flavours. The taste buds never got bored although the tummy was filled up with presentable proportions that did justice to our pocket.
The life flowchart on the tablemats was simple... Those who ride should risk but our risk this time in our foodadventure was simply a gain with a profit to our palate!

The nachos was generous with its topping and it actually was good.The same can be said for the fresh garlic bread, the gourmet and Mediterranean pizzas...fresh, abundant toppings and a perfect crust. I don't have taste for Lebanese but the mezze platter seemed pretty decent 
A good visit....should try...

The place is easy to locate,which becomes one of the main concern sometimes,and the decor is a bit different but quite classy,wooden furnishing,a bit rustic,and the bike makes it look the best.

So coming to the food,they took a bit more tine than usual to serve the food,we ordered a desi breakfast,eggless pancake and waffles,and I had there pasta too but that was on an evening,this particular day was for breakfast,the quantity and quality was good,presentation is nicely done,and the food was perfectly cooked and tastes good and healthy!!!

One word would be enough: PERFECT

Highly recommend for the people coming from Europe and North America and looking for some American/ English food. So very authentic.

I went to this place with my Canadian friend, Kimberly, for a late breakfast. I ordered all Americans bacon & egg and Kimberly ordered eggs Benedict. Both of the items were top notch and perfect. The presentation was so beautiful even the butter was in a floral shape. Kimberly did mention that this was the best eggs Benedict she'd ever had. The english muffin was perfect, the eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise sauce was sinfully delicious, even the potatoes were yum. We had taken watermelon based refreshing drink with a punch of basil. It was delicious and filling. It itself could have been my breakfast.

The presentation and the decor is mind blowing. The entrance itself has got a very stylish model of Harley Davidson. The entire cafe is bike themed. The lamp shades are made in the form of helmets. The leather stools, the posters, the wooden walls and chairs, even the salt pot stand on the table was a beautiful blend of speed and humor; everything is so very perfect. To our surprise even the cutleries came in the shape of motor vehicle tools and the name tags of the waiters were attached to their shirt by spanner like pins.

The waiters are so well trained and polite. Could not find a single flaw in any part of it. It was a lovely experience, within the pocket pinch.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

I am a cafe freak and i absolutely loved this place. Few metres down the Elgin rd, quite opposite to Forum mall one can find this world of bikers.
The best part of this cafe being its ambience, they put up shock absorbents on the wall, all the wall or table decors have bike parts and stuff and everything that make a true biker go insane..
Coffee was nicely served and tasted good.
Crispy chilli babycorn and some black beans toast were what me and my dad devoured on and we absolutely loved it.
The staff is friendly and they have air hockey too. I am 24 and still grill for it. That being said, it a a great place for kids too, they wont get bored.
They serve hookah too and have happy hours on it. How cool is that ?!?.
A must go for a gang of friends or biker gang.

Bikers Cafe is located at such an unconventional position, it automatically makes you feel excited. The interiors and music collection is bound to cheer you up. I have been here twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast and both the experiences were very different but I am going to go with the better one.

We went for dinner around 7 pm and the atmosphere was amazing. we ordered Ginger Ale, Orange Surprise, Fully Loaded Nachos, Classic Margherita Pizza and a Veg Lasagna. The ginger ale tasted bitter but it was doable, the orange surprise however tasted awesome, just the perfect amount of everything. The Nachos were by far the best nachos i have ever tasted, the quantity and the ingredients were both a treat. the Pizza and Lasagna were massive and rich on taste. We had no space for dessert, which we regretted because their dessert menu is very tempting.

Our second visit a few months later was for breakfast. The menu is limited and we had to go with their continental egg dishes, Spanish Haven and Paneer Burst sandwich which were both average. Even their Honey Banana shake was disappointing. If you are looking for a good time with great food, go during lunch/dinner hours.

Sorry for the lack of pictures, we were too busy eating :p

OMG, their ambiance. They have put shock absorbents on the door. Well, this is just to begin with. All the parts of a bike that you din't noe existed - they have it up their wall.

They serve hookah and they do it well. Food presentation is very good. We were the last customers to leave the place but they did not hurry up with us even when it was their closing time.

Food quality was awesome. The Mojito that they served was the best.

The Television did not work that night but that's okay. We weren't there to watch Tv. The place held good crowd too.

This place is a must visit on the Elgin street. It's located on the 1st floor - you wouldn't miss it.

We were from Bombay and we weren't treated as outsiders.

I went there with my friends. At first we ordered Hookah which is quite obvious at the Bikers Cafe. We ordered a Desi Hookah Grapes. The Hookah was good as expected though I'm not fond of Hookah at all. Then my friends ordered Bikers Club Sandwich, Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler and I ordered Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler for me. The food was delicious undoubtedly. It really worth the price. The ambience is quite good as well. Basically we have a good experience over there. There's just one thing I would like to add, when the name is Bikers Cafe then you must serve beer but alas this place is non-alcoholic. :)

The Bikers Cafe, as the name says is all about biking experience along with a lot of good food. It is a cafe that lives up to its name and does justice to it. Located at the junction of Lee road and Elgin road, it's located on the first floor of a complex with other commercial establishments.

As one steps into the restaurant/cafe, the decor gives a constant reminder of the name. With a small waiting room centred around a cruiser bike, tables with lights atop done like a bike's head lamp, metallic tables and chairs, stewards dressed like hardy bikers and so much more. It gives you the feel of an American cafe which serves as a stop for bikers on the highway. They also have a separate room for smoking, a bar like place and games like table football and air hockey or board games to fit your mood.

Coming to the food, they have a wide spread menu and as a rarity have nice breakfast options too. They open pretty early too. We were there for lunch and started with the soup of the day and chicken wings. The soup was a thick creamy broth and tasted good. The chicken wings was cooked in a gooey sauce and served with a mayonnaise dip which didn't go too well well with it, but otherwise the dish was good.

For mains we tried the Hungarian grilled fish and chicken fusion discovery. The fish was cooked well and served with a portion of mashed potato and grilled veggies. It was tender and had savoury flavours. The chicken was served with a portion of steamed rice topped with a sunny side up and two patties of chicken breast cooked in separate gravy. The chicken was tough to be true, but the dish tasted fine. For dessert we chose the fresh banana pancake, it was served hot and was way more than a single serving.

The cafe is good with the decor and food. The table games need a lot of looking after though, for them to be useful and a USP, they need to be maintained. The hygiene and cleanliness are maintained. Service is commendable. Prices are on the higher side.

Overall it was a good experience and begs future visits.

Happy eating!!!

Wow..when a customer try their food and if this is the first word that comes out of their mouth, it means a lot for any food joint chef and/or the owner. I think this place gets it often.

I have tried this place many time, and everytime they satisfied me. The way they present you the food, delivery or in-house, is international standard. This time it was delivery, and thats the most saddening part about Kolkata. No matter which place you try, they never do it on time. ( crappy pizza chains; an exception ) Thats why the one point deduction, other than that everything is too good.. Much better than the burgers you get from popular fast food joints.

Ok let me introduce their burger, phenomenal and exceptionary. The amount of mayo thet they give will keep you left wondering, why so much? such is their genorisity. And yes i am not exaggerating, look at the pictures yourself. The burger itself is very tasty, and the buns are soft. fillings and patty are fresh and juicy. They give Cole slaw mixed mayo, great?!?!?! Another dose of mayo.. huh? but actually it changes the flavor.. so you will enjoy it, nonetheless. The only thing that i didn't like are the french fries ( just like kfc, mc makes it better). Other than that great experience. A must try.

Went here with my husband, had pancakes which were very good, the coffee was great. The problem was the service, My husband got his pancake 10 
minutes before I got mine...and the worst part: I saw my pancake waiting in the kitchen, while the waiters were all gone for some reason!
I waved someone who seemed to be the manager, he saw the dish, but wouldn't pick it up! Eventually he found a waiter and send him to us.

The place is a real nice to chill out.Good ambience.Choice for breakfast is great.The juices are nice.The staff is good.Just two points for the management to make the place even better.
The service needs to be faster...
The establishment should get license for liquor. Then the place would be even greater to hang out in the evenings.

Visited Bikers cafe with my best friend on her birthday bash. The cafe in one word is awesome . Supercool ambience with the vintage bikers surroundings.

1st we have seeshah : OMG with energy drink base . The red bull added extra flavour and the smoke was coming super smooth with an awesome flavour.
Following that we have Djohn Chicken pizza ,Spaghetti meatballs and cottage cheese shaslik sizzler . 

I like the sizzler specially . We ended up with the sores shake and Brownie shake .
I would highly recommend everyone to visit Bikers Cafe at least once . Hence full 5 points for Bikers cafe.

A full 5.0 for this cafe. Situated on bustling Elgin behind forum mall. This place gives you the vibe of being a biker. Rock Music plays all the time and is not loud which is important. The food absolutely delicious ordered bruschetta and burgers and I was impressed with the quality of both. Service is too good and the coffee was out of the world. Overall there is nothing on which I could complain about. Lookong forward for a second visit.

Finally I made it to The Bikers Cafe after hearing so much about them in my friend circle. We were a group of 6 and we were given our table immediately. The service was very good and I liked their ambience! It's a pity they don't have the license to serve beer :P I loved the music that was being played! We ordered quite a variety of dishes like jerked chicken sandwich, club sandwich, penne pasta in pesto sauce, pepperoni pizza, hungarian grilled fish, classic waffles and choco chip pancakes.... I liked their sandwiches and the pizza but rest were pretty average. The cold coffee and the irish coffee was also pretty good but I did not like the oreo shake. Overall it was a decent experience!

Well this is the most talked about cafe in South Kolkata and true to the rumours, this place rocks. The ambience and the music both are perfectly suited for the young generation. Mostly frequented by young people who want to chill out with their friends, the cafe offers a positive energy and turns into a pretty good place to hang out. But the food was not that good and I have to admit that I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the music and the ambience. The drinks were not that good but the waffle was decent. The service was commendable and the cafe ticks all the right spots when it comes to cleanliness and maintanance. However, the quality of the food should be increased to that standard.

A place that's been on my list for very long. However it didn't quite live up to expectations. They have a huge array options on their menu, but the taste is pretty much average. Service is okish. So basically a very average place, since I can't say much about the food. Doesn't make me wanna visit again.

The Bikers Cafe is an amazing themed cafe in Elgin road. It is near the Forum mall.The place has an amazing vibe. The interiors are very good . Large bikes and artifacts about bikes and travelling are present all over the cafe. There is a fuseball counter where you can play  until your food arrives.Old English songs playing in the background and the atmosphere is very comfortable and cosy. We had orderded a mojito and the bikers chicken fusion which was a platter. The food was extremely tasty and we surely visit this place again. :)

If you are looking for a great informal restaurant with amazing decor and great food, then Biker's Cafe is the place for you. This bike and bikers themed restaurant near Rabindra Sadan Metro is loud and great for a gathering of friends.¬†
I visited this place for lunch with a group of friends one Saturday afternoon. There is a bike outside the front door and the interior is adorned with decorations pertaining to the same. Even the cutlery is designed to resemble a wrench and pliers. There is a foosball and air hockey table where you can spend your time while your meal is prepared. The Chuck Berry, Eagles and Nirvana playing in the background was the perfect music to accompany the ambience and food, which was unconventional yet delicious.
So finally coming to the food. Each dish was excellent and it would be wrong not to give them individual mention so here goes:
1) Caramel Desire - Basically cold coffee with caramel sauce, it was served in a glass resembling a light bulb on a wooden platform with dry ice underneath, which created a mist around the glass which looked mystical. The drink was refreshing and delicious.
2) Smoky Tomato and Red Pepper Soup - Served in a "witch's cauldron" with a few herbed croutons on the side, this soup looked amazing as it reached the table. It was thick, not at all watery, and full of ¬†the rich flavour of tomato, the sweetness of the bell pepper and the subtle hints of basil. I don't know what else was in it but it was amazing.
3) Non Veg Mezze Platter - With three kinds of fried elements and 4 dips, this is a mix and match dish. They all tasted good but I particularly liked the falafel, hummus and tzatziki.
4) Chicken Lasagna - Perfectly cooked pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, stringy mozzarella, toasty top, bits of chicken, with crispy garlic bread on the side. What more can I say? It was certainly one of the best lasagnas I have eaten.¬†
5) Italian Chicken Saltimbocca - Stuffed chicken breasts served ¬†along with mash, sauteed vegetables and an extremely moreish mushroom sauce. It was pretty delicious.
6) Dessert of the Day - We decided to go for the dessert of the day and it turned out to be Mango Monte Carlo. Mango and vanilla ice creams with pieces of spongecake served in a martini glass topped with fresh mango and bits of crunchy praline, it was lovely and fresh. My only concern was that the praline bits were a bit sticky and stuck to the teeth.
7) Chocolate Waffles - Biker's cafe is known for its waffles, and I realised why. Crispy around the edges, wonderfully soft at the centre, it was simply amazing. The chocolate on top and the scoop of vanilla ice cream seemed like an added luxury. It was the perfect way to end the meal.Service was quick but a lot of the dishes reached the table reached the table at the same time which made things a tad difficult, as the mains were sitting on the table while we were finishing our starters. The price is a bit on the higher side but it is definitely worth it. Definitely recommended.

For dad's day out we chose this cafe! And what a pleasure it was..  We took a table right next to the window and it was just lovely.  We ordered their special healthy smoothies - the elixir of youth and bone immunizer. Both were quite nice given the ingredients included spinach, ginger etc! The caramel cold coffee was average though and the instrument in which they served(a bulb shaped jar) quite silly! 
The honey chilli potatoes was quite good with the taste rightly balanced. The cheese garlic bread was once again average.. It would have been nice if they out some fresh herbs on top like basil or parsley. 
The hero of the day was the humble classic waffle served with a side of maple syrup. The best waffle I have had in this city till date. Will definitely return to try other items on their menu!!

Been meaning to visit this place for a long time and finally did so a few days back. The decor is fantastic and exactly what you would expect from the name of the cafe. They have a foosball table, a carom board and several board games to choose from. A live band plays new songs, as well as old favourites from school days and they do it well. The placeholders at the table suggest you go biking and if you come back alive you should eat...it's rather funny.
The food is pretty great. We ordered the Chicken wings in barbeque sauce and chicken peri peri burger in ranch dressing. The wings came with fresh carrot and celery sticks and a ranch dip. It was delicious. The burger was lip smacking too, however a little too hot for my palate. The Irish Coffee and the ginger ale were both fantastic. The ginger ale, unlike most places, did not come from a can. They mixed it themselves with a hint of lemon and I loved it.
The service was good and the prices were moderately expensive, but not a lot more than what you would expect. I will definitely go back if I am in the area.

This is actually my second visit to the cafe... and I must they have improved since the last time I was there.... or may be my choice of food has improvedüòâ . We ordered chicken wings with barbeque sauce. It was a revelation... served with carrot and celery sticks and a refreshing dip... yummm... we also ordered periperi chicken burger and it was hot... hot and delicious! But steer clear if your ears burn and eyes water with the name of capsaicin!!! 
We drowned the yummy grub with Irish coffee (for yours truly ) and ginger ale for my friend.... the ginger ale was fabulous too... not our usual Schweppes... more on the lines of Bunderburg! The striking decor of the restaurant and the live music is the added bonus!!! The band singing and playing played old ballards as well the newer tracks.... the range was quite impressive! 
I am eager to return soon!!!

Bikers cafe as the name suggests is all about the world of bikers- the decor, the menu, the ambience all add up to a fun biking experience. Interesting wall decor of bike headlights, helmets turned into lights,  cutlery that looks like bike tools, menu with bike names and a large Harley for selfies make it a destination cafe. The menu consists of a range of items which can be divided into normal cafe food amd the mains section. A special mention for their fully loaded nachos, mushrooms sauted in wine, chicken wings with BBQ sauce, speciality omelettes and their soft pancakes with berries. There's lots of space inside - a separate hookah unit, space to play foosball and enough space for a musical gig. So did the cafe make a non biker like me feel like a biker? Yes, indeed!

The coffee was great. I really liked the decor - very "homely", with a lot of wood everywhere. The little cookie they gave with it was a nice touch :)
Just one thing - when I walked in, some old music (Be With You by Mr. Big, from 1992, subsequently followed by Humpin Around by Bobby Brown - I hadn't heard that song in at least 15 years!!) was playing, and the sound sounded "muffled" - no idea why. Guys, please look into getting BC Jukebox for your cafe, a website/app that lets people request songs from their cellphone. Here's the URL: bcjukebox.in . Cheers! :)

My first experience was absolutely fantastic. They serve and treat the customers very well. Hookah over here is perfect. Food is equally awesome.
Burgers
American Breakfast are superb.
They open at seven o'clock in the morning and serve breakfast and great food. From 12 o'clock the hookah parlour opens and provides the best Flavoured Hookah's.

I always order Sex in the beach. I definitely recommend this place to everyone.

Just open a mini bar please. Atheist Beers.

Jyoti was my server first time and he became a good friend and I miss him.

The best cafe in Elgin Road area. Food is awesome. In fact I have been there today for lunch. Few things I would like add today. 1. Staffs who took the order and served the food was very nice. 2. Food was very tasty as expected 3. The person who got the check to me was highly rude and snob (cannot tell the name as I don‚Äôt know) 5.  After introduction of GST I have paid extra 6% of service charge apart from GST today in Bikers Cafe which is not at all acceptable ( if it is optional then they should have asked me before charging)

The ambience is fantastic, it gives a feel of an all American Bikers den with the wooden decor and biking paraphernalia thrown all over the cafe. At the entrance there is even a display bike....perfect for photo ops and of course we availed of this opportunity. They even have games tables such as a foosball table and even air hockey table. Great idea. The have a separate section for the hookah...and thank goodness for that,  we don't gave to tolerate the smell ( I don't like it...to each his own..)
The food is good with a variety to choose from but it is really very much expensive. They do have a variety and one can choose between pastas, pizzas,sizzlers etc. They also have some prepared and complete meals, one of which was availed by a friend albeit the non veg one, and liked.( I wouldn't know about that!!)
The items that I had were all good, loved the potato potholes ( a jacket potato preparation with cheese and dips). The Pizza too was good as was the Mezze platter. The drinks were served in the current trendy style and were excellently prepared.

Biker's cafe was always in my wishlist,finally had a chance of going here today with my friends. I went to celebrate my belated birthday there. My friends had brought a cake for me and while I was cutting the cake,the cafe played a birthday song. I loved this gesture and thank you so much for making it more special. 
I loved the decor. The food was equally good. We had ordered sizzlers and two pizzas ,one veg and one non veg. We had a great time out there playing the games. The service was nice and people were very friendly.

If you're the kind that loves bikes AND good food,then bikers cafe is your destination. 
The interiors feel straight out of the movies where the cool biker gang would stop for refreshment. 
The food is pretty good. We opted for a dijon chicken pizza, chicken pasta,sandwiches and chips,chipotle chicken sizzler and classic caeser salad. The virgin mohito and ginger ale came in cute containers with straw!
There's foosball and icehockey to play while you wait for the food. This is a place you should visit with your friends in a large group to be able to enjoy completely.
Aaaaaand, the harley! *_*
It's beautiful! Being able to sit on it for even that little time makes it all worth it. 
Although Bikers Cafe is a bit on the costlier side,I'd ask everyone to visit it once. More than the food,it's an experience. 
The games, the bike,the food..how many more reasons do I need to cite before you're finally convinced? :p
Go. Have fun. Soak in the ambience. 
Bikers is an experience,a feeling that needs to be felt in person! 
Highly recommended. :)

I've visited this cafe several times and they just keep getting better and better!
From spacious seating arrangement to sassy interior to fun indoor games to isolated hookah section to coffee to food items, this place has it all. They sure know how to be in sync with their theme-just check out the cutlery!
Be it Irish coffee or mocha or fish fingers or a simple spaghetti aglio oglio, the quality of the food is well-maintained.
I'll be headed for their breakfast items soon!

On a lazy Saturday afternoon me and a couple of friends ended up at this bike theme American diner kinda of a place in Elgin road. The mere entry was captivating what with its old style macho bike greeting you at the elevators. The ambience is cosy and very gossip-friendly. The seating comfortable and and spacious. The waiters are well mannered and eager to help.¬†

The menu is exhaustive. We had ordered for cold coffees which arrived in smoky wooden platters inside bulb-shaped glasses. The chicken satay was an indianised version of the popular thai dish with diluted peanut butter sauce. The chicken wings were well done but could have been better if BBQ sauce was used. The prawns chilly were coated with honey and some sweet sauce and was quite run of the mill.

A must visit for food lovers....

I'm a fan of Bikers' Cafes in general - and on that count this experience wasn't the best I've had. They've set the place up beautifully - you're happy the instant you enter. The food however, is just about above average. Tried their Pancakes, Omelette, and French Toast - and their breakfast menu seemed fairly average in general. The detox drinks are a good try though.¬†
Not the best place in case you're looking for the taste in the food as No. 1 priority.

For a vegetarian eating breakfast here it is a 3 . I know this is harsh. The non vegetarians loved their thai and middle eastern omelette(devoured actually) .But this vegetarian was left disappointed. The detox drinks are excellent. Be it free flow, muscle brainiac  .. You get what u order!! Great for weight watchers. I ordered mushroom on toast and the cheela.   The mushroom on toast lacked flavour and required additional seasoning while the cheela was passable. The chutney with the cheela was tangy and the best part of the dish. 
Need to make one more visit to this place to give it another chance, but will definitely avoid this for breakfast.

This place is crazy. Boy was I surprised to see their interior decoration. This definitely is a place for the bikers. Well to move on, I would definitely recommend the Biker's Strawberry Lemonade Freeze. The Non veg Mezze platter tasted dope too. Go with a date or hangout with your friends, this place is just perfect for those little escapes from your hectic life. Hoping to visit again soon.

A really nice place to hangout with friends. Refreshing ambience. Good food.
Had ordered Nachos, Meatballs & Spaghetti, Cold Coffee, Oreo Shake and a Pasta (can't recall the exact name). Meatballs weren't as good. Oreo Shake is a must try.

Overall, it's a cool place to chill. But don't expect extraordinary food.

Having lived on Delhi for two years and hearing so much about this place made me finally visit it in Kolkata. My friends and I went for dinner to the bikers cafe, the ambience reminded me of chili's and the Irish house somewhat and there was a live band playing which was a refreshing change from the rest of the cafes. We ordered Cajun fried chicken, knucklehead peri peri chicken burger, Portuguese chicken in mash and a Mexican chicken sizzler. The food is very good with the right balance of flavours. The service is amiable and quick too. Overall its a nice joint to spend time in.

We went there for an early morning breakfast and the place surely didn't disappoint. All the dishes we ordered were up to mark. We gorged on Pizza Omelette, French Toast, English Breakfast and some desi dishes like Samosa Kachori and Matar Kulcha. I would definitely recommend the place for all seeking a nice breakfast. A small improvement I would suggest would be maintaining their Foosball and  Air Hockey tables in better condition.

The first thing that would strike you is the wide range of wide range of Bikes showcased in form of miniatures..... Polished Biker hangout space..... the only thing lacking is the leather jackets, dim lighting, and some Macho beefed up Bikers walking around... Hookah available... But the highlight is the kind of things offered...The cutleries are something to look out for... especially the healthy drinks offered as part of rejuvenators... Lip smacking food... Variety of Vegetarian options available along with the wide range of food items... The music is great... have not been to the place while a live band has played.. would love to experience that surely.... The service a bit slow but the place is so great that they have built in games to keep you occupied till u wait for your food... the pricing is mediocre and does not feel like a burden on ur pocket... the only dash missing is the alcohol... Thumbs up to the concept....

My group consisted of 7 people including me and on a fine Sunday evening, we went to this cafe. Situated in Elgins road, when we entered, we were amused by this big bike near the gate. Now I would like to discuss in details what I like and what I dont like about this cafe.

SO, WHAT DO I LIKE ABOUT THIS CAFE?
- I would give high marks on the decoration of this cafe. It's just absolutively beautiful and serene.üñí
- The food tastes is just good. Being a culinary student myself and keeping in mind that this is a cafe and not a high end restaurant itself, I would say, according to a cafe standard, the food meets it's expecting. As well as the drinks too. Kudos to the chefs on line! üñí
- The location is very easy to find so we did not have any trouble locating it. You can see a big board of its name outside the building.üñí
- The hookah flavor is good. We ordered Brain freezer rose. Would like to have it again.üñí
- Cute cutleries. I dig it.üñí

NOW, WHAT IS IT THAT I DONT LIKE ABOUT IT? 
- The servers are rude! Plain rude! They don't even say thank you, they don't even smile! They had a bad day that they don't greet and smile us? I thought courtesy is a must in any hospitality! üñì
- At one point, the hookah was choking us badly so we asked one of the servers to fix it. He said okay. After 5mins, i asked again. He said the person is coming to fix it. I gave up and just smoked it until it fixed itself. Then he came and asked, is it okay now? Nice job on doing nothing.üñì
- The place offers wifi and my friends wanted to use the wifi. I understand the policy of not giving out the wifi password however, they asked my friend for her phone in a "give it to me" sentence and came back after 10mins. Slow service is slow!üñì
- How much tax do you cut? The total bill was around rs 4100, and after tax it became rs 5550. So, the service charges is 10%. The service tax is 6%. VAT is 14.5%. So the total tax is 30.5% of the total bill. Dont you think that it's a bit too much? The tax itself came up to rs1400+ which is a whopping amount. üñì

End result:
Would I ever come back here again? Probably not. Would I recommend it to other people? Probably not. 

Thank you so much.

Loved everything about this place. Was in my wish list for a long time and I finally made it! Located at a walking distance from Forum Mall main entrance. There is a huge bike at the entrance which gives you a very good photo opportunity. The ambience inside is cool. The hookah section is separate and hence you can take your kids along. The board games on offer along with ice hockey, etc will keep them occupied. And this is not just about ambience, the food on offer is also amazing. Right from Coffee to mocktails and the chocolate waffles was just Yum! Pricing is also fine. This is definitely one of the best cafes in kolkata! Must visit!

This restaurant is located in the 1st floor of the Platinum Mall in Elgin Road adjacent to Elgin Road's Post Office.
As you enter the place you see a cruiser bike which is there for you to take pics with. The place has a separate bay for hookah. I went with a couple of my friends and was not interested in hookah so sat in the open space where they have foosball and air hockey boards. The ambiance is quite cool and decked up with bike stuffs - e.g the lamps are headlights of a bike.

Now coming to the food we ordered...

Cappuccino
Virgin Mojito
Portuguese Road King - Piri Piri grilled chicken served with grilled vegetables, mashed potatoes and roasted garlic bread
Thai Red Curry - Vegetables in medium spicy red curry served with steamed rice and we opted for chicken.
Cajun Chicken Tenders - Cajun spiced breaded chicken served with orange and chilli dip.

All the foods were quite tasty and well cooked...only one of the dip had hair in it and once informing the staffs they were quite apologetic about it and immediately changed the dip, so its fine.

Looking forward to some more visits.

There has been a lot of hype about this place and I don't think my review would do much justice to the place as I only had one burger to judge it by.
The ambiance created is definitely that of a badass biker cafe,but I cant buy it being badass biker without any alcohol,should have atleast had beer.
Service was good and courteous.

Food:-

Banana & Peanut Butter Shake : it tastes good although I wasn't happy about that it was room temperature when I expected it to be chilled

Peri Peri Chicken Burger - good portion with a side of fries and coleslaw. It went well with the mustard ketchup but I did not find anything peri peri about it as I sailed through the burger without any hint of spice. The caramelised onion jam were nice,wished they had put in a bit more and also some picked gherkins. It was there but miniscule size.

The food was average. We had ordered ratatouille, chicken satay and two other items. Ambience is good and the view is really nice. They should really have to improve their service.

I was planning on visiting Bikers cafe for a long time, due to the high ratings on Zomato and the overall hype generated about the place. Went on a weekend for brunch and it didn't disappoint me ! 
The best part about the place to me was the decor. They have managed to decorate the place exceptionally well with the theme of bikes. There is a bike at the entrance itself, followed by showpieces. Once u enter the place, the walls are covered in posters, merchandise, frames, fairings , exhaust pipes and what not. Even the cutlery is customised. I'd give a 5/5 to the decor and ambience. 
Theyve got air hockey, fusball, board games, and a very smooth PlayStation also, which adds to the fun quotient of the place.
Now coming to the food, the portions seemed insufficient, and on comparison to the prices, it didn't feel worth it. The food was tasty yes, but it seemed overpriced.
Arabic Eggzee - it's an egg preparation, which a lot of onion, tomato n bell pepper, and also some cheese on top. I didn't feel anything Arabic about it, except maybe the pita bread n hummus served alongside. It was tasty, but not filling. 
The hangover downshifter - Basically one piece of bread , with the insides cut out, and with 2 poached eggs inside. Along with that, they serve a salad, which couldve been a bit more heavy. 
Aloo pyaazparatha - this item was unplanned. My friend n myself had the egg items and it wasn't much filling, that we had to order this. The paratas were thin, sliced into 4 pieces. The taste was decent enough. 
We had a house special cold coffee, a dark lord and a caramel desire, all if which were just average. The coffee should be thicker, failing which there is no point in having it !

Based on the taste alone, I wouldn't have given above 4/5. But the decor , the games and the overall feel of the place is unmatched.

Suggestion : Guys, work on the food items, the quantity , and especially the beverages. If it works out, there'll be no competition.

As the name suggests, this cafe is all about motorcycles, riders and of course lip smacking foods. Visited this joint a couple of weeks back and was really happy with the ambience, feel and courtesies staffs. We went for chocolate shakes, chicken twisters and banana pan cake. Each of the items tasted awesome and was also pocket friendly. They also have a separate hukah section. Must try for peoples who crave for lively ambience and good foods.

If you are looking for a place for a decent breakfast in kolkata then this is the place to visit. Just 5minutes from Forum Mall this place has an amazing entrance with a bike right beside the lift. The ambience is tooo good. I had come here for an early morning breakfast and to my surprise they were also serving hookah. I was extremely delighted and ordered for a hookah. The hookah was very good and so were its flavours. Guys u must try this which I guess is available only at this place and dats have hookah with cutting chai on their menu. This is a totally new thing and ull love it. The menu has a wide variety of items both veg and nonveg with both english and desi breakfast. The staff was friendly and the service was good too. Amazing place a bit expensive but a must visit!! And if you like my reviews and want to know more about places then do follow me. Cheers to this place!

a week ago we headed for this cafe after having heard about it from our relatives and friends., The theme of the cafe is a bike, with a real bike parked at the entrance. it had become a selfie zone of sort with each visitor taking a picture of the bike.
coming to the food... in one word "awesome". most of the dishes that were ordered met our expectation. the starter were nice, the main course excellent and coolers were marvelous.
the servers were patient and suggested their specialities.
the food is reasonable with a meal for two pinching you by a grand.
P.S. : special deals are available on Dineout apps.
enjoy your meal.

A lil bit on the overpriced side, but the ambience makes up for it. Great staff, extraordinary menu and the live band makes it near perfect. I'd say they can improve their pancakes, as they get real soggy even during service. The American breakfast platter was beyond great.

I have been visiting this place since it's establishment, when they didn't serve Hookah. Been a regular since then. 
I had first visited Bikers Cafe Gurgaon, was really impressed with the food, beverages and interiors. 
Was really happy to see they same Brand opening its outlet in Kolkata. 
Location: It is located in the Bhawanipur opposite Forum Mall. 
Interior: One of the best I have seen in Kolkata. A lovely bike is one of their Attractions. A calm and lovely ambience with a really nice crowd. 
Food: I have tried Most of their Non Veg and Veg Options a really nice menu shows the knowledge of the Chef, which you expect from such a brand. Their Eggs are really nice. Special mention to their Soups and Salads, most of them are well made. 
My personal favorite in Non Veg Starter is Chicken Wings and Cajun Chicken in veg I usually prefer Nachos and Potato Potholes. The Pizzas and Burgers our a must try. 
Beverages: Have tried their Berry Land Sugarcane mojito kiwi all are really nice with perfect balance of flavors. 
Shisha: Quite Smokey and usually they don't make it wrong, but I personally avoid shisha here. 
Service: Superb service staff well trained and groomed. Service has never been a problem here. 
Conclusion: 
Food & beverages: 4.5
Interiors & Ambience: 4.25
Shisha: 3.5
Service: 4
Will surely be a regular to this place, it hasn't ever disappointed me.

Yesterday I went to the bikers and I felt that this place has become the most unprofessional crap you will ever see. They have almost 15 waiters and most of them are not working compared to the 10 customers at a time. But still nobody are willing to work. I felt like slowly this place is becoming some non courteous overpriced bullshit of Kolkata!







Review of Two months ago-
No questions about their so cool bikes and the hitch hiking ethics around cafe. It's definitely a bomb and fab! 
Coming to the food, I'm dissapointed that bikers don't eat Bacon for which they don't have Bacon or Beef burger. Both starts with B so as the Bikers cafe. It's kind of unjustified to the bikers as well :(

I've ordered one Pink of health which is a watermelon juice along with some rock salt, didn't like it.
The Lamb burger I had was okay but I was expecting something huge.

Firstly the place is very easy to locate , just some footsteps away from Forum Mall elgin road.

The ambience and seatings are very cool with some comforting musics. They added some rustic look to the place and the serving people as well. All bike parts are there all around you which added some special effect to the place.

Have ordered a chicken sizzler and a cowboy pizza. The quality is really good with some different mouth watering flavours. Amount of bill is totally worth it. A very nicely organised place to hang out at. Rided well !

I went with one of my friend with a lot of expectations as I had heard a lot about it.We ordered gourmet vegetarian pizza.Unfortunately it disappointed us.The pizza was tasteless , seemed there had been no addition of salt in the whole process.The service was poor.We had to wait 15mins for the waiter to come n take our order n another 20mins for the pizza to come.But it was hot n looked yummy.We also took hookah which was OK, nothing great.

Nice ambience and quick service. Had waffles here earlier but today as per recommendation from the server ordered for chefs special mango waffle. Was totally disappointed. Not worth what you pay.

Sunday brunch at Bikers- I was looking for a breakfast place where one can really chill with friends and we zeroed in on Bikers. The place has a fun vibe with to it and is dotted with quirky bike things and posters. It also has a foosball table and an air hockey table!  We started with the Ironhead Burger and the Shovelhead burger. These burgers are a MUST TRY- Huge in size and really tasty! Also, loved the Veg benedict, which is their speciality. They have an interesting juice menu and we went for a low calorie booster which was a nice fusion of watermelon and cucumber. Their oreo shake has a fun twist with coffee flavour added to it! On the waiter's suggestion, we ordered matar kulcha, and I must say that the kulchas were fluffy and very light. Now all of this was happening over a full fledged game of Monopoly (they have quite a few board games) and we almost ended up spending 4 hours here! So the breakfast menu was replaced by the lunch menu off which we just ordered a Mediterranean Pizza since we were already stuffed. The pizza was a delight- thin crust and loaded!  The live music (great choice of songs and very well performed! ) along with the tasty food and monopoly made my Sunday Brunch perfect! :)

A biker's paradise, through and through, The Bikers Cafe is decorated with a bike, fun posters, iron chairs, etc. against the glass walls that light up the place. There's an American feel to the restaurant, with country and soft rock playing in the background to set the mood. The servers in black outfits and bandanas just add to the mood. The place is loaded with everything from a guitar to a foosball table to a TV screen, which makes it just perfect to hang out with friends, and have fun. I ordered a Cajun chicken, a non veg lasagne and lamb steak to go, and had a virgin coconut mojito while I waited for the food to arrive. The mojito was refreshing and new, with pieces of fresh coconut blending perfectly with the mint. Most restaurants add a mint syrup which gives a very strong flavour to the drink. But this was all natural, and perfectly balanced. As for the food, there's almost nothing to complain about, the Cajun chicken was slightly dry, but it was crispy and tasty, nonetheless, and the condiments that came with it, i.e. bbq sauce, mayo sauce and sweet chilli sauce, went teamed well. The lasagne had a strong cheesy flavour which might take time getting used to for someone who is not used to the flavour.  But for a cheese lover like me, it was delicious. The tomato sauce layer was not too tomato-y or tangy or sweet, and that was a huge plus for me; it's hard to find a dish with a tomato base that isn't too sweet or tangy. The corners and edges were golden and almost crispy - just heavenly! Beneath the golden cheesy top were layers of softness. The only downside was, it was a little too oily. The quantity was quite good. The lamb steak didn't have a very strong lamb smell, and I say that in a good way. The Jack Daniels Bbq sauce was deliciously flavourful. It had a slightly crispy outside,and was perfectly cooked, and not chewy at all - what a lovely texture! When the steward came to know that this was all for take away, he asked how long I would drive before the steak would be served, so that he could ask the chef to cook it just enough for the meat to not feel tough or overcooked. And, it seemed that the chef knew when to stop. The service was fast and the people were well-behaved and patient. Altogether, a great experience, and I can't wait to return soon, hopefully on a more happening occasion.

Have been there quite some time ago. The ambiance is quite good and the decor is kinda good too. With it being at one of the busiest places in the city, the Elgin Rd., the location is really good too! Other than that the food was decent, had garlic bread and pastas nothing much. Very eatable. Will visit again soon, and update the review!

Awesome food and drinks... biker's themed cafe.. with games and hookah bar creates a totally different ambience. Best place to hop in with friends.

Different ambience gives a feeling as if I'm sitting in some cowboy type cafe . Food was good . Had ordered Spanish omelette and coffee my friend ordered some chicken sandwich in mustard sauce along with brownie milk shake. I personally did not like d sandwich but the omelette was really good. I felt it was bit overpriced but if I compare with Flurys I get the same food here and is comparatively cheaper than Flurys . Must try for breakfast .

A "cool" place to hangout with friends. A very bike's garage type of interiors. Had tried the burgers and waffles once. The burger was well made and the fries were crunchy. The waffles were light and fluffy and were a treat to eat with the maple syrup. Also had the veg gourmet pizza. Thin crust, good toppings, cooked well. So thumbs up all the way. Can't wait to try the other things on the menu as well.

It was really a great experience today at the bikers cafe. Just a few steps from the forum mall. A wonderful place for the bikers .. They will literally love it and also for the non bikers who would like the theme a lot. It's a truly thematic cafe and when they say it they are thematic they actually mean it. It shows from the decor, the service , the dress code of the service personnel, and even the cutleries. I took a "Real sex on the beach" hookah with watermelon base. Bikers special strawberry Mocktail, Cajun chicken tenders, and barbecue chicken wings. The food quality was simply great. But the only thing is that they took too long to serve the food which disappointed me a bit but the food quality nullified the effect. You must pay a visit here. And the most interesting thing is that they put an effort to the presentation of all the items they sell and I personally think it's really important.

Bikers of the town should be here! Bike lovers heaven in true sense, plus the good ambience and creative displays. If you want to just chill with a hookah some good food and mocktails then this is the place to be. 
This place is in elgin just few mins walk from forum mall, beside aqua java. They have a different hookah zone, and amazing hookahs on menu. We tried girls night out with watermelon base and literally there it was with an watermelon as a base. The mocktail ( forgot the name) was amazing, served on a base of liquid nitrogen. In food we had cajun fried tender chicken with three dips, chicken wings tossed in barbeque sauce. Both were nice, i would recommend the wings more though. Need to try out more food at this cafe, they have some amazing dishes. The only thing keeping me from giving it a five star is their slow service. They took 5minutes to just change the coal of hookah, though at that time crowd was not much. If you have enough time then its ideal place, you can also a play a round of air karrom and few other games in between your orders. 
Would visit it soon for some more tasty food, but this time on an off day!

Doesn't have much options, specially for vegan.
Ambiance is cool, not completely a "bikers" cafe but yes bikers themed cafe.
Service is satisfactory.
Food is ok considering as vegan didn't have much option.
more than food, its a place to chill out with friends, have hookah, mocktails, play few games.

It had been on the checklist for quite some time and finally had a chance to go this amazing place. An enchanting place and a must visit for every biking addict in the city. This place serves mocktails and has a provision for detox drinks as well. Also a food menu that is quite elaborate and add to that hookah. You ask for and this place has it all.
We ordered the Brain Freezer Lemonade Hookah and Caramel Desire from the coffee. I should add that the hookah was just perfect. It's been ages since I've tasted such great hookah. 
The food was absolutely fantastic. Be it the Cajun Chicken Tenders or Fish in Butter Lemon Garlic Sauce. It was absolutely lip-smacking. Looking forward to go back to the same place and indulge myself in the other great dishes.

I ordered a coffee choco rose latte...omg!! This was the best in the evening... I simply loved it...
Mixed sauce pasta with veggies- this was good too. Regular. A little on the dry side.
Italian sizzler-this one was good, the pasta was tasty with arabbiata sauce and also the sauteed veggies..
Babycorn-was good too regular not spicy..

Hookah served here is really smooth ..

A blissful place and a must visit for every biking addict in the city. Its situated right on Elgin road a few blocks before The Forum Mall. It had been on the checklist for quite some time and finally we had a chance to go this amazing place.

I had gone there with my childhood bestie and my fiance and fell in love with the ambience instantly.

The place is huge with a bike parked right at the entrance.
It has a bar and mocktails. Also a food menu that is quite elaborate and add to that hookah. It doesnt really get better.

We ordered the Gum Supari hookah and Ginger Ale along withy fiance's favourite Spaghetti Aglio Olio and it was the best Aglio Olio she ever had. The reason i believe her is because she has almost had the same pasta all over the city.

The food was awesome, the gingerale was unexpected but lovely nevertheless and the hookah was great.
The staff was really friwndly and courteous and one could find a great ambience all around. The pricing isn't very expensive as well too.
Will be back again for more awesome memories.

Loaded with expectations, landed up here for breakfast with my dada n boudi. As soon as you enter the restaurant, something hits you.. that is none other than the smell of hookah! Yes this is a no booze, hookah place for bikers. Don't ask me how that works!
The decor at this joint is kinda cool and smartly done. Check out the cutlery they have. My rating is majorly due to this.
The food spread is impressive.. Egg centric breakfast from different parts of the world.. English (of course), American, Mexican, Spanish, Arabic, French, Thai, Japanese and so on. This adds to my rating too!!
And then comes the food.. presentation is excellent! Check out the photos of egg Benedict and coffee. Rating goes up further.
Drooling I take the first bite.. My mind wants to say wow.. But my taste buds are holding on. A second bite i thought.. Still nothing. Something's lacking in the taste. Hollandaise sauce was watery, baked beans was replaced with sweet corn which was sour, not tangy. Disappointed!
Had to bring down my rating hence..

This is by far my best hangout in Kolkata. For good reason. The food is excellent, and reasonably priced (try the bikers club sandwich). The music is out of the world. Especially for 90s kids. The ambience and presentation are novel. And the staff is efficient and friendly. My favorite are Naseem and Neeraj. They are all so patient and accommodating. Definitely visit. Play games. Do the cheap and excellent hookah. Have fun. I'm sure you will.

Went on a Friday night with prior table reservation as recommended by Zomato but on reaching, felt no need for reservation. Entrance is beautified by a Royal Enfield Bike. Interiors n seating arrangements were awesome. Inside the cafe there were two section one was Hookah Section n another general section.

Live band performance outshined the cafe with top English songs. Two games were also there to play with i e., Football n ice ball game. But was not much interested.

Garlic bread with cheese was awesome
Margarita Pizza was also good n better than Mediterranean Pizza.
The Italian Sizzler was not as expected.
Burger was the the best among all that ordered.

Mocktails as Fresh lime soda n Ice tea+Lemonade was too good.

Crux :- One time visit only, service was aomewhat slow. Staff were cooperative. Pricing is too high.

The Bikers Cafe is a place to be! 
Starting with the ambience - the place has a total bikers feel to it with decor and furniture to match the concept. 
The food - the quality, taste and presentation of the food items is really good. Almost all the times that I have ordered a dish it has been tasty and worth eating. 
The service - the staff are very courteous, friendly, helpful and smiling. All qualities that add up to the eating experience.
The hookah - the hookah is decent. 

Overall - the experience is a good one and a must go for all.

Food: Better than most cafes
Ambience: Pretty good
Spread is good but stagnated over time. Please look into the same.
Hookah is average.
Real improvement is required on the drinks menu. If u want to pull people who will drop by for the sole purpose of a cuppa, then serve better drinks which are a bit less priced or same priced but more qty.
I like this place enough to visit again, thanks to combined effect of location, food, ambience and the comfort level but will refrain from taking a laglrge group over good food.

I have been to bikers cafe a few times and have enjoyed the experience every time. Off we when to bikers agin last Saturday. The place was full and we were told there would be a 15 to 20 min waiting period. We sat ourselves at the bar and placed our order. Half an hour later we were seated.¬†

- We ordered the crispy chilli Chicken and the Peri Peri Grilled chicken burger.¬†
- Both came hot and the food was delicious¬†
- Towards the end of my Chilli Chicken I came a cross a small piece of plastic. I pointed this our to the server and was I naturally quite peeved.¬†
- The manager came over and apologised and offered us a complementary dessert, he recommended the Brownie.¬†
- The bill came and I realised that I had not been charged for the chilli chicken even though I had eaten most of it, I didn't feel okay to get a complementary dessert and not pay for the chicken and when I offered to pay for at least ¬†one of them the manager came over and made it clear they would not accept the money.¬†
I wanted to write this review not to complain about the misbegotten chilli chicken but to compliment the staff of Bikers Cafe for turning around a bad customer experience and making it a super one.

Went there for a Sunday lunch. The moment we entered we were like "wow! What an ambience!".. doing full justice to its name.
Waiters dressed as bikers were very courteous!
Now, the food.. we ordered a Cajun chicken tenders for starters which had nice crispy chicken served with a superb dip. For main course we had Hungarian style grilled fish and the terminator lamb burger. The fish was the star dish.. very soothing and full of flavours and gave that "totally melting in the mouth" feeling. The burger tasted good but would've been happier if the size was a bit bigger! 
Price is on the higher side and the choices in burgers and fish dishes are very limited.
Overall a cool place to hangout with friends if your pocket is full!!

Highly dissappointed. Worst food in Kolkata. Me and my bestfriend visited this place last August for his birthday treat with high hopes. The ambience is good. Actually very good. Harley Davidson at one side, hukka zone on the other, and tables placed in the different zone, with music tracks playing in the background.You will get a biker feeling as soon as you enter here. We ordered a platter(forgot the name). It took soo long to come and then when we tasted it we felt like leaving the place at that very moment. Just HORRIBLE. I wonder if its just our bad luck or the rating is just for the ambience.

I am absolutely in love with this place! The ambience and the arrangement- both are just too good. Though I have very less knowledge about bikes and all the two-wheeled beauties, but this place made me go crazy for them. 
Coming to the main part, we ordered Dijon Chicken Pizza and it was just amazing. And we didn't have to wait for long as, they said, it was ready in just 15mins! For dessert, we had Too hot to handle which is again a super yummy delicacy. Lastly, the hospitality of the staff is worth appreciating. üëç 
To sum up, I will be back soon as I have a lot more to taste. üòä

Found this place a bit overrated. The ambience and decor is nicely put up in bikers theme. The seating is comfortable and spacious. There are board games, foosball, etc. available to be issued. The staff is prompt and hospitable.

Coming to food, we ordered a kiwi mint flavoured hookah, garlic bread, fries and strawberry milk shake. The food was NOT upto the mark. It was served mildly warm and within 5 minutes, bread turned into rubber. The hookah was decent. Overall, not very satisfying.

Very good for you if you are a regular customer. If you are not then the staff of this place are not going to entertain you. Though you come first and place order before their "REGULAR CUSTOMERS" you will not get you food before them. I have been their twice. First time I liked the place though price is unreasonably high. When I planned to revisit then I came across the concept of being treated in very bad manner if you are not coming regularly. The staff members themselves told us "WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF REGULAR CUSTOMERS AT FIRST". I would never suggest anyone to go their and get humiliated by the ill-mannered staffs of Bikers Cafe.

After a much long wait of having breakfast outside home, we finally made some time and headed to biker's cafe. As the name suggests, the decor and theme of the place is all pumped up in biker spirit. We had a neat breakfast with eggs, chicken and lots of veggies. We had ordered a 'cholesterol burster' drink made of cucumber juice mainly and it was really very refreshing. No fizz, no sweet, just fresh juice..perfect to cool down your gut and soul. In food, we had 'the thai egg-spectation' which was having omlette with some thai red sauce in it. It came with chicken skewers and thinly spliced bellpepper and carrots tossed in some hot and tangy sauce. Along with this we had 'spanish haven' which is a spanish omlette filled with baby potatoes, cucumber, onion,tomatoes, it came with a grilled tomato seasoned with herbs (may be oregano), two sausages, one hash brown (it was super soft and yummy) and¬† corn relish. This was the heaviest of both the meals. The spanish omlette was good but expected it to be a bit more fluffy than fried. The food and everything is ok but i found them a bit overpriced compared to the quality. Hope to come again to grab their other dishes.

Went for breakfast. The place is very easy to find and open sharp at 7.30AM. Nice ambience and decor. Staff was really congenial. Now the food. Had a French Benedict with salmon, The Hangover "Downshifter" and Grilled jerk chicken honey mustard sandwich. All of them were properly prepared. Top marks for the salmon. Serving time was acceptable. Irish coffee was a bit too sweet for my liking and they made mess of the Eye Opener. Overall a great place to hangout and also has live music.

I did not want to have breakfast at home on a Saturday morning, so I drove down to The Biker's Cafe. It was my second visit to the cafe and I was desperately hoping to find a parking spot right outside. Lady Luck smiled up on me.
The motorbike theme is very evident in the decor. The big and burly Harley at the reception makes quite an impression. We were promptly seated and I had already begun to enjoy the morning vibes with some old school American rock and roll and country music they were playing. We ordered for The Arabic Egg-zze, French Benedict with salmon, some extra bacon on the sides, a cappuccino and an Americano. The Arabic Egg-zze arrived in about twenty minutes whereas I had to wait almost half an hour for my eggs benedict. The Arabic omelets were a bit overcooked for my liking but if had with the feta and tomato sauce they tasted rather well. The pita and the hummus were nice and fresh, I liked it. The French Benedict was simply delectable. The hollandaise sauce was perfect with the balance of creaminess, a slight tart and a slightly acidity. The eggs too were perfectly poached, just the way I like them, the gooey yolk running off when I cut in to the eggs. The smoked salmon stuffing brought the fishy and smoky flavours.Overall a brilliant dish. My only complain is that they were served on a freshly toasted sesame bun. I would have preferred the English muffins on any given day. 
The service was efficient and courteous. I didn't find it too expensive either. I'll definitely return again some day but I sure hope they do something about the car parking.

Was on the list for a long time, yesterday finally decided to pay a visit. Very easy to locate this place ,near to forum. I enjoyed every bit of this place apart from the food, the live music, the wooden decor, the atmosphere, For me the food was mediocre but again to reiterate this a cool enough place to hang out for long hours with your friends. ¬†I would even like a bar to this place, this would change the whole dimension

Had so much fun here! Went with my foodie friend! And as I'm not so fond of hookah, I loved how they had a separate room for it.
We ordered one 'Italian Sizzler'! And it was sooo yumm! Spaghetti pasta, vegetables and cheese covered potato!
And then one beforehand recommended 'Special Berry Compote' and it was the best I've had! Strawberry jam, almonds, cashew nuts and ice cream! Heaven in the mouth. Highly recommended.
And for drinks we ordered 'Passion fruit Mojito' and 'House special cold coffee'. Both were pretty good!
Taste/quality -4/5
Ambience - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
It pinched us 1300/-. Which I think was a little pricey! But considering the quality and if you an explorer and wanna go to every place just for once, I think its totally worth it.

The Biker's caf√© located in the platinum mall, at Elgin road, had been featuring in my crave list for a very long period of time!

I dropped in here with a friend, and was completely  bowled over with the fabulously designed  interior. The music was very much in sync  with the ambience, and the  posters bore that clich√©d  'biker' feel.

The staff members were cordial  and the services were prompt.

Firstly,we ordered for knuckle head peri peri grilled chicken  burger and two mock tails, namely Biker's strawberry  lemonade freeze  and watermelon summer splash. The burger was just perfect! It was served along with a mayonnaise  dip and french fries and both were equally satiating. Coming to the mock tails, watermelon  summer splash tasted average whereas Biker's strawberry lemonade  freeze was a treat to the eyes as well as the taste buds! I strongly  recommend this mocktail to the people who are yet to visit Biker's. 

Next we ordered Mexican Chipotle chicken sizzler. This dish, has the intricacy  of a sizzler accompanied with the strong aroma of Mexican  herbs and spices. We really  enjoyed it.

To square  up, we ordered a dessert named as 'Too Hot To Handle'. It was basically brownie in chocolate  sauce topped with a generous  scoop of vanilla ice cream in a sizzler platter. Honestly speaking, the dessert just stole the show! A must have I say!

Summing it up, I must say that Biker's cafe is a place a foodie must pay a visit to.

We visited this place on a weekday morning at 9 am! 
Location: Platinum Mall, opp. Shambhunath Pandit Hospital, 2 min after Forum Mall @ Elgin Road (on the same stretch)
Ambience: Complete wooden interiors, with a grunge feel: the first words that come to your mind when you enter this 1st floor place are "biker chic", " barrels", "beer in a tower" etc. It's as authentic as an authentic biker bar would be abroad! The seating is unpretentious, comfortable and the tables are wide, simple and classy
Food: We ordered 1 scrambled egg on toast, 1 baked beans on toast, a juice concoction called Cholesterol Buster and butter milk pancakes. The scrambled eggs were juicy with thick consistency, while the bread was nicely toasted. The baked beans tasted Indian for some reason  but was yum, hence I didn't care much for the authenticity. The presentation was excellent too. There were 3 pancakes with maple syrup which we absolutely loved and couldn't even finish eating. The pancakes were garnished with cinnamon powder and were fluffy, thick and moist. I loved the juice (cucumber, honey, coriander) and was absolutely refreshing! Overall pocket pinch 830 INR for 2 people. Good service, great food, great ambience! Will go back very soon for the other fare! Impressive place.

The pizza, spaghetti and sizzlers are must haves and it would be a sin to not have the Oreo Shake. 
The breakfast I hear is great too, shall try it out soon!

After a long time, went out and where else but Here.. Cos I had heard great reviews about this place..

Location & Ambience:
Prime location-very near to forum, 1st floor of platinum mall. The place is visually pleasing, huge space and very clean. It has a different section for hookah. Having huge glass walls lights up the place. The concept Of Bikers is to the point, you are met with an amazing bike at the entrance. Set up with bike related posters and frames And bike parts, perfect for bike lovers. The interior has a countryside concept, overseas great!!

Reached as Hungry as one could beüòã and thankfully the order was brought pretty quick.
QUICK SERVICE!! The waiter was well mannered, took care of what we wanted exactly. Very politely he asked about the quality and satisfaction of the food.

Ordered:
Bread toast along with Mushrooms sauted- crisp Breads and the mushroom was fresh, and not very spicy for a breakfast item
Mango waffle- perfectly crispy and soft where required topped with mango chunks along with chocolate sauce and mango marmalade.
Aloo Pyaaz Parantha-Veggies have few options so landed with this. Tasted Not very great, served with green chutney curd and pickle.
Watermelon cooler- seemed had a little extra water added to it, a little disappointing üòí
Hot Chocolate-ah my favorite, again not very appealing !!

Overall fine but there's scope of improvement on the food front. Great work guys, keep it up!!

This was a sudden and unexpected visit. We had planned to go somewhere else, found that place closed although saying open on Zomato and landed up here, this being located nearby.
The Bikers Cafe has grown up to be a very popular joint in the area known to serve really good breakfast and burgers. We had come here for lunch. The place is easy to locate, beside the Elgin Road post office.
It's a huge building with glass walls creating a lighted up spacious ambience to enjoy a cosy meal. We snuggled up in a corner. I wasn't ready to come here, so couldn't do my research before on what to order. Hence everything we ordered was impromptu. The seating arrangements for two was okay, the table having insufficient space, so they got us shifted to a larger table for four. I think the chairs too could have been a bit more cosy and comfortable.
The place is decorated with everything a bike freak would love, like my friend. There was a huge bike installed at the entrance, posters put up on walls of vintage bikes and also founders of many of those companies. There were installations of parts of bikes at the hookah parlour and also in the main area. My friend loved this place and its ambience absolutely.
We ordered food. Yes. That was my area of interest. It was pretty good. The staffs were courteous and helpful. They suggested us to order the Knuckleberg Peri Peri Chicken Burger. The burger patty was too hot, pretty different from the ones that I have tried before. They served fries in shot glasses. I liked this concept but the portion was pretty less. Next came the All American Bacon and Eggs. It's basically an English breakfast platter. There were two toasts, butter, marmalade, baked beans, a hash brown, two grilled sausages, bacon strips and a fried egg. A classic, my absolute all time favourite, I loved it from first to last. They told us that this would be enough for two adults' lunch. Trust me, it wasn't. Hence we went for another platter - Hungarian Grilled Fish. Pure Kolkata Bheckti braised in lemon butter sauce, served with mashes and veggies, this was yummy. Too good. And the bill was much less than other places of its kind.
The Bikers Cafe is a nice place to hang out with friends or family. My friend is surely gonna bring me here again for the ambience and I am coming back here for food very soon! Hey, what are you waiting for? You gotta try this place. It's worth it. Definitely recommended! Happy Dining! :)

After a long hiatus,  I am writing a review. This time for The Biker's Cafe. I had a wish of visiting this foe a long time. It's a nice place with good ambience and decor .There are indoor games eg Foosball,  free WiFi and helpful employees to help us with our orders. We ordered Veg Lasagne,  Italian Chicken Saltimboca which is Stuffed chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes And Fish Kapila. I personally recommend the lasagna and the fish preparation.  In the deserts, we had muddy on a sundae which is brownie with Ice cream and Special Berry Compote which is Waffles topped with berries and chocolate sauce. 
Overall the food was very good  but a bit costly.

A nice experience visiting a biker themed cafe. We tried sandwiches as we were looking for some quick bite after a full day of shopping. The sandwiches were finger licking and the cold coffee was amazing. Happy with the food we got but really upset with the service. The service was very very poor. We had to literally tell them 3 times to get the cheque before they got it.
Must Have : Cold coffee

Not recommend for vegetarians. Matter of fact there are no restaurants that really cater to veggies (keepin pure veg restaurant out). The Mexican veggie sizzler was not great. The ambience was good. The only high point was the burger which was delicious so a 3 rating else 2

Now coming to food, the full throttle breakfast platter and their paranthas are worth eating. Special mention about the Spanish omelette. This is a must try for egg and sausage lovers. 
Lastly as the name suggests, the theme and decorations of the place is quiet good! And to people like me it's amazing.

Location :

Located at the 5 mins walking distance from Brand Factory outlet.. Situated at the 2nd Floor of Platinum Mall.

Ambiance and Deco:

Decorated with Bikes spares and parts. Ambiance kinda American bar type.. Feels great..All servers wearing Jeans and scarfs look alike bikers. 

Drinks:
I had Orange Surprise which was really a surprise because it looks like a ice tea, taste like very unique. 
Another one I tried watermelon splash. Very good and refreshing. It contained Watermelon juice with basil and mint leaves. 

Food:
Ordered Spicy Cowboy pizza and Caeser salad.
Salad was okeish type but pizza was excellent. Crust was thin but well baked...

Last we order Bikers Club sandwich which was their signature item.
Waited for 20 mins then they gave the sandwich. After having one bite I must say it's worth the wait. The bacon, chicken, egg with cheese sauce was perfect in the sandwich. Really great.

After numerous failed plans finally landed up on a Saturday noon. 
The chasis of a HD welcomes you to the cafe. I loved the fact that they had a separate section for people who will opt for hookah and the other section. 
The juices provided much needed relief from the scorching heat outside. 
It was followed by chicken skewers and spaghetti in alio olio. Both met expectations. 
The view of lee road from the made me fall in love with my love kolkata again. 
Would love to come back.

This place was on my bucket list solely because I received lovely feed backs about it from my friends. Did it live up to it all? Kind of. To begin with, as you enter you shall notice the model of a bike placed right at the entrance where you can take pictures. The cafe lives up to its name 'Bikers', thumbs up to whoever came up with this witty theme. Oh and TV and Foosball, what could be better! The space is large with a separate hookah section and the interiors are classy. The food? I have had baby corn from a lot of eateries but the one served here has a different taste altogether. Delicious is the word! So was the pasta in Alfredo sauce and the Jacket potatoes. The service was okay-ish, the waiters are not well groomed I must say. But overall the dining was satisfying. The standard pocket pinch for 2 people is 1k approx. Shall come here again to try some more dishes and would definitely expect a friendlier service the next time.

This is surely one of the most coolest places to eat in the city!I am no biker but this place made me feel like one, from the bike at the entrance to the rustic chairs and the motor cycle head lamps. Service is a top level priority here with personals constantly checking on your needs. The food is great though the pancakes we ordered were a bit disappointing but the eggs Bennedict are a must try! So if you have a bunch of friends who wants to eat at hearts content and then laugh over a play of foosball,this is where you should head! I am definitely revisiting!

Black-polos-tucked-in-jeans-and-the-band-on-forehead-guys with a decent hospitality makes you feel so "biker" with added harley-davidson-decor. My girlfriend has planned it to visit here long ago, finally we managed to visit here in april. Italian food is pretty good. Just loved the "Teen-paan-hookah"(Though I had hookah for the first time). We had cajun chicken tender which was excellent. In mezze non veg platter lamb kebabs were good but didn't like the pita that much. Ice-cream with hot brownie as good as it is always. We played foosball, we posed on a bike. It's a wonderful experience altogether.
PS: Have the healthy drinks only for health, dont expect them to pamper your tastebuds!
Anyways! Just give it a shot

The dishes were sumptuous, wide spread and we'll served. Must appreciate the use of hammer to dispense napkins! Ruggedly fashioned staff made it even more befitting to its name. Pocket pinch was 800 per person with over ordering. Two main dish is enough for 3. The joint badly needs a bar. Love to return but not without a bar!

The coffee was okay, not bad, not spectacular. The pizza, could've been better if the chicken wasn't stale. Yes, the chicken on the pizza was stringy and smelled stale. Double thumbs down.  
I had mentioned that to the waiters and they had taken in the complaint politely. 
I do hope they'd serve better food in my second visit. :)

Bad Ass! That's what this place is! Everything from the bike at the entrance to the motorcycle head lamp lights is just bad ass! Live acoustic bands, opens at 7:30, bakes any kind of eggs you can dream of.. Savour eggs from various nationalities. They make a pretty swag burger too.
Get on you bike, ride down to Elgin road and treat your self to a Sunday brunch that dreams are made of!

One of the best places for hookah, the ambience too supports it..Will suggest to go in a bunch 5-6 so that u could enjoy more. The food was amazing along with quality servicing. In case u are not in a mood to wait for your order, you could play a game of foosball with your friends. And definitely one of the places to get clicked with friends as it has photogenic interior.

What an amazing place! The food, the ambiance, the service - it was all perfect. 2 of us went there for a Sunday brunch and ate much more than we had the appetite for. The eggs benedict are a must have, with the ham.  And so is the chicken chipotle stuffed omelette. This is one of the few places where I have had the perfect mashed potatoes, creamy and not too heavy. The stuffed potato skins are also delicious, the perfect amount of cheese and stuffing, not overpowering the basic flavour of the potato.
The service is amazing. People are very sweet and extremely prompt.
It's the perfect place for a lazy brunch, or even a loud dinner with friends.

It is one of the most classiest place on the elgin road. It is situated near the elgin post office opp. tyrepatty. The have a separate smoking area for hookahs. We had gone to the place in the morning hours which was still pretty occupied for breakfast services. We had ordered a wheel o chilla- besan chilla stuffed with paneer and mushrooms the dips along side where fabulous too. Next we ordered a mix sauce pasta which was quiet good. The cheese garlic bread which we ordered next was the best of the all it was crisp from outside and soft from inside with proper amount of cheese. Along these we had also got a pan flavored shisha. They also hav ps3 in the smoking area. The place is highly recommended though a bit expensive...

A cool addition among the caf√© family in the city that too situated at such a prominent place for hang-out groups. Bike-lovers are greeted with an Enfield right before the entry :-). Hookah experience is too good here. Had Double Apple flavour in Chilled Red-Bull base which was a suggestion from the staff end and it surely was a hit. The fresh toppings and the thin crust made the Dijon Chicken Pizza a successful venture with drinks which were refreshing as well. The Blue Lagoon was standard and the Dark Lord had his spell upon us for sure ;-). My friend enjoyed the whole of Carmel Cold Coffee so didn't get a chance to taste it :-P. Atmosphere is quite happenning with free gaming like Foosball & Air-Hockey available. Recommending for group visits.

First thing when you see from outside..u would think this is a guy's place...with loads of apprehension I climbed the stairs and opened the door and Bang!! A beautiful white bike greets you immediately. A sudden urgent to sit on it will always cross your mind. Next the ambience is really good. What would you expect in the menu...Beer and Burger...well Burger is definitely there but NO BEER. Disappointed. Anyways we ordered for coffees, Nonveg platter and Burger. The positive point about the place is ambience with live music. But the food quantity is not adequate enough to be shared. The taste is good. Hospitality excellent. So overall my rating is based on the value for money, ambience and hospitality.

The Bikers Cafe: the ambiance is undoubtedly good. However its the service that needs to be looked upon. The staffs are slow, we had to repeatedly ask them about a table for two, then they served us the wrong drink at 1st. The food is good. But SERVICE is too slow.

A quick lunch at The Bikers Cafe proved to be a pleasant experience. Nice decor and friendly staff and retro music playing on a Sunday afternoon. They did not have lamb burgers or pizza available, which struck me as odd considering it was lunch on a Sunday. 
We ordered two peri peri chicken burgers and one fish burger. The burgers were juicy and flavourful and the mayo and coleslaw served alongside were up to the mark. The fish fillet used was fresh, crisp and still tender and the dressing did not overpower the other ingredients. The chicken was tender and well spiced. Only bone of contention was that the fries were way too little and varied from burger to burger. So consistency was an issue. 
We also ordered an Oreo shake which was just thick enough, not too sweet and blended well. The detox juice - muscle soother - an interesting orange based blend was refreshing and made from fresh fruit with just the right hint of sweetness. 
Bill came upto around 1800 for three which was quite reasonable given that the quality and quantity are very satisfying. 
Definitely recommend a visit for a relaxed meal with friends or a quick bite!

Had wanted to visit The Biker's Cafe for a long time and made it finally last Saturday. And everything that I have heard and read about this place holds true! The ambience is warm, the waiters friendly. It was a bit loud, because we unfortunately sat near a speaker. 
Coming to the food, it is simply awesome. It looks good and tastes better and the portions are filling. We had burnt tomato and pepper soup and mushroom Chardonnay. With that we had 3 detoxifying drinks. And after that we a non veg mezze platter, which had falafel, chicken kababs and fried chicken. We also tried ratatouille. All of it was simply yummy. Lovely place! Would recommend it to all!

We had time to drop by for lunch and thank god we did. A really good experience with top notch ambience. What really is distinguishing here is there creative menu with cool names like Free flows, stress buster, etc and variety if new combinations. Like coffee with rose syrup. If you're a fan you'll definitely like it. Plus the Irish coffee- do indulge in it before having all the sweet deserts. While there was spicy Mediterranean pizza which was delicious. I'd have more had I had any room left. Food has not only touched the taste buds¬†but also the pampered the heart. All in all it was good. The only thing though was that Pizza took a lot of time. And it came back a little too crisp at last. But undoubtedly still tasted god. Its a place where you need to go multiple times to explore the menu. So why not go atleast once. ;)

Woah!!! I'm a pedestrian!! and I don't have bike!! Loved the lavish ambience and "You're beautiful" the track I'm talking about.  The Biker's cafe is for those who never question why "Mojito" is pronounced MOHITO why Europeans just kick off the cute little J!! Well let's get straight to the point I ordered Watermelon Lemon Splash Mohito and by the end of it I was chewing Ginger Bits out of my Straw Lol!! The salad Greek Salad with Feta was tangy and I liked the flavours. Then I ordered waffles waffles with the boring vanilla ice cream scoop with choco chips was fun and filling. One of the staffs was overtly friendly whom I had to threat that I'll give a negative review on Zomato. I'm being honest to myself and to him. I liked the food but I absolutely didn't like the show off. You're basically paying for the Harley Davidson and all those cool dude stuffs! And cherry on the top was a tiny piece of wrapper coming out of my Sweetie Tangy Mohito!! GOD BLESS BIKER'S.

Its the "Biker's" cafe & so be it....lets tick the check boxes.....kick ass cruiser model at the entrance, earthy feeling of wooden painted stock furniture, all hands draped in a bandana over their heads, hard rock in the air, lighting matches the idea, biking gear replicas strewn across....ok you did a good job with the surroundings, full on 5/5....what about the food, the mojitos make the cut although the "watermelon & lemon splash" was a damp squib.....the waffles & salad was good though....for all the effort, shelling just a tinge lesser than a grand (‚Çπ), would call that a winner and definitely coming back....but then! Whats with the guys trying to set our bills and drive us out as soon as the plates seem "near"  and i mean "near" empty & the disappearing act of the menu card before completely ordering!!!! As far as i know this wasn't a weekend and as far as i could see, it was near empty.....boys, you did mess it up, didn't you?? üëåüëé not beyond 3.5.....

This place is amazing. From food to service to decoration. This is an old favourite. Went there and ordered the hungarian style fish, I was surprised to taste the lemon-ish butter flavour in the fish, it was different and really awesome, since I'm a fish lover so I loved it. They serve it with veggies and mashed potato. For desserts, I ordered the blueberry waffle and this was lovely. This is seasonal and you should try this. Served with a scoop of ice cream. Tried the lasagne which disappointed me a little but was not bad since previously their chicken lasagne was way too good so I felt little bit average this time. Good time spent. Good music. Their service is really good, I loved the way they took the lasagne thing sweetly and said will bring back your memories. Thanks guys. Hop in people if you are nearby, this place won't disappoint you. 
Eat and be merry.
Cheers!

Had to try this place after hearing excellent reviews from my sister and the ratings on zomato and boy i was impressed!!

We had the veg mezze platter, veg gourmet pizza and the italian sizzler. The hummus was well balanced, pita was soft and the falafels were crunchy. The pizza had the perfect thickness and excelleng taste. The sizzler was ok compared to other dishes. I also had one of their detox juices named exilir of youth and i have to say that it was one of the best juices ive tasted in a long time.

The ambience and the service was as good as the food. A great addition to the kolkata food scene :)

Me and my elder brother were tired for my elder sister who had her advertising classes at an institute in Elgin Road. We were hungry, and after my sister was out of her class, we three decided to go to some nearby cafe and have some food and drinks.
Being a Zomato person and a proper foodie, ai quickly took to exploring Zomato for some good eateries in the area. The first name that came up in the search engine was of The Bikers Cafe, so I suggested this name and some other names to my siblings. My elder brother is a complete bike freak, so he desperately wanted to visit it hearing its name. We all agreed. We had our car with us, and following the map and directions, we reached the place very soon as we were already very near.
It is located on the first floor of Platinum Mall in Elgin Road. We took the stairs to find the billboard with the cafe's name engraved and welcoming its customers. We pushed the door, and was first welcomed by the strong smell of hookah and the hookah smoke. I was not well that day and thinking that it would be suffocating for me inside, I thought of dropping out. But however, as my dear bro insisted, I decided to stay back and entered. The theme is completely bike-oriented, as the name promises, you are welcomed by a large cruiser bike kept at the main entrance itself. The inside of the cafe was interesting, well spacious, dimly lit making the environment, well-controlled amd comfortable temperature. The area was big enough. Clean, hygienic, good looking and a good smelling place overall. We took a round table and made ourselves comfortable. The cafe also had free wifi and we were using it to upload statuses and pictures that we took there. The staff was cordial and professional which I liked. 
Since my elder sister is vegetarian, we decided tk stick to veg. We ordered a large Gourmet Veg Pizza, and two Minted Iced drinks for refreshments.
The Minted iced drink was really refreshing, cool drink with enough crushed ice and the mint flavour really made it worth.
The pizza was served on a wooden serving plate. We were provided separate cutleries for eating. The pizza was a thin crust one, large and suffice enough for three of us. It had an enough and well quantity of cheese provided, with good amount of toppings of tomatoes, olives, jalapenos, capsicum, bellpeppers,mushrooms, corn and onions. The pizza definitely tasted good.
The bill, I found, was somehow on the heavier-on-pocket side, because of the numerous kinds of taxes that are added up to the actual bill. 
This time, since it was for a short time and an unplanned visit, could not taste much of the cafe's food specialities. However, I would soon come back to taste some other food items and also their signature dishes and drinks.
A cool experience, overall! ‚úåüèªÔ∏èüòä

The first thing that you notice when you walk into this place is that although the decor follows a theme, they did not go overboard with the whole biker gimmick. The very next thing that you would probably notice is the extremely polite and helpful staff and the nice ambiance.

The menu boasts of a decent amount of variety and the fare - atleast what we've sampled - is pretty good if not great. We ordered honey chili cajun potato, the terminator lamb burger, grilled salmon teriyaki, muddy slide (or brownie sundae, whatever works for you) and a watermelon based drink (whose name I fail to recall). Other than the burger being a bit on the "hey this is great but let's try something else next time" side, I felt that it was a splendid meal. The salmon was probably the best of the lot, although it was the costliest - thankfully it wasn't my order. ;-)

And that brings me to the cost. I have to admit that the place is a bit on the costly side - which was mostly for the salmon in my case but still, not really cheap overall. But I doubt whether this place would ever be considered as robbing you blind - with good food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere I think it more than makes up for needing you to shell out a bit more.

If you are looking to have a decent meal which is not just plain Indian or Chinese food, I suggest that you give this place a try - you'll probably like it.

A very unique and 'out of the box' concept is applied to decorate the interior of this place, which is not only innovative but also reflect a quirky, yet rocking charm in its ambience. Yes!! As you can easily figure out from the name, the theme is bike. And as you enter the place, there is a grand cruise bike welcomes you to this rocking den.
Coming to food, it is remarkably delicious, and portion wise absolutely fine. The service persons are descent, well mannered and polite, but somehow seemed to be a bit over-professional, with a little lack in friendliness with the guests. Opinions may vary from person to person, but somehow, I think, friendliness with the guests, and making them feel comfortable with a warm welcome is something can't be ignored in a food and hospitality industry. Moreover, the wait time after ordering food was a bit long.
But apart from that, I liked each and every thing about this place, and this place deserves a standing ovation for its food and rocking ambience.
A must visit place for sure.

This is one place I've visited so many times and I still like going there for a perfect breakfast or some real fun time with fiends. They'll give you everything from that large variety of breakfast menu based on different types of eggs with other add ons, their pancakes are worth a mention and also all the other a-la-carte available. They've got their creativity in everything. The bike standing, the Foosball table and the decorations add to your fun time.

Love at first sight: well, The Bikers Cafe is exactly like one. You open the door, and you love the place even without tasting the food. Located on Elgin Road, close to Forum Mall, this place offers amazing breakfast. We had american breakfast platter with saut√©ed mushrooms as an add on. Yummm! The platter had toasted brown bread, one charred tomato (generally I leave it, but I found the tomato here extremely tasty), one hash brown (brilliantly cooked with no extra oil on its surface), sausages, three egg omelette (crispy, soft and tasty), bacons (OMG! Freaking delicious), baked beans (super tasty, tastier than Flurys), butter and fruit preserve. This was heavy and will make you full, with respect to capacity and satisfaction. Then we had butter milk pancakes. We were served with 3 brilliantly cooked savoury pancakes with maple syrup. You shall like the ambience. It was a visually stunning. They also have a smoking zone, where you can smoke and have tour food. FYI, they also have hookahs in their menu. It is a must visit. Highly recommended. Flurys and Au Bon Pain please watch out.

we went on Saturday evening...thankfully we got the seats quickly...the place is very buzzing with very good music choices...the area is not so large but very maintained...the helping guys were courteous...the mocktails were good...coming to the food, it was simply mouth watering...the place is a bit pricey, but its worth it...if you got a small group of friends, its the best place to chill out!!

The Biker‚Äôs Caf√© is one of those themed caf√©s with great d√©cor and good food. Centrally located with great food and good ambience is how I would describe Biker‚Äôs. The place has a foosball board and one can while away her time with that till the food comes. For Bike aficionados, the please would be a big draw, complete with models of vintage bikes all around. 

I went in for a breakfast with my friend Pronetri and ordered the French Benedict. My friend however was wiser than me and ordered the classic Brit Breakfast and Pancakes to go with them. For drinks she chose a latte while I settled for watermelon based health drink (don‚Äôt remember the name).

Coming to the food, my Benedict were nice, however I found the Hollandaise to be a bit runny, it didn‚Äôt have its usual consistency. My friend‚Äôs English breakfast was really good and I especially liked the special touch of orange marmalade which they served with the toast. The rest of it contained the standard hash brown and eggs, however they served 2 medium sized sausages instead of bacon and that may be was a put off. We shared the pancakes and they were fluffy like a dream, the maple syrup not being overly sweet as well. 

Finally, to close the meal we ended up ordering waffles as well, which were sprinkled with chocolate sauce and served with a big dollop of vanilla ice-cream. The waffles were crispy and soft at the right places and provided a perfect close to our meal. 

The service was pretty good and attentive and we didn‚Äôt really have to resort to waving hands/ calling out etc to grab their attention. 

Overall a very good place to grab a hearty breakfast. Haven‚Äôt yet tried out the mains though! Will be back soon.

Food is really good here. We ordered Fish fingers, mushroom chardonnay, Cajun chicken , Greek and Cesar salads, garlic bread , biker's cafe chicken soup of the day for the starters. All the starters were excellent. Then we ordered¬† Hungarian grilled fish ,¬† lamb burger and Jack Daniel BBQ lamb steak for the mains. Lamb burger was good but the grilled fish was the star of the show. It was "melt in your mouth" good and the sauce accompanying it was so creamy and yum.The lamb steak was a disappointment however¬† since the sauce was too sweet even compared to normal BBQ sauces. Also the lamb was not in the form of a steak but more in the form of a lamb curry. Overall though the food is top notch and we had a wonderful experience.

I went to this cafe on a Saturday morning for breakfast with cousins. The ambiance was great. The music is superb. Feels like we are in a Texas restaurant off the highway. We ordered a BBQ veg ranch burger, spinach corn sandwich and a veg cheela. My portion was the burger (cut in half). The contents of the Burger were falling out and I was not able to eat properly. The sauces they gave with the Burger were amazing. Cheela was good. Didnt taste the sandwich. We also had a cucumber, beetroot mixed healthy shake. It was good. Will try their main course menu there.

It was in my wish list for long time. Finally went there with my friends one Saturday evening. Nice place, good ambience. They have live band going in the evening. The collection of music they were playing were really good. We ordered a Hookah and we didn't want it to be too strong and they lived up to our expectation. We ordered dry chilli chicken, Baby corn and pizza. Food tastes really good. And the Pizza was not the traditional one we get in dominos and pizza hut. The pizza was thin crust and good. If they can use a little more cheese on the pizza it'll be great. Price is a little high but considering the location, the interiors, the ambience I would say the price is affordable. A must go for those people who love to hangout.

Was my first visit at Biker's cafe. I must say it's a nice place and very easily located. Interiors are well done and sitting also.
Went in the morning so it had its breakfast menu. Tough it's heaven for Non-Veg people as very good varieties of food. I had ordered chilla, burger and corn paneer sandwich. Overall food was nice and great. Burger was quite messy while having it, the contents tend to fall out, enjoyed a little as I had only taste of the bun in the mouth while it's patty and veggies had fallen out. üòï

In the morning they have quite variety of healthy shakes and I must it was delicious. I had order watermelon, cucumber, beetroot and mint mixed in it.

Overall experience was nice. Now would look forward to have the it's day menu soon. üôÇüòá

I'm going through a phase wherein I'm hogging my way through all breakfast joints in town, enthusiastically putting on pounds but NONE SHALL DETER ME FROM MY PATH. I'm out to find the best breakfast joint in Kolkata !!! 
So today I found myself at Biker's Cafe. Plus points for the superb location(right on Elgin road,opposite Simaaya) and the hassle free parking (you can park right in front of the building that houses the restaurant). With bikes as their theme and soft rock playing in the background, I felt I had made the right choice this morning. The setting, the ambience, the music is right on point. But let's come to the actual point. The reason why we loosen our sacks of gold at these places is for the food- and the food, my friend, was rather disappointing. 
Well to begin with, we had ordered two fresh fruit juices namely, the Elixir and the Muscle Soother. Both were good and special thanks to our server for suggesting the Elixir (a must try). Both were refreshing with a slight hint of chilli(loved this element). However what dampened the mood was the breakfast mains. We had ordered the French benedict with sausage as an add-on and Bobby brown omelettes. The French Benedict was just average, the hollandaise sauce failed to tickle my tastebuds and the add-on of sausages @Rs.42+taxes should have had at least two pieces(it had just one sausage). The Bobby Brown omelette too failed to impress, despite its fancy name. It was over fried and the brown bread served to us was of bad quality(I get better at my local grocery store). I mean come on, we expect good quality in every element of a dish at such fancy places. And why shouldn't we? The total cost of the breakfast was Rs.1060/- .  I rest my case.

Biker's Cafe is for the rugged mind. The soul of Biker's Cafe lies in the uniqueness of its decor, its ambience and how you wish it to be your crib with your besties.
Keep all the posh that comes with Elgin aside... Biker's Cafe is a whole new dimension of SWAG!
The moment you enter through the main door, you will get my point.

We just went in for a cup of coffee and obviously we were not disappointed.
Next time... wl definitely visit for the food yo, given its reputation!

This is the perfeat place to hang out with your pals. The interiors suit the concept and the restaurant is a very active one. There is this bike kept on which you can actually sit and get pictures clicked.There is a liv bar counter and the seats arrangement is good. You will surely never ever get bored over here, while waiting for the food to arrive or anytime. This place is packed with a ice hockey table, many board games etc. The staff is very welcoming and there are glass windows to see down. Coming to the food, the food is awesome. Pizza is awesome And don't leave this place without having mock tails, any of the mock tails because they are all equally good. The breakfast menu is something which I really liked and ths place is more apt for evening snacks. You will never regret your visit to bikers cafe for sure. I recommend it.

The decor and ambience do justice to  both the categories namedüòá we tried out lasagne, veg sizzler, chipotle and some drinks. Quite good taste and presentation. Level of spiciness could have been indicated on the menu. Overall good tasty food. Music from the eighties and a great playlist kept me humming through out my lunch.

TL;DR One of the best places in Kolkata to have Hookah with your friends while having great food and in a cool ambiance!

Biker's Cafe on Elgin is a bike themed Hookah place where you can play many a board game with your friends! It does not have a bar.

The hookahs here are really great! Not only do they have exotic flavors, they prepare it really nicely as well! We tried normal, Redbull and Milk bases and all of them were great!
Try Teen Pan with Milk base and Brain Freezer Rose with Milk base...they were really great!
What I don't like is that they charge for a coal change...something I have never seen anywhere else. The Hookahs are otherwise quite cheap as well!

We also had a great time playing Jenga and Foosball! Something to complement your Hookah!

Food here is absolutely fantastic! We had ordered Veg and Non Veg Platters, Fish Fingers, Veg Lasagna, Veg and Non Veg Pizzas, Honey potato chips, Crispy chilly baby corn and few more dishes. Definitely try the Square Pan Pizzas and Lasagna!
Shakes are also really great. Try the Blueberry shake....we loved it!

Ambiance 4.5/5
Service 4/5
Food 4.5/5
Experience 5/5

Great place! :-)

Biker's Cafe,located on Elgin Road is a bike themed cafe serving International cuisine.This place is a winner if it all boils down to the food,judging from what all I had tried.Not that the decor or the ambience was any less impressive.Decorated with biker's paraphernalia and artefacts and also providing games for 'pass-time', its a pleasing place to go to.
  Ordered the tomato mushroom bruschetta which was fresh and of good quantity.The fully loaded nachos was terrific with generous toppings and well presented.Also tried the vegetarian chipotle sizzler which was so tempting and will impress spicy food lovers which makes it so different from other sizzlers in the city.Also they have separate menu for healthy smoothies which was great and wholesome.
  For dessert tried the Too hot to handle which was a sizzling brownie.Looking forward to trying more stuffs on their menu.Although a little exorbitantly priced it was value for money,totally.

This cafe is located near forum mall and I went there for a hangout with friends. Delicious food, superb ambience and services. Brain freezer lemon was cool. We had mixed sauce pasta, Mexican chipotle chicken sizzler , crispy chili chicken and Texas spicy chicken cowboy pizza. The best part is, there is separate section for hookah lovers so that it won't bother people who don't like the smoke. Music was good and not too loud. A decent place to hangout. I loved the place and planning to go again.

Though the service needs to be improved the food quality &  portion size is good. The staffs are a little unknown to the menu with the choices.  To keep their guests occupied they have a Harley and a few games set up to keep you busy,  overall you would a great time if you have a group.

On my culinary trip , this is a place which would certainly surprise u in Kolkata. On a weekday evening I along with two of my bestest buddy decided to try out this place. Firstly they have a provision for car parking which is otherwise hard to find nearby the place they r located. Next the interior of the cafe is done up with extreme care n passion. You have seating provisions for people of all age and all kinda mood. They have a complimentary wifi which has a decent speed. Next the food which is moderately priced tastes really good and absolutely mouth watering. The waiters are extremely courteous and well trained. They have a different seating area if u wana catch up something on the TV and to our surprise they got all the channels from all corners of the world to catch on. No matter which country u r from, u will find a tv channel to suit ur taste. We stayed there fr about two hours and really enjoyed the place and the time we had. Its a must visit if u r a coffee fanatic and loved visiting cafes.

Hi,

It has been my second visit to Bikers' Cafe and to say the least it was an exhilarating experience both times. In fact, personally, I feel there are very few places in the city that warrants a second visit for all the combined reasons of ambience, food, service and of course the very eclectic choice of music. ( Rare mercy of having been spared the torture of Bollywood sound) :)

Must say the most authentic BBQ sauce in this part of the country to go with the succulent lamb. Although the helpings of pancakes seemed to have got smaller than my previous visit. Service time was a tad long and possibly seemed that service staff were having a tough time with the packed house. But then that would be cribbing on my part and excusable for the great taste when food was finally served.
But the high point of the place was of course the genre of music to accompanying the servings. Any place with U2' Songs of Innocence, Mark Knopfler and Chuck Berry as the house song list deserves¬† Kudos and High Fives.

My two bit suggestion:

1) may be a bar to go with my BBQ lamb would have been nice. Even if a full service bar might not fit into the existing brand equity or business model and et all. it may be possible to have a limited bar stocking just beer and wine. What you say?

2) As an aspiring musician myself, Biker's Cafe branding would be an ideal platform for a live music on lines of the genre played recorded at present. May be not a full band (space and cost considerations), even unplugged live gigs of trio band would definitely add value and patrons in tune with branding parameters of Bikers' Cafe.

Cheers and hoping to be back soon.

We were very excited from the beginning because the theme that this place has. The interior is simply awesome. When you will enter you will see a big bike ! (a very nice place to click pictures :p ) Though beauty isn't the only thing but the decor allows the simplistic beauty of food to really shine! This cafe buzzed with excited energy.                         We started with baby spinach,corn and cheese sandwich which was delightfull. Each bite made us feel that we want more. It was served with chips , fruits and a dip. Each spoon of dip was also simply amazing ! The presentation was very good. Texture was very clean. Then we ordered lasagna (veg). PRESENTATION :  It looked very delicious specially the upper crust . It was served with garlic bread in a square shaped bowl.                  TASTE : one word-amazing ! this pasta base which is topped up with exotic herbed seasonal vegetables synchronized with white chessy sauce was simple amazing ! You could feel the cheese in each and every bite. We really enjoyed this dish. It is highly recommended to all of you to try this lasagna . I want to try the nonveg lasagna even. I will definitely come and try the non veg one.              Anyway other than food and decoration there are few games even which include foosball. We really enjoyed a lot . Everything was so energetic here. Visit this place and come with a smile in Your face. highly recommended .         Thanks !

It was late afternoon, after watching a really dissappointing movie at Forum we wanted to catch up with something different and not too heavy on the palate..Well Bikers Cafe came as a nice solution..Located on the first floor of Platinum Mall adjacent to Brands Factory this place has earned a name mainly with its unique theme and its offerings of healthy mocktails among the rest..
Coming to the ambiance, well it suits the name aptly, its about Bikes, its about journey and what more important on the road for Bikers than to discover new cuisines and flavours.. Right from the Vintage Harley Davidson exhibit at the entrance to the lights resembling headlights of Bikes to the door knobs, it gives you a positive and chilled perception about the place..Less formal and more rugged..
The service was prompt and efficient and the ervers know their menu quite well..We ordered:
Masala Cola: Nice way to start your meal..quite appetising..
Cajun Chicken Tenders: Fried chicken supremes, served with three types of dips, one yogurt based, another sweet chilli and the third one is an imli based tangy dip..Loved the dips but felt that the acidic content of the chicken was a bit too much..should have been more balanced..
Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler: Loved the punch in the dish..it was virtually hitting the tongue, nice balance of heat and sourness as well as a tinge of sweetness..Comes with Mexican Rice which was way too salty to my likings..loved the presence of tortilla chips, friedbeans in the dish,added an extra dimension..
We were full by then to order any deserts..Overall our experience was mixed in terms of flavours, could have been better..Waiting for my next visit..Our total cheque comes to Rs.1056/-(all incl) for 2 people..

Service is nice but as far as food is concerned, not very good. It has got the ambience right but food quality needs to improve. Also mayb include a few more items in the menu to go with the ambience

A bike themed cafe with free air hockey & foosball & rocking music. They have segregated the hookah section which I liked. We ordered a vanilla latte, chicken lasagna & sizzling Brownie with ice cream. I ordered the latte with extra chocolate sauce which I didn't find in the latte or may be I couldn't taste it. The lasagna was a bit spiciy with peppers. The sizzling Brownie was perfect.

I've been here more than once now, and am really happy with the place. 
The food, service, ambience, interiors, location, nothing failed to satisfy. 
No special recommendations as such, all the dishes were good to go, but I'd specially like to applaud the staff courtesy. 
The service at times was slow, but that wasn't an issue thanks to the fooseball table that served as a perfect distraction! 
Morning breakfasts are super refreshing here what with the light music and yummy menu. 
OveraI, it has been pretty good experience on every visit. Must go with friends AND family! :)

The ambiance of this cafe is absolutely different and appreciating and is themed on bikes. The center of attraction is the royal enfield which has become a mandatory spot for clicking selfies or photos and posing on it by now. Servers were courteous. We went therein for breakfast and among their offerings we selected vanilla milk shake as blueberry milkshake wasn't available. Vanilla milkshake was good. Then we ordered their throttle up breakfast platter which was wholesome for us. Overall we had a nice experience. Price is on a higher side but it's worth it.

Sunday evening at a Metropolitan city. You would all the eating joints, especially the good cafes, to be choc-a-bloc. But not in the¬†case of Kolkata. If we were in Mumbai, we would have to fight for every inch. Whereas when we reached the Bikers Cafe today, it was nothing like that. We got ourselves nice decent seats overviewing Elgin Road, one of the posh areas of the City. Now the premise of coming to this place came from an earning to have some feisty burgers for dinner. So a little bit of searching made us realize where to go.

Regarding the place, awesome theme. They have tried to recreate the old biker clubs/pub found in the West and have been more or less successful in replicating the same. Wooden panels, a demo cruiser bike, posters, chairs, etc added to the theme of the place. Don't know why but they kept on playing Guns N Roses for ages. And with regards to the game tables, better to avoid that.¬†

With regards to the food, for starters, we ordered the following:
1. Fish Fingers
2. Malaysian Chicken Satay
As I always say, you can never go wrong with fish fingers. Proven correct again. The satay was good, in fact, the sauce with which it was served was even better.¬†

For the main course, we ordered the following:
1. The Terminator Lamb Burger
2. Peri-Peri Grilled Chicken Burger
3. Twin Cam Fish Burger
4. Virgin Mojito

The display was impressive. The food normal, nothing out of this world. Nonetheless, filling that we had to cancel our dessert plans. The service personnel's¬†were good and the orders were served quickly. We were out in an hour. Awesome throughput!¬†

All in all, a Sunday evening well spent on good food and an even better place. Do visit when you are near this area!

PS : They would start serving some good old beers. I bet this place would rock more then!

Current favourite. This place won my heart with its superbly delicious food. Easy to locate, this one's near Forum. There's this sexy white two wheeler to welcome you at the entrance. Not only is it themed and decorated so nicely, but also it serves great food. The hookah was a winner, found it better than most places and lasted quite long. The sandwiches were very nice to taste. Grilled chicken wings were a great treat. Sat there for a long time, enjoying their music and watching Xmen on the huge hd tv. It gets pretty crowded around the evening so you'd better come early to grab a seat at the shisha section which is smaller than the rest of the area. The waiting staff was a nice man and served us well. Overall, its a great place to be.

Apart from the decor and music nothing is special about the place. The moctails were substandards, we ordered for caju chicken tenders, it was a real disaster, the entire coating of chicken supremes were coming out while eating, it seems like the chef dont know how to actually coat food ingredients or how to make the batter. the service was slow, waiters are reluctant to take orders. we actually need to wave hand to call them.

I have been wanting to come here for ages now. Finally managed it post crying my lungs out while watching Star Wars. And the place was sheer bliss. I expected a better hot chocolate though. But brilliant lamb (in JD BBQ sauce) and strawberry waffles. :')

And the environment. I would come here just for the decor and music. And X-Men playing on one screen and James Bond on the other just added to the feel.

Coming back soon, for sure!

Biker's Cafe is one place in Kolkata where I have visited it at breakfast, in the evening for snacking and for family dinner. They have a large variety of veg and non veg dishes for an all day dining. Their mocktails are one item you should be looking on their black board. Don't forget to click a photograph with the big bike. At the same time, bikers cafe is good choice if you are looking for a place to chill with your friends as they have one of the best hookah flavors

as it goes with the name, it's a bikers themes cafe located at the junction of lee road and Elgin road offering superb ambiance, play tables, good music with great food to relax, be it for lazy breakfast or evening snacks....

Have tried their bikers club sandwich, all American bacon N egg, French Benedict with Ham & Bobby brown omelettes on one late breakfast date with dear ones & not a single one were disappointing!!!

I love this place.
Close to my office, this place is one of my favourite joints.
Located opposite to bhawanipore post office, you get welcomed by a nice beast bike at the entrance. They have separate area for hookah and  dining.
Innovative use of space by including games so that even while you're waiting for tables, you don't realise the time gap! 
And.. I can kill for the playlist they have !! I so wanna request the management to allow me to borrow it! Plss!
The hookah is always good here. I love their exotic drinks n juice section. Nice detox drinks and good variation in menu.
The food too is awesome. It's difficult to name one or two items coz I visit this place so often.

Overall, lovely place, country music, good food.. What more can u possibly ask for?
Shall i go there again? U kiddin? Of course!
P.s - woh playlist mujhe de do !! üò©

It's a nice place to hang out. If you got a gang and want a place to "chill" this is the go to place. The interior is very cosy and a double thumbs up for their theme üëçüëç the place has got a sports bar feel to it (minus the loud music and alcohol) 
The food is good. I'd suggest the lamb burger!!
Separate section for customers who opt for the hookah.

It was my first visit at Bikers Cafe with my friends on Christmas Eve this year to celebrate our re-union. The food quality was amazing and I liked the ambience as well.

We started off with a thin crust Veg Pizza, then came along Honey Chilli Cajun Potato which was a mind blowing starter..! Then we munched on Chicken tenders and Chicken wings tossed in BBQ sauce. Last but not the least, the sugar cane juice rocked our appetite..!!

The breakfasts served there are mouth watering, even when you get to hear the name of dishes. This place has the best lasagna in town. A 5 star for the cleanliness. The price is moderate and affordable. A visit with your friends is a must as it provides gaming consoles and foosball tables for the waiting period. Cheers.

Some of the staff are non courteous. Very nice interiors. We tried crispy chilli babycorn which was the best I've tasted till now. The margherita pizza was okayish. Nachos were good, however they are an aquired taste. The Mocktails are awsum. Specially Kiwi twister. Cold coffee was also yum.

If you're looking for nice place for an evening with friends.... I would highly recommend it. The ambience and service - really nice and cozy. Although I do wish I could hear the live bands play. We ordered a gourmet Veg pizza, Italian Chicken Saltimboca and fruit crepes. I must say that the thin crust pizza was not such a hit among us. Everything about Chicken Saltimboca was great- starting from spinach stuffing to the black pepper sauce and even the mashed potato. (Veggies were a bit hardboiled though). Talking about the crepes- It was a showstopper- although initially they looked like a paratha wrapped with fruits, but when we took a bite, we just loved it. These cinnamon flavoured crepes were unique - a break from chocolate dominated world of desserts. The only downside however- it is a bit heavy on the pocket. That will be reason for not giving it a straight 5.

It was a little difficult for me to find this place.
But totally worth it. Great ambience. The staff is very friendly. Atleast my host was. They try to make conversation with you. Even though everytime they came and said something to me, my mouth was full and so i couldn't speak properly and it was embarrassing.
Good food. The portions were great. And i love it when there is quantity plus quality.
I had the biker's club sandwich. Amazing is the word. Good meat and awesome cheese. I love cheese. And this one had it on point. And it had bacon. Though it was the first time i had bacon and i was expecting some other taste, i didnt quite get it. The way people describe bacon as the absolute best, i didn't feel it here.
Still amazing.
And i had chocolate pancakes. Really large portions. Not really what i was expecting but still good.
4 points just for the sandwich.
Had to get them both packed.
And the bill was more than what i had calculated. I don't know how they added the taxes.

Extremely well done ambience.. The one thing that makes me choose this cafe over others is the wide selection of fresh drinks and juices over the usual aerated drinks high only on calories.. Haven't eaten much but the spaghetti arabiatta  was bang on.. Good hookah!! Big thumps up to bikers cafe.

I fell in love with this place when I dropped in for a quick breakfast on a Sunday morning. Firstly, the ambiance is very tasteful - the setup of the bar and dining area, the way the walls are done up. Secondly, the place has everything you might want - big TV screens, games like foosball, air hockey.
Specific to our visit, the food was great - we tried kachori, pancakes, caramel cold coffee - all delicious. There was live music which was absolutely delightful - the singers did a great job, and I loved the casual setup. Service was prompt and courteous. Great experience! :)

Hi foodies!

=August 19th, 2015=
This restaurant actually came up on my list while I was searching for the best lasagne in town! 

-Decor-
This place deserves a paragraph on the decor. You'll instantly like the place on entering it! It has a very youth vibe to it, complete with foosball and air hockey! We went there for lunch but I believe the place will liven up more in the evenings. Everything is themed with respect to the title. (Even the quirky washroom). 
Although it is a perfect hangout for friends, it has not skimped on the tables for couples! :)

We ordered:
1) Mushroom Chardonnay: As I love mushrooms, as a starter, I opted for this and boy was it worth it! You'll be disappointed with the quantity but they made it so well that you may end up ordering more than one!

2) Non Veg Lasagne: It was good. I won't get too excited though cos considering the price of this dish, I expected a little better. 

Nonetheless, I want to visit this place once more and try their breakfast options. Highly recommended! 

-Bon App√©tit. :)

Have only visited this place once and that too alone for a quick k lunch as I was in the neighborhood for some work. The ambience was really nice, open and inviting with large glass windows. The main seating area seemed full so I was seared in a small adjacent seating area through a door. The first thing that entered my nostrils was the smell of flavoured hookah. The area was small,  with about 4-5 tables,  each capable of seating atleast 4 people. It was filled with thick smoke and was not very well illuminated compared to the outside section. Why the waiter asked me to be seated here is a mystery to me. The  I ordered a simple non-vegetarian penne pasta in white sauce and a coke. There wasn't much delay in service although I have to seek somebody out to get my water refill. The pasta was nice and creamy with the right amount of cheese. There were generous shredded chicken pieces. Portion was not very generous but it was enough for one person. 
Overall a good experience but needs to be explored further to properly assess the pros.

At the bikers cafe in Kolkata.. I think one of the worst service ever. The staff extremely rude and the food came approximately an hour late. Such kind of service is not expected from a supposedly reputed cafe. My advice to all future customers is that if you have all the time in the world to wait for your food, only then come here, otherwise don't.

Are you crazy about the bikes?? Then for me it's definitely has to be from The¬† Bikers Cafe.. Haha :-D..¬†
A name synonymous with the Gen X, Y and Z; you couldn't possibly not seen at least one check in on Facebook for The Bikers Cafe..¬†
Definitely it is lives up to its name as it is a good place for "Bikers"... Though I don't have any ideas about the spare parts of bikes but here the walls are stucked with the each parts ;Which gives you the feeling of a side Cafe in US..¬†
Nice place for hookah hangout but the price on higher side.. The Bikers Cafe needs no explanation given its huge popularity particularly among the youngsters.. What makes The Bikers Cafe elegant?? Well apart from its prime location that is stone throw from the rabindra Sadan metro station, offices, schools, colleges and of course for its great ambiance..¬†
Their pizzas are worth tasting along with the variety of finger food they have to offer.. Shisha was good.. One thing you instantly notice is that almost every table has a hookah on it ! Amazing Italian food! Very cordial staffs!¬†
It is great place to chilled out with your friends.. Music, hookah, Italian dishes....! What else is needed for an evening munch.. Italian herb tastes so good that it melts on your taste buds, along with cheese..

Had bookmarked this trending cafe for a long time and finally visited it on the occasion of my friend's birrthday.
Ambience is rather posch and classy with really cool decors..On entering,u see a white bike stationed at the entrance. It also has got air hockey and futsal games which is really nice.
The place is divided in 2 parts: shisha nd non shisha section.. basically shisha section is for hookah purpose and is a smoking room..it has got a ps3 setup nd a large screen in which we can play and is separate from the dining area.
Now coming to the food..we had ordered for pasta in white sauce with chicken, dijong pizza, texas cowboy pizza and chicken lasania.
The pasta dish served with butter toasted bread was awesome in taste..rich thick creamy white sauce with nicely grilled chunks of chickens and the pasta was well cooked.. highly reccomended..quantity wise..good for sharing between 2 ppl easily.
Next was the dijong pizza.. it tasted good but i felt that a little less veggies would enhance its taste further. The base of the pizza is really good..nice thin crust..properly baked and good amount of cheese..a little more topping of chicken would be appreciated.. The pizza is big in size which is cut in 4 medium and 4 small slices (total of 8 slice).
The texas cowboy pizza was really superb in taste..nice thin crust with ample cheese ,garlic nd chunks of nicely spiced chicken.. wud prefer this over dijong..highly reccomended!!
Again served in total 8 slices ,cut in 4 medium nd 4 small portions.
The chicken lasagnia was very rich in taste..we ordered this last nd by the time it came we were quite full..generous filling of chicken,cheese nd pasta with baked cheese layer on top..it was spicy nd is a heavy dish served with two toasted bread. I didnot personally like it very much..although ll try it again in an empty stomach üòõ.
The service was good..with waiters well versed with the dishes..u ll have to wait for some time after placing the order but then u ll b served very fresh items.
The bill came to be 1829 inclusive of all taxes ..
(They take 31% tax.)
Highly recommended for its food quality and ambience :D

This place is simply amazing. Delicious finger food, soul pleasing mocktails (no alcohol sadly), fooseball (played for hours), video games (FIFA) on a big screen, hookah.... Couldn't be better place to hang out with friends.

Went there with 6 friends to celebrate a friend's birthday. One of the best experiences so far in Kolkata.

Must haves: Kiwi-Lichiee smoothie, Honey Chilli Potata, Lazania, Teen Pan hookah.

You have to be there to believe me when I say "oh the food that they serve", because that is the first that comes to my mind when I think of Biker's Cafe. Been here a couple of times for breakfast and ordered a whole lot of stuffs, and instantly regretted it and that's a good thing because the quantity is huge there. I can't remember the main course that I ordered and I don't find it here on the menu as its not the same which I got for breakfast (I guess they have a different menu for breakfasts). Although I did have special berry compote and blueberry waffles as desserts and they were sumptuous to the say the least. Me being a big fan of all things berries, can say that it's one of the best waffles that I have had in Kolkata. They also serve mixed-fruit-mixed-vegetables-mixed-whatnot juices for the health freaks who come here after jogs and gyms only to gain more carbs and kid themselves more than anyone else.
Half a point deducted for the breakfast menu which is not uploaded here. Afterall who doesn't love menus?

Especially the actual bike standing at one corner of the cafe.... The food is also great... I ordered coffe, and an all american bacon and eggs and it was delicious.... Though many people will concider this place to be very expencive.. And i wont lie... It is quite expensive.... But the food is really up to the mark.... I wouldove to go this place again to check out their lunch and dinner specialities....

So I went there a couple of hours back around 12.30 for a lazy Sunday brunch with a friend. Biker's has a very classy yet rustic biker feel with some great music playing in the background. I have been there earlier when it used to serve only Veg, so wasn't very pleased. Today was different. Ordered a Biker's Special Club Sandwich and a portion of Fish Fingers, with Herbal Green Teas.
The Club Sandwich was extremely well-made..with Egg, Chicken, Bacon, Cheese, Mayo,Tomato and Lettuce in tiers of wholewheat bread. Served with a dip and potato chips, it was just perfect. The Fish Fingers were crispy and made to perfection, served with tartar sauce and french fries. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The prices are little on the higher side but the ambience makes up for it. The bill came upto Rs. 1025 for the two of us. There was a slight network problem with card payment today, so had to pay cash unwillingly. But otherwise it was a great experience. Looking forward to coming here again in the evening sometime for hookah and other quick bites I couldn't try today.

Being new to Kolkata, I haven't been to many places. However, bikers cafe is the best till now. A cool hangout place for friends :) while waiting for the order one gets the chance to play air hockey :) Overall the ambience is great.. Place to be for hookah lovers.. The staff is friendly and courteous.. Plus the moat important thing food quality is good. We ordered house special coffee, virgin mojito, garlic bread and spicy Mediterranean pizza.. All the items were delicious.. Its easily a 4.5/5 on food.. The live band adds to the ambience.. All in all, really nice place to spend ur evenings in Kolkata.. Looking forward to visiting again :)

After heavy Saturday lunch wanted to chill out somewhere with hookah and quick bites. Was passing by Elgin Road the thought came about long bookmarked The Bikers Cafe.

We were directed towards seat at hookah-plex. That's what they call it for hookah zone. They have PSP, air hockey and fussball too for enthusiasts. Live performance is overrated.

Ordered Paanch Paan Hookah with Orange Surprise, Virgin Mojito and Ginger Ale. Hookah was refreshing and strong but only Orange Surprise is recommended.

In quick bites had Crispy Chilli Chicken and Dijon Chicken Pizza. Chilli Chicken is crispy indeed and pizza is delight for thin crust lovers. Must try here. 

Servers here are so courteous and friendly. Bill was INR 1724 inclusive all. The place can be a good get-together option too.

Though i'm no connoisseur & my experience being limited, Bikers cafe is my most favourite place till date.

Located on d 2nd floor of the Platinum mall on Elgin Road, this place is an absolute winner. As the name suggests, the decor boasts of a variety of biking props from the engines on the wall to the limited edition Harley Davidson bike. The pool game at the entrance is very strategically placed. The seating arrangement is excellent & the ambience is rocking. The champagne styled water bottles to d jenga cards on the tables are quite fascinating.

This review is based on a couple of visits. The things which i ordered are :
1. Jerk chicken with honey mustard sandwich - a perfect combination of honey & spicy pulled chicken which is a must have.
2. Arabiatta aglio olio - the creamiest & d most delicious pasta i've had till date. Make sure to add broccolis in it.
3. Thin crust veg pizza - The only weakling in the otherwise perfect menu, nothing but a series of bell peppers & sun-dried tomatoes topped on a thin base.
4. Grilled peri peri chicken burger - Signature majestic size burger of this place served with salad & fries. Absolutely rocking !!
5. Hazelnut cappuccino - Though i'm not much of a coffee person, i found myself indulging in it both times.
6. Muddie on a sundae - Rich chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream.
The mocktails are quite refreshing with interesting names.

Food presentation excellent & good value for money. Service is always prompt. The waiters are always there to help u especially if its ur first time.

Few cons is they dont yet have a bar & they should be regular with their hookah.
Would strongly recommend everyone to visit it. Will personally look forward to try their awesome platters the next time i visit there.

Well, if ders anything close to perfection for me, Bikers Cafe it is..

As my friend introduced this place ¬†- This is one of the few places in Calcutta which can match the cafes in Bangalore .
The place is easy to locate near Forum and the ambience is great with live band playing.
We ordered a variety of stuff ranging from mocktails to ¬†sandwiches to burger to pizza and waffles and each was great on its own .
Added to this you have a foosball and air hockey table to play .
Definitely a place worth coming back !

A place which was right up there on my wishlist. The location is easy and convenient to find. It is located right opposite to the Elgin Post Office near the Forum Mall. As soon as you enter this place, there is something that attracts you and that is what exactly made my first impression perfect. The interiors is rough and rugged in sync with its theme with bike posters and accessories on the wall. They have separate zone for sheesha lovers and a different zone only for foodies. They have made sure you dont get bored while you wait for your order, hence air hockey, foosball and PlayStation. We ordered for a Iced Tea fused with Lemonade, Orange Surprise, Crispy Chilli Chicken & Bikers Chicken Fusion Discovery. Iced Tea was okayish and could have been better but the Orange Surprise was too good having a very subtle taste which i thoroughly enjoyed. The Crispy Chilli Chicken was killer to say the least. Perhaps the best Chilli Chicken preparation i have had in the near future and yes it was crispy which is tough to find in other restaurants. Even the dry gravy comprising of  veggies and garlic was very tough to avoid. Next came the Bikers chicken discovery. Two pieces of chicken breasts prepared in different sauce of Pesto and Peri Peri. The Peri Peri was fine but the Pesto sauce preparation simply amazed me. It was so good that i recommend everyone to try it. Finally we ordered for a Blueberry Waffle. The waffle was freshly prepared and it was so very tasty having the right amount of blueberry punch. Overall i am very satisfied with my experience and cant wait to go back to this place.

This palce was decorated for bike lovers and it was Heaven on Earth for me.. We tried the Portuguese fish, and dry chicken fry.. As well a pan hookah with apple chillum. All in all..it was a great day and the food was amazing and worth it

The 4 rating¬†is only and only for the a,ambiance and the decor and the live band that I came across, performing on a very cosy Sunday morning. ¬†I had heard a lot of rave reviews about this place and naturally, the thought of visiting for a breakfast came into my mind, as I was aware that they serve nice breakfast.¬†
Upon entering, I loved the Harley Davidson model displayed. It was meant to set the mood and it did. The decor of the restaurant is beyond doubts, fresh and completely out of the box- more so for Kolkata. The comfy interior exuded enough warmth to charm the living daylights off me; only if the food was something to match! But more on that later. I would like to talk about the live band performance- it was amazing. In fact, the best part of my visit and one the one singular point that will draw me to this place. I even ended up placing a request :)
Now the food- we had ordered All American¬†and Ham & Cheese Bobby Brown platter; On the sides we had lattes and cappuccinos and I ordered a detox drink - Elixir of life. Frankly, I was not impressed. I was promised a great breakfast and they failed to deliver! Of course there are many attractive reading names on their menu but now I will forever be in doubt whether the are as good on the palate as on the ears. The attraction for an attractive interior and bands will fade beyond a period- good food will only count then. I hope they buckle up. For, I am really dying to go back and try out the other amazing items on their menu.

I went to this beautiful place for breakfast on the weekend. It is strategically located and is extremely brightly done up. There's free WiFi and a special international breakfast menu. There is an interesting variety of American, English, Spanish, French, Thai, Indian, Arabic dishes. There is a separate juice, beverage and health drinks menu. We had ordered Spanish, Thai and American dishes along with latte and 2 soothers (bone and muscle). The drinks were a bit bland considering the healthy ingredients. Also the Spanish omelette had potatoes which didn't blend well. The experience was wonderful and the staff was aware and courteous. It's a feel-good place and the games add to the feel. They serve an assortment of dishes and have a colourful platter. Will love to try the other dishes on the menu. Overall must try once. :)

Review for 25/10/15: Had a HORRIBLE experience today. My son wanted to go to Bikers Cafe, well not really for the food but more so for the foosball and the bikes. I had a not so good experience with the food previously and wasn't gungho about eating there but still ended up going. We ordered a Ceasers salad and a pizza. While placing the order, I categorically mentioned the instructions to the chef as the food was for the kid and he can't eat it very spicy or hot. I forgot to mention that since its for a kid, pls don't ADD CHILLIES OR PEPPER. I thought since I mentioned its for a kid, it will be taken care off. Well, it came with chilli flakes and pepper and the kid couldn't eat it. So I kept it aside and ordered for a chicken pasta. Now this time, I wanted the guy to write it down that the chef should not add CHILLIES, chilli flakes or black pepper. Again, the pasta came with black pepper. Almost 45 minutes and the kid has been nibbling on to the salad which he doesn't like. Poor thing was hungry and I couldn't take it anymore. Blasted the hell out of the INSENSITIVE CARELESS BUNCH OF JOKERS WHO HAD THE AUDACITY TO COME BACK AND TELL ME THAT THE KITCHEN FORGOT TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. What happened happened post that and the apologies and what can I do's but its spoilt the day. I had to take the kid to MacDonald for lunch. Well, they did remake the pasta and packed it for me and didn't charge me for it. I was actually so pissed off that I didn't want to pay a penny for SUCH INSENSITIVE AND SHITTY SERVICE but paid anyways with a 10% service charge. BIKERS CAFE MANAGEMENT, IF YOU ARE LISTENING, PLS DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THIS IS SO SO VERY DISAPPOINTING. YOU GUYS ARE SO BLOODY INSENSITIVE. I guess such standards are maintained only in Kolkata. You should be ashamed.

Review for 14/07/16: Great ambience and decor with the white and chrome chopper adding to it. It's a very lively place with well appointed staff who are attentive and service oriented. My son loved the place and spent more than an hour on the foosball table. I loved it too, in fact played it after a long time. There are a couple more places where you have a foosball table like The Loft and Novotel but I thoroughly enjoyed it at the Bikers. Overall experience was good but me and my wife weren't really very happy about the food. We love continental and European cuisine and hence could make out the difference. I mean it's a great elaborate menu and it was very well made but somehow the taste was missing. We ordered a lot of food and drinks but everything was just OK. For eg. The Grilled Salmon was very dry and appeared stale. My rating is for the overall experience and it could definitely be better if the food improves as per my liking. It's an expensive place and they add 10% service charge to your bill by default, so you don't need to tip. It's a good thing but if they screw up on the service, you still end up paying for it :)

I have been hearing a lot about this cafe lately so decided to finally give it a try! I must say the decor of the place completely justifies the name of the cafe. There's a dapper bike waiting right outside the door to greet you and you just can't miss the lightings on the wall comprising of actual bike headlights!
Along with the amazing ambiance, the food and drinks definitely lived up to the expectations. We ordered an Irish coffee, Arnold Palmer and blue lagoon for drinks and a Texan spicy cowboy pizza. The drinks were pretty good.. but my oh my.. was the pizza tasty or what!
Overall a great experience and definitely worth giving a visit!

It was very refreshing to go to such a nice small place in Calcutta.... The food was real good... We tried a few pizzas.. Yet to try the other stuff. The mocktails are good... But I didn't like the coconut mojito. It was just coconut water with mint leaves and some ice.
The ambience is nice and people will enjoy hanging out here. 
Please remember they add 10‚ÑÖservice charge which you will only get to know at the time the bill is delivered.

Visited this place last week, situated on the first floor of Platinum Mall, its in a well situated location and easy to locate! 
We had ordered a Virgin Mojito which was really refreshing, got a good punch of mint in it which I really liked. We were waiting for our chance to get a seat at their hookah corner, they have a seperate enclosed room for smoking hookah. Once we seated we ordered for our hookah, it was pretty well made!   Also we ordered a Dijon Chicken Pizza which was quite cheesy and it was yummy! 
Overall loved the place, won't mind visiting again!

Oh I just loved this food joint. It is on the first floor of platinum mall on Elgin road on the junction of Brandfactory and P.O. The place has a cool and trendy ambiance.

Right at the entrance you will come across a bike written "Live to Ride". And it was a hell of a ride on a puja evening with friends. The management was very friendly and we were given a nice table for six for more than couple of hours. From what I saw, they have nice music, a separate hookah place perhaps (not sure, I did smelled Hukaah while entering the place though), a bar like sitting also, apt wall decals and some games like foosball tables and Air hockey. Me and some of my friends enjoyed matches between ourselves and against other players form the cafe also. It was fun evening altogether.

Now about the food firstly we ordered Irish Coffee with Veg Nachos. The coffee was decent but the nachos were really good. Topped with sauces and cheese. It was really good. Nachos are always a good option while you are with a group.

We also tried a non-veg chicken pizza which was also good. Lots of mozzarella cheese, a yummy combination with olives and tomatoes.¬†

I will definitely come back here. delicious Food, sharp Service, awesome ambiance, without putting a whole to your pocket. What more you can ask for!! Many photos attached.

After many failed plan went their few days back unplanned. The first thing you notice is the ambience. It is no doubt very unique. Different parts of bikes are hanging from the wall, the waiters are dressed as bikers you have few gaming consoles where you can play games as you wait for the food. They serve hookah and have a seperate room for that which is good. Now if all these raise your expectation about the food then you will be little let down. Food is good but nothing superb. Service is prompt but needs improvement. They messed up an item as simple as salted fresh lime soda is difficult to accept. It is the fact that kolkata lacks places like this has made it so famous. Definitely It is not a place where i will go back for only for food.

In future i would surly visit this place if i got an oppurtunity.... My fav was aglio olio of course! N yea cant forget oreo shake either along with bruschetta!

Coming to food...
We ordered for Ratatouille which I loved to the extreme... It had  layers of cottage cheese stuffed with vegetables made in white sauce with tomato gravy a bit and cheese all over which was grilled and that gave it a perfect taste..
Next we ordered was crispy chilli babycorn which was v crisp but it was too dry...
Quantity was a lil less considering the price but food is definitely a must try...

Biker's Cafe. 1st floor. Platinum Mall. 
Keeping true to the name, there is a bike smack dab in the middle of the first room which then leads to a second room, the main restaurant. 
The staff are nice and courteous. 
We had ordered the chicken lasagna, the BLT sandwich and the peri peri grilled chicken. 
The lasagna was THE BEST LASAGNA ever
The BLT sandwich came with a side of coleslaw and was good, if not a little dry. 
The burger came with a side of French fries and coleslaw. The patty was juicy and delicious. 
Because of the ongoing weekday offer, we got 2 cold drinks free with the sandwich and burger. 
Only thing is the price is a bit on the higher side. 
Overall, a good experience.

Today went for a dinner at Bikers Cafe with my friends & family. This was my 4th or 5th visit to Bikers Cafe, as usual the food was excellent but sadly today the service was exceptionally slow. It was crowded being a sunday and the service staff looked a bit unorganized. Usually the service is slow here but they cover it up with excellent food but today service was disappointing. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to everybody but Bikers Cafe guys pull up your socks. Hope I get a better service in my next visit.

Kolkata needed a coffee lounge with its own uniqueness and Bikers Cafe definitely lives upto my expectation. The addition of live music just enhances the atmosphere. The food quality is very nice worth recommending. Staff is very friendly. If you can add draught beer in the menu the place will just fly.

I am in love with this place. It's my second visit to this cafe, and they have impressed me once again with their impeccable service. Food too is as good as it was the last time. The highlight this time is a live band (They are
very good!) performing in the morning, and making my day. Some might think that the Bikers Cafe is a little expensive, but but I think this place offers great value for money.

Each time I go to Biker's, it throws up a new experience for me. But it's always a good one. :)
I'd swear by the Eggs Benedict. The Buttermilk pancakes are super soft and divine. And waffles are not too bad either. The chocolate drizzled satay was a quirky dish which worked. And they have excellent coffee. Win! 
For a late brunch with friends or dinner with loved ones, it's a choice destination, and did I mention the ambience? Its as cool as it sounds. I just wish I was a biker chick, but you don't get everything in life! ;)

I was here with a friend. The ambiance is great. The drinks were pretty good, but it was the chicken lasagna that stole my heart. It was better than what I used to have at my regular place. The sizzling brownie with ice-cream was also just the way I wanted it. The quantity is ok-ok, given the quality, I don't think I should complain. But yes, they did take time to attend us. I definitely plan to visit there soon.

This is a breath of fresh burning rubber that everyone in calcutta needed. It's got good food good music good people serving and some new stuff on the menu that will surprise you. It's a good place to hanging out with friends and or family. They could make the menu a bit more extensive but I'm only saying that because feedback is a must.

A great place to hangout with friends offering a good menu to choose from. I went for breakfast with my cousin Rajrup Das and we loved everything about the place. The place is so well decorated and we absolutely loved the food we ordered. I would say that their coffee is way better than what we get at a Barista or a CCD. Early morning acoustic live music was an added bonus. I would love to visit bikers cafe every now and then however, I would have loved it even more if they served alcoholic drinks as the decor reminds me of my uni pub. Go Go Bikers! ;)

Well,

My last visit was disappointing when I got a bill with 10% service charge. Why the hell do you guys do such things. Show me a single country where they charge customers for serving separately. If you want to charge, add that amount on your menu or expect your waiters to be tipped if they have served us well.

Dropping your ratings from 4.5 to 3.

This is my second review for biker's cafe since last year and i can say without a shadow of doubt that this place has never failed to impress me. I generally go there for breakfast  every week and try the super amazing egg based dishes. I think this place is one of a kind to serve such high quality and delectable food. Also worth mentioning is there amicable staff who suggests those dishes which suits your palate. I like all of them and my personal favourite is Govinda because of whom i am writing this review.

Few if the scrumptious dishes which is a must try are:
French Benedict 
....Egg womb
Greek omelette
Arabic omelette 
Burgers
Jacket potatoes....
Cold coffee....

Checked out the bikers cafe for a 9am breakfast with my wife and little son. Welcomed and was given a sofa pronto and the menus were laid out quickly. We ordered the bobby brown omelette which was basically a three egg omelette with cheese and ham. The omelette was large and the ham was more than adequate. We also ordered Angels in egg womb , which were boiled egg whites stuffed with a tangy sauce, beans, chicken mince. I found this item more suited to a starter than a breakfast but the dish was well presented and wholesome. The final dish was a stack of fresh banana pancakes which were decent. I seriously believe that a good pancake can only be made with eggs and I found something lacking in those pancakes. The maple syrup could also have been supplemented with condensed milk and a small portion of berry compote or even honey. All add different flavours to the pancake and can really make the perception of the final product much better. For drinks, I'd ordered an American which was not too my liking. The coffee was too cloudy to me. Service was good albeit slow owing to high crowds on a holiday. Will be back...

It was a newly opened joint when we went there & we had actually nothing to do much so we thought of going somewhere to sit an hour or so & have some shakes.
It was not much crowded as it is now ;)
& we didn't have plan for hookah so we sat in the dine place.
For food we ordered biker's chic fusion & it was too yummy to describe. .I liked the idea of egg on top of it...if I didn't have to go for dinner I would've definitely tried lasagne..next time maybe :D

Loacation: Elgin Road, Forum Backside(Shoppers Stop Entrance) , Beside Aqua Java. It's on the first floor. The tower is called Platinum Towers.

Ambience: This place is a bit on the Expensive Side, hence you will expect Cream crowd here. Justified! Good Music, Very Well Trained staff who will check on your feedback after you are done eating. They actually live up to their Name. Huge bike placed just at the entrance. Much like the Bikers Caf√© in Delhi.


Food: I went her for breakfast. Ordered Chermoula Roasted Vegetables Sandwich and Cardio Brainiac Juice. 


The sandwich has got Roasted veggies like Onions, Bell Pepper,Etc mixed with Mayonnaise with herbs. Very tasty. No complaints on this one. 


The juice was really very healthy with Watermelon and a tinge of Green Vegetables. The best part is that, the juice wasn't canned. It was fresh and made my morning!


Really good presentation and courteous Staff! They also have WiFi so you can do your work at peace. They have this amazing Foosball counter to keep you amused if you love indoor gaming!

Keep it up ‚ò∫

This place was on my wishlist for a long time. Located just beside Aqua Java on Elgin Road, it is very easy to find. The rustic ambience and the decor of the cafe will surely surprise you. We ordered Malaysian Chicken Satay, Dijon Chicken Pizza, Virgin Mojito, Bikers Strawberry Lemonade Freeze. The Malaysian Chicken Satay was very tasty. Dijon Chicken Pizza was nice but the chicken was very less in it. The two drinks were pretty average. The menu had a lot of variety in it. The waiters were not upto the mark. Overall I liked the place so hope to visit in future to try out the different other dishes.

Bikers cafe is absolutely true to its name as far as ambience is concerned. It has a very happening feel to it. Coming to the food. We tasted quite a few dishes and all of them met our expectations. The pizza was crisp and scrumptious. The spaghetti aglio olio was amazing although I found it a tad too spicy than it is supposed to be. The babycorn starter was also good. But what stole the limelight were the potato potholes. They were lip smackingly delicious and it is a must try for all. This place also has some great desserts. The pancakes and waffles are really good. The only drawback to this place is its service. I found it a tad slow and the service staff were not forthcoming in serving dishes. But all in all it is a fab hangout place and a must try for people of all ages.

Its amazing decor and ambience is the main thing this place is famous for. Quirky posters, motifs and models all round, it also plays great contemporary music and is one of the best places for hanging out with friends. It even has a foosball table! Coming to the food, on our first visit, we ordered Chicken Wings and Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler, with Sweet Lime Soda to refresh ourselves. The food is quite well prepared, though expensive. The staff is friendly and helpful.

One of the finest place in Kolkata for hookah lovers. The cafe never seems to disappoint us in providing a comfortable ambience with like people. The food is equally delicious be it Desi anda bhurji or the authentic banana pan cake with maple syrup. The fuse ball table is a cherry on the cake for game lovers like myself. A definitely recommended place to free yourself from the hustle of the city.

We dropped by last Sunday. 

Loved the decor. One of the very few restaurants with healthier options too ( apart from other stuff) on the menu. 

Now for the food.  Everything looked so interesting that we could not decide what to orfer. We  finally ordered a Malaysian Satay Chicken and Spaghetti. 

The Chicken came with a peanut butter dip. I loved the dish. On its own its a full meal for one person. Quite satisfying. The Spaghetti was light and full of flavour. 

Looking forward to coming back again to try their breakfast menu.

The Biker's Cafe - The acclaimed cafe in the city of joy.
=====
Location: Located right beside Aqua Java Elgin Road on the first floor.¬†
=====
Intro: This cafe needs no introduction. I am quite late at reviewing this cafe. However, this cafe was on my wishlist since quite a long time. I had come here with one of my friend's to enjoy the feel of bikers cafe. I was quite mesmerized with the interiors (Pictures will speak about the ambience). They had foosball and air hockey as games to play. Nevertheless, after observing the ambience, i decided to sit at the hookah section and smoke some sheesha as it was quite long. After finishing my food, i spent sometime to play some air hockey and foosball. It really made me feel refreshed and energetic. :)¬†
=====
What i ordered:¬†

1) Nachos - The nachos were good. It was perfectly topped with cheese, bell peppers and more. Nachos lovers should not give it a miss. :) #musttry

2) Virgin Mojito - The mojito was good but could have been better. Personally, i love this drink too much and want it perfect. :)

3) Watermelon Cooler - It was just fine. A little better version of home made watermelon juice.¬†

4) Brainfreezer - Simple brainfreezer sheesha is good enough for me.¬†
=====
Pros:
1) Ambience
2) Prime Location
3) Games - Foosball and Air Hockey
4) Separate sections for dine in and hookah.¬†

Cons:
1) Price is on the higher side.
2) Staffs are not very courteous as they need to be.
3) It lacks the vibe and the feeling.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 750-1500¬†
=====
Expert Suggestions:

1) Please improve your services. The service is quite slow and plus the staffs are not being really courteous. As customers we are paying you our bit and we expect our time to be enjoyable.¬†
2) This place has a lot of potential. Get some offers for hookah and food as well. This will definitely attract customers.
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4/5
Food Quantity 3.7/5
Taste 3.8/5
Hygiene 4.2/5
Hospitality 3.3/5
Ambience 4.1/5
Value for money 3.4/5
=====
Conclusion:
I would only visit in near future if the services are improved a bit more.¬†
=====
Note: Unbiased review based on my dining experience.¬†

This is super close to my college but I finally went yesterday with my bestie. It's easily located and the ambience inside is chilled out.I love the fact that they have an air hockey and foosball table.There is a different hookah section apart from the main cafe.We tried the detox drinks,The Pink of Health which was yummy,yummy.The menu isn't very extensive but that's not an issue because whatever they have on offer is real good. We tried the prawn and garlic pizza and it's the best thin crust gourmet style one I have had so far in Kolkata. The staff can be a little more courteous but the service is efficient. Also bucks wise not the cheapest but not crazily expensive either.Totally going back for more.

A lazy Sunday afternoon prompted us to strike out...and to The Biker's Cafe on Elgin road. The first thing that strikes you as you head up to the first floor and make to enter the door is a collection of bikers' memorabilia in a glass case. Head inside and its just wow! Spacious interiors with ambient lighting, comfortable seats and a touch of something different lure you inside. As we wanted to be seated in the sheesha section, we had to wait a few minutes, but were directed to a table sooner than we expected. We ordered a chicken satay and the biker's club sandwich, along with a drink claiming to be an elixir of youth. And I must say that the taste, quality and presentation of the food was simply awesome!   A paanch paan sheesha completed a lovely repast. The interior decor is very modern and striking. From tankers of different models of bikes mounted on the walls to quirky messages on licence plates, and perfect numbers playing in the background, all in all a great experience. The only thing that kept me from giving a full 5 rating was that, I felt that the wait staff, who were otherwise quite polite and helpful, could be friendlier and a tad more  professional.

The choice of music is what I have playing on my ipod all the time, so that makes me feel right at home. The menu has something to offer for every mood, whim and fancy. Burgers are juicy and yum!

Ordered a chicken pasta in white sauce along with a plate of classic waffles. Strange order for a late evening meal, yes. Both the dishes were very well done. The sauces were well flavoured and just of the right consistency. The waffles were truly wondrous; not overdone with just the right amount of soft. 
The pasta was a little too steeply priced, however.
Definitely merits a second visit, possibly to scope the breakfast menu.

We ordered Bikers cafe non veg special and some Thai dish along with 2 veg dishes with chow. And mini pizza nd veg platter for starters. All were yum and very filling. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. Service was quick. The sofa and chairs were very comfy. We booked the private area. Will definitely recommend this place. Though the price is a tad bit on d higher side but the pace is really cool. Worth the money.

Bikers Cafe-Was excited to go to this place since long to experience the concept.
The place is good and spacious. However.I didn't get the feel if a biker (They do have a Harley davidson, but I had higher hopes about relation with the name)

Coming to the most important aspect-food.
We ordered a hookah which was very good (Much better than Tyre patty or tea trove). In food. We ordered an Italian sizzler and a garlic bread.

The sizzler was tasteless.There was no cheese added to it. The bread was hard to bite.

Overall, a good place to have hookah and enjoy with friends.However when it comes to food, there are many other joints in the vicinity which over much better food.

The suitable location and the hype of it made me pay a visit to this place. Undoubtedly one of the best looking hangout place over finger food in Kolkata. Ambience is really cool so is the concept.
Now coming to the food we ordered Gourmet vegetarian pizza, spicy chicken pizza, Spanish style prawn and in drinks Elixir of youth. The pizza scores full marks on thing crust but it ain't a standout. It's something that you get in other cafes as well. Prawn was really good, soft and juicy. The name of the drinks are really interesting while the one I took tasted satisfactory.

So if you don't mind giving a bit more pinch to your pocket for a hangout and ambience matters to you, then you should definitely pay a visit.

Nice place to be with friends and chill.. Gives a complete ambience of cowboy dens because of the interiors.. Would be an icing on the cake if some live performance would be arranged.. The food was upto the mark.

This mumbai/delhi culture of cafes and lounges is catching up real fast in Kolkata as well. This place is one of those cafes in Kolkata which is a must visit, not for its ambiance but for the food, and the crowd. The place is also filled with fusbal tables and other games. The sizzler is worth the price, and is a must try. try coke in the float as a drink. I liked it, you might like it as well.

The crowd that comes up is another fascinating aspect here, not only young couples or friends turn up here but also families find themselves comfortable here. The music that plays up is equally good and entertaining.¬†

Definitely a must visit place, please do visit !! Cheers !!

Happy Munchin :)

I had heard about the place for a long time and finally got a chance to visit the place. Firstly ambience is fun and youthful. Food options are limited. We ordered a Malaysian Chicken Satay with peanut sauce. Quantity was good for a starter, taste was quite authentic. Good starter. Then for main course we ordered Italian Chicken which was quite nice and Jack Daniels bbq lamb steak, which was awesome but the quantity was small. Overall good experience will come back for the prawns and the total bill came to about 1550, which is moderate... Kudos!!! Just one mood spoiler that there is no liquor... Else this place is just like Garage Inc of Hauz Khas....

Love the ambience of the place..its everything a bikers den should look like..the food is a bit overpriced though..and service is late after ordering..gaming options are good..the drinks options should be increased..a biker's place without any hard drinks is not expected.

Bikers Cafe is situated in 1st floor of a building on the crossing of elgin road and lee road and so when we took table near the tall glass windows the roadside look was looking really good. Ambience of the cafe is very cool and done as per the theme, before coming i did expect that there would be bikes and some bike stuff as the name itself is bikers cafe... but once I stepped in I ¬†was totally floored by the detailings done and at the same time best part is that it doesnt look over the board.
You get a very casual and relaxed atmosphere here.¬†
Staff is very courteous and helps you suggesting your order with a very smiling face. On his suggestion we ordered gambas pil pil ( a prawn dish served with bread ), my friend is a veggie and wanted to try some sizzler so we were suggested cottage cheese shashlik sizzler ( which was quite filling having 4 steaks of cottage cheese, some nachos with sour cream and pica di gallo, mexican rice and grilled vegetables. We also ordered for mushroom as starters and ¬†greek salad with feta cheese ( the veggies in the starters were really very fresh and appealing ). Finally for desserts we had fruit crepes with ice cream and fresh banana pancake ..both were eye pleasing as well as yummy...
Yesterday was my first visit to this place and never knew that they open early in the morning at 7.30 and have a seperate breakfast menu so am gonna drop in very soon may be this sunday itself to try the breakfast.
I loved everything from music to interiors to food to service.. A big thumbs up...Just keep maintaining these standards and also a request... plz get your liquor license soooooon :)

Bikers Cafe is the most classy hookah joint I've ever been to. I was literally blown away by the theme set up around Bikes and those plastic parts inscribed on the walls inside the hookah lounge. 
Locating the place was a cakewalk as it's situated just a few steps straight from the base of Elgin Road on the first floor of Platinum Mall. There is a separate area for people opting for hookah and its ambience is extremely soothing. I went with my girlfriend and therefore the place being scarcely crowded was a boon for us.
Going by the waiter's choice, we ordered Sex on the Bike for hookah. The Red Bull base was refreshing and it was pretty strong. To accompany that, orders of Kiwi and Lychee soothie and a Strawberry Freezer were made in the drinks cordon. Dijon Chicken Pizza formed the sole order in the food department. The drinks were sparklingly refreshing but I found the Pizza a little too flat for my taste buds.
Despite a cozy ambience and good choices of orders, we decided to work our limbs and minds a little by trying the games they had on offer like Jenga, Foosball and Air Hockey.

To conclude, the experience was jam-packed with ounces of entertainment. Excellent place. Excellent service. No wonder it's a little expensive.

A cafe which is not just a cafe or as you would expect it to be that its just a place to go to hav a good chat over coffee and some tit bits. Its got an elaborate menu having items from different cuisines to choose from, great coffee menu, health juices, ¬†mocktails like sugarcane mojito which i found very unique and refreshing, and in deserts they got pancakes which i can vouch to be the best i have ever had so far, came here at evening so ordered potholes a very tasty potato dish, eggs platter with pita bread, mumbaiya sandwich and samosa kachodi mix, a rice based dish ( forgetting the name ;) . All the dishes were very tasty and we really enjoyed ourselves.
I found the board over the restroom very innovatively addressed ;)
You can really chill out here if you enjoy playing games as they have quite a number of options for you.

I highly recommend this place to people who wanna have a great time with their friends and family and also those people who are looking for a place which serves great food.

Last but not the least, ever smiling and friendly staff were the icing on the cake !!!

The interiors of bikers cafe is the coolest in the city, ropes for ceiling, bike tanks on the wall, customised bike for selfies, interesting messages on metal tins put all around. A super 10 on 10 for the ambience.
Songs collection is very tastefully done. Some people on another table were cutting their birthday cake, i found it very cute of the cafe to play a birthday song and make bike throtles...small things in a way but really makes your special day extra special :) ¬†I have decided already to celebrate my birthday here :))
Coming to food, we loved each dish we ordered, from chicken pizza to burger to mezze platter non veg. Really would like to appreciate the varieties of accompaniments they serve with burger so every bite you have you can enjoy with a different option from mint dip to mayo to mustard sauce to ketchup . They also gave french fries and coleslaw with it( quite filling i must admit ).
Only complain i have is that the dishes took a little longer time than we expected but here also cant grudge as they have varieties of options to enjoy the wait. We played a game on PS3 and zenga, my kids had a great time playing airhockey.
Overall a super duper time and am coming back soon as my birthday is just round the corner :)

We were lucky enough to get a table here during the peak Saturday evening hours. 
The staff is warm and cordial, the store is set up perfectly to give a feel of a Expressway side cafe in US. 
The food is great, their mocktails are great and so is their Sheesha.. 
The only let down was that there is only one guy to serve Sheesha orders to all the tables,  so a little delay. 
Hence 4.5.

Sharing my dining experience at The Biker's Cafe. Self visited with three of my friends a day before. Ambience was mesmerizing with a soothing music. Started my dining with virgin mojito.. Coming to the food portion, the most attractive part of my visit, it was more than wonderful. Ordered non- veg lasagna, Mexican chipotle veg sizzler, Salmon triyaki, Mediterranean grilled veg sandwich and ended with mouth watering fruit crepe with ice- cream and chocochip waffle dessert. The fabulous food quality and friendly serving session made me felt to visit this place again. Is looking forward to come back soon..

The Biker's cafe is a really cool place and if you have to wait a bit, don't fret - there's a mini foosball table to keep u busy. the decor gives a good feel of the theme it has, and the servers with bandanas are warm and courteous.

now coming to the food we ordered -(a) terminator lamb burger, (b)  chicken saltimboca, (c) mexican chicken sizzler, and (d) chicken fusion discovery,  followed by a waffle dessert and brownie in chocolate sauce.

let me say it like this, you know the feeling when you have missed being in the coveted top 10 in class and your classteacher writes a review 'hard working but can improve much better', which is basically that u didn't do ur best not coz u didn't work hard but coz u didn't think through everything as well as others did. likewise, everything served to us showed that there was work enough to make it technically good (the chicken patty was soft and chicken saltimboca and  chicken fusion were good) and plated very beautifully, but what I felt was that the sauces, mayo and fillings need a bit of re-thinking since that last bit of zing to make it top class is missing ( the beetroot mayo in the burger was not distinguishable, same for the sauces in saltimboca and fusion discovery). but this is a place most likely on my list to look out for ( just for a foosball table ! ;)).

Very regretful experience.I only liked the interiors.Irish coffee was very light.Maybe i ordered the wrong dish.But atleast the staff should take care of the hygiene before serving the food or even while preparing it.The friendly staff served my lasagna for the 2nd time free of cost but I suggest the management  should really really look into your hygiene.I couldn't possibly enjoy its good taste after i found my first serving dirty.Very bad experience from a place where i had high expectations.

Having had very pleasant experiences in the past, I chose to recommend this cafe yesterday night to my friends. We therefore met up for light bites & dessert. However, the food was disappointing. I ordered a Mediterranean sandwich, but, was served an indeterminate one - stuffed with a mish-mash of vegetables. I couldn't detect feta cheese or pesto, or the finesse of preparation indicated by its description in the menu, but of course paid for all of it. The waffle had strawberry crush, much akin to jam : it tasted as a concoction fit for kiddy parties. Thankfully, the pizza was as good as ever! So was the ambience & service. And a huge thumbs up to the music!! 
I hope the disappointment of y'day will just be a one-off affair and bikers cafe will be its usual self..

Visited this place yesterday. The decor and ambiance is good. The taste in music is pretty good too. We had the drinks first... 'Detoxifiers'... The pink something and the 'ant-iinflammatory'. Both tasted pretty okay.We ordered the knucklehead burger and the lamb burger. I must say they were both pretty good.The meat Patty was juicy and they had the right ingredients. Then me ordered the Malaysian chicken satay, which my friend and had. According to my friend, it was 'okayish' . then we had the chocolate chip waffles. They were really good, tho i prefer waffles with strawberries and icecream (they didnt have fresh strawberries).Overall the bill came around to 1700 approx. The service is very slow. And I hope they improve that. The staff is friendly and courteous. I wish they could have more boardgames that we can borrow and play .

I have always been a biker.Grew up in an age when cars were not as commonplace as today and while studying Architecture in an Engineering college,bikes were craved and treasured to travel and impress the girls.I have had my share of bikes including the legendary Yamaha RX 100,Suzuki shogun and the Hero honda cd 100.I almost died on my RX 100 once at Lonavala but that's a different story.I plan to invest in a Harley soon.

The prelude was not only to tell you about myself but what kind of a bike aficionado I am.So when I could manage to visit Bikers cafe today after a long wait,they did not have to try very hard to impress me.The wooden feel,the displayed bike,the photographs were all nicely done.But I felt they could have gone farther on the biking trail,maybe sell some legendary bikeware and photographs of some legendary bikes.

I loved the menu.Ordered a juice which they called an energiser or something and which was pretty good.

They gave me a complimentary munchie with a dip which was the best part of my eating experience.And this came with some very attentive service.

Then comes the mains for which I ordered a tuna sandwich.Here I was disappointed.The tuna instead of being flakes or chunks was a watery fill which had too much mayo making it very pungent.However I shall give them the benefit of doubt and go back very soon to taste their other products.Because in my heart of hearts,being a cafe entrepreneur myself,I want this cafe to succeed big time.

After all I have to be back here on my Harley.......

Had a great experience! The orders take quite a bit of time to reach your table but what arrives is absolutely worth the wait. The portions are good. The ambience is BRILLIANT! It's expensive but when you are ready to splurge, this place offers you great food and a really cool ambience. We tried the French Benedict, the Eg and Bacon and Cheese Pizza, the American breakfast, the Mezze platter and waffles. It was quite filling for 2 and we had to get half of the pizza packed for home because we couldn't eat anymore. Also, the litchi and kiwi mocktail was pretty good. The bill had come to something around 2 grand and 700 more for taxes. It was worth it.

Of all the things I have been able to try my recommendations are the Classic BLT, Dijon Chicken Pizza, Lasagna, the non-veg Mezze platter (this is seriously amazing and the veg one is also good) and the classic waffle.

I went to this place twice... Has its own front yard for parking. The ambience is spic span and relaxing. The foosball table and the music adds to the zing. The attendants are very polite and extremely helpful. Now coming to the main topic ; Food.
The peri peri burgers are simply awesome. It was the right amount of crisp added to the perfect amount of tender.
The best lasagna I have tasted till date. A perfect balance of cheesy and meaty.
The Italian saltimboca was ecstasy to the taste buds. The chicken was tender and the gravy was one of a kind.
The Dijon pizza was less than satisfactory though. I found the base to be a little hard and thin for my taste.
Overall a must visit place if you like good food. The pricing is pretty competitive.
A complete value for money deal.

I would be visiting again to taste the other items in their spread. Would love to see more variety in the drinks department.

Ambiance a big thumb's up. They got those Foosball and pool tables and you could even get jenga blocks at your table on request. For hookah we got one of the specials there ,¬† called real sex on the bike, and pretty smooth it was. I personally loved the American eggs n bacon all day breakfast platter but my friends were mostly blown away by the chocochip pancakes. Three soft pancakes loaded with choco syrup, absolute decadence. We even went for the classic waffle, since they didn't have any of the seasonal ones, and that was pretty amazing too. Although this place kinda fares on the pricier side, I'd still pinch my pocket a little for the food and ambiance here.

We ordered gum supari & teen paan rose hookah which both had good flavour and best part they were smooth. Nachos,cottage cheese sizzler, gourmet veg thin crust pizza and chilli babycorn were the dishes we had , and i must say we enjoyed having each one of them.¬†
Strawberry lemonade freeze , gingerale and virgin mojito we ordered in mocktails. Sadly my phone gallery got corrupted so i cant upload the pics, but whenever m gonna visit next would definitely click again :)

Well , ambience is wow , you have separate hookah & non-hookah sitting arrangements . We took the non-hookah one . 

You can play table soccer , and more . You can sing , take up a guitar .... really an amazing place to hang out. 

A bit expensive than other cafes , but it is worth it ! 

We ordered for : 

Dijon Chicken Pizza -4/5 ... crispy , hand tossed bread 

French fries - it was good , nothing to rate 

And a burger .... I apologize that I couldn't click it , because before I could do so , I was over üòú

Best surprise my wife planned for me, I am a bike lover so there could not be any restaurant better than this for me to celebrate my special day. my friends brought me here and wife was already there, she had got a pendrive played there with pictures of all our special moments and i was awestruck. Place is sooo amazing with interiors all done up with bike parts and stories of bikes.¬†
I love eggs and they had one of the best egg-combos i have ever had, latino , thai and bobby brown omlettes we ordered and enjoyed each of them, superb taste and wonderful presentation. Health juices menu looked interesting, we had one anti ageing juice and one cholestrol buster both tasted nice, Mojitos have a decent amount of mint leaves and was very refreshing.
The service staff were very sweet who played a very happy birthday song and gave us a complimentary brownie flambe.

Thank you guys once again for making my special day extra special early in the morning. Cheers !!!¬†
I am going to come back again very soon to try the main course and hookah someday.

The experience was divine! We went for celebrating a friend's birthday .. and they made a special flambe with a happy birthday tune in background for the birthday girl post meal which was the best and the most memorable part of the bikers cafe.
The food was another amazing part! I have read many raving reviews regarding the place, the ambience , their service and all were true to our expectations , but the food was way beyond it.
We started with CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP which gave the kick start.simply finger licking good! Next we had a starter, MALAYASIAN CHICKEN SATAY which was also great with six soft and tender chicken skewers and the peanut dip. Proceeding to the main course we had CHICKEN LASAGNE,HUNGARIAN STYLED GRILLED FISH,BIKERS CHICKEN FUSION DISCOVERY,ITALIAN SIZZLER WITH ADDED CHICKEN and all were superb.
For dessert we went for the waitors suggestion and ordered waffles THE BERRY COMPOTE..it was a mind blower..the soft warm waffles with berry spread and melted butter with a scoop of ice cream created a tantalizing heaven churning in our mouth.

With mind blowing food..bike themed decor ...terrific selection of music tracklist..and always ready to help staff..and some hookah to add on..this place scores almost full marks...Just i wish they had a liquor license..it would have been the most happening place near elgin.

I went there with a friend in the morning, around 11.30, so we decided to have brunch. We had a Brain Freeze Lemon hookah which was pretty mild and good. After that, we ordered the All American Bacon n Eggs platter, choco chip pancakes and hot chocolate. The breakfast was pretty decent; we were served bacon, fried eggs, sausages, baked beans and toast. The choco chip pancakes were really tasty though somes parts were a little dry. The hot chocolate was nice too.
What really makes this place so attractive is its bike themed ¬†decor. Aside from the oft mentioned white Royal Enfield which is prominently displayed, there are bike parts decorating the walls, cool quotes and a foosball and an air hockey table. It also has a mocktail bar. The music is loud and peppy which goes well with the ambiance.¬†
To sum up, it's an innovatively decorated place with pretty yummy food.

All wood work and rustic look with ceiling of ropes,paintings and bike tanks on the wall,customised bike to welcome you,and country music to make you feel nostalgic, to sum up its a 10 on 10 for the ambience and feel.
Its not a place only of cool interiors but they also have an innovative menu and good quality food.
Really liked the veg variant of benedict they serve, I ordered it as found interesting to know someone is doing an eggless benedict.
grilled fish,chipotle sizzler,mezze platter,chilli paneer all were simply wow.

¬†fresh juices with vegetables and fruits were refreshing and at the same time tasty.
pancakes again eggless were veryyyyy yummy.
choco rose latte again i found a very different thing on the menu so ordered as couldnt imagine rose syrup in coffee so wanted to taste it and trust me it is amazing.
Only thing missing is alcohol , else this place has it all.
Would love to try the breakfast once here as menu seems tempting :)

Food: pretty good. The coolers and mocktails are refreshing and are made with expertise. 
Pricing: a bit on the higher price.
Ambience: They are loud and they are proud.

It's the Red Bull of restaurants - energetic and vibrant and the vibe is so lively.. 

This edit is a complete change to my last review. Been here N number of times and have been disappointed especially when it comes to food. Dinners have usually been an exemplary experience and more so after they have started serving drinks which was restricted only to mocktails earlier. Nothing has changed over the years in taste and presentation, ambience and comfort and the bustling footfall. 

In this recent visit and my first for breakfast I realised that the service staff in the morning shift are probably as not experienced as those we get in the evenings. And if they are the same, then somethings wrong with the kitchen staff. Request for a Greek omlette and I was told 25mins prep time, opted for a normal masala omlette and guess that came 40mins later. 2nd round of mushroom toast and cheese toast took eternity. 

Appeal the management to look into this nuisance. For which I have dropped my rating by half a point. 

‚ÄúPink of health‚Äù is an outstanding drink that my 7yr old daughter told me off and I am impressed they served the Americano steaming hot. Bruschetta is killer stuff!!! Omlette was YUM, maybe because it came after a long wait.

To start off I really liked the custom enfield which is kept on display. The place will surely unleash the biker in you with its souped up wooden interiors. On the contrary the food is nothing to write home about. The biker within you would definitely want you to go for a steak. A good place for a Sunday brunch!  Thumbs up! #ZenFood

Even though a little bit on the expensive side, the food tastes great. The quantity of food served has room for improvement though. 
The biker theme is innovatively reflected on every object in the restaurant. The foosball and air hockey tables complete the perfectness of the place.

I visited this place couple of days ago . I ordered for chicken wings ,a lamb burger and a drink.
Chicken wings were ok. The dose of BBQ sauce brought up the life else the chicken wings by itself were average. The lamb burger was a let down . On the first touch, it was evident that the burger lacks the feel.  The buns were mildly stiff not the kind you would expect on your signature dish . And my drink , well I guess it would be enough for me to say that I have to change it and the second drink, which was different from what I ordered earlier was average . Emphasis is too much on the presentation.
Looking the rating , I can say that i've had a bad day but to have 3 things which at best would be slightly above par is tad too much to reconsider my rating.

Went last Sunday morning with my family for breakfast. Was amazed to see that the place was 50% full at 9am. There were some bikers also whose bikes parked in the lot was a treat for my girls. They were thrilled to get selfies on the bikes and one of the biker was sweet enough to give one of my daughter a ride who was not ready to step down without it !
Now, coming to the food. They have lots of varieties eggs preparation. We ordered Spanish Haven and Latino Egg first and loved both of them. Surprisingly, they had also some desi stuff in their menu which we ordered and enjoyed having, the Chilla had Paneer and mushroom stuffing. We also had Samosa Kachori Matar Chaat, Potato and Onion Paratha and tried their most popular detox juices as recommended to us named Pink of Health and Elixir of Youth which both were very refreshing.
Would surely visit again to try their main courses as menu looks very tempting.

It's one of really good hangout places in Kolkata. From morning till evening they are there to satiate your needs. Early morning coffee catch up with girlfriends ? Lunch with colleagues ? Evening relaxed hangout session? They have it all. Solid good menu - it's won't blow your head off by innovative or exquisite variations, but it is good and consistent in taste. Good place to visit with kids ( especially boys) - there's an awesome white bike inside. Actually, their ambiance is great, music, rustic decor - gets you into the mood for a great friends get together. Breakfast menu is quite extensive . Would love to see more soups in their lunch section  and description of the drinks in the Detox, otherwise it's a guessing game. Generally, one of the places I never say no to and keep coming back. It's a bit tricky to find entrance if you are visiting for the 1st time - it's on the left side of the building, if you are standing on Elgin road.

A nice concept and well executed as well! The place has a very nice feel to it. The service is good. Hookahs are nice. The health booster juice options are quite interesting and worth trying. 
They have a separate zone for hookahs also which is quite good. And they have a good range of board games. The foosball table needs some maintenance. 
All an all.. A good place to hangout.

Gives a rustic feel to the visitors. ¬†Service was quick and friendly. Great music. ( well, my favourite songs were on the list, so.)Wide variety of summer coolers. The food was cooked to perfection.

Wow is the word i have for this place, done up in a very american way with cool interiors to do justice to its name, they got air hockey , foosball and many board games to give their guests something to enjoy and keep themselves busy till the food arrives.¬†
coming to food, we ordered practically everything from the menu as were a group of 12. loved the jalapeno burgers and the thin crust pizzas, mezze platter had a very interesting beetroot hummus, moroccon tagine which is served in a ceramic dish is not only visually appealing but also has a unique flavour. We ordered mushrooms and a potato dish ( forgetting the name ) for starters and they were mouth watering. For ¬†the endings we had fresh banana pancake and chocochip waffles which i can vouch is the best i have ever had so far in kolkata.
Service guys were friendly and ever smiling, since we were a young group of guys intented to have full fun... they were very patient with us... I recommend this place to all who want to have a good time and enjoy great food.
They also serve hookah, which we couldnt try as there was no table available, so next time i wana experience that as well as i am told they have good food combos with hookah on weekdays..¬†

Good ambience quality good but quantity not good e.g the sizzler cost around 400 but can't serve a single person Complete. The quantity of pasta was average. Compared to chillis the price is same but quantity of food is too low. We are ready to pay price but u have to improve on Quantity, one can visit twice thrice but to get people addicted to you u have to make one stomach full.

After several recommendations from friends and like, decided to visit the cafe for a Sunday lunch. Loved the Hungarian styled fried fish and bikers chicken fusion discovery. 
Service is prompt,the decor also adds to the overall atmosphere.
Hope the cafe starts serving alcohol in the future. Bikers need some fuel to keep em running afterall!

An impromptu visit to this cafe turned out to be more than welcome experience.Located near the Forum Mall,the ambience of this place lives up to its name.Divided into two departments(Hookah and non-Hookah),the place has a certain American roadside bar theme,which is sightly decorated with parts of bikes and board games.
The spread of the cafe could've been more,but it manages to aptly suit itself with the decoration.
Coming to the food,we ordered Dijon chicken pizza,Lasagna non-veg,Italian chicken saltimboca and tasted perfect.
Had the place served beer,it would have brought a total american touch to it.

I am not a hookah person and the non hookah section is full of hookah smell. I have heard a lot of this place but somehow i was disappointed. The chicken wings we ordered was stale and smelly. We did put this across to the waiter but that did not get me any result. The wafles and the rest of the menu items we ordered were ordinary.

This place is located on lee road opp india bulls. It is on the first floor of the platinum building. The ambience is really amazing with foosball table and biking stuffs. The breakfast they serve is really great. Ordered one french benedict,baby spinache corn cheese sandwich,watermelon juice and masala chae. The salsa and mayo they served were amazing in taste. Service was quick and friendly. Food taste is really good. Prices are on a steeper side though. Had a really nice breakfast.

The Bikers Cafe is built to satisfy all your biking needs. The ambience is something that'll keep you wanting to go back. With the foosball table and the air hockey counter, waiting for our food was one of the other things that we enjoyed. Food was oh so good! Specially the lasagna with all the cheese. With a group of 6 people, we made quite a mess, but the staff were really patient. Desert of the day was a Chocolate cake with whipped cream, choco chips and caramel crunchies (nothing to complain there). Will definitely go back.

I go there often. The last time I went there was with my mother where we decided to ditch the routine and chill at the cafe. While we had sumptuous food like the mexican sizzler and desserts along with drinks, we enjoyed the ambiance of the place.

We played a game of Scrabble for a while and thereafter went on to read the papers until we decided it was time to head off!

One of THE BEST places I have been to.

Amazing food and a very unconventional theme together make this a total winner.
I had the Peri-Peri Burger which was undoubtedly the best burger I had till date.
The pasta was great too.
The interiors are so well thought-out and they have convincingly made it look like those bikers' hangout-joints.

P.S. : Foosball was super-fun. :D

The bikers cafe is amongst the new, quirky, comfortable cafes... With a gud range of choices in food... I met up a group. Of frnds after a long time... The satff gave us enough time to catch n gossip n took the order without unwanted nudging... Food was fresh,, nyc.. Grilled chicken and choclate waffle is a must recommendation...

Had been there for a Sunday brunch, and was pleasantly surprised at the various options they had. The staff was very hospitable and were courteous. The food was great, specially the quality of bacon and sausages. The waffles and pan cakes were also very nice. The baked beans was a tad disappointing as it was cooked in Indian style which didn't go well with the bacon and sausages. I also liked the big pans in which they served. The ambience was enjoyable.

Now coming to food, they have practically everything on there menu barring authentic north indian,but then its perfectly fine as there menu has choicest of things from around the world. We ordered bikers chicken fusion,salmon teriyaki,grill fish,chicken satay and thin crust pizza and found each and every dish delicious. Tried few of the mocktails,dont remember the names :) but all tasted good. Ended our dinner with dry fruits filled waffles and chocochip pancakes, yummyyyy is the word for it...I was told they open at 7.30 in morning and have an exclusive breakfast menu, cant wait to try it someday..may be this sunday :)

If you are an early riser and want to go out for a good breakfast, then this is the right place. They have various types of egg preparations , we were a group of 6 people and could order six different types of egg meals and must say each one of them was awesome. Different types of detox juices they have in their menu, we tried elixir of youth and pink of health as we found the names interesting, both tasted good also. A thumps up to the coconut mojito and sugarcane mojito which sounded very unique to me, so ordered it. We then ordered chocochip pancakes which i can vouch to be the best available in calcutta. I am really impressed with the food and service and so would definetely go there again to try their dining menu. Also saw that they serve hookah, so thats again another reason for me to drop at this cafe which not only serves great food but have very friendly servers to take care of u.

One of those places which are hyped about than they deserve. The decor is the best part about the place. I am not sure if "cafe" would be the right word to describe it. Its part fine dinning and part hookah/sheesha bar. 
As for the food there is nothing American or Biker-like about if u go by the portions. Specially the breakfast selection. The best things on the menu are the milk shakes. Try the banana milk shake. Its yum. The Egg Benedict with the salmon variant is spectacular and end it off with waffles or pancakes. The rest of the menu does not have the wow factor. 
However though they say its a all day breakfast joint its not. You won't get "breakfast" items post 7pm which includes the Benedicts.

Looking for some good coffee and snacks and a place to chill out.Yes then definitely you must visit The Bikers cafe.Am really happy that kolkata is coming up with such cool themed places. The bike themed cafe with  rustic look and some good food will definitely charge you up. They have a range of detox juices which I really loved.The pizza  and French fries wre good too. I felt the food menu is limited but no complaint with taste and quality.

Location:opposite forum mall
P.S: service is slow but its not a problm as you can enjoy the peppy ambience and yes its cool non alcoholic.

The Bikers Cafe is located nearby Forum Mall at the 2nd Floor of Platinum Mall. SUPERB interiors and rich interiors,  this place will definitely attract one. And with free wifi it definitely attracts many youngsters.This place gives you a wide variety of choices in menu.  I went there with 3 of my friends and we ordered Texas Spicy Chicken Cowboy Pizza , it was nice with thin crust and chicken toppings, then  Mezze Platter (non veg) , it s a wonderful dish with lamb and veg cutlets and the chicken sizzler which was yummy and with the perfectly cooked chicken and the rite amount of rice . Lastly we ordered desserts #Too hot to handle and #muddie on sundae. The too hot to handle was seriously too hot to handle, the molten chocolate will surely raise ur taste buds craving for more and muddie on Sundae is similar kind except for the molten chocolate. It is kinda heavy in the cost side but u will definitely not regret. These were a total of 1889 rs. I would definitely come back here as I wanna try out those burgers,  pasta and sandwiches.

Recently, I checked -in Bikers Cafe situated in  31, Platinum Mall (1st floor), Elgin Road, Bhowanipore, Kolkata, West Bengal 700020. As usual my friends and I were taking a guess at the total amount of the bill (we were far from the accurate amount). The bill was shocking because it was Rs.1000 more than we expected. I took a photograph of the bill to re-check later(photograph attached). I found the VAT wrongly calculated.As per rules of taxation, VAT of 14.5% should be levied only on the value of food and beverages.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†(INR)
Sub total                                                             2795¬†

Service charge (10% on Food and Beverages)   279¬†
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                                                3074

Correct Method:
VAT of 14.5% (on sub-total of 2795)               =405.28

However, Bikers cafe calculated VAT on Sub total and service charge(Rs.3074)  which amounts to 445.80. This malpractice should be checked with regular inspection. Most customers find the restaurant bills confusing and avoid the hassle of calculating the actual amount they are supposed to pay. It is essential for all customers to be vigilant and check the bill before payment.

We were a group of 20 and had gone post dinner for little chilling out.

The place has great food though we just ordered 3-4 dishes but there were very good.

But the service was very slow and the staff seemed un interested. It was a total put off.

The sheesha which came after more than 30 minutes of waiting was not all up to the mark. The room is so small with 10 sheesh around it became absolutely claustrophobic and became too difficult to sit there.

The place is great for food and games and having fun in smaller groups but they. Cannot service such a huge table.

Will go again just for the food but.

A super cool place to hangout with friends. Came for the first time on my friends recommendation as he sweared by his life that the hookahs here are damn smooth and real good & man sooo true he was. Really enjoyed hookah & to top it all they are running food combos if u order a hookah. Other than the combo we also ordered food from their menu which comprised of sizzler, chicken sandwich,jalapeno burger(yummm) & eggless chocochip pancake. They also have ps3 & foosball and board games... we didnt realise that we spent nearly 3 hours here...only thing we missed was beer...wish they get their license sooooon. ( see i have given a .5 rating less to this cafe only coz they dont have alchohol, else its a wow place ). The service was prompt & nice, the waiters properly aware of menu items and more than happy to suggest you. All in all a super experience. Will surely keep coming back.

Liked every bit of my 1 hour at the cafe. Decor is out of d box, food is good, nice concept. Overall, a place that is much better than competition. Staff seemed young and friendly. Prices are a little high. Parking is a nightmare. Taxis are best for this location.

Will be writing a short review, as I had only hookah there.¬†

I really appreciate the presence of this cafe in the city and the concept. The atmosphere was really a drive in cafe like. Even on a Wednesday afternoon, it was brimming with people.

Hookah lounge was where we sat ourselves. Ordered the paan masala hookah. Quickfire service. We were in a hurry so did not ask for a coal change or anything.¬†

Ambience is just perfect!! Populated yet calm. Prices are really worth watching out for.¬†

Located in a very good location, about less than a km away from Forum, this place has some potential.¬†
Eagerly waiting to haunt these guys again, this time with a plan!!

Cheers to Bikers Cafe!! Thanks for being a part of making my visit to Kolkata memorable.

The name is quite exciting which actually invites people to check whats its all about.. Went there with my group and what an amazing outing it was. 
We ordered fresh lime which was pretty good and then we ordered vegetarian lasagne which was pretty good. The main attraction was the games which is there. All our free of cost which includes play station 3 and fuse ball. The games bring a very lovely experience and makes the visit worth while.
A must go place.

I went to the bikers cafe for the first time...where i found they still dont serve liquor which is a dissapointment for some ¬†...we ordered ¬†some mocktails n coffee based drinks which were too sweet n very ordinary for the price charged,the mocktails were also dissapointing as the drink was not properly filtered....now the food we ordered .....Pizza was very much dull n tasteless ...the bread was okey but too crunchy...Lasagne was okey not tht upto the mark ...the major dissapointment was the ¬†nachos tht we ordered ¬†which was flat with no cheese, no flavour , they served plain nachos with no salsa sauce....overall a very dissapointing experience

I went to Bikers Cafe on my last visit to kolkatta...n what a place...Had read it on zomato under great breakfast and thought I should try it...The place is beautifully done with biker feel...the music played is retro so its quite enjoyable...I straight away ordered for the english breakfast along with egg white omlet,pancakes and paneer paratha...the english breakfast was super but the only minus point was instead of hash brown they served a aloo tikki but the quality of the meat served on the plate of superior...the egg white omlet was made to order so was perfect,just the way i like it....the pancakes were fresh n hot but paneer paratha was simply brilliant with very less oil...overall the experience was super and would love to go there on my next visit.

Went there with my friend for lunch.. Was surprise to find it a family placed.. Quite pricey and the music was really jarring on the ears.. Bass was too high, made it difficult to have a conversation. 
But other than this the food was great, portions were good enough for two people and the Tate was also really good. I liked the decor a lot bikes everywhere and even the waiter looked cute in their biker outfits. 
Would definitely visit again.

The only disappointing part is that they are not having liquor license :P Though they told they are getting it soon!! Otherwise food is awesome. Decor (with the Harley Davidson) is amazing! Price is also moderate. They have loads of varieties in food. They only suggested us what to order, and we were not all disappointed! 

Overall a very nice place for a group or couple! I would surely visit again! :)

I love the ambience of this place. The harley on display and the whole way this cafe is designed makes it a fun and relaxed cafe different from the other normal ones. Even the menu is quite a wide variety and quite like the salads and the different mocktails they have. A place like this is a need and not an option and I hope this place continues to stay and does well.

The pancakes, eggs Benedict with salmon, Arabic eggs were all delicious and good sized portions. The foozball table keeps kids ( and some adults!) entertained. Perfect breakfast or all day cafe, with a special mention for the great coffee

rarely does a cafe impress so much as this place in elgin road platinum mall.its is loud,boisterous and palpably youthful in spirit,and I am not just talking about guitar adorned walls,the ropes in the ceiling,the frisbee table,the hardcore music,the giant lcd,the bar table with brewing machine,but the whole attitude of the place.the waiters/stewards wear a bandana like west american streetgangs on their forehead,and just propped up beside the glass facade is a harley.coming to the food,I cannot possibly overdo in appreciating them.the lasagna and the choco chips pancake were utter delight,the pancake specially the best i've ever had in kolkata.before that virgin mojito and ginger ale were their refreshing selves in the cute "biker's cafe" embedded glasses.the one thing that was a bit letdown was¬† the spanish item gambas pill.its some buttered rice with succulent pieces of prawns,but they dress it with sauce very nicely.it's more looksie,less eatsie.overall,the it was one of my best sunday brunches in recent times.

This is my favourite american/ italian cafe after chillies. I was introduced to this place by my friend. It is located near forum mall. The ambience is that of a hard rock cafe which is quite unique in this city. There is the bike of Harley Davidson which is their landmark. The entire cafe has several bike accessories and seems very attractive. Also they have several board games to keep the customers busy while they prepare their order. 

Coming to the food, for starters we ordered:

1. Malaysian chicken satay- It is grilled chicken sticks which looks like the seekh kabab but tastes extraordinarily good. With peanut sauce dip, it was amazing.

2. Chicken peri peri burger- It consisted of crispy chicken fillet along with veggies and french fries.

3. Hazelnut coffee- It was too sweet but since i prefer sweeter coffee, i liked the taste.

My friend ordered a watermelon drink which she said was very refreshing

Fot the mains, we had:

1. Spicy mediterranean pizza- The pizza i had here tasted better than pizza hut and dominos. It was soft and had generous amounts of cheese.

2. Non veg mezze platter- i was too full after the pizza to have this. It had four types of dips with pita bread, lamb chops and chicken samosa. I had one samosa and one chop. Both were very delicious.

For deserts we ordered strawberry waffles which was crispy and served with a vanilla ice cream.

It was an amazing dinner. The next time i will come here for their famous breakfast !! :D

We were in the neighbourhood,and it was a sudden decision to go to The biker's cafe for breakfast.It is situated on the first floor of Platinum Mall.The decor highlights the name of the cafe,and the ambience is different but nice.We went around 12 but found it more or less,empty. I had the Peri peri chicken burger.and grape rasna  hookah. The burger was very tasty and quite filling.My friend had the amrican eggs and bacon breakfast. With tasteful music and great food on offer ,the biker's cafe would definitely be getting a second visit from us,soon!

Well for starters, I would like to say I had an excellent meal. The non veg lasagne was brilliant. The portion was good for 3 people. Also the spicy chicken pizza was yummy. I had a muscle relaxer drink, which was made well and my sister had a watermelon mohito which she enjoyed. Now for the little faults, 1) service was really slow for quite an empty restaurant which is expected at 1.15pm, there was just 1 or maybe a 2nd waiter, our had had his hands full, 2) for a 10% service charge I expect a faster and more efficient service.

I rate this cafe as one of the coolest place in town. It has all one would want on an eating day out with family. Visited this restaurant yesterday night for dinner with my wife and two kids.
I was very happy to see that there are so many options to keep kids occupied , so the time kids were busy playing the games, i and my wife got to have some good time chit chatting with each other :)
Coming to food, first thing i liked was their menu, must say they have lots of options to choose from. We ordered gourmet veg pizza, chicken satay, their chicken fusion dish, hangover killer , the name really appealed me ;) ¬†. ¬†For deserts we had the dessert of the day ( dont remember the name ) and some detox juice , again forgot the name but it was tasty and strawberry & chocolate milkshakes. We really had a wonderful evening and want to come again someday to try the breakfast here as the menu looks tempting and best part , i was told they open as early as 7.30am in morning.

Hmn..Bikers cafe never stops amazing me everytime i visit the area with friends ¬†. There constant additions of great experience whether its the ambience ,Food , service or feel is actually praiseworthy . Was very impressed with the new additions of Bread Pakora which tasted and looked awesome. The oil content was soaked out to ensure my stomach remains happy even after eating it :-) ,The Chola Kulcha was mind blowing and so was a very unique ratatulille (All veg). Apart from amazing tangy flavours , you could almost smell and taste freshness .¬†
The Service team was polite and welcoming as usual .Recommend they should open more options in cal (Recommend Salt lake :-))

Been to Bikers Cafe this morning with my friends as wanted to have a good breakfast. Checked zomato and found this themed cafe opens as early as 7.30 in the morning, so we reached here at around 8.30 and were amazed to see 5-6 tables already running at such early hours. It was nice to be welcomed by happy faces of the servers, we took a table facing the road near a customised bike with which we took some selfies.
Coming to the decor, it does justice when it calls itself a themed cafe. Interiors have been done with much detailing, loved the rustic feel and they have taken care to ensure guests get an adda feel, by having varieties of games,even PS3, Foosball and air hockey..(no extra charges :) to play with them )¬†
There food menu , i must say is also having some innovative and experimental dishes. The menu is quite wide catering to all kind of taste palletes ( from international world cuisines to very desi stuff ). ¬†We tried there eggs & bacon pizza, desi anda bhurji, Mumbaiya chutney sandich & bun omllete. All the dishes i must say were very tasty and has tempted me to visit this place again sometym for lunch or dinner to try there other dishes.
We found coconut mojito very interesting and tasty, other than that ordered hazelnut flavoured cold coffee & masala tea which were again very tasty.
A big thumps up to the cafe. Guys ur service rocks and also the food. All da best !!!

We visited the restaurant a second time for lunch, three of us. The service was excellent, however a major issue was with one of the three orders. Two of us ordered mecican chipotle sizzlers, if I remember the name correctly. The third order was a hamburger. The third order had a small centipede/caterpillar kind of an insect that probably came out of the lettuce in the burger. It was immediately brought to the notice of the attendants and they took care of it immediately. They were apologetic about it and compensated with a free dessert. My friends were generous enough to give them a great feedback even after this. It hurt my conscience and thought it as my duty to put it in record. Happy and healthy eating to all Kolkattans. Cheerio

Walked into the cafe one fine afternoon, with a friend of mine. Must say the location of the cafe is well chosen and bound to grab attention.
Inside the eatery, the story has been elevated to a different level. It's like one of those American diners which can make you forget about the time.

Fast ¬†and friendly service are so hard to come across nowadays that it deserves a special mention when it comes to Bikers.From the design of serving plates and other ancillaries to the well thought out Items to be dished out, much care on detailing is noticeable¬†

We ordered Salmon Benedict sandwich and Crepe with strawberry filling topped with Chocolate Sauce.Needless to say we didn't regret on our selection or indulgences .¬†

Delicious food ,Warm ambiance and friendly service ,Bikers has it all up it's sleeve.I wish Bikers All The Very Best. Keep on pampering and indulging customers with your delicious and decedent spread.

Anxiously, Looking forward to my next visit :)

I recently started Solo Safaris to Restaurants and places I can find in Kolkata to find my happy place in this city.

The biker's Cafe was one of my first trip destination and I was not disappointed.¬†

I went there and was greeted by the staff who directed me to a decent table with a cool view of the Harley Davidson with an option to view outside but not close to the windows. I was given attention which I liked.

I ordered simple. A special Cold Coffee was pretty good considering it was a freakish hot Saturday Afternoon. Despite the fact that I accidentally snuffed some cocoa in which we wont talk about, I liked the presentation and over all taste. ¬†I mean the cold coffee, not the snuffed in cocoa powder

Ever been to a place and thought you should have brought your best friend as well. The ambiance made me feel so. I wanted to share it with my friends. So next time if I am ever strolling near Elgin with some friends I will definitely drop in at The Biker's Cafe.P.S. I didn't like it when someone changed from "The Dark Knight" to A time to Kill. This is not a remark you deserve but the remark you need, jk. Ride Hard Boys.

Finally visited the Bikers Cafe today after waiting for them to get a bar license (which incidentally they still haven't got). We reserved our table before going but were still made to wait, clearly no table was reserved for us. Service was prompt, but a major mood-spoiler was that the staff were arguing amongst them selves near our table. The ambiance is good and trendy. The food we tried was adequate if not outstanding.

We ordered Mushroom Chardonnay, Fish Fingers and Chicken wings for starters. The Mushrooms and Chicken Wings were good. Main course were Vegetable Mexican Sizzler and a Prawn and Garlic pizza. The sizzler was nice. The pizza was innovative and different from the traditional taste of the pizzas available in the city.¬†

We also ordered a Green Coconut Virgin Mojito and a Ginger Ale with our food. Both were good.¬†

I wish to return and try the burgers, but hopefully, when they get their bar license. And I do hope they improve their service.

and each time I go I find an improvement. This is a very cool place and the ambience is great. They have also added air hockey now along with foosball . There are many games like scrabble and jenga and not to forget they have free WiFi which is a big thumbsup. It's a great hangout place. The staff is very efficient and the service is also quite quick. A good point is that they have a separate section for those who take hookah. The food is also good ... loved the penne arrabiata although I didn't like the mezze platter. They have a wide variety of waffles. I love this place and won't mind visiting it again.

Had bn really lookng forward to visitng this plc agn, and finally i gt one such opportunity tdy... Cumng to the ambience it is well built and spacious, thr eere too many games tht cud entertain childern.. 
The food that we ordered were Chicken Caesar salad, Malaysian Chicken Satay served with peanut butter sauce, Biker's Special Cold Coffee along with Dijon Chicken Pizza. 
Chicken Caesar Salad was okk to eat.. The dressings were very minimal, thr were hardly any cherry tomatoes and hardly chicken pieces in it which dissapointed me.. Overall the salad tasted okk.
Malaysian Chickrn Satay was nycc and the peanut butter sauce tasted gud.. A thumbs up to it!!
Biker's Special Cold Coffee was also okk.. Not grttt though not gud!!
Dijin Chicken Pizza was one of the horrible pizza tht i had in my life.. The toppings were minimal and the chicken on it were barely visible!!
The staff and the service were a let down.. The waiters hardly gave any attention.. We literally had to call thm agn and agn to voice out our concern..had to wait for 10 mins to get a glass of water!!! The service was a heavy let down.. Didnt expect this at all!! Service and the staff need to buck up !!
Overall i wud dfntly lyk to visit this plc agn if the service gets improved, to try out yhr mexican and thai cuisine !!

It is a good place to hangout with a nice ambience and a raw feel is provided to the interiors in order to make one feel as a biker. The menu is quite extensive and one has a lot of options to explore. I really liked the fun games that are available like the jenga, foosball for passtime. There is also a hog bike placed for the photo lovers. I really liked the dark lord shake there. The pasta is also good. The staff is also co-operative.

This themed multi cuisine restaurant @ elgin road was at the top of my wishlist to try as heard lots about it from my friend. finally, visited it on sunday night. We were lucky to get a table in 15 mins and while the time we waited for our food, we were offered some board games, which my kids enjoyed a lot. Service was very prompt and people were over5 polite & courteous. I was amazed that being such a packed up cafe , we were served our food in 15 mins and wow everything was so tasty. Their Peri peri burger and Gourmet veg pizza were awesome.Salmon teriyaki and bikers chicken fusion not only looked mouth watering but were equally tasty. Enjoyed the eggless waffles and ended our meal with there choco rose latte & hazelnut blast cold coffee... I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to not only have a great time but also enjoy good food... Its a must visit guys !!!

The ambience is awesome, all the shutter bugs will love it and the service is moderately good polite behaviour and friendly. Finally, the food was good we ordered burgers, sandwiches, sizzler platter and grilled fish items ( sorry forgot the names and the online menu isn't updated) it was good except for the sizzler, it was very dissapointing to taste, my burger was very spicy as it had peri peri chicken in it did not know that so could'nt entirely enjoy my meal, other than that it was a wonderful experience!! Should try at least once.

A relatively new place, The Bikers Cafe has a rustic touch to it, with a biker's feel.

The ambience is great, with very good music and while you're waiting for your food, you can spend your time by playing Jenga, Air Hockey and/or Foosball!

They serve an all-day breakfast, with various kinds of eggs and also Italian, Mexican, American and Thai delicacies, among others. The drinks are very refreshing and the food is equally good with a mix of flavours tingling your taste buds. A meal for two would be around ‚Çπ1500, but it's totally worth it!

This place never fails to make me a happy camper, almost single handedly making Calcutta an even more joyful place to live in. 

For a person like me The Biker's Cafe checks all the right boxes. They serve a long list of eggs from around the world, breakfast all day long, good music, free wifi and Scrabble. 

I have absolutely no complaints about the food or the portions and am always pleasantly surprised by the final bill. 

My personal recommendation would be the All American Full Throttle Breakfast, especially for those days when you force yourself out of bed midday to face the world.

Nice place in a great location....food is great   and very reasonably priced. They have a colorful and broad range of foods and beverages in their menu card and the service is great too... I just faced one problem( do not know whether it's a regular thing but it seems so).....a bunch of middle aged (and definitely frustrated)  women playing some kind of game that definitely involves money and shouting "maalamaal"....that was very much disturbing..the situation didn't change even after we complained!!! Don't know whether the administration is clear about their non-negotiables, if they have any...

I am surprised that i actually did bot visit this place much sooner. Such a great place it is to chill with friends and has a very different feel to it from the other cafes around town. Bikers cafe is located on elgin road near forum mall. It was a Saturday night and we went here around 8 or 9 of us. We ordered a variety of food and drinks and hookah. The ambiance was superb and the staff was also very nice.

We ordered fully loaded nachos which was good but can be better. The Mexican jalapeno burger was okay nothing great. The spicy Mediterranean pizza was really yum and for non veg we ordered the mexican chipotle chicken sizzler and grilled fish. I really loved the fish and the sizzler was also really good. The hookah was also nice and my sweet fresh like soda was just right amount sweet and refreshing. 

All in all it was a great experience and surely is a place where u can keep coming back without feeling bored of the place. A big thumbs up ??

My first time at The Bikers Cafe and I must say its a lovely lovely place. It just takes a few minutes to put you at ease and I just forgot that I am outside my home to try out a new place to eat. The ambiance is amazing and one of its kind, it is a cool and fun place, no one bothers you, you can be loud and have fun, there's ample space so you can be your own self, the interior is done in ¬†warm wood work and with interesting posters and paintings on the wall. The food was a pleasant surprise and all the dishes that we had ordered had a distinct and really good flavour. We had ordered Malayasian Chicken Satay, the non vegetarian Mezze platter and Mexican Chipotle from the sizzler menu, The Mezze platter is delicious and the Mexican Chipotle was too good. The desert options provided by them is wonderful and one can make a meal out of these sugar goodies ,I particularly loved the Blueberry Waffle. To top it off there are table games that one can play so you need not wait between meals. This is a place worth visit time and again.

If I have to recommend a friend outside kolkata a place to chill out and have great food then this place would just be it. Situated in elgin road inside the platinum mall the place leaves you dumbstruck with its ambiance, which is enjoyable and mesmerising and yet has a distinct serenity. The food served is too good and is above all praise. We had Malaysian chicken satay, Chipotle in sizzlers a mixed chicken platter with variety of sauces . All of them were unique in their own style and the distinct flavour has a secret that you would want to know. For dessert we had blueberry waffles. I would love to visit this place again and again and will highly recommend it to everyone who have come to kolkata from outside specially from different countries

Look raw, rustic and have that certain macho-ness that every undaunted biker dude, garage fella and roadie looks for. Good food, decent menu and ambiance and a little funky d√©cor accentuated by motorcycle parts like handle, wheels cover the walls. All in all, this place completely blends with the name.

Terrible Sunday lunch service - and I'm trying to refrain myself from using expletives here to describe the kind of service we received at this place earlier today.

Drinks did not get served for 20 minutes after ordering, and that too after a stern reminder.

Three entrees ordered. First the burger - came - 30 mins later - patty was cold, key ingredients missing - after pointing it out, the entree was returned to the kitchen to add the missing ingredients. Received the rectified burger - patty still cold.

Other two entrees were no shows. Only after being borderline rude with the waiter did the 2nd entree make its appearance. - over 1 hour later.

By that time we had already asked for our cheque, as my two month old nephew had run out of patience as well by then.

Oh yeah - couldnt help but notice "service charge - 10%" - what a joke

Never again...

Having read about Bikers cafe breakfast, this place was on my list to try. Unfortunately though i could not manage to go over for breakfast but did try it out for dinner one sunday evening. We were not very hungry so ordered a portion of chicken Vietnamees soup, a chefs special exotic salad with dressing on the side and the bikers fusion chicken. The soup was a light broth with robust flavours and crunchy veggies. The quantity is good for a light start to a meal for a single person. The exotic salad had a few watermelon cubes, fewer of the pineapple pieces, a couple of cranberries mixed with a few assorted peppers, a handful of grated cheese and chicken pieces and a lot of iceberg lettuce, which hence did mot feel like a well rounded salad mix. The dressing, a mayo dates dressing was well balanced in sweetness and sourness. The bikers chicken was an interesting dish. It had 2 thin slices of chicken breast grilled and basted well with peri peri sauce on 1 piece and a silky smooth pesto on the other. Accompanying this was a half fried egg woth plain steamed rice and a small portion of chicken roulade. The sauces were well made and the meat had a generous serving of these on it. The chicken itself however was a little dry. we also took a kiwi hookah on ice which was good. The ambience was not a great break away from a clich√©d bike cafe, nevertheless it was very well done. Music was the evergreen rock, a delight of course to the fans of popular hard rock. These aspects put tigether, bikers cafe makes for a good hangout place for those who enjoy a hookah and are fond of GNR, Nirvana, Bryan Adams etc. All in all a good experience and a place i would visit again, the next time for the breakfast though. Booze however is not available.

It is situated on Elign Road, next to Shambunath hospital. The moment you enter through the doors, it is like you're transported to the US and the biker gangs there. The decor is simply brilliant and the white bike standing right in front is the icing on the cake. 
The food is pretty awesome here and the mocktails are to die for. Their burgers are also pretty good.
Overall rating goes mainly for the ambience and the mocktails. 
Would definitely visit again.

Been there quite a few times. It is a themed food outlet and rich in decor. It is on the lined of American highway stop for bikers. The food is good and unique. Price is reasonable when compared to the quality and taste of the food. It is an ideal place to click some snaps specially in front of a harley davidson placed at the centre of the 2nd floor outlet.

This place is good in every department, be it food, decor or service. Its decor is classic like its got the hand stitched leather seat chairs, wooden tables, the heavily modified royal enfield  and even the door handle is a suspension and damper combination. Its got that old school vibe. 
Coming to the food, its great. These guys serve one of the best burgers in town. The knuckle head peri peri grilled chicken burger, this is a must when you visit this place. The lasagne and the sizzler are good too. The mexican rice in the sizzler was amazing but the chicken was bit on the bland side. Pizzas are kinda good  and reasonable. 
Coming to the cost its a bit on the expensive side like the burger is almost like 300 bucks but the food is worth the money

Ambience: Once you enter inside, you will find that the name suits it well. Everything is related to bikes: a full sized bike, bike headlight and helmet shaped lamps, foosball table etc. wooden furniture and shelves complement the theme. Music is also lively. You would really love to hangout at this place. 

Food: The menu is completely different than the other cafes. They offer breakfast as well. The Potato Potholes are mouthwatering, a great feast for potato lovers. Mexican Ham Sandwich is nice and Bikers Club Sandwich, with delicious smoked chicken pieces and egg, completes the taste. Hungarian Style Grilled Fish is a must try. The desert options are also very different. Waffles and pancakes are a great desert option. 

Service: The staff is very friendly. They pay a great deal of attention to your comfort and frequently ask whether you liked the food. 

Value for Money: Not very expensive. The taste and the variety of food is really good for its price. The menu options which are unlike a traditional cafe compel you to ignore the pricing.

Overall: A place with a perfect hangout theme, great menu options, amazing taste of food and the live music is good enough to woo you to visit this place.

We ordered a paneer burst sandwich and a English style coleslaw sandwich... Both were amazing... This was followed by a serving of chocolate chip pancakes... Oh My God.... It was fabulous... I mean the best that I have tasted till now....
The serving size was good... I wanted to try their waffle too but neither of us had place left in our stomachs... So much to my disappointment I couldn't try those.... But I m definitely going back really soon for their brilliant pancakes and waffles...

The food was yum! The portions are quite filling for 2 people.
Perfect place to chill with friends for hours! Foosball table and air hockey are added benefits. Though they require maintenance more like replacement. :-)
Food - 9/ 10. Shakes are especially mouth watering. The blueberry shake is a must!
Ambience - 9/ 10. Music is awesome and the rustic biker's theme adds to it. Servers are polite and non obtrusive.
After a long and tedious day, perfect place to relax with a energy shake and mouth watering chocolate pancakes.

An amazing place to chill out with friends and have delicious food. Have visited this place 5 times, and would love visiting it again and again. The ambiance is just mind blowing with superb decor and music. Coming to the food, on each of my visits I tried something new and was not at all disappointed. Chicken wings in BBQ sauce have become my favorite. Their house special cold coffee is amazing. The only disappointment was that didnt get the kancha/banta bottle. Would love tasting it here, after having tasted it during my childhood vacations in Punjab.

Although we went here for lunch one day, this would be a perfect place to have a filling breakfast or brunch. The menu lends itself especially well to that. The decor is exquisite, reflecting a slightly gentrified version of the beer-drenched American biker bar, often seen in shows like SONS OF ANARCHY, and the vintage bikes on offer are gorgeous to just ogle at.

As for the USP of this place, it's the only place I've found in Kolkata that serves a peri-peri chicken burger, the "Knucklehead", and it is gorgeous. (And yes, I first saw peri-peri in the HBO show LOOKING). The Angels in Egg's Womb was brilliant too, as were the iced teas. I am looking forward to going back to try the waffles, more of the breakfast options and the three-cheese blanched grape sandwich. 

Pocket pinch is considerable, but the food kind of makes up for it. And last but not the least - IT HAS A FOOSBALL TABLE. And as a diehard Friends fan, that earns a HUGE brownie point from me. The classic hard rock music playlist is also a huge plus.

Early morning breakfast at a diner! Well just that the diner has a twist, a twist of bikes. The biker cafe is a huge place serving some of the best items. Went here for breakfast with my cousins. Being from Delhi, I love having breakfast at diners. The breakfast culture in Kolkata seems to be a little off! The place was empty and dull. The food on the other hand made up for the dullness. 
Ordered the all American breakfast, pancakes, French toast and waffles. Everything was superbly amazing. A special mention to the waffles, the best I've had till date in India. Just the right amount of sweetness and crisp. Yum yum yum! Surly going to recommend this place to whosoever is coming to Kolkata. It's one of my favourites here!!

Ambience - 9/10
They've kept it very authentic to their American Biker theme. The dress code of the waiters also supports the theme. Wooden interiors with an actual motorbike used as a piece of d√©cor, and other such biker themed deco pieces. 
They also have air hockey and table football to add to the fun element of the place.

Bobby Brown Omelette - 8/10
If you have a cheese omelette fettish, this is a recommendation for you. The menu describes the dish in detail. It is served with a piece of hash brown, 1 slice of toasted brown bread, and butter. I somehow particularly like the hash browns. 

Peri Peri Chicken Burger - 7/10
Very different in taste, compared to the available Chicken Burger variety. Served with a shot glass full of fries, a cheesy mayo dip, and your decked up burger. 

Suggestions: Need more non-veg burger varieties in the menu.

I'm definitely going back to try the lamb burger I've heard about, and the Bobby Brown omelette!

Ambience-good, soothing, innovative..music selection is really good.a vintage bike is special attraction.there is also provision for zenga, air hockey, table football

Staff behaviour-very good.polite behaviour.good knowledge about menu.serving time is satisfactory

Food-really good.we had blue lagoon (really good, synthetic smell was absent)..malaysian chicken satay(good taste, accompanying sauce was not that good),buffalo wings(personally I did not like it),, mexican chicken chipotli sizzler(a bit spicey, tastes ok), biker cafe chicken discovery, french fries, chicken lasagna(really good one, authebtic taste), jack daniel lamb steak, fruit crepes, too hot to handle (sizzling brownie with vanilla ice cream) and classic waffle with vanilla ice cream & maple syrup....must try -jack daniel lamb steak(with mashed potato & saut√© veggies), bikers cafe chicken discovery(it had butter rice, egg poach, one piece of sausage, two chicken breast-one cooked in pesto, one in peri peri sauce)

Pricing-really expensive if compared with the quantity. But the quality is so good, you cant really complain :p

Overall-a grand experience, must visit with family & friends.will definitely visit again :-)

Next, the ambience. Absolutely brilliant choice of music, from old school rock n roll to jazz, funk and even a little bit of Bob Marley! Add to that the bike themed paraphernalia, posters and what all. Free Wi-Fi. And did someone ask for a Foosball and an Air Hockey table!?
 It's the perfect place to chill out with friends. And then food itself delicious. I ordered a Veg Lasagna, and no complaints whatsoever. Baked to perfection, and delightful! This is one place I'm gonna make a lot of visits to!

I had this place in my wishlist for a long time and finally visited this place a couple of days ago with my college buddies. This place is located just opposite to sambhunath pandit hospital,in the same strech of road one follows for the forum mall. To put it outright,this place is for the young gen Y kolkata crowd. The bikers cafe is a themed american diner and hats off to the management for the amount of perseverance thrown on the decoration of this place. As per keeping with the name,the decor is all about bikes,the history,some themed pictures,etc., but the best part is that the restaurant has an actual harley davidson bike and that for sure is a show stealer. The feel of the restaurant is very rustic with the wooden decors and the overall interior of the place. The ambience of this place is just awsome. There is also a small gaming zone having a foosball table and some other games and if with a big crowd it is a place for sure fun. But bikers cafe is not only about decor.The food of this place stands equally tall and their kitchen surely has some real good culinary experts. The menu has a very interesting choices for food and bevarages. Coming to bevarages first and then the food, we ordered creme mocha,hazelnut coffee and virgin mojito for our bevarages. The virgin mojito and creme mocha were superlative brilliant but my friend complained that the hazelnut coffee was too sweet and the sweetness somehow messed with the flavour. For the starters we ordered chicken satay with peanut dip and yes...the dish was impeccable in taste. The presentation of this dish was very good and the cute little tomato served at the side of the dish was a very artistic touch. The peanut dip was tasty and the satays were soft and creamy. We then tried the lamb steak and this was another thumbs up dish. This dish is highly reccomended from my side if visiting this place and I am sure of having this dish again on my next visit. We finished our course wih their all famous dijong pizza. The topping of the pizza was utterly delightful,the mozarella and the dijong mustard sauce encrusted was a clear winner,however the only glitch I felt was that in the crust of the pizza. The crust was way too thin for a thin crust pizza and it was way too crispy which made it a little messy while having it. The service of this restaurant is excellent and the staff are extremely friendly and polite,always serving with a smile. This diner is definitely a crowd puller and if they keep their services this good,they will surely go places. I am also very intrigued by their breakfast menu and some of their platters and I am surely going back to try them out.

If classic rock music and an overwhelming masculinity are right up your alley, this is the place to go (I enjoy the former,hence my visit was pleasant). This place has outstanding albeit exorbitantly priced food. I enjoyed every morsel of my meal+every sip of the house special milkshake. An excellent recommendation to those looking for a fine but not fancy experience.

The superb ambience with the Harley parked at its centre is a total crowd puller. The restaurant gave an ethnic american diner feeling. The upholstery also matched up in finesse. The menu is limited but sumptuous. The Dijon pizza was good and knucklehead burger was a cracker. The Mexican sizzler will not tickle the average Bengali tastebuds so one can give it a miss. The lasagne was also good but nothing great. Overall it was a good experience and one should try it atleast once to get to feel of the American biker genre. Cheers :)

Was totally floored by the ambience, the lights, the guitar, the bike...and loved the friendly and knowledgeable staff. Was there with a friend, on a Saturday evening and had ordered chicken sandwich, and this yummy dessert called 'split personality' (banana split with oodles of caramel). This cafe is something out of the ordinary and a happening and cool place too. 4.5 out of 5 stars to this. Minus 0.5 for the price (which seemed a bit on the higher side, but is mostly justified because the food is lovely and so is the ambience).

Had been avoiding this place for long, assuming it to be one of the wannabe concept restraus springing up every month in Kolkata. 
But bikers cafe surprised in a very good way.
Jumping straight to the point. 
What's good : 
-The amazing effort put behind the decor is sure to grab your attention... Intricate detailing done to the level of  helmet shaped lamps. 
- have visited this place twice in successive weekends for the food. The thin crust pizza, deserts, sizzlers are among the best you get in the city. the veg jalape√±o burger is a must try. 
- drinks options are good. Mojito was a bit disappointing with too much lemon. While the coffee was well prepared. 
The place also has decent  parking options 

What's not. 
Nothing much. Except for the point that such a setup demands liquor. 

Kudos to the people behind for putting up such a good package.

It was my first visit to Bikers  Cafe.
Except for the 'fully loaded nachos' which was a miss , this visit was all positives for me. 
The Ginger Ale was perfectly balanced . The garlic bread was one of the best I have had. As for the mains the white sauce pasta and the vegetarian gourmet pizza were absolutely delicious . The highlight however, for me was the Italian sizzler. 
The staff is extremely cooperative , the servings are hearty and humble and the ambiance unique and comforting .

11th June 2015 . Second Visit.

Again arrived for a lavishing breakfast. It didn't fail to disappoint us yet again .

Ordered a Spanish Haven and French Benedict this time.
I didn't try the French Benedict but basically there were two bread loaves with poached eggs on it. There was an amazing complimentary sauce and potato something. It looked amazing. My partner loved it.

I had ordered Spanish Haven for myself.
Giving it 4.5
It was a mixed omelette that had potato blocks, capsicum, sausages, other vegetables. There was Hash Brown and Ham on the plate too complimentary with the same amazing sauce.

Also ordered Ginger Ale. Gets 3.5 from me.

Bill came up to 800!
However I was so full that I lasted till 5pm without any food. That speaks of the quantity.

Till now, my favorite Breakfast destination.

First Visit:
Decor : 4.5
They have this cute and sexy bike riding theme. The tables and walls are wooden adding a very nice effect to the whole theme. Youve got games and LCD screen to occupy both the adults and kids. Sunday mornings are crowded it seemed with the whole family coming out for breakfast.

Service: 3.9
Service was a bit slow in the beginning due to the crowd. Many guests complained but I could see that they were doing their best. And some guests had forgotten the difference between their servant and the waiters. Its sad to see how some of the guests treated them. They are here to serve you food and make your visit pleasant. A little patience would have been nice.

Food :
So I ordered the All American Breakfast along with Pancakes.
The combo had sausages, omelet, tomato something, bread with butter and some orange jam.Giving it 4.0
The Pancakes unfortunately were VERY sweet. It was impossible to eat it after a while. We did have a talk with the waiter and I am sure it wouldn't happen again. However for this experience, ill give it 2.0
My sister ordered some Bobby Brown combination that had bread and Mushroom omelet. Since im not a fan of Mushrooms, so I cant rate it. She didnt complain though :)

Value for money : 3.8
Whatever I had seemed good enough for the price I paid. Both combos and a drink came down to some 800.

Will DEFINITELY visit again.

The food is just Ok. could eat the meat but fish was aweful. Service is quite slow.
As the name says bikers cafe, trust me after you enter looks more like a kids zone than anything about bikes or bikers. The only thing here about ¬†biking are the seats & a bike placed to create the ambiance. Thaz it!

Overall, had a bad experience & moved to the nearby restaurant after having some stinky fish one,to get rid of the chaotic place because of the children playing around & second for not so good food.

The Best Breakfast spot in the town. Went there with an old friend from Mumbai. And stayed awestruck with every dish that came by. Brilliant service & hospitable staff. Easily the favorite restaurant of all time. The details of the place from decor till the playlist is perfect. Economical and worth every penny.

I decided to visit this place after reading the reviews on zomato. Honestly, I couldn't spot it at once. it took us a while to figure out the location! However, the moment I entered the place, I was blown away! The wooden floors, wooden tables, the bike on display...everything was so detailed. It is one of the few themed cafes which actually live up to its name 'The Bikers Cafe'.. Even the waiters wear bandanas on their heads! They have these little biker motifs everywhere, in fact the glasses and the water jar were so cool that we would buy them if they were on sale! ;) And then you have awesome old school music too.. Beatles, Bob Marley.. What else do you want? Coming to the menu.. they have a variety of spread to choose from. I was actually 'quite full' when I went there. But my friends were not (Well, they are never full! You know what I mean! ). So we ordered 2 portions of All American Breakfast with pancakes and honey in 1, and maple syrup in the other. One of my friends being a vegetarian, however tempted he was with the scrumptious non veg spread, had no choice but to settle down with some sad and boring veggie dish (No offence to any veggies out there. I'm just a hardcore bong who survives only on non veg!). So he ordered a Veg Lasagne. For beverages, I ordered my favourite Irish Coffee while my friends experimented with different varieties of cold coffee like the House Special Cold Coffee, Dark Lord and Hazelnut Blast! I should definitely mention that the waiter was really friendly and patient enough to describe each and every dish so that we could be sure what to order! However, they did take some time to prepare the food but we had no complaints because we played Jenga while the food arrived. I had no clue how to play Jenga, and the waiter, again very patiently, explained the rules of the game to us. We completed 1 round of the game which I lost but then the food had arrived by then and it looked so delectable that I forgot the game and attacked the pancakes and devoured the same. The pancakes were so soft that it melted in my mouth and I finished it off in a jiffy before my friend could even realise that there were pancakes served with his American Breakfast! Needless to mention, he didn't stop pulling my leg for the rest of the day stating that I finished his pancakes because I was 'too full' apparently! However, the only letdown was that the quantity was kinda meagre if you consider the price you are paying! However, the veg lasagne was surprisingly very tasty. And considering the fact that I am a hardcore non vegetarian and I do not let go of any opportunity of taking digs at my veggie friend, I finished more than half of his lasagne! Yet again, he too kept teasing me the whole day that I finished his lasagne because I was 'too full'. Anyway, TBC makes really good coffee. Undoubtedly one of the best cold coffee I have had in recent times. Also, the hazelnut blast, dark lord and irish coffee were all brewed to perfection! I think we spent hours there..eating and sipping the coffee..and chatting away to glory.. In fact it's the perfect place to hangout with your friends. And if you have a crazy gang like I do, you should definitely go there. Cos the staff were really polite and didn't complaint, rather seemed to enjoy when my friend got up from his seat and kept doing some crazy mimicry and we were literally ROFL! So yeah, TBC is a cool place to hangout, with good food and extremely chic decor! I'm definitely coming back wit my gang. :)
P.S. Browny points for the Foosball table.. : D

Great theme & interior added to real quality food and tempting menu of food and non-alcoholic drinks & hookah. Great location near Forum Mall, so Foodies need to hit the unique cafe which is nearing its 1st anniversary.. Throughly enjoyed the All-day breakfast and chose for both the bacon & sausages instead of either of the options to satisfy myself.. The House Cold Coffee is one of the best cold coffees ever with the right amount of strong coffee and sugar blended to perfection.

My experience got even better during my latest visit after trying the most awesome juicy burgers in Kolkata - KnuckleHead Peri Peri Grilled Chicken Burger. The creamy Bikers Soup was the day was pretty good served in an unusual soup bowl. We also tried the Mexican Chipotle Chicken Sizzler, a chicken dish prepared with veggies and spices in Mexican style served with spicy rice and fries was also quite good. However the dish seems to be too spicy to overcome the taste buds and maybe the fries could be accompanied with a mayo dip to neutralise the same. The house cold coffee as usual was brilliant!!

Should also mention that every staff at the cafe is really well behaved and makes everyone feel welcome all the time.

Bikers Cafe has fresh, new and happy feel. Though a part of the tending concept cafes at Kolkata, its not just another one. Its a concept cafe with extremely detailed and eye catching interiors, good music and of course the king of all - great food. They serve amazing pizzas with crisp base, juicy cheese and toppings. The sizzler was made very well. The quantity of food was just fine. It had great variety of drinks and desserts as well. To top it all they have a very impressive juice menu, healthy and tasty. I would also like to try their breakfast some time.

The staff was very well aware of all the food being served, and gave good suggestions. Nice music and nice service. They left me impressed. Certainly worth the money. With just nothing to complain about, I rate this place 5.

A really nice place to eat your breakfast(specially after caramelle cafe got closed down). The burgers are nice. So are the fixed all English breakfast. They have done up the place quite nicely( I think I even saw a lowrider there). Bikes and burgers and decent music with sunlight coming in a temperature controlled atmosphere. What more do you want from Kolkata?

This place has been in my list for sometime. Today I and my friend went for breakfast. Mouth-watering food and even at 10:30 am the place was relatively crowded. A big thumbs-up for Foosball and Air Hockey.¬†
Lets talk about the food: My friend ordered American Breakfast while, I ordered Bikers special with Bacon (extra).For juice we ordered Pink of Health and Free Flow.
Then we ordered buttermilk pancakes and chocolate chip pancakes.
The hash brown and omelet was good. The pancakes was so good and yummy!
Affordable and good for place! This place is a must if you want to have good breakfast!!

This was the second time, we (me and two of my friends who are not on Zomato yet) planned to visit & it was worth it's weight in gold. The ohh-so rusty ambience is one of the most striking part of this dine-in powerhouse. And free wifi, who does not love free wifi? (laughs) We quickly scanned the place and I was really impressed by the way every detail was taken with a tinge of vintage-ness to it. We ordered for Caramel Desire to start with - which was strong in flavor added with the right amount of milk. Moving on, we ordered for mushroom chardonay, mixed sauce pasta & mixed platter. Mushroom chardonay was the show stealer in true sense. The flavors were really coming along. But, it wasn't spicy at all. Mixed platter includes falafal with four choices of dips - which tasted really like the falafals should taste. Add to that, the mixed sauce pasta - prepared well and served hot, yummilicious.¬†

A pat to the attendee who took care of us. Infact, everyone attendee out there were very generous.¬†

We also tried our hands at air hockey & foosball. It picks up the energy really.

Highly recommended. I will visit again as I missed out on waffles. Sigh.

We went there intending to catch a quick bite in the morning before work and found an inviting little joint, crammed full of all the biking grunge you can think of, and topped off with cheery American country music! The food was exceptionally good. We tried the All American Breakfast which was top notch. However, the Ham and Cheese Sandwich with Sweetened Apple reached the table without the sweetened apple! When asked, they defended by saying that often people find it too sour so they conveniently left it out! They were quick to rectify themselves, though, and my sweetened apple arrived in a small bowl shortly, and I must add that it amplified the taste of that sandwich greatly! Their house special cold coffee is a rich, creamy treat. The service is quite prompt and all-in-all it was quite a memorable experience. Will definitely visit again, soon, to try out their main courses. Brownie points for the twin flat screens that were playing the match!

TIP: Don't miss out on their crisp, perfectly done waffles!

The Bikers Cafe is one of the many places that are coming up with new concepts. The theme and the interiors are well balanced with enough of both, natural and artificial lights. 

Must haves at that cafe are:
1. Pizza
2. Mezze Platler
3. Oreo/Hazelnut Shake
4. Chocolate Waffles 

The staff has detailed knowledge about the menu and its ingredients in order to guide the customer well with his/her order query.

This cafe has to be one of my favorite places to eat out in Kolkata. 

The ambience is classy, sporty, fun. The restaurant is airy, a lot of natural light shines in during the day. The staff is very friendly. 

Loved the fresh juices being served here. My favorite thing to eat here is the Lamb Steak in Jack Daniel's sauce. Simply fabulous!

The prices might be a tad on the higher side but the experience makes up for it!

Our usual disclaimer applies: We are vegetarians and our review too will be of vegetarian food.
With that out of the way, we visited Bikers cafe a week back. The ambiance is fantastic. It's an all wood and metal finish with cool bike accessories all over the place. The headlamp of a bike complete with the spread out handle bars as well as a completely modified chopper, the place lives up to it's name. The menu is well stocked, but simple. We ordered a serving of fully loaded nachos, an Iron Head Biker BBQ Ranch burger, an eye opener, a house special cold coffee latte and a le waffles de strawberry.¬†

Their servings were pretty large and they tasted fantastic. The Nachos were crisp with generous dollops of salads, mustard and sour cream all drizzled over them. The Ranch burger was huge, juicy and delicious and was accompanied by a serving of fries, ketchup, mustard and a finger licking ginger-chilli-mint dip. It was lip smacking. The juice and the cold coffee were above average as well. The dessert was fantastic. Fresh, hot and crunchy waffles covered in fresh cut strawberries and a spread of strawberry jam with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream was a perfect way to end a great meal.¬†

Overall, Biker Cafe is a sumptuous and cozy hangout replete with biker gear and accessories which you can purchase over the counter. Moreover, they open at 7 to start breakfast. If you plan to ride out from Kolkata on a brisk early morning, make sure to stop by!

We ordered Nachos, which was different from the usual and that really surprised us! Very rarely do we see, Nachos in a different manner, still a pleasing taste. Thin crust pizza, was a delight too. But the best of the lot was the chocolate pancake. 

Look forward to visiting again!

Heard a lot about this popular cafe, so dropped in today for a quick bite. Located at Elgin Road near by Forum Mall, the cafe will catch your attention from quite a distance because of the sexy Harley Davidson that can be seen through the glass wall from across the street. The moment you enter, you get a Hard Rock Cafe feel. In the waiting area several cool biking stuff are put up, along with bikers' stories. Once you get in, the feeling is quite cool and chic, with some rock music playing to refresh your mood instantly. Quite a cool place to catch up with buddies for a fun session. Wooden floor, glass walls over looking the Elgin Road, rock music, quirky table mats, cool ceiling everything adds up to the rock ambiance of the cafe. Adequately lit up to be at par with their rock ambiance. They even have Foosball, Air hockey, in case you want to play a friendly game with your friends.
¬† The staff is friendly and efficient, they will readily come to you, greet you with a smile and introduce themselves.
¬† Now lets talk business, food that is. I am not impressed with whatever little I tried. Ordered Too Hot to Handle, which is a sizzling hot brownie served with a scoop of ice cream on top. It wasn't anything that great. Just okay, anyway with such an ambiance and friends with you, nobody would care about the food much, provided its not absolutely obnoxious. Their Buffalo Wings, which is nothing but chicken wings in bbq sauce served with french fries is at par with that of Dominos, nothing great again. But, they must do something to raise the standard of beverages that they serve. Struggled hard to finish the Orange Surprise and Virgin Mojito that my friend and I had ordered.
¬† Pretty expensive, cost for two for a little bit of snacking would be around 1000/-.
¬† But must visit for a Hard Rock Cafe feel in Kolkata.

At last got to visit the very hyped , the first biker's themed cafe in Kolkata and surely had my money'$ worth. First impression is the entire wooden decor , well crafted with a great sense of uniqueness like using shockers for a door knob and fuel tanks glued to the walls which signifies the rustic biker's feel to it. Flanked by the fussball and air hockey table on one side and the magnimous white Harley - Davidson parked in the middle , biker's cafe truely delivers a virile atmosphere almost similar to the roadside cafes for the bikers in the west. Great place to hangout with frndz. Coming to the most important part, the food . The food is really mouthwatering and sumptuous , momentarily I forgot about the place as I gorge on the iron head bikers BBQ ranch burger. Then we also tried fully loaded nachos , the " twin cam" fish burger and lastly the Texas spicy chicken cowboy pizza . The food are well garnished with various add-on like mayo dips , French fries and finger chips . The price is also very decent. A very apt place for all the ardent bike lovers and also for non biker like me who went to enjoy a leisure Sunday afternoon with good food and great rock music . Overall its a great concept joint and a must visit.

Deserts were so good that we were fighting with each other for every bite :P. Service was also very good though mocktails and juices are below average. The place few big screens, so it can a very good place to hangout and watch some match. Also there is fuss ball table for entertainment.

Location: Very close to both Forum and Exide crossing. It's located at Elgin Road and can be easily spotted from the Macho Harley Davidson that can be viewed from across the street. Parking only outside the premises and no valet. 

Ambience: Wooden floor, Harley Davidson, Foosball, Jenga and PS3. It‚Äôs a guy‚Äôs DEN (absolutely not being a misogynist, it's just the words). They added a lot of zing inside to bring out the hardy feeling. Music was nice with some Bob Marley, Dirty Dancing and the old school likes. Separate room for shisha aficionados. It was small and cozy with a PS3 (Only NFS available, two controllers) and couch. The wooden bench looked nice but wasn‚Äôt very cozy to sit for too long, obviously gave that a miss. 

Food and Drinks: Let‚Äôs not judge this place with the name Bikers Caf√©. Who cares, no alcohol? Drink milk, surprise your liver???? Jokes apart, I think you can give your beer a miss for the awesomeness of Milkshakes. For people who still think milkshakes aren‚Äôt their thing, there‚Äôs nothing to worry, as the server made us believe that liquor license is on it way. I trust him.

DRINKS: Vanilla Milkshake and Banana & Honey Milkshake. Vanilla was plain old school and tasted very natural. Banana and Honey was mind blowing and can really sooth your palate. 

SHISHA: Tried their Paanch Pan flavored hookah, it was pleasant. It served its purpose smoothly without any chocking or smoke issues. What more can I say?


FOOD:  The True Business part comes now.

Season Fruit Bowl: Fresh fruits consisting of Watermelon, papaya and strawberry (Allergic to pineapple so skipped that). Beautifully sliced and neatly served but was expecting more fruits like apple, banana, kiwi, grapes etc. which could have made the platter really interesting.

Fully Loaded Nachos: It was good with salsa sour cream and shredded lettuce sliced on top. They don‚Äôt add beans or guacamole on top but nevertheless it was a pretty filling appetizer.

Knucklehead (peri peri grilled chicken): I really didn‚Äôt taste this but the presentation was fantastic.¬†¬†My friend

I had heard good things about the ambience and it dis not disappoint. Liked the decor.
But regarding the service and the food ,NOT SOO MUCH.
to begin with, we had ordered All American breakfast, first of service is a bot lousy.
They forgot to bring the sausages,I had to remind them to get the sausage.
It also does not say if it is meat or chicken sausage.
The sausage and hash brown did not seem fresh cooked but packaged and frozen stuff heated up.
¬†Serving only a SINGLe slice of brown bread for a full breakfast was a lil too less of a portion.
Typically some baked beans are to be served which was missing from the platter.

Also had ordered Jerk chicken sandwich, which was quite dry.Not the melt in your mouth flavor.

Lastly Service charge of 10% is included in the bill, so you dont get to pay for the service the way you feel ,but the way they feel you should feel!!

For the price NOT the best .
A Yay for the decor a Nay for the food and price!!

It's a great cafe with amazing ambience. They have given a full feel of a biker's paradise. It looks like a sports bar and serves amazing coffee! The food is also great.
We ordered Italian sizzler, Italian chicken, and Lasagne.¬†
For the drinks, we had Dark lord and Hazelnut coffee. We ended our meal with amazing choco chip pancakes.¬†

The food, drinks, desserts, ambience everything is great but the service could be improved a bit.

P.S. The place will get more happening once they start serving alcohol.

The Bikers Cafe..so after hearing and reading so many positives from my foodie friends I was so looking forward to get a feel of my city's changing face in terms of cafes.. You see from the Mitra Cafe of yesteryear to todays these kind of cafes. So lets get into the review.
¬†
Ambiance - Dudes and chicks alike , you will loooove the ambiance here..Rustic, macho, sporty however you may describe it, the biker motifs and installations on their walls like the helmet lamps and that gorgeous white and gold Harley Davidson..it rocks!!

Food - They are essentially casual dining but before starting I must mention about their plating..its so arty and neatly done. So we ordered
1. Malaysian Chicken Satay - 6 pieces of well cooked chicken strips that comes with a peanut dip. The chicken were soft, and a very balanced taste along with the dip and the aroma of the peanuts never overshadowed the taste of chicken. Thumbs Up.
2. Cajun Tender Chicken - Comes in 6 pieces long with 3 dips, a mayo, a sweet chilli and a green chilli. As the name goes, its mildly spiced and yeah its tender with a little crispy outside.
3. Spaghetti Meatballs - Very ¬†light and mildly spiced yet quite tasty, the portion is good for one. The meatballs were tasty with a balanced spice level to match up with the relatively blunt spaghettis.
4. Bikers Chicken Fusion - It is a full meal for one. It comes with steamed rice, a poached egg sunny side up and two combinations of chicken one in peri peri sauce and pesto being the other. Recommended.
5. Jack Daniel's BBQ lamb steak - Well, we didnt quite get the lamb in BBQ sauce as they were out of it , instead they made it in black pepper sauce. Wont say it was not good, the gravy was tasty but the lamb disappointed and it was a bit overcooked and got very chewy and rubbery.
6. Masala Cola - The classic masala infused cola.¬†
7. Waffles - Dessert of the night. Mindblowing to be honest. I never had much of experience with waffles before this, but I can tell hands down..we tried both the variants..Chocolate and Strawberry , both were awesome..wasnt too crispy or hard, had absolutely no problem in cutting those and were soft enough to give that gooey feeling in mouth. Another must have in my opinion.
P.S. They gave a vanilla ice cream complimentary to have along with the waffles. Nice gesture folks.

P.P.S They also gave complimentary Nachos in a sour cream in the beginning.¬†

Service - The waiters are polite, actually very polite considering we were like acting crazy over there with friends, knowledgeable about the items and had good attitude. Serving time is almost 20-25 mins approx during rush hours .

Overall, had a lovely evening. Would have given a 5 except for the overcooked lamb. Would love to visit again. Cheers!!

Bit of confusion with the serving,  mohito and blue lagoon was nice. Thin crust pizza was nice and the famous burger was juicy and mouthwatering, interiors are interesting and different.

There are few restaurants where you will find the perfect amalgamation of overseas recipes with desi khana and the result is that people are pouring into these places to savour all sorts‚Äô foods to satisfy their taste buds. One of such places is the Bikers Caf√© where you will find some American specialties, desi treats, French gourmet breakfast, sweet items for those who have sweet tooth. Such is the variety that whenever I am there I try different food items; I love their salmon Benedict which provides a different flavor and taste from our homemade ‚Äòmacher jhol‚Äô. I have seen how pancakes are made on several cookery channels but it is the Bikers Caf√© where I first tasted buttermilk pancake, fresh banana pancake, also choco chip pancake. Waffle is another item which I love to eat. So their classic waffle, banana waffle, strawberry waffle also are on the platter. There are multiple fish items which one can gorge. Grilled fish is something I always look for, so the Biker‚Äôs Caf√©‚Äôs Hungarian style grilled fish is my favourite with that I also prefer bikers chicken fusion discovery, pang yum kaffir thai fish.

Went to bikers for my birthday breakfast! We called for cheese garlic toasts which was amazing. A cafe latte which was very good. Fish finger... Juicy crunchy and perfect :) and an Italian chicken which was bland and hard... They replaced it even before we could complain! The service is great... They take feedbacks with interest! Amazing ambience :) cheers!

Bikers cafe is pretty lively, comfortable and serves good food at decent prices !!!

Bikers cafe, being a concept cafe has a lovely ambiance with the decor all circled around the concept. The main attraction being a HD bike in one corner and various parts and spares of a bike etc adorning the walls. The staff service is top notch and music is pretty cool. Overall a great place anytime of the day, be it for a dining or conversations over coffee and snacks.

Coming to food, they have a big menu with some pretty lovely preparations. Pothole potatoes, spaghetti alio olio, mezze platter, nachos, pancakes are ones that a must try in my opinion. Pizza, burgers are good but a bit over-hyped here in my opinion. They make decent coffee and rose latte being highly recommended by a friend, is what i wish to try next. They make great waffles and its superb if you wish to end your outing on a sweet note.

Overall a great place with nice, comfortable and spacious interiors, great staff service and nice food !!!

Devil is in the details, and Bikers Cafe knows that. A dream vintage bike right at the centre, and everything else following the theme. Nice thin crust pizzas, good white sauce pasta, apparently some good salmon. A little steep on price and a little too slow.

Initially Biker's was a place for coffee. Oh Yes! They serve the best cafe latte in town. So whenever I wanted a hit, I would go to biker's. They serve exactly the kind of coffee I like. The ambiance gives you a good vibe. It's all wooden and british and cool. And, so the visits here happened often. 
Besides the coffee, the pancakes are THE PANCAKES. I love the choco chip pancakes. 
This is one of the very few place that serves delicious mixed sauce pasta. The pizza that I had tried was good too. Basically, more than good.  
I love the place for everything that a cafe is loved for- ambiance, music, food and COFFEE! 
P.S. They play the Beatles. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I loved it. The concept is very unique with an amazing decor and it is a must visit for everyone. We went there n a Sunday afternoon and after looking at the menu I wanted to taste everything. We ordered Cajun chicken, grilled chicken sandwich,waffle with maple syrup, blue lagoon and lime cola. I loved each and every dish. Moreover I m a huge fan of waffles so I ll say waffles were the best and the maple syrup was better than anyplace. Will visit soon.

This place is very conspicuous and well located.It follows the biker theme very well,from the biker type look of the waiters wearing bandanas to the bike on display right on the front window.Even the wall is adorned with parts of bikes.So I completely loved the ambience and the decor.The tables are also very well spaced out and the place looks spacious.
Coming to the food,we had ordered Malaysian Chicken Satay,Mexican Chicken Sizzler and Arnold Parmer from the drinks.
First of all the food took a while to arrive,but the waiter said this happened as there were two parties going on simultaneously.
Anyways so when the food arrived it did look very delicious,attractive plating !

The malaysian Chicken Satay was very juicy but soft with a slight bar b q flavour.It was good but I did not like the garlic dip served with it which should have been more tangy and should have hit the tongue more,moreover it was on the warm side so that killed the dip.

The sizzler was a let down.It was basically mexican rice with chicken but it just didnt seem like a mexican dish which normally has that tingling effect on the tongue.There was something missing.

The Arnold Parmer tasted like a normal lemon ice tea with slightly mellowed down taste of lemon.Good.

The staff was polite and courteous.They took my review form very seriously.
Iv decided that I would give them another chance just because of the ambience and decor.
People there seemed to be enjoying their meal,so hoping I enjoy the next one here!

A very nice place to chill with a ambience that the name truly justifies. They have really nice food that's prepared a little different from the regular preparations that we eat here in Kolkata. So you're going to love it if you love enjoying different kind of things. One of the best places for breakfast too if you're not looking for a 5 star.

The Bikers Cafe is one of the best breakfast joints I have been to. Everything about this place does complete justice to the name. The entrance, the wall, the decor, all are related to motorbikes. I was particularly swept away by the music. We visited for breakfast and they had all english folk on the loop with Simon and Garfunkel, Denver, Dylan, Baez, The Brothers Four in the list. 
We ordered a Bikers Special breakfast which has a Bobby Brown Omlette- comes with poached tomatoes, two slices of Brown Bread and Chicken. The Omlette was the star, it contained mushrooms in it and was absolutely scrumptious. 
Another very interesting part of the menu is the detoxifying drinks they offer. I asked our server to bring us two of their best tasting detox drinks to which he brought us Elixir of Youth and another Pink Juice for Kidney and Liver. I cannot make up my mind which one I liked best since both were unbelievably delicious and refreshing. We also ordered for a Cafe Latte which looked Picture Perfect with the Latte Art on top and tasted neat and strong. Then we finished with Waffles and Berry Compote. The waffle was crisp and berry compote came with nuts and was a perfect mixture of sweet n sour. 
Pocket Pinch : 1200/- approximately.
The food was very filling and unquestionably satisfying. I wait to try their Pizza and Pasta and the rest of the detox drinks. I am going back soon and so should you. :)

The ambience was the place is chilled out. The menu is quite different from most places.
Though the strawberry waffle was a disappointment as the waffle was dominated with crush and fresh strawberry taste was not that well.  Even the waffle was over done and too crispy.
The shake and coffee was good. Even in the shake i found the brownie pieces too big for shake and little too goey.

I was here last Thursday. Strolling down the street I saw this white beauty gleaming and that drew me in right away. The first thing I noticed was the shocker shaped door handles, +1 for impression. The interior is tastefully decorated and the music was good. I liked the ambiance. I was very much full, hence didnt eat anything though, but I had a double espresso shot and I very much liked it. I dont know about the food they serve, the surely serve good coffee. I ll check this place out once more at least soon to review the food.

It pains me to write a review for your joint as I had huge expectation...First impressive point is you open at 7:30 and your staffs are very polite and well trained..

Now the sad bit...

Grilled Jerked Chicken Sandwich - What did you use instead of chicken? It tasted like processed soya bean - not even chicken...Only I could taste the caramelized onion ! Nothing else...Coffee was mediocre...

I will never dare to taste anything Non veg in your place..Scared of the ingredients....Decor is outstanding..Are we just paying for the decor then? Because the food and drink are not worth the money ! Either you work on it or just become another mediocre decorative coffee shop...for eg our beautiful Wise Owl :P

Here's a place to perk up your day with amazing breakfast. The ambience is posh with a rustic touch, artfully decorated with all things reminding you of bikes and road trips. That's bound to set you in the high gear!! The highlight for me was definitely their grilled chicken peri peri burger-heaven! And the rose latte coffee..it's gonna give ccd a run for their money. The breakfast assortment is quite good especially when served with a smile. The hospitality definitely earns the place a brownie point. So spruce up your winter mornings with the biker's cafe spread! They also have jenga! How cool is that, eh? ????

The name of this caf√© always excited me to make a visit. One fine morning without much thought my friend and I decided to drop in, coincidentally it was a Sunday. Biker‚Äôs Caf√© serves a unique breakfast buffet every Sunday. Unknowingly, we went waiting to be surprised. The d√©cor and the music didn‚Äôt let me down. My friend being a bike lover loved the d√©cor where a bike is kept in display and factoids and miniatures are put up over the wall. I loved the choice of music from Denver to Eagles to Beatles to Elvis. We went through the menu almost twice still couldn‚Äôt decide on what to have as it was 10am we didn‚Äôt want anything heavy but we wanted to try the ones Zomatier‚Äôs suggested. Then suddenly I thought we could have the breakfast buffet priced at 299 + tax. We opted for it and I patted myself at the end of meal for making a good choice.

Their spread had everything ---- EVERYTHING. Starting from the ‚Äòsouth‚Äô of idly, vada, sambhar to ‚Äòwest‚Äô vada pav, to ‚Äònorth‚Äô aloo paratha to ‚Äòeast‚Äôpuri sabji to ‚Äòglobal east‚Äô chowmein momo to ‚Äòglobal west‚Äô sandwiches salads salamis to desserts having chocolate to fruit cake to the ‚Äòawakening essential‚Äô masala chai. The taste of every salad unique different and tasty, the regulars of north south east west tasted as they should, the chocolate mousse was as sinful as it could get.

At the end of two and half hours of non-stop laughing , chatting, eating I was full is all ways possible from the heart the stomach the pocket and the taste.

Coming back soon to try out their a-la-carte soon. Do drop in. Preferably Sundays, breakfast buffet is on till 3pm.

One of the new theme restaurants in town. Finally decided to check it out. Ambience is awesome specially the vintage bike in the lookout. Food was also good. We ordered Texas cowboy chilli pizza and terminator lamb burgers...both tasted amazing to say the least. Lots of cool areas to take selfies. A bit expensive for my taste but the overall experience more than makes up for it. Definitely a kool place to hangout.

A cutesy (wrong choice of word for 'bike' themed cafe) place with a fairly elaborate menu. The food and music is great and staff is warm. Free wifi is a bonus! 
We just felt the portions could've been bigger. Example- a tiny portion of fries is priced at 80‚Çπ (avg in similar restaurants is 100-120‚Çπ, so they could price it at 100‚Çπ and make the portion more generous). 
PS: the fries dish is really cute! ????

The bikers cafe near forum mall, is a nice place for catching up with friends and binge on some junk as well as healthy food.

The decor is based on the bike theme as the name suggests . Another highlight is that they have board games and one of the rooms even has a big tv where u can even play videogames (ps3).

They serve breakfast all day long! Yay! The menu also consists of burgers and pizzas ( the chicken burger being my favourite there). For the health fanatics there is juice booster menu as well.

We ordered the peri peri chicken burger and mushroom burger and some fries on the side . Chicken burger was good . For the drinks, we ordered the house special cold coffee which was nice too.
Also tried the strawberry waffle which was fantastic .

Wanted to try the breakfast items on the menu, but next time maybe.

All in all a  good place to hang out and chill with friends.

Its quite pocket friendly at Rs.800-1000 per person.

We were visiting Kolkata over our annual holidays and wanted to try a brunch menu someplace. Had heard a lot about a place on park street (wont name it!) But when I looked up on zomato, The Biker's Cafe on Elgin Rd seemed to be well recommended - so gave it a try one monday morning along with my in laws

Ambience - Nestled in a very central location and beautifully setup, the restaurant did very well to really stick by its biker theme. in addition to a bike sitting in the cafe, even some of the seats are modelled like bike seats. Live music, a foosball table and jenga blocks are there to keep the bored entertained

Food & Service - everything on the menu looked delicious and we tried more than a few items on it. The american breakfast is nice but could be heavier - that said, highly recommend their salmon egg benedicts, waffles and the peri peri chicken burger. To go along, get one of their healthy unsweetened juices.... you will most certainly be surprised! Service levels complemented the quality of food and we were never kept waiting for long... and yeah, it was all done with a smile

Overall - must go place if you're looking for a sumptuous breakfast. It will be on our go to list when we visit Kolkata next

Visited this place on Christmas Eve with my gang and the place just turned out to be well suited for a hangout with your friends. The decor and the theme is different and cool. The waiters were courteous and polite. And the food was amazing specially the overloaded Nachos and Potato potholes are a must try here. The only let down was the fact that it was crowded since it was Christmas so the food items on their menu went out of stock and the food took like an eternity to be served on your table when we were like starving! But I would give it a second thought since its a new outlet and they didn't have much experience to handle their customers on a day like Christmas. So maybe my visit changes my opinion on their late service. All in all, a must visit place in the town.

I had been to Kolkata last month, for a couple of days and one of my friends suggested this place to me. I was totally unaware of this place as I shifted to Chennai a year back and since then this was my first visit back home. We went to The Biker Cafe at around 11am. Situated near the Rabindra Sadan Metro station, Elgin Road, this restaurant, I must say, has the right ambiance needed for continental foods. Starting from the choice of music to the interior decoration, TBC is the ideal place for people who love steaks, sausages, burgers, bacon and yeah, as the name suggests, bikes too. I am not a big fan of bikes though, I went there mainly for the food but some of the vintage bike models kept there for display is bound to attract(or distract) you at some of point of time. 

Anyway, coming to the food, we ordered the American Breakfast that included brown breads, jam, butter, (bacon/sausage), tomatoes and egg(fired/sunny side up,boiled). We ordered both sausage and bacon, so they charged about 50 bucks more.. But I liked the bacon more in the end.. It was well cooked, the aroma was amazing, it was crispy and munchy. The sausage seemed okay to me but this friend of mine, who visited the restaurant twice before, said that they prepare it even better. But anyway, I would suggest you to try it, it's good. We tried the was pancakes too.. Maybe it was the best part of our meal. I love pancakes a lot and I found very few places in Kolkata making as good pancakes as TBC. To add to that we also had Chicken Satay. Well after having so much for breakfast you really can't eat all those chicken alone, so me and my friend, we had to split it..

We had a bill of around 950-960. A very reasonable price I must say.
 Service was also quite good.
I would really suggest this place to all you foodies out there in Kolkata. One morning some "kochuri" and "chholar daal" can definitely make way for bacon and sausage and pancakes. I haven't tried the steaks or burger there but after the goodwill that they have earned from me, I will be looking forward to visit this place again and trying out the other stuffs that they prepare.

And yes, the sad part is, they don't serve alcohol.

The name only suggests about its theme,"Bikes"..It is located just opposite Tyre patty or in the lane opposite to pc chandra(chowringhee)..
It has many spare bike parts put up here and there but the show stopper is the vintage bike put up on the display..
I'm a hardcore vegetarian still they were able to satisfy my taste buds with burgers and pizza's and ofcourse a chiller...the pizza was the best thing among them and was one of the best i ever had..
Will visit soon...
Do try pizzas..they are yumm...

Had this place bookmarked for quite sometime... finally decided to try it out today.

I must admit...they deserve 5/5 for the concept/theme. The place was well laid out and quite spacious. They have taken due care not to clutter up in order to accomodate extra guests.

The lighting and music was awesome.. remenescent of 90s. (Dont break my heart..Achy bachy heart, Alice...n more).

I ordered a VIRGIN MOJITO and BIKERS CHICKEN FUSION followed by STRAWBERRY WAFFLE...all on recommendations of my server. And must I say.. they were all awesome. Nothing out of the world...but definately out of the regular. The portion was quite filling.

The damage to pocket... Yes. Bt then once in a while... who cares!? :-)

Would love to come back to this place for its ambience, music and great American food.

The Very Idea to set up a place like this ... specially in kolkata really worth appreciation. It really make one feel young & energetic instantly. Apart from the Decor, along with the Stunning Bikes or the bike plates... the menu card holds a delightful presentation of the items available. ¬†One can enjoy the PS3 games while dinning ( though the Wi-Fi is sometimes not available ). The dishes mostly inclined for a breakfast , but the taste & the flavor will certainly put you to the Wild - Wild -West. ¬†Nothing more to say.... if cost doesn't matter, then it is a must try not only for the Gen-x, also for the fellows those who once regret for missing the ¬†fun of a memorable hangout or a "tete a tete" in their college lives...

Another great new eatery in Kolkata, pretty different from anything else we have. Was there for breakfast, and I don't have too many complaints about either the eggs or pancakes. Service was excellent. Music may have been a bit too loud for breakfast time. And a few more 'regular' flavours of tea wouldn't be a bad idea...

Yesterday while returning from office I couldn't hold my hunger for longer. I had to eat something and that‚Äôs when I came across The Bikers Cafe. This particular restaurant was on my mind for quite a long time but I never had a chance to visit this place.

Location ‚Äì This restaurant is located right on the four head crossing of Elgin road. It is on the first floor of Platinum mall. 
D√©cor/interior/Ambiance ‚Äì It is a great place for bike lovers. Every decoration in that cafe has done a great justice to the name ‚ÄòThe Bikers Cafe‚Äô and the love for bikes . You can go up to the TBC in platinum mall through the staircase or the lift. As you enter the 1st floor there are posters of the bikers and the bikers . When you enter the restaurant it takes you to a different mood. The wooden tables, the log type couch, the heavy rot iron chairs, the wall paintings, photos of bikes everywhere and mainly the Bullet (I think that‚Äôs what it is called. Not very good with bikes and their model nos.). It has a gaming room as well. It is a family restaurant. Bar is not available. But serves awesome mocktails.
¬†
Food ordered ‚Äì

# Starters & Main course
1) Fully Loaded Nachos (Veg)
2) Malaysian Chicken Satay (Non-Veg)
3) Fish Fingers (Non-Veg)
4) Dijon Chicken Pizza (Non-Veg)

# Mocktail
1) Berry Land
2) Pink of Health

#Dessert
Too Hot to Handle

Food experience ‚Äì It was recommended by the Head chef to us. I DO NOT regret taking them. The Nachos were crunchy with veggies and sauce. It was savory. The chicken satay was too soft, little sweet n salty. Fish Fingers are not like the normal fish fingers. It was juicy, soft, melts in the mouth and has an amazing aroma. Lastly the Dijon Chicken Pizza was the best of all lot. It was a homemade pan crust pizza with extra cheese, chicken and different types of sauces.  It was little spicy, not very salty.   Now over to Mocktail‚Äôs. Pink of Health is something which all diet food lovers will love. It is a detoxifier for liver and kidney (Chuckle). It is made of Watermelon Juice, Papaya Juice and Citrus limetta aka Mosambi juice.  Super tasty. Berry Land was a Strawberry Milk shake. They don't compromise with the quality and the quantity of the food. I even had to pack the untouched food back.    

Recommendations ‚Äì Fully Loaded Nachos, Malaysian Chicken Satay and Dijon Chicken Pizza is a must try.

Pocket pinch ‚Äì it pinches your pocket a little.

Bon Appetite !!

This place gets a high rating for the ambience. However the food is just about average. The drinks are made well, this coming from an alcoholic in a mocktail bar. The starters have some good preparations in the mezze platter. But the main course was a let down when they over cooked a simple chicken dish. Do come here to pass the time with friends. Has a gaming room and free internet.

Paradise for bike lovers. Loved the ambience specially. The lights are actually the headlights of bikes. There are cosy seating arrangements. There are nice paintings around. The best part is there's a harley Davidson bike in display

Coming to food, the chicken swekers were yummy. The pasta was delicious along with the garlic bread, the dessert was nice too though I don't like bananas

If you love the "two wheeled" partner you have, this is the place where you wud like to hang out and stretch your body a bit after a long bike ride.. Whatever may be the clock is ticking, the team will provide you the best... The ambiance reflects the name of the restaurant and makes a bike lover proud.. I really appreciate the design and the owner to have come up wid a place in the city, which was beyond our thinking..¬†
Had a Grilled chicken sandwich which was really different from any other sandwich corners in the city and a cup of hot coffee... Liked it.. must visit!!!!

The ambience just goes by it's name, indeed a bikers cafe. The collections and the interior is just perfect. There's even a Foosball table! 
We had the english breakfast, the bacon was fresh, so were the hash browns. I loved that pancakes with maple syrup (80 bucks extra).  The pancakes were topped with icing sugar. Overall had a great time there, though the price was bit high. But, just for the ambience, i will visit again.

The name goes wonderfully with the ambiance of the place. From the moment you enter you can feel the energy the colorful and vibrant mood of the place. On a late Sunday evening I went along with 3 friends. The 1st problem area has to be the seats if you are coming with more than 2 people. The sofas are comfy but right opposite you the two seats are like stools with no back rest! So now it's all up to your luck if you get sofa or those stools! The food here is really good. We ordered the iced tea with garlic bread along with chicken wings! Next we went for their thin crust pizzas - also yummy. We finished with the chocolate waffles rich and sinful. While the food keeps you happy and craving for more I do wish their service was a tad bit faster. Over all one of the upcoming hot hangouts in Kolkata and I loved it.

The Food here is really Good. I tried almost all the veg dishes on the menu. Everything which was served be it presentation or the quality and the quantity was amazing.  The must try dish for vegetarian for starter is the mushroom dish and in main course is the gourmet pizza and the Thai green Curry. Also, if you are a fan of drinking refreshing mocktails then you should try the Vring Mojito. A full paisa wasul place.

This is one of the most happening place I found this festive season. The themed platform of bikes and everything related to the bike gang culture has been captured in a very surrealistic form. The food was fusion, from sphagetti and pizzas to cutting chai and bhel puris. This restaurant being a little pricy offers a delight as to a European-Desi culinary mix-up. Definitely for a group outing in the evening.

We were returning from a Gangtok trip and suddenly decided to visit this place because we loved a similar place in Gangtok named 'Baker's Cafe'. And boy, i loved it. I got a bit confused because the door of this cafe isnt that showy. Upon entering i almost felt like shifting to Bhawanipore for a breakfast every morning. The staff were dressed up as real bikers minus the leather bikers jacket but had the bandana tied around the forehead. I so loved the customized bike on display which they call the 'Selfie Corner'. Can't say much about the ambience as it was too early and it was just the 2 of us. The decor is stunning. There's even a karaoke spot if I'm not wrong. Numerous wall hangings. Retro punks were playing in the background. One thing that really interested me was, when a dish was ready in the kitchen, the cooks honked an air horn to alert the waiters. Quite innovative! Now coming to the food, we ordered:
All American Breakfast: it had eggs (we ordered omlette), 2 sausages (pork. We didn't take the bacon strip), 2 brown toasts, butter, jam, a potato chop like thing with baked tomato. Its big to fill one. A perfect breakfast. Taste still lingered in my mouth the whole day.
Bikers Special Bobby Brown Omlette: it had a huge omlette with mushrooms, the same potato chop like thing with baked tomato, 2 brown toasts, butter and a chicken something. This too can fill one perfectly. Oh did i mention i loved this the most.
Pancakes with Maple Syrup: 2 soft pancakes. Melts in the mouth. Had sugar dust on top which made it even sweeter. Yummilicious!
Pink of Health: a healthy drink consisting of watermelon, papaya and another fruit (i can't recall which one). I took a sip and it was not bad. Fine enough!
Cappuchino: this was for me. Just as how it should be.
I had a sumptuous breakfast with a happy tummy and a happier me. Highly recommended. There serve food outside breakfast too. I will try those very soon. Cheerie!

Biker's cafe is located on Elgin road next to Shambhu nath hospital.  I love the fact the the attention to detail is given a lot of imoratnce in making the theme of the place. Even the door handles are made with spare bike parts. They have a beautiful collection of branded bike tanks. The star though is the vintage Bike in the display window.  

Coming to the food, the menu selection is very beautiful and the choice of dishes on the menu is quite remarkable.  simply loved the pizza sauce on the thin crust pizza. Also the Dijon mustard chicken Pizza was stunning. The stuffed potato was delicious as were the chicken fingers. The dips served with all the starters were nice espcially the orange chili .

I ordeed a lamb burger with a side order of grilled vegetables and both were delicious. I really liked the pink beetroot mayo in the burger 

I have had brownies from them earlier and I must say they are quite good as well.  

The staff is very warm and friendly I love the bandanas they tie on the head. 

Overall a brilliant concept. My only concern is that the service time is a little long rest all was fantastic.  

Kudos

Iam in the city for one week. Hence my friend suggested that we should check out this new place called Biker's Cafe. So with a little help from our GPS, we reached the cafe. The first thing that impressed me about the place was the great ambience!The music they were playing was also quite good.
We then ordered our mocktails and a starter. While I ordered an Orange Surprise, my friend who is on a diet ordered one of their diet mocktails called Free Flow. The mocktails were really good. We had ordred a Bruchetta as a starter. The same was quite decent. The portions were good.
We then ordered the Moroccon Tangine for our main course. Iam anyway a great fan of kus kus. The flavours of this dish was perfect. This was my first experience of a Moroccon dish. I will definitely try one again.¬†
Basically an excellent experience and definetly a place I would reccomend.

#BikersCafe #Kolkata #MustVisit

Very unique for the kind of places Kolkata has. The concept of a Biker Cafe is novel in terms of ambience and decor. Situated on Elgin, this place is almost opposite Forum (next to Vanilla Creperie). Love the decor, splash of color, the swanky Harley Davidson on display, the paintings, artwork, all that they have on the walls and racks and most importantly the food!¬†

#GluttonsChoice
1. Ham Cheese Cuban Sandwich
2. House Special Cold coffee
3. Lamb steak in Jack Daniel Sauce
4. Chicken Satay

Great marination, lovely balance of flavors, the steak, satay and sandwiches were made to perfection. Im addicted to coffee and the one at Biker's completely shut me up. I could finish it in one go, every sip was insane satisfaction. Strong with the right amount of sugar, it was the best of all. They also have a breakfast buffet priced at Rs 275 for a decent spread. Not too much variety but good enough for the price.

Downside:
1. I ordered the Eggs Benedict which was overcooked - it was less of a poach and was almost half boiled with very little Hollandaise (see image). It was served with grilled salmon, ideally smoked salmon goes best with Eggs Benedict! So, one may give this one a pass.

2. I ordered extra bacon plate as a side order, which had a strand of hair. However they were quick to admit their fault and change the plate. Overall, great place for a meal with a lovely ambience. Service is prompt and friendly.

Verdict: You can't not visit this place, if you are in Kolkata. While you wait for your order, they would be happy to lend you a board game!

I used to love this place until very recently. In my last two visits I have noticed that Biker's cafe has been turned into a birthday party zone. Screaming kids, annoying adults and super loud music is the theme of this place right now. Both the occasions I found the food pretty average, service below average and the place getting louder and louder.
They have a Hookah Zone I agree but I do not smoke or even like the smell of Hookah and their non smoking area has been turned into a mini party place. They not only allow outside cakes but also let their guests throw cakes on the floor, it's a disgusting sight alright. 
I have just one request to the owners, either put up a sign board that some private party is going on so that others won't go inside and get disturbed or else find a new area for these private parties. Really really annoying experience.

But food , umm well I have to say I was slightly disappointed. 
I had ordered BQQ pizza 
And lemonade 
~ lemonade was BAD ! It was horrible 
~ pizza was okay , nothing super special it was just fine. Wasn't really impressed with the food. 
~ the brownie on the other hand did some justices. 
So maybe a plus 0.5 for that. 
I felt the bill was not so cheap , considering the food it served.

After some waiting to do this cafe is now licensed  to serve hard drinks but the drinks price is on the higher side.A can of bud costs around 285 plus tax.Except that its one of the best cafe I have hung out in kolkata and its also nearby my working place. Food is great. Cajun chicken tenders,pancakes,exotic salad,knucklehead periperi chicken burger are some of my favourites. Music is good,not so loud. You can indulge in playing foosball with your freinds but a billiard board would have been better. A Harley Davidson is kept for exhibition and it also suits the ambience of this cafe alongside wooden interiors. And yes of course high speed wi fi is there which you can't ignore,might this be the reason also for their high pricing. A must visit for all the cafephiliacs.

Keep eating and keep reviewing.

We had our breakfast wid bikers special bobby brown omelette... it was awesome....

Then we had mexican chipotle ... its was good... spicy...

And we had fruit crepes with ice cream at last... bt it was too sweet to eat... they just used huge amount of honey in it...

Only drawback i saw was that , waiters r not well trained... they dropped the spoon and knife twice while serving...

If u hav money go and njoy... this is d bst cafe after cafe mezuna and chilli's. ..

This place is cool. Period. Great ambience, perfect for de-stressing. And they play awesome music over there ( I would love to steal their playlist one day). Though biker's cafe is featured in Great Breakfasts, it doesnt fall behind in its lunch and dinner menu. We were served biker's soup of the day and buffalo wings as appetizers, both of which were equally savory. Now coming to the chicken lasagna, it has to be the best I have ever had. We decided to experiment a bit with gambas pil pil( spanish style cooked prawns) and we were pleasantly surprised. Full points for presentation. One of the best things about biker's cafe has to be their delectable desserts. We had ordered strawberry waffles and split personality. The latter was a combination of three flavours of ice cream upon caramelized banana.Excellent. They have a separate menu for the eggytarians and I must mention here that the Spanish haven and Bobby brown omlette we had laden with ham and cheese were scrumptious as hell! The service is quite efficient and the prices are more or less reasonable keeping in mind the quality of food. And they also have a hookah section. Way to go! This is one place where you will definitely want to come back again...

This could have been the latest hangout in town, but I feel it is failing to live up to the expectations. Ambiance is very cool - with a low ceiling and pub like atmosphere, there cant be a better place for a lazy hangout with friends. Food menu is pretty extensive, with most kinds of eats and snacks thrown in. But food quality needs to improve vastly and justify the cost - we found some fried items too oily and wanting in taste.

Service is also not upto the mark. As long as you go in a big group of friends and don;t mind the long delays or the not so exceptional food, it is fine.

After a very early morning flight and then waiting 5 hrs to commence an 8 hr road trip, the 1st place that came into my mind to relax was this : The Biker's Cafe. And as usual, I still am begging them to disappoint me. The visage of people serving here reflects their ultimate goal : Brotherhood.¬†
Perfect place just to sit down, surf on the laptop and eat light food, that too alone. Just like their better half in Delhi, the one in Kolkata does justice to all the parameters of quenching thirst, DARK LORD being exceptional if you belong to the Chocolaty era. Full marks on the decor, theme and hospitality. The only request to them is that they can show better things on the screens than TNAs and Kickboxing.
Anytime I am in Kolkata, this place will always be on my visit list.
THANKS FOR SAVING US BY GIVING THIS ESSENCE AND AMBIANCE: THE BIKERS CAFE!!!!

I think the whole ambience and feel u get in this place is rather nice. For me it reminded me of a Rock bar back from Canada. They play decent mix of Rock and Country music and service is really good as well. But the food so far is not good by any means. I had their famous chicken dish, forgot the name but it was horrible. And the masala chai was not good at all. They have this plate called an American breakfast which is really good. But overall it's an alright place.  


So I suppose I should add some to this review as earlier tonight I tried some hookah at this place and I must admit the hookah was absolutely amazing, I forgot the name but it was blueberry PAN and mint. Smooth lot of smoke and good amount of flavour. The songs were rocking and the my mojito was quite good as well!

The Biker's cafe is a quaint little eatery located on the 1st floor of Platinum Mall. It is decorated with a lot of motorbike related nostalgia and is one of the "Must Visit" places in Calcutta if you are looking for a Good place with Great Service, Lip-smacking food and wonderful atmosphere. You can have an Indian style breakfast too but all five of us opted for the American listing on page #1 of their menu. The Bobby brown Omelette, All American Breakfast or especially the Pink Salmon Benedict are items to die for. Pocket pinch was Rs 3800 for a party of five.

Nice ambiance,friendly staffs with good suggestions for your meal. Bikers club sandwich was filling, with great taste. Chicken fusion has two boneless slabs of chicken with two different sauces.One was mild and the other one makes you sweat with its hotness. Rice was well cooked and tasty, although I did not opt for butter on it and ended the lovely meal with a mixed juice of cucumber,beet root and watermelon. Free WiFi for u and computer games for kids. Over all a nice place to visit on a lazy weekend. Going there again for sure.

I'm impressed with the ambience and the feel of the place. But the food definitely needs an uplift. The menu is unremarkable and doesn't match up to the place.

Oh the stirs and waves that this place has created! This was in my wishlist for quite sometime as well.¬†

Walking straight from Bhawanipur College towards Elgin Post Office gives you the Biker's Cafe. The main door at the first floor has no board btw. However, when we entered, we were greeted and directed towards the corner sofa. The music system played right above my head but it was not too loud thankfully. A nodded and quite liked all the songs as a matter of fact!

The service was nice. We ordered All American breakfast, pancakes, knucklehead peri peri grilled chicken burger and pink of health. ¬†The drink came first. The pink of health basically had papaya, watermelon and one other fruit which I forgot. A loved the drink. I dont like health drinks so no comments. The burger was big and nice! ¬†Nicely grilled and placed. They could give given a little more of the french fries though :P
The American breakfast was lovely. The bacon strips were perfectly cooked. The sunny-side-up egg complemented the brown breads. I quite liked it. The pancakes with maple syrup was wonderful! All in all, its a lovely place.¬†



A little heavy on the pockets yes but the food is healthy and nice! The food might take a little time to reach your table but the service and decor would not disappoint you. Neither would the food. A wanted to have the JD lamb steak but was full already. So we shall hit the place soon again. Cheers :)

This place has been on my checklist since it had open.. And after i went there.. I must say it was a good choice.. 

Ambience: very nice.. The rustic feel is so not kolkata.. It will like take you to a new zone somewhere in bangalore. Good music and very innovative props such as a bike.. And few foosball tables 

Food: garlic bread with cheese was perfectly done with some added parsley.
Then came the chicken sizzler which was an above average dish..very nice mexican rice and a semi dry chicken combo
The cowboy chicken pizza was something different.. The shape.. The pizza sauce.. Ample of topping.. It was perfect.. A bit spicy but good! 
We also ordered the passion fruit iced tea which was again average.. Nothing over the top

Pricing: its not a very economical place but then i can assure u that the portion they give and the quality of food is good for that pricing.. You wont be disappointed at all.

Ambience is quite good inside, but I didnt go there just to be a part of the ambience and I was disappointed with the meal that I had, as well as the way I was treated. 

1. Menu arrived 10 mins after we took the seat. 
2. Da people there were not noticing if the glasses were empty or not. Another bad thing, as servers at better hotels keep a point on that. 
3. Food arrived on time, but only Burger had any taste. Our Potator potholes and pizza were quite poor. I have bad meal experience and that is fine, but paying this much amount and eating what i did was like telling myself that I am supposed to be made a fool. 

Hope the standard of the restaurant in terms of quality and service improve, as i am sure that Veggie people will not go there just to have a sight of the Harley Davidson for long.

Suddenly me and my two dear friends decided to have breakfast somewhere and my friend really became excited after looking at the reviews and pictures of The Bikers Cafe in zomato so the three of us tried out this place today. This place can be easily located and ¬†the whole place is quite attractive and i simply loved the ambiance. Though we reached late still i wanted to try out some breakfast items and therefore ordered all american breakfast along with pancakes which consisted of ¬†1 bread, grilled tomato, 1 hash brown and we opted for omelette and crispy bacon and along with it we were given butter and marmalade. In totality it was an uncomplicated dish and its the simplicity of the dish which i loved and would definitely have it again also the pancakes were really soft and great. After ordering this we became really confused as to what other items we must try and that is when the staff came to our rescue and i must give credit to him as he was well aware of all the items and gave us good suggestions. Hence the other items which we ordered were berry compote waffle, peri peri grilled chicken burger, chicken penne pasta in mixed sauce and house special cold coffee and cappuccino. In the mean time we were taking a tour of the restaurant and discovered that the place was stacked with so many games and my friends wanted to play Foosball but alas the foods were served in a jiffy. The pasta was delicious as the taste was properly balanced and thank god the dish also had ample amount of chicken in it, the burger was huge in size and lip smacking served with french fries ( my friend complained about the quantity of french fries they served as she wanted to have it more ) ¬†and the waffle was equally tasty which proved that all the dishes maintained the consistency including the cold coffee and the cappuccino. One teeny weeny thing which i would like to point out is that the drinks though good in taste but it is over priced and i would really want at least two slices of bread in the breakfast platter.The total amount which we had to pay was around 1400 and i believe the amount was okay compared to the quality of the food that they served. It is one of the coolest restaurant and one must definitely visit it. -with Alolika Pattanayak and Suryanu Sengupta

It was a rainy afternoon... And I abruptly took the decision of visiting this cafe... The first thing you notice after entering this case is its ambience... It has a wild and rock kinda ambience... There is bike bike and bike everywhere and all are so neatly placed... One word to describe it is exciting... The oil tankers of legendary bikes like ducati hyosung and a asto Harley Davidson is a prized deal...now come to the more important point,the food.....its good but the quantity is too less according to the price...I have tried the grilled fish and a sandwich there...both are good but failed to curb down my appetite..so its a good cafe with good ambience and good food...but it is overpriced...so now the ball is in your court...but according to my opinion at least visit the cafe once and if you are a biker and rockstar kinda guy then you should visit this one...

It was an outing with friends.. This place is a walking distance from my home. It has a nice welcoming appeal.. The staff working there all wearing black tshirts an jeans with a biker look. The sitting arrangement is quite good. The biker seat tool was very interesting. Coming to the food we ordered the nachos with topping and a chiken satayed in peanut butter sauce. Both were really tasty. For drinks we ordered virgin mojito and ginger ale.. Both were really refreshing..  We were there quite sometime.. Then we ordered a pizza .. It was a total thin crust pizza. Tasty. Over all the experience was good that ended with a selfie with the bike. ;)

I visited this place for 'Breakfast'To begin with I would like to start with the interiors of this place which is out of the world.The Harley style model bike,the headlights used for interior lighting, the brief history about motorbikes hung on the walls are amazing and unique.We ordered the All American Breakfast which consisted of bread butter eggs which you have options like boiled,omelet,scrambled to choose from and a boiled tomato.Bacon and chicken sausages with a cheese/potato chop.And a small bowl of Marmalade to sum it up.The waiters were very friendly and were wearing bikers outfit and a red bandanna on their head ¬†which again goes with the theme of the place.I loved this place and I am thinking of coming here again.You should definitely drop by sometime and specially for breakfasts.

This place absolutely wonderful. Went there to have breakfast today (8.15 am), and found it nearly empty. The ambience is cosy and impressive at the same time. The tables are nice and large, the decor is charming and the music complements it all quite well. This is what we ordered:¬†

1. Irish coffee (hot) - nice and strong, tasted really good after I added 4 packets of sugar ( I like my coffee sweet and my chocolate bitter), doesn't have too much milk though I suppose it's meant to be that way.¬†
2. Caramel coffee (hot) - I didn't taste it, but my companion seemed to enjoy it.
3. Crispy bacon - this wasn't strictly on the menu (it's supposed to be a part of the all-American breakfast), but the staff was very accommodating. And the bacon was lovely. Some places use the frozen strips u get in Spencer's, which has hardly any fat and a very thin piece of meat. But they used the real thing: 2 pieces, well fried and curled to perfection. My favorite part if the meal.
4. French fries - wasn't a part of the breakfast menu either, but again they accommodated my request. Potatoes were fried as they should be, and didn't go soft even after the meal ended ( I usually save a few bits for last ) . Also, I really liked the white sauce they served with it, looked like mayonnaise but had a bit of kick.
5. Choco-chip pancake - yummy. Three pillowy cakes embedded with choco-chips, drizzled with chocolate sauce and served with a bowl of chocolate sauce on the side. They even offered me a second bowl when they saw how much I enjoyed it.
6. Non-veg Eggs Benedict - a unique dish. The sauce poured over the eggs was really spicy and Indian in taste. It's light and leaves plenty of room for more food. Good strong flavours in what is typically a mild dish.
7. ¬†Vanilla ice cream - again, not a part of the breakfast menu, but I adore the pancake and ice-cream combination.

Bill came to 1247, which I think is pretty ok. I cut 0.5 marks because they didn't have the salmon Benedict which I really really wanted. Also, they served everything all at once. But then, I'm nitpicking. It was a wonderful experience and I'm definitely going back there again as soon as my wallet permits. They made up for the disappointment of not getting salmon or non-veg sandwiches. Although I really think they should introduce a few savory pancakes I the menu.

The place is really nice. The ambience and service is good. The music is peppy and they play really cool 90s pop songs. Tried the virgin mojito, Oreo desire coffee, mezze platter veg, BBQ ranch veg burger and the classic waffles with chocolate sauce. Everything was delicious. I'm sure the other dishes will as good as the ones we had. I definitely recommend the cafe. Come with friends and family and enjoy ????

The bikes, the wooden interiors, the fuel tanks, the play station console ¬†will make the visit to this cafe a crazy experience. The place serves all day breakfasts which seems to be a fairly new concept in the cafe culture of the city. One negative thing about the breakfast menu is that neither do they give juice nor any hot beverage which should be a must on the menu. The staff is friendly and the music they play here goes well with the feel of the place. But once you here be r ready to pay a big amount on taxes.

The entry in itself gives a very happy feel because of the wow factor ambiance. The menu is elaborate with classic world cuisine. I had called my friends for dinner and we started with chicken satay and European veg burger along with a greek salad.
The salad and satay was outstanding and ¬†burger really stands apart from the regular burgers what we are used to from different qsr chains as 1.it is jumbo 2. awesome dressings 3. perfect patties and lipsmaking french fries and coleslaw accompanied with it. Then we ordered a italian sizzler , a lamb pizza,a grilled fish and a bikers chicken fussion( very difficult to choose from a huge range of menu). The food was really a visual and more than a perfect taste treat. The pizza was a perfect crust with a perfect bend of cheese and sauce, and well done lamb, a must try pizza. A very new concept of arrabiata spaghetti and grilled veg on the the side( an italian sizzler) the fish and lamb was also very enjoyable. We had no room for desserts. Service was swift and courteous.A altogether good experience. foot tapping music. A must visit for global food.

Fairly new kid on the block here is a smash-hit with the crowd apparently. A unique theme with fitting decor and a large screen on the outside of the building adds to the charm of this place.

Coming to the food - the selection is simply awesome!
The all-day breakfast platter, juicy burgers, shakes, waffles are all very comforting.

Being a little heavy on the pockets, its not an everyday place. But, its a fun happy place for loud groups of people.

Three cheers for the biker dudes!

For all those bike enthusiasts they may not find much about the bike thing. The ambience is perfect for a gathering willing to indulge in some good food while watching a live game/match.. Those who are health freaks will be greeted by a number of healthy concoctions (take assistance of the waiter to choose the right one).. As far as other options on the menu are comcerned.. its completely a foodies yard to choose from.

Finally, finally I nailed the place after several failed plans. Thus the elation of being here was quite a bit on my part. Four of us met today evening to chat over coffee and finger food. 
The ambience has been talked about and elaborated on, so I shall skip that beat. What I may choose to add here is the arrangement of the corner tables near the speakers. When the music is played loud (the likes of Rihanna, Eminem, etc), it is impossible to sit at the corner tables, enjoy a chat or coffee or do anything for that matter. We had to change seats because of this, which was complied by the servers. And oh, I love the name tag tool symbol for the waiters along with the badges they wear. So cool!
Having caught a bit of cold I straight ordered for the choco rose latte without a second thought. Others ordered an Arnold Palmer, jasmine delight and cutting chai, respectively. The drinks arrived in time and each of us were happy with our drinks. I loved my coffee - perfect blend of chocolate and coffee with a subtle rose flavour. It did its job of making me feel at ease and comfortable well. We finished our beverages and sat there chatting with no order for about an hour. No waiter disturbed us, even when the place was getting quite crowded. Thereafter we ordered a Vietnamese chicken soup, one veg Thai green curry and a Texas cowboy spicy chicken pizza. We were informed that the food would take about twenty to twenty five minutes. The soup arrived first, it was light, tasty and comforting. The pizza arrived five to ten minutes following that. The crust of the pizza was thin, crispy and fresh. The toppings were well strewn over. The thing I really liked about the pizza was the use of burnt garlic. It enhanced the flavour of the toppings enormously. The Thai curry took quite a while to arrive, definitely over forty minutes. When it finally did, we wasted no time and dug in. I love Thai green curry and this was perfectly done - opulent use of the right vegetables, a not too thick or thin gravy, the right amount of spicy rendered the dish a beautiful taste. 
We enjoyed our evening here. The ambience is peppy with an influx of young crowd and the prices are definitely a value for money. For the entire binging today, we paid 1735 bucks! Perfect, I say.

The Bikers Caf√©, Elgin Road, Kolkata 

Having mapped the Bikers caf√© on Zomato, I realized that we were staying very near the joint and mentally made up my mind to make a pilgrimage for breakfast. The problem in Kolkata is that everyone (relatives) wanna feed you and each Mashi, Pishi, Kaki et al would boast of bong culinary prowess, for which I am a diehard sucker. Last 10 days were various versions of Lucchi Alu dum/Alu/Dal, Kochuri and dal, Paratha and maangsho driving us down the bend if not the waist. We were a couple exhausted with breakfast!! 
However, the pending pilgrimage was in my mind beeping me constant reminders not because  I am a hog but the fact that I am a biker and a HOG (Harley Owners Group) from Mumbai. We finally made it to the place on Saturday amidst a number of cancellations at the pretext of visiting the mandir for Gurupoornima. We decided to visit with another cousin who has been there a number of times.
The Bikers caf√© is located in the Platinum Mall which most taxi drivers aren‚Äôt aware of compared to the more famous Forum Mall on Elgin road. Bikers caf√© was a delight at the first step inside with the white souped up Enfield cruiser as a reminder of the Bikers glory! Open faced bricks with large cubicle like seating with ample natural light gave a feeling of warmth and coziness. A yellow chopper placed by the huge glass window pane overlooking the street was interesting a sight to an avid biker.. The posters, headlamps, the foosball table were grungy yet smart furnishing definitely seemed inviting. There are also two big LCD TV‚Äôs installed with sports channel showing FIFA continuously especially Brazil‚Äôs lackluster debacle. The Blue Enfield Tiger headlamps on one of the pillars between the windows gave  a piece de resistance look to the place.
My wife, cousin and I selected the bar stool counter for breakfast. We were greeted with a smile by the guy across the counter with a bong accented ‚Äú Good Morning‚Äù and handed over the menu card which was a breakfast delight. My wife selected the 
Angels in egg womb at Rs 180/- which was an poached egg benedict with filling of ham and cream cheese and celery with 2 toast on the house and a Herbal Green tea at Rs. 120/- per cuppa. Whilst I went for the Biker‚Äôs special Bobby Brown Omelette which was large sized cheese (I asked without mushrooms)  omelette with complimentary, 2 slices of brown bread with butter and jelly served separately, a small hash brown. The omelette was superb especially with the gooey cheese melting down your mouth was sheer heaven.  The hash brown was well done. What do I say of the toast ‚Äì it was toast! Regular toast!! I asked for coconut at Rs. 109/- a refreshing drink of coconut water to wash down the guilt. My cousin opted for an Egg My way or the Highway at Rs.140/-  with chipotle chicken, cheese, spinach , bell peppers as add on at  extra rate 4 toast with marmalade and coconut, same as me.
We sat for some time having completed the sumptuous breakfast talking about various things and gossip and just could not resist ordering an additional Bun Omlette (Mumbai style)  with cutting chai at further Rs.150/- was the ultimate chef de resistance unifying my Mumbaiikar status with land of my forefathers. Loved every bit of the food though missed the Bikers especially the HOG‚Äôs.

No pictures since we did not carry our cell phones as we had to visit the mandir, where cell phones are not allowed.

Excellent atmosphere, superb d√©cor with a great ambience of a sports bar, something we mumbaiikar HOG‚Äôs seriously need!!

Ambience ‚Äì 10/10 ( Modern and Cozy)

Menu ‚Äì 9/10 even the satay‚Äôs and other items

Taste ‚Äì 9/10 

Customer Service ‚Äì 8/10 Good 

Value for Money ‚Äì 8/10 

Recommend ‚Äì  Compulsory visit by Bikers ! Next time wish to see a line of well accessorized Harleys!

I think the menu is great and so is the food. But the quantity is terrible. Between 2 of us, we ordered a side and 2 mains. We were still very hungry after. The burger had literally a chicken nugget. The burger too soft.
Otherwise I thought the flavours are great, but as far are vfm is concerned, very low on my list. Also for a bikers cafe they were playing pop and romantic music which didn't go with the ambience at all

The Bikers Cafe located at Elgin Road is the newest entry in the segment of posh themed cafes in Kolkata. As the name suggests this is a hangout for all the motorcycle enthusiasts. 

Located just beside Aqua Java, Bikers cafe is located on the 1st floor of Platinum Mall, few sections of which are still under construction. The entrance is not very enticing but once inside, its a completely different scene. The moment I entered the cafe,  I was happy to see something new, classy and the interiors very tastefully done. The first thing that caught my eye obviously had to be the Harley. The yellow chopper placed by the large glass pane overlooking the street was a delight to the eyes. The posters, headlamps, the foosball table and the grungy yet classy furnishing definitely seemed promising. There are also two big LCD tvs installed with sports channel on most of the time.

I visited on a weekday morning, hence they were serving breakfast and juices only at that point in time.  

I ordered for a Bikers special Bobby Brown Omelette and my friend ordered a Grilled jerk chicken with honey mustard sandwich. There was a separate Detoxify menu consisting of freshly made juices as claimed by the cafe. We ordered for a Pink of Health which consists of Pineapple, papaya and watermelon if I remember correctly. 

The sandwich arrived first. 2 brown bread sandwiches neatly served with french fries in a shot glass. Moments later the Omelette and the drink arrived as well. The sandwich was well made but I had expected the chicken filling to be more generously stuffed especially for the price being charged for the sandwich.
The juice - Pink of Health was indeed very fresh and refreshing. We are so used to having preserved and packed juices and this is indeed a welcome change. Thumbs up to that. 
Now the Bobby Brown Omelette is a grand dish. It consists of a decently sized mushroom-cheese omelette with complimentary, 2 slices of brown bread with butter and jelly served separately, a small hash brown. The omelette tasted awesome especially with the chunks of mushroom in it. The hash brown was okay. Also there was a kind of chicken preparation which was served with the egg but honestly speaking I do not know what the preparation was.

We did enjoy the breakfast, the juice being my favourite out of the 3. The staff were very courteous and asked for our feedback on the food verbally and also presented us with a feedback form with the bill. Now coming to the bill, the three items were billed at around Rs800+ which included VAT, Service tax and a 10% service charge which is a bit a too steep. For a bill of Rs 3000, one might end up paying something around Rs 300 as service charge. The cafe is expensive to be frank. Quality is not an issue but quantity is something that needs to be looked into. I would have been happy if the sandwich was a double decker one or if the chicken was stuffed generously. 

But taking everything into account the place deserves a good rating and is a must visit if one is looking for something new. I was impressed with the amount of detailing these people have done. Each of their cutlery is labelled with The Biker's cafe logo and the entire place has a very upscale feel to it. But be ready to shell out around Rs 1000 for a proper breakfast for two and around Rs 1500 for a hearty meal. And oh yes .. they have Free Wifi :)

So I had actually skipped dining in this restaurant a few weeks back and must say it was my mistake.

The building being under construction is a turnoff and from the looks of it will remain for some time.

We were a group of 3 vegetarians and ordered the following:
Starters/Appetizers
1) Smoked Tomato and Red Pepper soup - pretty decent but most definitely not exceptional
2) Fully Loaded Nachos - very so-so. The nachos themselves had a store bought packet chips taste and the salsa was not enough.

With this start we were not expecting a very good standard in the mains.

The Mexican Jalape√±o burger is something I am definitely going to return for. It was a great veggie burger after a long time.  
The Cottage Cheese Shaslik sizzler was also pretty nice. the marination on the paneer was great and it was a tasty dish.
The veg gratin was also nice and cheesy. 

With these mains we now felt happy enough to order multiple desserts

The Chocomosa was a good idea but failed in execution - the fill pastry was oily and took away from the taste.
The fruit crepe was great. would have liked some more filling but it was still a good dish

We had ordered a ginger ale which was the best i've had in Kolkata ever since Fire & Ice switched from "Cottons".

All in all I had only one service issue and that was that the dishes were not brought out together but rather one at a time. 

I would definitely visit Bikers Cafe again and probably take my kids along.

A well themed cafe. A great place to hang out.

Visited this place with my colleagues and had a swell time playing Foosball (this one is the mini Foosball though, and the assembly on the boards is wrong).¬† the Arnold Palmer (iced tea with lemonade), which seemed like just the right drink for this sultry summer.

On my second visit, however, I was put off by the rather disappointing Fish Finger and the Aglio Oleo pasta wasn't too encouraging either. The Foosball boards are also in the need of repair.

I have been here a number of times already. The selection of music is great - ranging from classic rock to ska music. Thumbs up for that! If you want to eat something wholesome, I will recommend the lasagna or the pancakes. The cajun chicken tenders is my favourite starter while the Arnold Palmer remains my favorite drink.

Last sunday my visit in bikers cafe will be memorable.When we entered the ambiance was very good and trendy.The restaurant was full we waited for a while,as the reception staff was very polite to organize a table for 4.
The Menu seemed to be great. It had all the selected best world cuisine. The highly recommend suggestions came from very well mannered staff about the burgers. We tried lamb and jalapeno burgers, it was simply mind blowing, the lamb was very juicy and tender and served with exotic beetroot mayo and french fries(also bike carved in the plate by tomato sauce).We ordered italian sizzler, prawn pizza,and a chicken main course. All the food was great and we enjoyed thoroughly, pizza was outstanding and perfect thin crust. It was my friends birthday, the waffle with mango was delicious. To our surprise the server served us an exotic flamble dessert live, and told this is on the house for any birthday celebration.
Guys great job and we will definitely visit soon

I landed up here last sunday evenin,mainly,i must admit,to surprise my bf who is a bike afficionado...but this newly opened cafe did wonders to me too!! The moment i stepped in, i knew this was gonna becum one of those cafes i like to frequent...the 'ruf n tuf' decor was in perfect keeping with the theme..with headlights for wall lamps, gear clocks and table motifs...but the star who stole the show was undoubtedly the harley davidson on display! Neon signboard, great music..it somehow gave me a grunge rock feel..
We ordered a cream mocha and a choco rose latte, both were really good and refreshing...next came the food...they have a varied spectrum of options startin from sizzlers,pasta,pizza,sandwiches,falafel...we opted for the cottage cheese shashlik sizzler...i found it a bit too bland for my taste...nothin lip smacking bout it...but wat made up for it was the dessert..strawberry waffle was unavailble sadly so i opted for the blueberry waffle...it was a gastronomic delight...
All in all,i wud love to come back here for the ambience and also lookin forward to try more of their beverages!

Came to bikers cafe for the first time . It's ambience n the decor is really well done . A themed cafe which resembles English countryside pub . We ordered pizzas n some side accomplishments , they were very tasty then we had fruit waffle with strawberry ice cream which was a treat for the taste buds. Now winding up with the house classic cold coffee which has just t right flavour needed . The place has good music n warm n courteous service . Next time hoping to sit at the bar stool n enjoy some good drinks. Wishing u get your license soon.

A biker cafe that serves no beer ? Really ? 
Anyway I went there couple of months ago and was told they would serve beer soon. However I see they still don't serve beer, which to me is unbecoming of the title.
Beer apart, I'd give it a solid 4.5 on ambience and service. The food and shakes were all right. Nothing out of the world though. I'd rate it at a 3.5
And a -1 for not serving beer.

And here is another new restaurant, but at least one that has a soul and a personality it seems. Biker's Cafe is located at the corner of Elgin Rd and Lee Road, right next to Aqua Java. The entrance is a bit of a let down. You enter from the side of a building, go up plain looking stairs and enter through work in progress. Once you are in, it is an entirely different matter.

The place is done up in a very cool manner. Not too overstated, young and yet stable. Not too loud, the place exudes class without being snobbish. The bike near the window of course adds to the atmosphere.

They have an interesting menu. Various mostly European dishes, including some of their signature dishes. They also do all day breakfasts and platters.

I started with a Thums Up. It came in a large glass with the logo of the restaurant. Nice. They serve it from PET bottles, hence there is a certain lack in taste, something a glass bottle version would have so well taken care of.

I laboured over the menu, wondering what to eat without spending too much. I finally settled on the Terminator Lamb Burger. Service was reasonably quick. They claim the patties are made fresh. It had a very soft bun with a rather thin but very soft lamb patty, with some beetroot mayonnaise and vegetables on top. It was served with some fries (neatly served in a small shotglass) and a well done coleslaw. I found the burger too small for the price. While the circumference was fairly decent, it was too thin. The fries should be have homestyle, and more of it, The coleslaw was served on lettuce that was not washed properly (which is inexcusable).

In the meanwhile I had lengthy conversations with the staff. They are all pleasant and friendly.

I wanted a dessert and settled on the Fruit Crepes with Icecream. The crepes contained sauteed pineapple, pear and something else, and there was a scoop of vanilla icecream atop. It came in a large plate and it was actually difficult to finish the icecream with a fork :) It wasn't bad, though the fruits did not express their individual tastes and textures. There was some sticky caramel strewn over which was interesting, and a pretty pointless chocolate sauce that kind of killed the taste. They took ages to serve dessert.

The bill came to Rs 744. This included a much unappreciated 10% service charge.

This place holds promise, and is definitely a good place to try out.

Last sunday it was bikers cafe for us. Noticed it all of a sudden while walking down elgin road. On entering the first thing dat I noticed was the bike- the white n gold harley davidson. And the cafe decked up as the biker's den with leather stools, stacked tables, motorbike headlamps, lampshades in the shape of helmets. What was awesome was water in the champagne bottles. Loved the ambience. michael jackson n george michael topped the charts.Ordered a mocha n cappuccino n to team it up we had the yummilicious chicken satay with peanut sauce. Coming to the mains its was norweigan salmon with teriyaki sauce and sticky rice. The fish was out of the world.  Den was the lamb wid barbecue sauce. Felt it was a bit overcooked. But otherwise it is a great place to be in. A must- visit.

The Bikers Cafe made me feel like I was on one of my trips to Delhi because they have a branch there as well which I have visited a couple of times. The place has a very cool vibe and I absolutely loved the decor ..... very few places in the city would have such a chilled out feel to it. The attention to detail and the little quirks are lovely. The tables , the leather stools , the mini-foosball table , the motorbike headlamps which are wall mounted and double as lights , the lights over the bar using helmets as lampshades are all wonderful. The showstopper is the seriously awesome White and Gold Harley they have. 

There is no alcohol served as they are yet to get their license but once they do I am pretty sure its going to become a great place to grab a drink. Coming to the food .... we started with their Signature Texas Chilly Pizza with Chicken .... its a very good pizza but considering I did not find it spicy at all ( I can't handle too much spice ) those who are expecting a spicy mouthful would be left wanting a little. Otherwise generous toppings and a perfectly prepared thin crust. We ordered Four Mains ... Non -Veg Club Sandwich ... very good and we all liked it. Norwegian Salmon with Teriyaki Sauce and Sticky Rice ... fish was lovely just a tad overdone but very fresh and tasty. The sticky rice was slightly bland and they certainly need more sauce on the fish. We had a Stuffed Chicken Breast which was very good but again a bit too dry  ... more sauce required but the Mash Potato served with it was excellent. Lastly we ordered a Lamb in Barbecue Sauce. Quality and preparation of lamb was very good but where this dish was a let down was that instead of using a Barbecue Sauce on top they used the same sauce brown pepper sauce as the chicken dish and when I pointed it out to the server and he spoke to the Chef the Chef insisted that it was Barbecue sauce which was quite disappointing. The Manager Mr.Anirban however later apologized and assured me he would look into the matter so hopefully there won't be a repeat act. 
We had ordered the Lime Cola and Virgin Mojito both of which were excellent and went well with our meal. Dessert had to be the waffles after reading my fellow foodie Poorna's review :-). We had excellent waffles topped with fresh mango and served up with Honey and Maple Syrup. Over all a good meal .... they need to tweak some aspects but I would certainly go back for more. I would have actually rated them a 4 except for the way they tried to pass off the confusion about the sauces. 3.5 for food and a plus 0.5 for the super cool Harley they have.

A friend recommended this place, so I thought of checking it out. The ambience is great and the seating arrangements are nice and well spaced. Coming to the food, I had great expectations owing to their expansive and elaborate menu. However the food wasn't that great, I have had better food in lesser price. The drinks were too watery and the dishes were small in proportion. They take long to serve, like really really long, they say it will be served in 20 mins but that easily exceeds 30-35 minutes. Out of the three dishes we ordered,the Mexican rice was the worst and the lasagne was  the best, it has a generous amount of chicken and was topped ample cheese.
I would give it a rating of 2.5/5.0
The decor and ambience calls for a visit though.

Last evening, I was at The Bikers Cafe with my partner. The place is nice, the "biker" theme reflected by the decor - bike on display, helmets turned into lights, biking quotes and so on. The music, however did not match up to that, it was the basic English songs popular among Calcuttans .. romantic numbers majorly.Not that i didn't like, but somehow felt that the songs could have been chosen more attentively.
Coming to the food, we ordered one Choco Rose Latte, one Texas Spicy Chicken Cowboy Pizza and one Chocolate French Toast. The service was fast. Latte tasted very refreshing with the rose flavor and i liked it. The pizza was a square one, eight sizes, flavorsome, cheesy and quite sufficient for two. The choco french toast tasted average, thin bread slices choco dipped, barely got the egg coating.
Though the time for food to the table was fast, they took about 15min to get the bill, which was very frustrating as we were in a hurry and the place was full too. The bill itself was disheartening, they impose 3 taxes which sums upto 1/3rd of the food bill.
Overall, a very mixed experience.

I had seen the writeup about the Bikers Cafe in the Graphiti... so it had been on our target list. We were finally able to visit it last week. We loved the concept and the decor of the place.... Being new and not yet very well known (and also probably bcoz it was a weekday and office timings), it was quite empty, which I liked. I don't like crowded places. So we went in and ordered 2 juices and a " Spicy Cowboy pizza". The pizza was good, but it took them very long to serve it. We had asked it to be less spicy and they had served it as we wanted it. Its a good place to spend time if you have enough time to spare. Also, the prices are reasonable and we spent less than Rs.1000. That was definitely a plus point! Definitely recommended, and I hope they work on their timing to serve food.

It's a beautiful caf√©. Very well designed. It's new and fresh for kolkata which has many cafes but all are similar in some or the other way. This caf√©, u can go with anybody n enjoy
I had ordered for falafel platter n I loved it. Good falafel after a very long time. V then ordered for potato holes which basically is the famous dish - jacket potatoes! I would give it a 1.5 on 5! Yes it was very sad. They serve good waffles. One should try it. The staff is very cordial n is quite aware of everything.. But the service is VERY SLOW! They take ages to serve the food. My first dish came in 10 mins, while the second took almost 45 mins. Rest, somehow I enjoyed my visit to this caf√©. There is a certain charm that will make u wanna visit it again. Please fix the service issue! 
Pocket pinch- approx 450 per person.

P.S. M a vegetarian n hence have no clue about the non-veg dishes served there.

Love the ambiance and the cool bike... since it's just started off service is still slightly shaky. However, the choco rose latte is one of the best coffees I have had till date, and I have had many, I daresay. The waffles are perfect - fluffy inside, crisp outside, and with a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce and fruits on top. I was not much of a fan of the garlic bread - although the bread was nicely chewy, the cheese topping on it was too dry for my liking. Same goes for the Salmon eggs Benedict - overly salty, and the egg was overdone. They do make a very decent all-American breakfast though, and a mean set of pizzas. My friend adored his lamb burger so much that I had to take a bite to figure out what the fuss was all about, and it was pretty good! 

Watch out for the bike. It's very cool to look at. :D

The first thing that will make you fall in love with that place is the white harley. Interiors are fab. Banana pancakes and strawberry waffles are to die for. The non vegetarians please dont miss on Bikers Chicken Fusion Discovery. For the vegetarians try lasagne for sure. If you are on a diet for a long time let your cheat day be in Bikers Cafe and the best part you dont even have to be a biker to be there. :p
