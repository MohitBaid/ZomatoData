This is really good for chocolate lovers. All items are made at home. Service is also convenient according to me. It’s worthy for your pocket.

I am regular customer for choco fantasy,  all the chocolates items are of great quality.  Price is also reasonable. its complete value for money. I have not tried custard but chocolates are real good, So  i think custard  must have similar quality.

During my visits to Kolkata I always look for varieties in sweets and food stuffs, One evening me and my colleague came across Choco Fantasy in Kasaba. The Dark chocolate s and Fruit Truffle were absolutely wonderful, from.preparation to presentation, very pleasing. The fact that the quality of chocolate induced me to purchase them for my wife back in Dubai.
