Tasteless food :(.  Ordered chicken salad and chocken platter,  both were bad.  Service was slow and they were charging more than bill saying prices are not updated yet.  Bad experience.

Best for an IT employee. On friday night you will find the new way of life. The cost are quite cheap and their will no turbulence for you to choose the side dish. Hukka service is ok but the environment and the DJ will embark to fly in mood.

Preach is a good hangout place especially because of it's fast and good servicing bar section. Staffs are really humble and a really cool decor with music. I gave 4 star and not 5 because i felt the main course serve time is little more or else i would have rated all 5 to this place. Cool ambience, good food and good staff just a little faster service of the main food is required.

Sector 5 has a lot of options when it comes to lounge bars that also offers delicious finger licking food.One such stop just beside big bazar is Preach.

The decor is simple and lacks a bit of the vigour when compared to the other pubs near .But the food speaks for itself.A sudden plan on a friday led me to this lounge.I have been here but they still hadn't received their liquor license back then.This time we had the full bar available.

Our orders for the lunch

üçÅFish Ala Diane--poached basa fish in a tangy tomato ala diane sauce served with boiled veggies and mashed potato.The fish is just melt in your mouth.

üçÅChicken Coco vin--Chunks of chicken in creamy and cheesy coco vin sauce with mushroom.The dish came with boiled veggies and mashed potato.The mash could have been better.

üçÅSmoke fish-- Fish with a smoky flavour with a lovely tangy sauce as a topping.This is a recommendation for all .The sauce was enriching and had the perfect consistency.

üçÅRoast lamb in mint sauce--the lamb was too hard and the sauce was too minty for my taste.It coul use a bit of less mint and more cream.

To wash these down we had a glass of LIT ,a red eye cocktail and a bacardi breezer.I am big fan of hookah and couldn't help but get a grape flavour with a red bull base.

The cocktails could have been better and lacked punch.The hookah on the other hand was light and lasted for a long time without choking even a bit.

The place has continental food to die for but can work on their bartending skills.The service is very courteous when it comes to being attentive.The ambience could be a bit revamped.

My next visit would be on the new year and i believe it could be the most horrible experience ever.I have been to so many parties in the last few years but this was a disaster.The food was stale and smelled really bad .The bar lacked drink options and didn't have even soft drinks to offer.

Extremely disappointed with their service on a package of 5k for a couple ,i must say that i expected better food at least.Would definitely think twice before recommending anyone.

This place is located near to Pantaloons in sector 5. Good place. Ambience is nice. Its basically a night club. But the dj was playing songs which werent so good and mostly punjabi. We ordered 3 Shepherds Pie and rum shots. They have amazing offers on alcohols. They took nearly 45minutes to bring the food. Though we were really hungry and we kept asking them about it still they took so long. The food was bad. Seriously bad. Shepherds pie is something which should be loaded with cheese and the lamb should be soft. Here the cheese was nearly invisible and lamb wss really hard..we dint like it. Even during payment they took so long to bring the cheque. So yes, if you wanna chill with your friends over some shots then visit this place otherwise dont.

On our way back from central mall, we were looking for a decent restaurant with bar. I opened zomato and stumbled upon this place. Early evening 5pm the crowd was thin. The ambience was warm but grunge like. We sat up stairs, which houses  the bar and a hug screen and DJ console. The food was quite delicious. We ate bacon and chicken for starters. (Sorry was too hungry to take a picture) the menu had some unique names which I found hilarious and hence landed up ordering a "salty dog" cocktail! It was yum.. We then ordered pork chops and a lamb lasagne. The pork was falling off the bone.. Juicy and succulent.. lamb was good too but had a very strong mutton taste, a little too over powering! Over all a good place to have a chilled out relaxed evening.. Plus point for smokers-they let you smoke inside the restaurant at the table.. But extremely disgusting for non smokers, since smoking is banned in public places and restaurants..

Well away from the RDB Boulevard Crowd but well within walking distance. The bar is located inside a corporate park and that speaks abundant....beautiful inside, well lit, very presentable and quite the 1st-floor bar. Food was good, I have had better sheekh¬†kebabs in comparison. A good place to hang out with your crew in the evening!! Looking forward to visiting the place once again.

I am a regular here and would like to highlight on the fact that this place serves delicious food.you must have their chicken velvet, herby chicken finger and the lip smacking chilly oyster fish...!!! 
Apart from that there various other food items that can be gorged on. 

Yes the quantity is a little on the smaller side but the taste makes it up for the small quantity... !!! 

Now the point that really attracts me here is the fact that the price of liquor here is slightly on the lower side.
There are so many places in sector 5 and this place stands out for its amazing n strategic pricing of liquor...!!! 

The music is very loud and at times it is almost unbearable and you can hardly hear somebody else‚Äôs voice...so I prefer to stay down than the 1st floor.

Shisha was not up to the mark, was corrected several times. Food was good. Had ordered for Sweet corn Soup, Cheese french Fries, Tandoori platter. They  had few brands in Beer.

Believe me chicken velvet was just mind blowing in test. Fully covered in cheeseüòç‚ù§Ô∏è The decor is pretty good.

Its amazing how ppl r so quick to writeoff a place with a drop of a hat without even undestanding the concept n theme of a place. Been to major clubs,pubs,watrholes and Michellin Star Restaurants¬† and im compelled to back up this place with all my heart. Every entertainment and food joint round the globe runs on 6 basic principles,which are, Price, People,Food, Service,Ambience and Music. 1@Price(Its the most balanced priced restobar in the city and for a place like Sector V). 2@People(A very good mix of corporates and young people. Im simply glad that i dont have to walk into a cheap crowd peddling their dirty trade around the place. Weekends can get really exciting and crowded). 3@Service(Believe me the place has the most sorted barmen and serrvice staff i have seen around anywhere. I have dined at Michellin Star restaurants in Paris,Munich and Brussels. Even staffs in those restaurants tend to ignore u after a certain point even after paying 500-600Euros for a meal). 4@Food(I have never found anything wrong with the menu yet everytime i ordered across the table.¬† The menu is just right for a resto-pub. And taste buds differ from individuals.) 5@Ambience(Well this is what makes one repeat a place everyother time. If u think walking into a club with flashy Neon lights and Extensive capeting is healthy and fancy, u will also have to keep in mind that those places are the ones which are peddled around the most. The place is very well maintained, its clean and organised. I have a serious OCD so its just suits my way of things. The theme of the place is that of a minimal and with 2 huge floors and a private group table a.k.a THE VIKING's TABLES which easily accomodates a gang of 10+, i think thats the best u could think of. If it had to be single floor or a rooftop place you could have automatically experimented with that kind of a place). 6@Music(DJRajveer is a seriously entertaining mixer. I have heard DJ's switching to Bhangra and clumsy mixes when the crowd becomes demanding. He knows what he is playing. Yes it does get loud but isnt that what clubs are meant to be? If u r looking to listen to ur BF/GF why dont u snuggle up at a cafe!).¬†
Overall PREACH is just the kind of place i would gather my folks for a good night out. Confident of walking into a decent crowd with very good food, Sisha and some serious good music by DJRV.

Didn't like the place... Not so good ambience with too much loud music that you won't be able to hear the person sitting next to you. They have two floors without any separate smokingzone.
Well..The food is really average....
Also you won't get any complimentory snacks with your drinks.(which almost every big or small bar in the city offers)
So if you are a lover of loud music, hookah and not so good food then this is the place for you.

....
Giving 3 for the decor.

I can pass on this place truth to be told. Over the top loud music with rather non - required videos on the large screen. It sometimes makes you feel like you're in some kind of a shady bar. Ambiance is not at all good. The hookah is cheap. However the taste is more of "chaltah hain" type. 
Food is average to the most. Like half of their food from the menu wasn't available. Whatever they brought was decent enough.
However the service is courteous and the cater to your need. 
Whoever has office nearby and want to have budget hookah and cheap drinks and/or bored with opium you can definitely go else you can skip this one.

I had visited this place along with my five friends last Friday and below are the drinks and food items we had ordered-
1.Two King Fisher Premium (650 ml).
2. 6 Red-Label (60 ml) (Buy one get one offer was going on)
3. 1 Jim Beam (60 ml)
4. Two hookah's¬†
5. 1 Mojito, 1 Cooler's (Strawberry )
6. 1 Tandoori Chicken Full, 1 Hong Kong chicken, 1 Potato Skin With Mushroom.
7. 3 Noodles, 2 Rices and 1 Chicken items (We packed this things) i forgot the name.¬†¬†

A shocking bill of Rs-10,077 has come. We had done one mistake by not analyzing the bill properly as we had to left the place in a hurry and we have lost the bill eventually.¬†
The next day i called them up and asking for the bill (They must have another copy) again as i wanted to see why it was so much! The guy who picked up told me he'll call me back and provide the details in an hour. As expected, didn't get a call from them.
Coming to food quality- it was average, the coolers was pathetic so does the noodles and chicken items.
So, if you are visiting this place beware of the bill and analyze the break-ups properly.

Went there during durga puja. Had a nice experience with friends. The ambience is pretty cool for friends to hangout, who can booze, and have fun in the dance floor and some music. I must add a point that the dance floor is not big at all. The place is easily crowded during the night. They also have curtains for a section who dont wanna dance and just enjoy some booze with music on! 
Next I would like to add that I had tasted the Hong Kong chicken and pan fried noodles. The noodles was okay but the chicken was flat in taste. Then tried the fire shot and it was good. The service at bar counter is also good. They also have offers for different days of the week. One must checkout those offers, specially girls, bcoz there are free shots on Wednesdays. 
Overall a nice place to hang out and booze in cheap.

Coming to the food part. We had Schezwan Chicken, Shepherd Pie, smoked fish, pork ribs. All the items are delicious.

Good place for booze and hookha only drawback is the beer is a bit costly here.
Another problem is their complimentary with beer.
They serve exactly 5 fried potato wedges without any refill. Yes no repitation of complimentary items.
Coming to the food the wings and tandoori chicken were decent, enjoyed them.
Sisha is available but they dont have the flavours menu so they should make one soon.
Overall not a bad place, good value for money but they should improve their service which was a lagging and reduce the price of beer.

I was really misleaded by a review which said its one of the best pub around.I really didn't like anything about the place.Firstly the decor is quirky but nothing special.The tables are so close to each other you would feel like sitting on the next person's table.Secondly the ambience is too loud and there was so much smoke my eyes started burning the moment I entered the first floor.We were a group of five we settled for the less loud ground floor.Coming to alcohol..there were only 2cocktails available which pub has that? Wierd.Further they didnt even have any mocktail other than virgin mojito.However we ordered from whatever was available.None of the mix was good.
Now, coming to starters we had ordered pan fried fish,murgh musallam,warm chicken.The portions were too less according to the price.Further apart from pan fried fish everything else was just edible.For the main course we had ordered Chicken Velvet,Lamb roast in mint sauce and pork chop as everything else in the continental menu was not available.Apart form chicken velvet everything else waa nt edible.Lamb roast smelled bad and it seemed half cooked.Special mention to the Pork chop which was again not cooked properly.Even after us repeatedly asking if the item will contain fat.The person taking the order said no but when the Pork chop came the entire chunk was fat and we had to waste the entire piece.
To me the entire night got to a waste as I fell sick after eating the food.
I will never recommend this place to anyone.But unfortunately if you have to eat here just have beer and chinese thats the only thing edible here it seems.

Located at the same row as kareem's and 10 downing Street, just the backside of fbb. The place has two floor , ground-floor is for private seating arrangement and the 2 nd floor is for dancing area ,bar or may be for dj. The interior is simple,nothing about noteworthy. In the ground-floor they were playing MTV music but the sound was faded by the upper floor's dj music which was so much loud that you can't hear the voice of your next person. They served indian, Chinese and continental cusine there. We opted for continental and ordered American corn and paneer cake for starter, Mexican veg and curry paneer steak with rice for main course. As per the quantity price will make a big whole in your pocket. Taste is average nothing about extraordinary. According to menu many of foods and liquor were not available though it was a normal weekdays. Service was very much slow. The restaurant was average in all categories I am not feeling like want to visit again. You can go there to just recover your boredom of a normal day.

One of the best Bar & Grills witnessed in the North Part of the City . Some great ambience with amazing concepts of Table & Seatings which gives an exceptional and proper pub feel. Food Quality & Service on time with some different delicacies than just the usual. The place is cozy and beautiful for some chill time in the afternoon and early parts of the day with great deals and offers on their food and alcohol which is completely pocket friendly. I would suggest this place to most of the North segment of the crowd and other people as well.

Decor :
This place is very close to my office. It's a new place in sector 5 saltlake. The ambience is cool. Decor is quite interesting too. It has two floor which makes it a decently big place.
Food :
We had chicken combo, mutton combo and veg combo. Price was very reasonable but when the combo plates arrived we were shocked with the quantity which was very inadequate and then the price didn't seem to be reasonable. I didn't like the taste much. Food was disappointing.
Service:
Service was late and not very impressive.

Visited this place last night for a birthday celebration ,the space inside is spread over two floors , the upper with a dance floor and a private sitting area which we occupied .Already quite late for dinner and they accept the last order on food at 10:35 pm , so didn't get much scope to expirement with the menu. The entire list of chicken main courses and shepherds pie from continental section of the menu was unavailable , we had MURGH ANGARA KEBAB , FISH MONRAY , CHICKEN COCO VIN , SMOKED FISH , HONGKONG CHICKEN and CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES along with Teen Paan hookah.The food was served quick and hot , and each dish was done well. the music played by the dj were mainly punjabi tracks alternating with Bollywood numbers and definitely can be upgraded with better choice of playlist. Overall satisfied with the food quality at such affordable rates , the unavailability issue if ignored.

Very helpful, friendly staff with good suggestions for food and drinks. The ambience is enjoyable and the corner seat is a particular favourite. 

The food they provide has a lot of variety and is prepared pretty great. Though the choice of liqour and cocktails is very limited (was disappointed to not find Tonic water with my Gin), it is made up for with the warm staff and lively music along with reasonably priced dishes.

Located in Srijan Tech Park this is a perfect drink and dine place. Though they serve hookah as well but the drinks menu is just amazing. The food menu has Indian, Chinese and Continental cuisines. The Tandoori chicken and the Pork seekh kabab are pure love. If you want to have a good mocktail do try the Mojito and the Blue lady here. The Chicken velvet and the bacon and chicken are worth trying as well. They have a good range of Indian scotch and whiskey. Beer lovers, you won't be disappointed here. Wouldn't call it pocket friendly but not hell of a costly place as well. But I can give you this, you are not going to regret your time here üòä

Went there on a Monday night. Almost empty, except for some tables upstairs, which is where we sat.
Dim lights, okay. But no proper music. They actually just played MTV on a projector. That's just unacceptable.

We ordered beers, 5 Kingfisher Storms @150 each.

Food. Ordered pork ribs and chicken & bacon.
Very less quantities. The plate had one rib. And five very tiny pieces of chicken wrapped in bacon. Taste was okay.

A big plus is that you can smoke where you sit.

Ok, so for my fellow viewers, here's a quick pro's and con's of preach! 

Pro's:

Ambience was sooo sooo sooo unique! Out of the box idea. 
The staff and the waiters were very well behaved. We visited preach for a friend's birthday!  And we were just 3 of us. They offered us the best seat. Secluded from the main area! That was very much a cordial behaviour! 
And now, the food! It was THE BEST FOOD IN SEC 5. i can bet! BEST AND EASY ON THE POCKET. 
Alcohol is reasonable too!


Con's: 
*after 5 mins of head scratching! NOTHING! 

P.s : pork ribs were yum!!

I went with my colleagues for lunch, it was a birthday treat. The decor is totally apt for boozing and getting stoned with dim lights and live music. And coming to the food we ordered virgin mojito,peas pulao, fish amritsari, chicken vrindaloo. The food was tasty with a perfectly made virgin mojito, I guess the best one available. The staffs were good and professional and the price was fairly reasonable. The only drawback I felt was on their quantity, rest the fish Amritsari was too good and don't miss their hot chocolate brownie. So according to me
Interior - 8/10
Taste - 8/10
Quantity - 5/10
Quality - 8/10
Service - 8/10
On a whole it was a good experience and will surely visit again for the virgin mojito and brownie for sure.

We went on Thursday . Waiters were too good . They were serving and servicing all the time . Environment was love totally . Dark and yellow lamps were there .Music was also good and last dishes were so much delicious
We ordered warm chicken, Mexican veg spaghetti 
Drinks - hang your brain shooters ., Gin and ordered teen paan hooka. The hooka was so strongandfelt drowsy . Recommend to go and spend . It is nice pub and it 's not so costly .

You can try pan fried pork, it's a nice preparation. Chicken side dishes also have enough of quantity.
But only a negative point would be the loud sound of the music system in the upper floor.
Overall a nice place for a dinner date!

So finally I'm writing my review for the Sector V, Salt Lake expertise on Zomato!! üòä

Preach! Well, visited this place a couple of weeks back. It's located at PS Srijan Corporate Park, near RDB Cinema, the same area where 10 Downing Street, Barcode, Kareem's and Genuine Broaster Chicken stand.

This place offers a 2 level seating arrangement. The upper floor is basically the party spot, accommodating the DJ, the Bar, a giant screen and so on. At first, we had taken our table over there. But the music didn't let us sit there for long. It was really really loud. I mean, I literally couldn't hear my friend from right across the same table. We shifted back downstairs. The lower level was quiet and simple. Interior was decent.... Nothing out of the box, yet not bad as well.

Coming to food, we had ordered Mutton Galouti Kebabs, Spaghetti Napolitana and Toast Basket teamed with a couple of Pink Panther mocktails. The Toast Basket was suggested by the Manager over there and it was really good! The Spaghetti was a bit too spicy, yet nonetheless was pretty decent... I enjoyed it. The Mutton Galouti Kebabs, as remarked by my friend, didn't taste the authentic way. All over, it was decent but somehow I felt, was not worth the pocket pinch.

Last and not the least, hospitality was good. Staff were quite courteous and helping. ‚ò∫

This is quite the place if you wish to let off the steam of one long work-loaded week. The loud music gives you a TGIF feeling no doubt. The ambiance is quite wholesome with a unique sort of theme that resembles a jail or a dungeon as cleverly suggested by a friend; not to mention the assortment of cuisines offered here-the continental ones catching one's attention quickly with their exotic names and pocket friendly prices. We tried out continental dishes there and were quite happy with our choices. A particular recommendation from my end would be Fish Morney- a delightful cuisine comprising of fish fillets baked in cheese and strewn with the goodness of veggies. The mushroom omelette that we tried out was not as amazing as we expected it to be but reasonably good. All in all..quite a gratifying experience if you are with your chosen company and choose the dishes well!

Had been to this place on last valentines day as all the other places were either super expensive or full to the brim. The place is quite huge. They have a seating on the ground floor as well as the first floor. The music was quite loud, but considering we had no other good option, we chose to bear with it. I dont know if the loud music was on behalf of the special occasion or that is how loud it is usually, but if you are planning on spending a quite date, cross it off your list. The ambience was not bad and the prices were dirt cheap. They did have an extensive menu though but since it was a brand new place we chose to opt for the staples.

We ordered chinese, Indian as well as a continental cuisine. Sadly, the Chinese and Indian dishes were quite disappointing. The continental however was good. Not super good, but in comparison to the other dishes, it was the star! 

Liquour however was dirt cheap. So if you are lo
oking for a nice place to hangout with your pals for booze and dont mind average good, preach is a really good option!

Visited this restro cum pub ¬†last saturday . ¬†
It has a rusticity to its ambience. It covers two floors. The first floor has the DJ who plays awesome and loud music. Completely suitable if you are in a party mood. If not in mood for loud music then can accommodate yourself on the ground floor.
The first floor has the bar but the drinks can be served to you on the ground floor also. The smoking zone is the first floor where they also serve hookah.
Coming to the food, we had:
Pork Boti Din Raat which was quite good,
Pork Ribs which was juicy and delicious,
Bacon and chicken which were succulent but a little bit salty,
Chicken Cinzano which was tasty,
Brownie which was a huge let down, it was two three days old and quite bad in taste.
The service was good. However, they forgot to bring the potato and greens which are served along with Chicken Cinzano and when I reminded them, they brought it within 5 mins.
So overall experience was good, not a pinch on the pocket.

Will visit again :)

I was out on a Friday night with my friends and nearly every place around the block was full or had a waiting time of 20-40 minutes. So we noticed Preach and on zomato, it had a 3.5 rating. Though it was too low for my liking, I thought wth.. Let's give it a shot. 
Well, I'd have to say that after eating there, I believe the rating is too generous. For both food and ambiance. 

Starting with the ambiance, I entered the place and started coughing. I smoke, so a little smoke doesn't bother me much, but this was a mess. Our server wanted to know if we preferred sitting upstairs and since we were first timers, none of us knew what that meant, so we tagged along. 
The music was dangerously loud. I've been in high end pubs and random parties, but this had to be the loudest music I've ever heard in a cramped confined space filled with smoke and men. It was unbearable. So we came back down and ordered food. 
We took something called cheese and fries I guess, in the description of which it said that it was fries with cheesy sauce. What we got however, was weird textured French fries with zero seasoning and grated processed cheese sprinkled on top. Forget sauce, it wasn't even melted. The fries tasted like those store bought ones which have been left to thaw for too long. 
Next we ordered teriyaki pork. I found it to be too salty, not exactly teriyaki to begin with. And it was too stiff. You shouldn't give spoon and fork with a pork dish, FYI. 
Don't think I'd be going back here. One time was enough. Only pro, the booze is cheap and if you can handle torture on your eardrums, you can smoke freely.

Had an amazing time here last evening. We checked in at around 6. We were the first ones there.. Hence  there wasn't much of an ambience to go around. But around 7:30 it picked up. And how!! The dj belting out foot tapping numbers and the crowd playing along on the dance floor. Helluva place. The prices are fair, both for the bar and food. The food tastes pretty good as well. Some of them were outstanding. Especially the Hungarian chicken and shepherd's pie. The service staff were very very courteous. Look to be back here soon, when in the city..

Want to hang out with your friends and you do not want it to burn a hole in your pocket, Preach is the place to be. Ambience and interior is quite interesting with an energetic DJ who kept on playing foot tapping numbers throughout the evening.
You can also utilize the dance floor though it is a little squeezed for space. However the food is of average taste and they need to improve since they have tough competition across the road. The bartender(Pradip) is an artist with the burning shots. The waiting service is impressive.

Location: PS Srijan Corporate Park, opposite Rdb cinemas in sector v

Decor and ambience: a mix and natch of luxury and funky, a rare one there, wooden tables and chairs, semi graphiti walls and a duplex setup, perfect for friends hangout or a fine dinner with family

Food and menu: Continental, chinese, Indian on the menu and we tried Continental and Chinese. The fish fingers were different and pleasantly so where as the cream french fries were just about fine
My friends thot the red sauce pasta was mind blowing whereas the fried rice was great too, the chilli oyster chicken could have been a shade btter

Staff: a brilliant bunch there, courteous, always smiling and ready to help and serving at good speeds, they even pulled down a giant screen so that the four of us(just 4) could have easy viewing of the songs they were playing

Overall: a bit more work on the taste front and this will be a table topper soon

This is one of the new bar and restro hub at sector V and it's a wonderful place. I went there last night with friends and was glad to find a place upstairs. The ambience is good with dim lights, amazing music with a good DJ ! and a cheerful crowd.
We took beers, some whiskey for drinks. And as for the food we took Pork Ribs and Chicken Hot Garlic Dry. The Pork Ribs were perfect, although a little more quantity would have been better. The Chicken dish was pretty nice as well.¬†
Best part of this place is definitely the music and their dj who mixes the songs so well ! I look forward to going there again !There's also a small dance floor to shake a leg !

The place is decent by location and decor. The music was pretty loud and the DJ was stuck on pretty mediocre, generic bollywood songs. Also, smoking at the table was allowed instead of a smoking zone which resulted in a not so great experience. The menu is fairly priced on the first look but on reading the fine print it is overpriced considering the place. All the food we tried was on the oilier side and over-done. LIIT pitcher was not on offer but the glass was OK. The service is tardy considering the army of workforce visible. Orders and drink refills were done at their convenience and took their own sweet time. Overall an average place I wouldn't want to visit again or suggest any friends.

An average place located in the same building as 10D just at the corner, decor isn't great as compared to other place in the locality. Food is really average to say the least. Servers are slow dull and lack enthusiasm they need a makeover before it's too late.

Visited this place twice and really a place worth visiting and to destress ourselves. Starting from the decor its unique and modern. Service is very good, these people are eager to help and to make you feel comfortable worth praising are the staff out there. Now comes the food, menu is vast and both in veg and non veg there are choices and i ordered for paneer tikka and my friend for chicken kabab and food was really really good taste wise and even presentation was good. A little complain is that they don't serve any thing complimentary with drinks and secondly being a bit dark place one cannot read the menu as the words are small, i used my mobile torch to place the order. Rest everything was fine a place you can say pearl in kolkatas resto bar - lounge. Worth mentioning is the house dj he is really good at his job and keeps everybody happy with their fav music, large screen tv adds more glamour to his tunes. Overall worth visiting.

Been here with my family, but I was quite disappointed with the quality if service they provided. On a Sunday afternoon we were the only customers but they took a lot of time to serve the food. They didn't had many items available from their menu as well. They were also very slow in giving the bill. But good thing was their taste which was quite good. Then again the spoilt sport was the apple pie which felt like it was at least a couple of days old.

Ambiance & Decor: 5/5

Been there twice but 2nd time didn't able to get the alcohol as they were having some issues with the license things, may be because it is just newly opened. Nice an decent ambience with lovely decor. light music with limited song collection, don't expect much in music dept else u will be disappointed ... Head toward the backstage if u love bass n pumping music that automatically makes u tap ur feet. Alcohol are decently priced I would rather say best. Food is ok ok. Ordered mutton tikka or something which was just average so after that ordered the common chilly chicken which was also average. Staffs are good and service is nice n decent . I would say its a value for money bar&pub. One more thing I missed.   THEY DON'T SERVE COMPLIMENTARY WITH YOUR ALCHOHOL ORDERS.... BETTER BRING YOUR CHIPS & PEANUTS ..

Well, this review is based on not just one, but 2 visits to this same place in a small span of 7 days!

While casually strolling through Sector 5, Saltlake, I encountered this place ‚Äì nearby the RDB Cinemas and immediately entered for their veg thali priced at Rs. 199 /- + taxes!

They agreed to serve me the thali even after I had arrived after the normal lunch hours ‚Äì a gesture well appreciated by me. Ambience of the place is fine, with beer drums used as table lights. In the evenings, a Dj operates at the 1st floor and a projector plays Bolly songs.

I started off with a couple of veg kebabs ‚Äì which were just fine ‚Äì nothing to boast much about. Next came the main course ‚Äì 

Dal makhani ‚Äì pretty average, garlic over powering it‚Äôs taste

Mixed vegetable ‚Äì Not tasty at all

Naan ‚Äì Pretty good

Pulao ‚Äì Fine, but way too oily

Raita - okayish

Gulab Jamun - Fine

A complimentary papad as well as some salads were also served. This meal was overall a pretty mediocre experience!

A week later, I made a move again to this place and this time opted for some Italian cuisine instead of the regular North Indian. I ordered a Veg Augratin ‚Äì which was piping hot and superb on taste ‚Äì 1 of the better ones I have ever had. It was served with some complimentary cheese garlic breads, which went very well along with the gratin.

For beverages, I had the Fire and Ice mocktail, which was fine ‚Äì a mixture of chilly as well as lemonade. Finally, I ended with the walnut cake served along with vanilla ice cream, which was good, although, the cake was way too rich and heavy than it ought to have been.

Prices are somewhat high which is justified.

USP of the place is the superb service, they attempt to make you as comfortable as possible.

In a nutshell, expect exceptional service, good ambience and not so tasty food.

We ordered Mutton Raan Nawabi (boneless) as take away. 
It was a mutton dish but we found chicken pieces ( looked liked chewed) and not sure why they call it boneless. We had to chew mutton bones much to our disgust. And it was so spicy that we could hardly eat. Definitely not repeating ad they certainly do not "preach" good customer experience and quality food.

The ambience is really nice but I wish they had worked on their food too. Its pocket friendly but then completely dissatisfied with the food. We ordered North Indian and Continental. One can try Continental but the north indian is a complete no no. The starters are fair enough except for Hara bhara kebab (please dont try ordering it). In mocktails we ordered fresh lime soda which was pathetic.¬†

Just 2 good things about this place- the ambience and the staff. The staff is quite humble and always on their toes.

One may just drop in for some light snacks.

It's nice to know that a chef forgets how a dish is made.

This was my 2nd visit to Preach, and a dish which I liked first time was served to me in a complete different way, different taste, different ingredients and different look.

And alcohol is not served on Thursdays. What rule is this and where is it written??

Completely disappointed and erased from my to visit list. Never again.

I selected ¬†this place for a friend's birthday party and all of us just loved this place. A great place, good food, good ambiance, service though was a bit slow which was then looked after a complain to the manager. There is a dance floor as well. We had lots of fun since the DJ played good music.Talking about dishes, there were less options for vegetarians like us to select but whatever food we ordered was tasty. Moreover, the place is quite pocket friendly. There is certainly a room for a bit improvement but all over a great place to visit. I would really suggest to visit this place at least once.

When you are in the same complex where another wonderful restaurant is housed, comparisons are bound to happen.  Located in PS Srijan complex, Preach is a nice restro-bar. However, 10 Downing street is very close by. Hence, the competition among the two. The ambience at Preach is more like a pub, dim lighting, quirky seating arrangements and decor. The upper section has a huge tv, so whenever there is a good football match, this place might seem ideal. In terms of food, the menu is interesting with continental, chinese and indian cuisines. I had opted for their thali option though, which one can opt if they really hungry. Basically indian stuff in the thali option. Taste was decent, service was good too; though i felt there is scope for improvement on both fronts.

Located in Sector 5 this newly opened restaurant is good. I went with my friends and were satisfied with the taste of food but the price could have been kept minimal.Since the pub is upstairs too much of loud noise was destroying our evening and also there are hell lot of mosquiotoes not letting us to sit.

Must try are the thalis, which comes at a very reasonable price and is quite filling. Having loved the food we visited them after office, the beer and liquor price a very reasonable. DJ plays good music and always ready to take requests. Courteous and well behaved staff. A must try for all age group....

Now the price, its very pocket friendly and would definitely attract crowd. We ordered a Shisha (only 250 bucks) and beer. Beers are all in big bottles. Coming to food, fast service, food tastes good. Conti dishes are a must try. Had a nice time on Women's Day.......

They do not specialize in the chinese cuisine. I had ordered American chopsuey and it was excessively sour. When we called the manager they said that this is how chopsuey are prepared(like I was tasting it for the 1st time duh!) . We asked for a replacement but was given a bland veg fried rice instead. We had also ordered 2 chicken side dishes out of one couldn't reach the table and the other had no seasoning. Surprisingly after we were done I noticed one of the waiters started laying desert plates on the table.  On asking he said it's a complimentary.  We waited for it to arrive but to my utter dismay he came back and took back the plates.  Such behaviour is not expected at any restaurant.  Even the quantity for continental is too less compared to the high price.

Quality of food is super disgusting. Yesterday we went there and had a very very bad experience. I ordered Hungering‚Äã Chicken (Rs 279) which had hardly 4-5 small pieces of shredded chicken and very small quantity of rice. Absolutely not worth.
Specially the manager is very bad mannered guy. They just don't care about our complaint regarding food.
PLEASE DO NOT GO THERE. !!!!!

"A very good example of a very bad restaurant ! "
I have never left such a negative review in my life and I do realize that this is not a starred restaurant,but dear me, I also think that you can expect some sort of standard when you out to eat. Unfortunately, the standard at this restaurant was very poor!!! Where do I start?
Having entered the restaurant, we were offered seat to sit and relax and select the menu. Afterall this was my 4th visit today! So i really happy and excited cz i was ordering my fav food.... But this was my worst experience today.

Coming to the Manager and his team
Mr.Manager trust me you were very arrogant!! Being a manager of the restaurant..your first priority should be ur guests!!! We had called you 3-4 times. Yet u sat back and took ur gala time to come.
Being a manager u should have attended the guests instead of sitting back.

Coming to the waiter who took our order
You were damm confused about what you should serve or what you shouldn't serve!!!
Please wake up!!
U need to guide the guets... Instead i saw that the guests had more knowledge about the food items than u.

Guys!! Never order fresh lime soda
Fresh lime soda =water full glass+2spoons of soda+1drop of lemon
Cost is 100/glass

This was my 4th visit to the restaurant and was very shocked to see the way it was degraded.¬†
It was suppose to be one of my favorite ¬†restra and have referred to many people over there.
1. Quantity is almost reduced to Half .Its like before for ¬†Rs300 combo we were unable to finish it but now we are hungry
2.Have ordered the veg baked dish which i am ordering third time ..the taste , quantity ,quality everything degraded. Garlic bread served with it was stinking.
3. Ordered Lime soda.. It was Clearly known that water was mixed and not at all sweet.
4. Escalated the same to manager ¬†he was least bothered to listen our reviews and the same with the staff.
After 5th call ¬†manager has visited in front of us for formality
5.It was just waste we payed Rs4000 bill and everyone came out hungry.

I must say this restaurant has ¬†high time disappointed the whole group ¬†and would never recommend to anyone.

i went to ¬†preach on a weekday afternoon for lunch with my colleagues. The food was pathetic, the service was very slow and the staff was not at all mannerful. The quantity served was so less that it could hardly feed a person. In comparison to the quantity the price was very high. Please dont go to this place and waste your time and money and mood as well :-(¬†
It was a total disaster.

Very bad. THis was my 5th visit to the restaurant in the span of 2 months and it gave me worst experience .The food quantity was meagre.I went there with a group of 10 .None of us are happy with the food.
There was a huge time delay in the service.The lime soda was just water with slight taste of lemon and no sugar or salt in it.
I will never visit this place ever.
I had taken my friends there to give them a good food experince and they are dissapointed and I am feeling the same.
Even the manager tried to convince us with useless reasons.
one of my friend got the food served after everyone had finished their meal and also the food was not good for value.¬†
I wount not even give 1 rating if it is not mandatory.

Super bad.. not recommending. 
Food was exceptionally bad in taste and very low in quantity. we received our ordered food after ~40 mins later. we ask waiter to talk with the manager but initially he just ignored. after that when manager came we explained all our grievances regarding food.  and he just gave us some disgusting answers like our chaff has been changed..  this is too much.. and we are not the first time went there, it was our third time within a span of 2 months..
Mr Owner: I have provided my cell number in the feedback form. if you want to know in detail for the sake of your business please call me anytime..

I was really disappointed by this place. They let me down so badly in front of my guests.¬†

I ordered, a plate of seekh kebabs for 209 bucks +taxes what I got was probably 1 seekh kebab cut into six tiny pieces one of which was about an inch long!!!

Stinky Aloo in Kashmiri Aloo Dum which was inedible and had to be thrown. A plate of chicken vindaloo which claimed it would have 6 boneless pieces but has 2 itsy bitsy bony pieces of chicken with 4 potatoes and one portion of something called Kesar Paneer which was a greasy mess with some white unappetising stinky (Again) gravy WHERE IS KESAR??? why would you even call it Kesar Paneer? ¬†The paneer was just enough to fill 1/4 of the box they packed it in. I ordered 2 dals through Swiggy and got only 1! The dal was definitely NOT dal Makahani. It was a watered down Mah Ki Dal!

Exorbitant prices for such measly portions.¬†

BAD, ugly food which was a disgrace!!! I have never been so mortified in front of any guests, EVER!!!
¬†
Shame on you guys for calling what I received yesterday as food! Why would you give rotten food (Potatoes) to people?¬†

AVOID!

Not the best place .. at first the ambience seemed promising and so did pricing of alcohol .. but the food was HORRIBLE.. and so was the music ! Besides they served a vegetarian person chicken .. service is also very very bad ! The waiters argue .. and THE TYPE OF MUSIC .. loud ear drum piercing Bollywood music is not always liked by people .. there should be variation and a good mix of newer western songs as well .

Preach is the newly opened Pub in the already crowded pub scene of Sector V. I decided to visit it for my Sunday dinner and booze with some of my friends. To my utter surprise the ground floor was completely empty and the reason being they weren't serving liquor for the day. I was about to turn away when they informed us that they can serve only beer. So we made our way to the first floor. For the starters we stuck to the basics of Chicken Tandoori, Fish Tikka and some mushroom dish of which I have forgotten the name. All of them were well prepared and we liked. For mains also I stuck to the tried and tasted Chicken Hakka Chowmein and wasn't disappointed. Although the quantity served was less but the preparation was good. Thr overall bill including a dessert and two beer bottles came for around 1500 which I think is quite reasonable. What makes this pub a little 'hatke' from others is the booze pricing is nominal and also the ambience is good. So if you are looking for some new place in the Sector V area to crash in with your friends, you can give this one a try. Although it needs to up it's service a bit if it wants to stay in the stiff competition in that area.

A very nice place in the heart of the sector 5
Ideally located - exactly in the opposite of RDB cinemas.
The most convenient part was parking - it has a designated parking space where most places lag behind.
Shisha was good.

Food and friend goes hand in hand. Meeting a friend almost after a year needs celebration and here we were ending up a new, little known restaurant-Preach. We never knew the food journey to this new place explored would be fruitful. Everything out there is worth appreciating, the food, the service, staff  members, ambience and the moment spent. The manager ensured that we were given their best services.

A must visit for foodies, families, people planning to surprise their loved ones on their birthday. They play live music. Music played on large screen, which would entertain the kids and the dance lover. I look forward to go to this place as I love this place. 

Overall it gets 5 from me. üòÉ

This is a favourite haunt for all the corporate professionals, here at sector 5, where you can get liquor at reasonable price without compromising the quality of food and ambience. If it's a Friday evening then expect to wait in a long queue for getting a table! Food tastes good. #, Hungarian chicken chilly fish #dry chilli chicken are the few recommended dishes here.

Located in the same campus as that of 10 Downing Street, this is a newly opened restaurant in Sec. V opposite RDB. The ambiance is really good. The service is proper, and the food is good too. If you are a first time visitor, then you get a free mock-tail if you like their page in front of them. We got one of pineapple flavor. We ordered the veg combo, pork chops and shepherd's pie. The veg thali was good. It contained, a roasted papad, 2 hari bhari kababs, salad, raita, 1 masala kulcha, a portion of jeera rice, dal makhani, mixed veg and 1 gulab jamun (Rs. 199). The shepherd's pie (Rs. 299) was really filling, though it could do with a little more cheese. However, the pork chops (Rs. 299) my friend had was disappointing with a big piece of bone. I would suggest that if you order pork chops, just check it once, so that you can get it changed if you are not happy.

It's a newly opened restaurant in sector 5. It's in the same campus as 10DS. Ambiance here is quite average. I had a mocktail named Blue Basil Creature which I found to be good. Drinks menu is limited. We had American corn pepper salt which was good and crispy potato chilly with cheese which was pretty average. Since it is a new , the staff is not trained well enough. They need some more grooming.

Planning to hangout during the evening? 
Well I can suggest you PREACH. 
Located near the infinity benchmark, sector 5, is a new addition to the pubs in salt lake.
It does not remain that crowded still it can attract pub hoppers by its loud music and a good ambiance.

The music is quite loud in the first floor with a good enough dance floor to groove with the tunes. A good lighting and a proper atmosphere to set the mood for partying.
Talking about the ground floor, well it's completely different. The music is very low and well litted up by lanterns with certain wall hangings to give it a look of the country side bars. Well to match to this environment get yourself a beer with some sides, specially the murg tangri kebab, which was really delicious and get on a good conversation with your companies.

Adding to this, the management was really nice to us with no delay and no cons in their services. So a thumbs up for that. 

So just break into the place and decide the mood you want to set yourself for the evening.

After reading some of the reviews and going thru their menu, I had order Chicken Burgundy with rice thru "swiggy". Liked the food and was delivered on time. So thought of visiting the place with some friends, the decor was good. 
Service is pathetic! The staffs are confused with their roles, they don't even know what they hv in their menu, what they can serve us. We ordered our food (we were a group of 6), 1st a person came and took our order, after 10-15 mins another person came to take our order again saying that the 1st person didn't note the orders so he forgot. They don't even know hw to take orders. After waiting for 2 hours they came with one Rajasthani thali which didn't hv paneer even though it ws mentioned in the menu. When asked one of the waiter confidently replied this thali doesn't consist of paneer, another person pointed out the 'kadi pakoda' as paneer. What a stupid way to fool ur customers as if we can't differentiate btwn paneer and kadi pakoda. After a wait of more than two hours they could serve food to 4 of us only, the other 2 friends didn't even get what they ordered. we could not waste anymore time so we asked for the bill and they didn't even know what they have served us. They took more time with the bill as well. There were 2 other groups as well and they also left disappointed not getting there food served. It was a horrible experience. Oh! I must say the food was not bad but after such a bad experience the food also didn't taste that great. I will never visit this place ever again. If this is the kind of service they provide I hv a doubt for how long they can survive as there are a variety of restaurants in this area with much better service.

Visit the place only if u have atleast 3-4 hours in hand.

Had a horrible horrible experience. Went with friends to have lunch and I swear we will never ever visit this place again! If there is any worst way to describe the service apart from using words like - 'pathetic'/'unpleasant' I would use that. The management is absolutely unorganized, don't have a clue on how to take orders and deliver them. We were 6 people and had waited 2 hours to get our orders. Out of the 6 dishes ordered, we were served with only 2 dishes and that too the inclusions of those dishes doesn't matches with the description as per their menu. For eg., in a Rajasthani combo meal we were not served with 'Paneer' and while inquiring about the same one of the manager told us (pointing towards 'kadi pakoda') - Sir, there is the paneer. Wat the !!! We ordered 2 beers and after waiting for 1 hour we were told that the beers were kept in the refrigerator a while ago and we have to wait till those gets chilled. There were 4-5 other group of people and all of them have experienced similar service and has left the place without having anything. We also had to do the same after getting served with the alcohol and 2 dishes. However we were decent enough to ask for a bill (of whatever we have consumed). Even that took them 30 mins to figure out what they have served and what not! Finally we left the place disgusted giving them a visiting card so that they can come up with a final bill amount which we can pay. 2 hours later one of their service provider contacted us with the final bill. Even that bill was calculated incorrectly wherein they have included the dishes which they haven't served at all! Also, the service provider doesn't even know how to swipe the card and charge the bill amount!! I am a resto-hopper and a foodie. This is the first time ever I had this miserably inadequate experience with a restaurant. The ambiance was nice and food was 'okay'. However, with this kind of service I doubt whether they can make a name for themselves. ¬†They need to change or reorganize their management on an urgent basis otherwise their reputation is gonna suffer at the end of the day!

The place is divided into 2 floors . Thought the sitting arrangement fir the 1st floor may be designed to accomidate large corporate groups.. but iy feels a bit cluttery. Rhe ground floor looks decent though. 
We missed alcohol as they are about to start serving from 11 of this month. 
Coming to the food and tge mocktails... they were simply outstanding. The blue lady mocktail was served in a bulb shaped jar which looked nice and tasted heavenly. We ordered chicken combo which consisted of jeera rice , kaali daal , shreded chicken curry, gulab jamun , salad and papad. The chicken in burgundy sauce was served with butter rice ... was a burst of cflavours in your mouth..  

Overall the ambience was nice except for the too loud music ... and the staff was very friendly and always hovering around to make ur exp at preach a bit better...

The service is excellent and food is good. Just one complain that I had being a sweet tooth was that there was not much variety in the dessert section. Hope they add more to choose from..Otherwise a good experience...Will like to visit again!

So this one is pretty new amidst the endless eating options in sector 5. Went for lunch today with colleagues. I would say, the first impression is satisfactory with interesting interiors. Now coming to food, starters were served fast as soon as ordered, but somehow the main course took a long time to serve.
Tried crispy chilli babycorn which is like sticking to the basic chinese veg starter and expectedly good.Hot and garlic chicken was spicy and tasty.
They have combo options, which is like a Thali in main course in Indian cuisine as well as few continental platters. So the thali contained nun, jeera rice, dal makhani, fish/chicken curry, fish/chicken fry, raita,papad, gulab jamun. The flavours were authentic and fulfilling, quantity more than enough for one person.
Coming to Continental dishes, somehow they took a very long time to serve them. We tried smoked and grilled fish, both accompanied with boiled veggies and potato.I would say this is not the best place to try continental but not disappointing as well. I was missing the authentic subtle flavours of continental cuisine.
Attenders were helpful and attentive towards the customer needs.Would visit again to try  out the chinese combos and mocktail options.

This new restaurant raised our curiosity due to their pocket price at the first place. When we entered we were amused by the environment. We ordered Herby chicken finger,butter nun and chicken vindaloo. Food was pretty good but the main highlight was their service. They were very attentive. The most important thing is, having a lunch here after mid of the month doesn't hurt the pocket.
P.S. checking in their Facebook page and liking the page gives you a free mocktail.

5 5 and only 5...That's what you can give this food joint. Met with friends here and the food was much more than EXTRAORDINARY. We ordered a pqn fried noodles, Fish maroul and a continental combo(can't remember the name) but all of them were truly appetizing. The Fire n Ice cocktails were out of the world and even the Pink Panther was serioisly awesome. Only the caramel custard tasted a bit bitter but that barely deserves a complain since all the other delicacies stole our foodie hearts. A spacious two storeyed place, devoted to cool decor and an awesome songer who made our evening worth remembering both in terms of food and hospitality.

The newest addition in Sector 5 Saltlake with an admirable ambience ,decor ,people and the food too. All these while it's was constructed I was curious to know that what it was. Finally it opened and yesterday I visited.
It has a very prime and posh location in the IT hub of the city and the way the have put it up is amazing.
The entire restro is divided into two spacious levels and you can easily hold parties in it.
I tried the Strawberry Shisha, Chefs Special spice garlic pepper chicken and Veg Parisienne. The later was a bit new to palate which was layered with pineapple chunks, cheese, veggies in tomatoes and sweetened Arborio rice. All of them were equally great. 
The asked us to checkin through facebook and gave two small complementary fire n ice in mason jars and I loved it so much..
The service was good but at times the servers tried to upswell very politely which is actually a plus point.
The DJ is awesome out here and they will make u feel the beat.
During Christmas they are getting the liquor license For four day as they will hold some great parties. They promised to call me...
Visit and get your chance too!!

They are providing a private lounge too for private parties. This restropub has also opted for liquor license, which will be coming soon according to them. They have very nice interiors with kind of a setting which indicates layman setting, machines and metal junks. Preach is preaching to stay calm and have fun.
For the time being they are serving hookah, for which they don't have a menu yet. Last day we went there, we ordered chili pepper chicken, Veg Parisien and sheesha(strawberry). We got complementary fire and ice drinks too! Food is delicious here, chicken pieces were soft and succulent and perfectly spiced up with peppers and chilli. The veg parisien was layers of baked arborio rice with corn, vegetables, pineapple and cheese. It was good combination of sweet and salt, the garlic toasted breads were adding on to the flavors! Service was a bit slow although and looking for further upgradations at preach as there are other tough competition from close by similarly themed restropubs!
But all this comes at a very reasonable price in preach, so if you are sucker of good food, sheesha and good music then you know where to go! :)

First of all a lot of thanks for the pleasant hospitality and an amazing food.. A must visit.. Present in Srijan Corporate Park.. A heart warming and modernized and a luxirious interior. Very helpful courteous waiters.. And a tasty lip smacking fantastic food.. We went there some time back. Me along with a friend went for an interview nearby and as we were feeling hungry, we thought of giving a try.. Live music cheered our mood.. Now for the food part, had chicken gulmohor.. Nice tender juicy chicken.. Mutton rogan josh was equally juicy.. Soft mutton which seems like melted in your mouth... Gravy was equally tasty and mouth watering. I ordered kulcha while my friend ordered veg pulao.. Kulcha had the right amount of spices what we ate in a hotel in Rajasthan. My friend also said that the polao was equally delicious.. And that was it.. We will be going for the second time.. Thank you
