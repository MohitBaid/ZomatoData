Best of Kerala and lower west coast cuisine served in an intimate, non-nonsense eco-system. The menu is not all-pervasive, thankfully. The options are limited and hence mostly very good. The Mutton Olathede and Kozhi Curry cannot be bettered. The Malabar Paratha is a great compliment to the sides. Highly recommended. Small, independent eateries like Ammini must survive to make Calcutta a food haven that many want it to become.

South Indian restaurants in Calcutta never go below a certain standard, but I have had better in many places even nearby. Swagath, Raj, Banana Leaf - all make dosas and idlis with a better taste.
Ambience is alright. It is spacious.
I came out saying it wasn't bad.

Simple yet perfect. This is what a good restaurant should be like. Comfort food in a cosy environ. The fish curry is delicious with rice and appam, which is melt in your mouth soft. 

The menu does not have a lot of variety but what it does have is prepared and served with thought, attention and promptness rarely seen in other restaurants.

The dosas, roasts are all good. Dig into whatever you like, it won’t disappoint.

Having spent a significant time of life in Dubai and being pampered by authentic Kerala cuisine, my search for the same somehow resolved at this small yet beautiful restaurant. 
I was there with my son and two of his super foodie friends. 
Since we all were extremely hungry, we ordered the set menu with 2 mutton olathede, 1 chicken kozhi curry and one fish in banana leaf. We ordered the sides with appam. 
The manager ( a perfect gentleman with a signature sense of hospitality) suggested us to taste malabar paratha and I must thank him for the same. 
Coming to the main sides, mutton Olathede, taste wise was near to its perfection however the dryness was missing. I think the taste is somewhat influenced by Bengali Mutton curry. The strong taste of Coconut oil was missing. Which is an eternal accompaniment to feel the authentic kerala curry. 
The chicken and fish in banana was good. 
My 1.5 marks deduction was mainly for the appam. In my suggestion, the management should immediately change the utensil for making appam. The shape of the appam was no way coming to that heavenly semi-circle appams I have been spoilt with. Appam is what makes a perfect kerala meal. So I suggest a little more care  on that. 
The choice of dessert was good. The coconut icecream and payasam was delicious. 
I loved the serving as well. 
Please don’t get me wrong. I am not criticising the food. But my expectations was a bit too high!
Overall experience was good!

This place was on my wishlist for quite long, we managed to visit this place suddenly, we did not have much plan before. This place is simply decorated with keralian paintings and handicraft. 

Now coming to food.

 We had buttermilk, mutton olathede combo along with idiyaappam. I loved idiyaappam which, was one of the main reasons for visiting this place as i have not  got idiyaappam in other non-veg south indian joints. Idiyappam was very refreshing. We liked buttermilk as well but, the quantity could have been a bit more. Mutton olathede was also good , mutton was properly cooked, it went well with it. 

staffs were quite cordial here. In fact, i did not notice that they don't provide Chutney in the idiyappam combo, but when I told them, they did not hesitate to give us the chutney, we had red chili coconut chutney, and inji puli. We both liked the taste of inji puli. 

We had a satisfying experience.

Can Rasam be made any better?
No!
This small eatery , with humble interiors, near Hazra provides incredibly delicious and authentic Malabar food!
The menu is quite simple , but , each dish is a wonder!
Such varied taste!
Being a true blue bong, I love my mutton and my fish!
But.... Never did I expect such a different taste of the meat. Othelede mutton is just too good! Dry , spicy and different!
The banana wrapped fish is not your usual 'bhetki paturi'. It smoky and hot!
The Kozhi chicken tasted exactly like the one I had at Coorg! Complimented wonderfully by the Malabar parathas and rice and the dry onion powder!
So, if you have a taste for south indian delicacies.... Go ahead and try this!
It's just too good to be missed!

Ammini, a relatively new kid on the block, with a seating capacity of 24, located in South Kolkata (Monohor Pukur) serving some authentic Keralite cuisine in a good ambience has already made an impression among the foodies of Kolkata. 
Please do not be disappointed by their small menu.The Mutton Olathede (spicy dry mutton) or the Kerala Kozhi Curry (chicken curry) comes with two appams/one Malabar paratha/three stringhoppers and can easily be called the signature items on their menu. 
We happened to be there on a day which had mutton stew with two appams among the special items on offer. The boneless pieces (five in one plate) of mutton were softer than chicken or paneer, yet holding together and succulent to the core. The gravy - unparallelly delicious? A definite understatement!!! Undoubtedly a Sunil Gavaskar straight drive!!!! In a nutshell one cannot assess this place on a single visit.

The staffs were friendly and were prompt in their service.

The food was of authentic Keralite taste. The quantity was bit less, but the awesome taste made up for that deficiency.

It is a good place to visit who would like to have good Keralite food.

Ammini is a small restaurant located on Manohar Pukur Road, close to Deshapriya Park & Tridhara Club. They serve decent South Indian cuisine with some speciality items from Kerala. The Appams are really good as is their flaky Malabar paratha. Both the Mutton Olathede and Kozhi Roast are good though a bit dry. The Veg Qorma and Potato Stew are nice counterparts to those dryish non-veg dishes. They serve the food on banana leaves and it'd be really nice if they served a full South Indian thali on that! Their service is also very good and certainly competent enough to deal with the heavy flow of customers as witnessed during the Durga Puja.

I am a Bangali and that means that I know my mutton. You must be out of your mind if you go to Ammini and not order the Mutton Olathede. With three soft and amazing idiappams the whole thing comes to 437 bucks after taxes. There are very few restaurants in the city that will give you a taste of untarnished happiness and Ammini is definitely on top of that list. Just the sheer visual of the mutton breaking as you put your spoon through it is enough to...you know what I need another serving right now!!!

Ammini was on my list for a long, long time. So finally today visited this place, located near Mohanarpukur, for dinner. On arrival at around 9:30pm, we found the place to be jam packed and sold out of the vegetarian dishes. We had a waiting time of 15 minutes, but around 8 minutes later we were given a table. 

The place is tiny and can accommodate roughly 15 people. The decor is aptly done. The staff however seemed all over the place. 

Coming to the food- I had to try the highly recommend mutton olathede. Along with that we ordered the Kerala khozi chicken curry and ghee roast.  I am absolutely sold to the mutton, it was delicious. The chicken curry was the typical South Indian chicken curry and the ghee roast was an extra crispy dosa - but loved the sambar and the chutneys. We also had appams and they were soft and delicious. 

They were out of buttermilk, but didn't inform us till we verified again. For desserts we had unniappam and Kesari. Unniappam are fried dumplings probably made of bananas. Kesari was a halwa, it reminded me of the halwa prasad they serve at Mandirs. 

I will probably visit this place again and again only for the delicious mutton.

Nice and cozy place for south indian food lover... Specially non veg south indian food......it is a very small area for sitting. Only 6-8 tables are there. The kitchen is open beside the serving counter. Their special item is appams which is so tasty. It is like roti but so soft and good taste. The side dish which we took mutton olathede which was also nice. One thing I missed here.... There are may be 8 to 9 persons for servings and cooking but they forgot to fill my empty glass. May be due to presence of their owner. Nothing else to say. Last thing, if u want to try different kerala food with non veg style, u may go there.

This place must be in your go to list if you want to have authentic south Indian non vegetarian food in kolkata. The ambience is very tastefully done giving a feeling of the region. 
Had to wait for a good 10 - 15 minutes before we could a get a table for 4.Had ordered the chicken ghee roast, dosa, mutton combo along with buttermilk. The mutton was melt in mouth and one of the best i had in recent times. The chicken was very good but the mutton combo was the hands down winner. Pocket pinch on the higher side. But a place definitely for revisiting for good food.

I really liked the place.Situated in Hazra,a small discretely located place.Switch on your Google maps to locate the place.
It's authenticity and simplicity is its charm.
The serve you best Keralite food in the most Keralite manner.
We were served in Banana leaves and water or any other beverage is served in locally made "kulhads"
We went for Appam that was so light and well fermented.The Veg korma was tailor made according to our preferences.Like we didn't want potatoes so they cooked with coconut paste.This was something new I had tried.The subtle taste of Appam was well balanced by a little sweet korma.
Also we had also ordered masala Dosa.A plate of Dosa has two servings.So the portions are more than expected.The sambhar made my day.I haven't had tastier sambhar before.The coconut chutney and all other chutneys were too good.The idli was soft and light.According to my taste preference.One who has taste for South Indian delight,should definitely go once.The price is very pocket suitable.Loved the food and ambience.

This place was on my wish list for a long time. Finally managed to drop by once for lunch. Ordered two combos from their menu. One was a mutton ghee roast combo and the other a chicken one. I forgot the names completely. This is what happens when one keeps reviews pending for a long time. 😵😖
But I still remember the taste. The paratha was soft and crispy simultaneously with numerous layers. The noodle roti/paratha was beyond delicious. I can have that without any sides. The mutton and chicken were both made superbly well and both had unique taste to it. I didn't like the appam which was like a dosa sans the filling. It had a wee bit fermented taste. So I won't order that again. The prices are on the higher side but it is worth it.

I had the pleasure of having the most amazing meals in recent times at Ammini. The highlight of the meal was Mutton Sukha & Chicken Roast. Sambhar & rasam were delicious. There were only two negatives was that Appam was too thick at the base & Fish curry wasnt available. Otherwise Great, they will see alot more of me in times to come.

I keep on returning to this place once in a while, a definite hub to relish the legendary Keralan cuisine. Well maintained joint manned by courteous staff, Ammini will live up to both your gastronomic & ambient hunger. Mutton Ollethede is a MUST try, even for people who are non vegetarian, yet avoid red meat. Have a glass of butter milk to wash down the spices after the hearty meal. 

The earthen glasses & banana leaf plates are just added cuteness. The menu is slightly hefty on the wallet, but definitely worth every penny!!

Go out on a date, or with family, or just go alone, this place caters to every hungry heart.

When it comes to trying out cuisines from other regions of India, I have always felt that the Foodie in Kolkata is not as adventurous as his counter part in other Cities (please don't hold this against me if you disagree).. that's probably because the Chinese and Mughlai Food available in this City is addictive.. But, considering a small hole in the wall place, serving Kerala Food in Kolkata, has been in business for over 6 years, makes me stand a tad bit corrected.. I am talking about "Ammini" in Hazra. Simple cozy decor, where the focus is on serving good food..  I wanted to try the Mutton Stew, but unfortunately that is available only on certain days (weekend and Tuesday if I remember correctly).. So, settled for the Mutton Olathede (Spicy dry mutton), Veg Korma, both served with Appam, Ulli Chamandi (Spicy Onion Chutney), Pink Chutney, and rounded it off with some Kesari (Mallu Suji Halwa).. Served on a Banana Leaf.. the food had the distinct flavours of Coconut and Curry Patta that Kerala food is known and liked for.. although, I feel the Mutton should have had more meaty pieces, and less of bones.. Another thing that stood out was that there is no demarcation between the Cooking and Serving staff.. Nasir Khan, the friendly Gentleman who served me, went around the counter and made my Appam for me too.. I was told that although three people have been chosen to interact with customers, each one of them has been taught how to cook all the dishes... How cool is that !!!!

On a pyachpyache rainy day, after much delegation I decided to visit Ammini. I had an NRI friend back home, and she refused to have any international cuisine. I thought it would be best to explore Kerala. 
We ordered MUTTON OLATHEDE with IDIYAPPAMS and KERALA KOZHI CURRY with APPAMS.
The MUTTON OLATHEDE is to die for. Dry, spicy and smokey. It hits all the correct notes, and is a must try in this restaurant.
IDIYAPPAMS were a little too cooked, they were sticky and bit soggy.
KERALA KOZHI CURRY was our good old 'mangsher jhol' with ground spices and curry leaves. You could taste the distinct spices and I was happy with it. :) 
APPAMS were light, fluffy and soft. They hit the mark perfectly. 
The service is moderate and so is the decor. I really liked their clean and cute washroom.
Mutton Olathede is the dish for which you should visit Ammini.

I have never been a fan of south Indian food. I have visited all the four south Indian states but their local foods have never really impressed me much. But I have always enjoyed trying out different cuisines and that is how I landed up at Ammini. It is not a big fancy place but their food I must say did impress me big time. I had ordered Kerala chicken curry, Malabar paratha, mutton stew and appam. The appam and the stew was so delicious that I ended up eating four appam! The paratha and chicken on the other hand did not really matched up to the standards of the other great dishes. I guess I am going to change my opinion of Kerala dishes at least!

After searching for quite some time for authentic Kerala food, we discovered this quaint little place in Manoharpukur Road. Starting from the start: unassuming decor, simple furniture, with a few very tasteful paintings. You don't need more than that if you can make food like Ammini does. To my sheer delight, this was the only place in Kolkata I found idiappams (string hoppers, apparently they are called!). Served with Veg/non veg gravy of choice (Veg Korma for me), made in coconut oil, they were straight out of a Malayali kitchen! The only  time I had such idiappams was at homes of natives in Kerala.. Tried their buttermilk - perfect, in earthenware. Had three; wanted unlimited refills if possible. The veg meal combo was delicious again, with the rasam on this side of country that I have tasted. Rice with sambhar, rasam, curd, two veg gravies, pickles, poppadam, payasam... Lovely. Very courteous staff, whk came and explained every item to us (cos we asked). Kudoscto the Manager Mr. Nair, who was courteous and offered me his phone number for any customisations later. Prices not off the roof, so OK. 

In short, they stay true and consistent in their food, décor and service - simole, authentic, sattvic. They offer Sadhya only on Onam, though, so will wait for it!!

Ammini is tucked away in a quiet street of residential south Kolkata.
The place is small, but ambiance is very clean and cosy. 
Interesting and comfortable decor. Smart casual but nicely relaxed. The food is south Indian and very nicely spiced. Food order was taken and served promptly. 
The mutton was melt in your mouth and the fish spiced to perfection. 
String hoppers complimented the meal nicely. Portion sizes were reasonable. 
Small menu but seemingly done well.

Situated on Manohar Pukur Road, Ammini offers authentic Kerala delicacies. The interiors will give you a feel good factor and is rustic & soothing to eyes. The setting is really austere.

Now the food, I have ordered the Specials with the option of Appam and Kerala Kozhi Curry which is nothing but Chicken Curry from Kerala. They served it on the traditional banana leaf kept on a straw mat. It really felt good. The food was amazing, hot and fluffy appams with a great chicken curry. There were around four pieces of chicken in it and it was adequate enough for a single person. I also ordered an Idiaappam: the taste was something new, it was a bit sweet and garnished with grated coconuts.

This is a must visit place especially if you love Malabar cuisine.

Excellent... excellent... excellent...

It's the place place for those who have a miss confusion about South Indian foods like me... to me South Indian cuisine means... idly, dosa, sambar, uttapam... mainly all in veg versions... but this place completely changed my views... I'm specially a spice food lover... so after reading so much good about this place I decided to give it a try... And I'm proud of myself for taking the dicision...

Firstly, the deco n ambience was mind blowing... love their way of preparation of dishes in heavy cutlery and banana leaf... staffs are very courteous... service was good too... also l like the newspaper paper bags for taking parcels... total eco friendly concept... thumbs up...

Secondly, the food... we ordered for...
◆ Filter coffee~ Awesome...
◆ Dahi vaada~ Very good...
◆ Kerala khozi curry~ Served with two appams... excellent... so spicy but full of beautiful flavors... tasted insane...
And opted "Mutton olathede" for take away... and it was also wonderful... 

Pocket pinch was bit high... but very well justified by the quality... quantity being little unsatisfactory...

This is a small restaurant with simple decor. They are a purely south indian restaurant and prepare the dishes really well. 
I had Kozhi chicken roast, appam and kesari halwa.
The chicken tasted really good. I loved the flavour of it but the quantity is too less as compared to the price. 
Appams were really small too. 
Kesari halwa was not extraordinary. It was suji halwa with some kesar flavouring. 
The quantity is very very less. That was a disappointment.

My parents and I love to eat South Indian food together. With the weapon of Zomato app in my hand, I put in the required filters and saw this place pop up of which I had never heard before. I forgave myself because I have not been living in Calcutta for close to 5 years now. While we were headed to this place, I realised that we were a bunch of vegetarians expecting to have a great meal at a place know for its Malabar fish and Mutton preparations. Yet, gathered courage and stepped in.

Ordered -

1. Veg Combo Meal - which came with perfectly cooked steamed rice, sambhar, rasam, coconut curry, mixed veg, pickle, papad and payasam. Fulfilling platter.

2. Appam and Veg Korma - delectable combination. Appams tasted so soft and fresh, Korma just perfect (not too spicy, not too oily) to be eaten with Appams.

3. Podi Idli - the fragrant masala coated with heated ghee all over the idli. 

4. Masala Vada - crisp, tasteful just perfect.

5. Chaas- spicy, sans the green chilli seeds, yum in my tum 

6. Masala Dosa - just to see how they serve up a simple thing like a masala dosa. We took pink chutney and onion chutney along with it. 

Right from the presentation to the speed of delivery, to of course the taste of the food, everything was on point. We were happy to break out of the traditional south indian food that we've been eating. The staff was ever so friendly and helpful. They give face wipes on each table, and betel nuts after every meal (pic attached)
Wish you all the best!!

Absolutely amazing cuisine from Kerala and a delight for people who are fans of traditional South Indian non-vegetarian cuisine. The mutton, the fish (the fish in banana leaf is head-spinningly hot, but not oppressively so, and absolutely divine) and even the simple potato curry is amazing. So I will not single one dish out as the menu is quite uncomplicated. Just pick what you feel like eating, order appams (or the delightfully tattered Malabar parathas) and dig in. A true gem of a place.

It has a small setup in manoharpukur road. Situated at a walking distance from desapriya park, this restaurant serves delicious Kerala food. The appam & mutton olathede are to die for. The Kerala paratha & kozhi curry are tasty too. But yes, I would rather opt for mutton olathede every time I drop in here. The kesar halwa is also yummy. I've deducted 0.5 for the laid back service. Rest is just so awesome. A must visit for lovers of South Indian food (apart from idli and dosa).

Amazing food. Tried the non veg today. The mutton stew and the chicken roast, both just amazing in their own way. The appam is so light. And I just love the chaas there. Ended up having 3-4 of them in the whole course. The staff are very good as well. Service I'd say excellent.

Good concept of a south indian restaurant. Nice place with a good seating capacity. Simple decoration yet authentic. Had malabar paratha, idiappam (one kind of roti made of rice flour), mutton olathede, butter milk and some preparation of chicken. The food was served on banana leaf which was quite unique. Liked the concept. Food was good. But the price was on higher side in comparision with the quantity of the food. Should visit once if you want to try out the south indian delicacies.

Ammini had set up shot in a converted garage and taken the food enthusiasts of Kolkata ( I hate the word foodie) by storm. South Indian cuisine is known to most bengalis to be the veritable "tiffin" and Kerala cuisine was not so known in our food loving city.. but that was before Ammini. The taste and authenticity of Kerala cuisine is located very conveniently on Monohar Pukur Road. I remember going there with a friend long ago and we were so engrossed with eating that taking pictures completely escaped my mind. We had the specials... Mutton Olathede (a dry mutton curry... hot and spicey and not for the faint tongued)  and Kerala Kozhi Curry..  which is a chicken preparation i suppose a speciality of Kochi. Being fans of Appam we had these divine curries with what is essentially sour rice paste and coconut milk pancakes, crispy around the edges, but soft in the middle... and we ordered more. We also had the Inji Puli, translated as the sweet and sour ginger and chilli pickle.... which complimented the food excellently.  Being an incorrigible sweet lover, my friend had the payasam, sweet and ricey. And as no south indian meal is complete without coffee... ofcourse we had some... the filter variety as the tradition demands.

This place bookmarked for so many days introduced me to the beauty of keralite cuisine.Its located away from the hustle bustle of the city..a hidden gem it is.The decor was simple with potted green plants,artworks resemblant of Dakshinatya's rich culture.The place was amply lit up with daylight which is a mood lifter.

I came here for a lunch with Anamitraa Chakraborty .We settled for fish in banana leaf,mutton olathade with 2 appams and inji puli which is a sweet and sour ginger pickle.Food was served in long banana leaves which is a pleasant touch.

•Fish in banana leaf-It may look like fish paturi from outside.But the owner who was present informed that the fish used is surmai.It is king mackerel which is very popular as an essential part of Syrian-christian cuisines along the coast of Kerala.More surprise unfolded when we took out the fish from the banana leaves.It was infused with keralite spices instead of the mustard paste used in Bengali bhetki paturi.It was very spicy! Certainly not for weak hearted.I loved the tingling it caused in the taste buds being an ardent fan of spicy food.Still we were thankful to have the inji puli..the unique sweet chutney which acted as a brilliant balancing anecdote when the spice quotient was becoming overwhelming for us at times.Fish was an absolute delight to have.It was white,flaky and perfectly cooked.

•Appams with Mutton Olathade-What a heavenly combination it was! Appam is staple diet of Kerala.. it's type of pancake made with fermented rice and coconut milk.Its crispy in the edges around a spongy soft centre.I liked it so much that we ordered an extra appam.It was perfect accompaniment with Mutton Olathade.The mutton was beautifully spiced.It was falling out off bone and melting in mouth..that was the kind of softness in the meat.

I loved my experience here.Its a refreshing change from the type of food we consume while dining out.The difference is made by the homely touch in the food Ammini serves.Will visit in future for a soulful gastronomic saga again.

Those of us who live in Kolkata know very well how hard it can be to find a place to eat during Durga Puja.

I, along with 3 companions, was in search of a eatery to have an early dinner this Saptami. We located this place quite accidentally, and decided to give it a go, with not very high expectations, may I add. The impression didn't change much as they told us quite a few items were not available from their already limited menu. So we ordered whatever was available.

However, here's the twist. We were blown away by the quality of the food. The dishes were brilliantly cooked and served in very proper portions. We ordered Appams, Chicken Roast, Fish cooked in leaf (don't remember the actual name) and Rasam. I've never had South Indian food as good as this.

The price is also very reasonable. The staff was prompt and polite, and that just adds to the brilliance of the place. The only con I could find was the space which is a tad bit less.

Two thumbs up from my side. Would visit again and again.

Had visited Ammini after requests from my husband..and cribbing all the way that I don't like curry patta in my mutton...we had ordered Special of Malabar paratha and Mutton Ollathede...the mutton was melt-in-mouth..perfectly cooked...tantalisingly spicy...and rightly paired with the Paratha...mutton was neither oily nor heavy..the paratha was soft and flaky with no feel of grease when touched...the dosa was also great and we had halwa mildly sweetened and heavenly .
The staff was courteous and helpful...I would go again and again...I could not give a 5 as the AC was not functioning properly.

The management has however done their best to furnish the place as best as possible within their given budget. The items on offer are limited, but they have various specials for the day and those items are always scrumptious. Their mutton olathede and appams are to die for. A good experience altogether.

Went on a quiet Saturday. The place is definitely a favorite amongst a niche set of people. Limited menu. Limited cooking is done so some items get over. Specials are on offer. Service is decent. Ambience is cozy and tastefully done. Portions are good for one. Taste is great. A little high on spice. Price wise is comfortable.

I went on Wednesday evening to this place hoping for Onam Sadya, but sadly they had it only till 4.30 p.m. which is a little unfair on  office goers like me! But anyway, I had their Adai Dosa (served as a pair, spicy and filling) with two sorts of chutney - the regular one and the onion one. The onion one is amazing (I wish they were a little liberal with it!).  However, what I love is the sambar. It is amazing and very different from what most restaurants serve - it is thicker and delicious. I also like the ambiance. It is a small place but well arranged. The traditional feel of the restaurant is also interesting - the decor, the banana leaf plate, the menu card mounted on a frame, the utensils and of course the keralite supari served at the end.

A bite of Kerala turned out to b one of the most memorable places in my food voyage...
Simple nice decor gives u good vibes..the waiters are extremely courteous...well mannered...and they know their job...
I was elated to b served on banana leaf after ages...
The malabar paratha we ordered was crisp...at first i was doubting the amount charged for 1 paratha..but as i munched on..i realised it was heavy enough..
The kozhi chicken curry was splendid..smooth buttery gravy well cooked with coconut and fresh herbs and the chicken was marvellous..perfectly cooked soft juicy pieces...makes u smile..
The appam was good indeed...soft centered with crisp peripheries...
The mutton olathede was the show stealer...rich spicy tender juicy mutton...undoubtedly one of the best mutton dishes i hav tasted in Kolkata..though a tad bit oily...i absolutely loved the rich bold flavours..bingo..signature dish.
We had kesar halwa for dessert..fresh warm halwa served with fried kajus...the aroma spoke of camphor which i liked very much..the taste was unique..not too sweet..perfect end to the food journey..
The betel nut served at end was also entertaining..
The service was prompt...did not mind to pay the bill which was a tad bit on the higher side...

Everytime I get my tickets done for Kolkata I do one more thing simultaneously... search for a new place to eat.
It was mum's birthday and her favourite cuisine is 'south indian' yes to us bengalis it starts and ends with dosa and idly, the most innovative we can be is think of a rawa dosa or a fried idly ..
Living in Delhi I was lucky to be exposed to the non vegetarian fare that Andhra cuisine has to offer (andhra bhawan)and I will agree it is insanely delicious.
So this time I had to give mum the taste of non vegetarian food from the far south and hence Ammini it was, they serve the kerala variant I have read, though honestly I don't have any knowledge in regards to the difference in dishes of the various southern states. I should be excused for such illiteracy!
The restaurant itself is quite tiny which gives it a very cosy and comfortable feel, the decor is modern with subtle but beautiful hints of bric-a-bracs which are dominant of kerala like the wall hanging, the pickle jar.
What I liked most was that they serve food directly on stunning green banana leaf very earthy and soothing to the eye.
The menu itself is also very unique , a wooden framed card, they do not have too many things to offer very crisp and concise another thing I loved!
We ordered appams with chicken roast and malabar parantha with fish wrapped in banana leaf.
The chicken was spicy and hot, and beautifully cooked the appams too very soft and steaming.
I loved the malabar parantha much like our lachcha parantha.
The fish was almost the bhetki paturi that we eat but the spices were different, and the fish used I don't think was bhetki but some sea fish, mum thought it could be mackerel.
We ended our meal with filter coffee, the best coffee I ever had, the aroma of the roasted beans and the balanced milk will give any coffee chain a run for their monies. I would rather go to Ammini for a cup rather to any of the coffee chains.

A special mention to the hygiene and cleanliness that the staff maintained( even the rest room) is commendable.

The place and food made me very happy, it fed my soul mostly.

Many of us in Bengal have a pre-conceived notion that south indian food means only idly, vada and the final frontier- dosa, that too masala dosa. But, surprisingly, there is a whole array of yummy cuisine available in south India- Kerala cuisine being amongst them. Then our next idea comes that Kerala cuisine is ALWAYS cooked with coconut oil and carries a bad smell- hence, please avoid. But, thanks to the new-age food-entrepreneurs, this idea is about to change. Welcome to one of the best mid-budget kerala non-veg eatery which actually serves breakfast even (hell yeah !!!)- Ammini. 

  
How to go and when to go :

This is easy to find. Take the sharat bose road aka lansdowne road from ramkrishna mission hospital/ hazra road crossing towards desapriya park. You’ll find the manoharpukur crossing signal soon, take left and and after 6-7 buildings, you’ll find the restaurant on your left with a full-glass frontage. They are open on all days from 8 AM- 10 PM, but beware, food starts to get over from 930 PM onwards, so reach early. 

Ambience:

A nice one- nothing to complain. It has an AC, nice chairs and tables, a very clean toilet and the interior is done with some nice kerala styled pictures/ paintings. Once we settled down, we were presented with bamboo trays with banana-leaf on top, on which food were to be served soon. And the menu card was presented. 

Food:

In the menu card, we found one good concept. They actually have very less items. I hate places where they serve thousand varieties of items and none is their specialty. Here, they have very less items on menu card and the dish of the day is written on a black-board with chalk. Hence, look for it once you start ordering. And, the meat/fish items came with complementary appam / iddiappam- that saved us the headache of thinking what to eat it with – a complete package. We ordered butter milk and rasam first and then the food. Somehow, I didn’t like the rasam, it was too thick for my taste, but butter milk was brilliant and made up for it. 

The next dish was Mutton Olathede with appam. This is a hot, spicy (not fiery) dry mutton dish with tomato slices- mostly stir-fried. The accompaniment just blew our mind. I love appam and used to have it whilst in bangalore, but definitely did not expect this to be such perfect in nature. For the first timers, appam is kind of a pancake with fermented ground rice and coconut milk.Its mostly soft in nature and can definitely accompany a meat/ fish dish. They serve 2 appams with one non-veg dish, but we ordered few more on a-la-carte basis after that. 

 

The next dish that came was fish in banana leaf with idiyappam. Here fish (I suppose good quality Indian salmon) is marinated in some spicy, tangy masala, wrapped in banana leaf and was shallow fried. Idiyappam is steamed rice flour noddles and a great accompaniment. This fish dish, I must insist, is a must-try here. 
Along with these, came the accompaniments (paid): 

The first one is a tangy tomato chutney nemaed inji puli and second one is kind of a gun powder, spicy and to be sprinkled over food, called molaga podi. They are good as accompaniments and to be sprinkled over appam/ idiyappam but I personally felt they can come complementary rather than separate items. 

We were almost full and time has come for some desserts. We order kesari and unniappam. 
 Kesari is a ghee smitten suji halwa with lots of dry fruits and nutmegs. Its damn good and definitely not-to-be-missed. The second item that we ordered, was suggested by the restaurant manager.  Unniappam is a keralian version of our own pithe, which we gladly found out. Its made of rice, jaggery, banana, roasted coconut pieces, roasted sesame seeds, ghee and cardamom powder and fried in oil in unniappam pot. The restaurant served them freshly cooked and that made our day.  

The meal ended with complementary pan supari (imported from Kerala it seems- I don’t like to spoil my taste-buds after such great food) and my wife and son liked them very much.

Sometimes I become puzzled as in where to go while I have zeroed down to 2-3 choices to have a good lunch on a holiday. Finally, I chose Ammini among them and went for it. This is a small cozy place situated in manoharpukur road near the point where it meets sarat bose road. You will feel good once you enter this place as the decor is simple yet cheerful and neatly done. We ordered for Mutton olathede with appam and a malabar paratha. I wanted to try the taste first and then order for more if I like. They served in earthen bowls and on banana leaf. The Mutton was good and tasty. The appam and paratha was okayish. I have been to many parts in South India for work and I felt there was nothing extraordinary in taste of appam and paratha. The Mutton is worth trying. We did not order for anything more as we wanted to try out some other place too. The service was okay and pocket pinch was on a heavier side compared to the dishes.
May be some other day would like to revisit and try the dosa.

The mutton and hot rice plates are must eat. Order a fish roast in banana leaf. Though a little spicy cook but a glass of butter milk will end the experience as "wow". A clean and well managed resta

I like foods that are made with passion bringing the taste of cultural habits. Ammini is one of its kind. Serves food from the 'land of spices'- kerala cuisine.
It's a small restaurant at monohorpukur road near to kalighat metro station. Near to nature ambience is very impressive- lush greenery on entrance, food served over banana leaf, water on earthen pot, open kitchen and parcel delivered on paper bag.
Food: Nice looking APPAM soft in the centre and crunchy on outside is a perfect combination with dry spicy MUTTON OLATHEDE or CHICKEN KOZI CARRY. Sightly sweetish MALABAR PAROTA is another option . 
Strong filter coffee elevates the mood at the end.
Will definitely visit it again.
Recommend for those who want to treat the taste bud with some new taste.

It seems whoever said 'size doesn't matter', had Ammini on mind. This restaurant has a small holding capacity, and a short menu. But that doesn't hold back its chefs from creating a magic of flavours from Kerala. Service is excellent. Ambience is refreshing. Use of banana leaves and earthenware adds more colour to the experience. I would recommend all the non-vegetarian dishes as those are very different from what you get anywhere else.

Monohor pukur road has a new small and cute outlet serving delicious food of Kerala. Well decorated interiors and service are quite appreciable. The menu list is not really long, but whatever it includes are worth it.
The mutton oladhade (a semi dry and moderately spicy preparation) can be enjoyed with appams or lachha parathas (which, to my surprise, were not at all oily or greasy). The poatato stew is one of its specialties. All the food must be relished with the Rasam Ammini offers.
So, in brief, good place, good food and good service, all within a reasonable budget. Ammini surely is now a part of the list of eat outs I'd like to recommend to people and I also look forward to another nice dinner at this restaurant.

Got to know about the place only last year. Was very apprehensive looking at the limited options in the menu as we are vegetarians. Placed an order for potato stew, vegetable korma, dosas and one of their day's special - a south Indian meal. Loved the preparation of each of them although for me, veg korma stood out. Preparation of rasam was very good too. Even though the options are limited, the use of spices and the flavours is exceptional.

South Indian meals typically have unlimited refills wherever I have been to. That's something I feel they could reevaluate.

A delightful little place that you stumble upon as you walk along the lane between Priya Cinema and Desapriya Park. With its apt tagline "A taste of Kerala", it makes you realize that there is so much more to South Indian cuisine than the stereotyped idlis and dosas. The place is small, no more than 5 or 6 tables, but the service is very prompt and hospitable. Now let's talk about the different dishes we tried!

1. Paniyarappams- These are small fried dumplings which go very well with the sambhar and chutneys they serve (the chutneys are freshly made and heavenly, I should mention.)
2. Appams with Mutton Olathede / Kerala Kozhi Curry- We have tried both of these combinations. The appams are a delight , soft in the centre and crunchier on the outside. The mutton is very spicy but tastes wonderful! A must try! The Kozhi (or chicken) curry is coconut based and tastes very different and delicious.
3. Addai Dosa- This is a dosa made of lentils and tastes very different, more like a paratha. A must try!
4. Malabar Paratha with Veg Korma- The Malabar Paratha looks and tastes a lot like Laccha Paratha, but is sweeter. Goes well with the veg Korma, which has a coconut based gravy like the Kozhi curry.
5. Fish in Banana Leaf- This deserves a special mention. It looks a lot like the Bengali dish Paturi on the outside, and tastes equally amazing!
6. Kesari- This is a Kerala special suji halwa which has a distinct flavour. Highly recommended for all who like something sweet at the end of a meal. 

As you can see from the rating, I am in love with this place, and will visit it again soon!

After a very long time I totally fell in love with a new food joint.
Location:It is a bit difficult to locate if you're not a localite. Near the Tridhara Durga Puja place.
Food:We orderd Mutton Olathede with Appam & Malabar paratha. The appams were soft & crispy from all sides & fluffy in the middle.It was delicious. The paratha was okayish. It was huge & heavy. The mutton came in a dry gravy with the pieces tender & tasty. The preparation was very less oily & spicey & tasted heavenly.Then we ordered masala dosa & it was one of the best dosas I had.It was so soft that it almost melted in the mouth. The Filter Coffee later added to the mood. Decent quantity authentic espresso keralian coffee with a slight bittter taste. Even the betel nut supplied at the end as a mouth freshner had a signature mark.
The staffs are very friendly.
I didn't like the open kitchen idea & it was sometimes hot inside.Need to work on the cooling :D & may be they need look for a bigger & more convenient place.

This is the second time I am visiting the place and always feel like coming back again. A completely new approach to the the South Indian cuisine. An extra '.5' because of the reasonable price of the food and the staffs, who are always at your service. 

The food
Paniyarappams(small fried dumplings served with coconut chutney, sambhar and a red chutney)- you can have it as a starter, which will refresh your taste and tell you there are more dishes awaiting
Appam with Mutton Othelede is great combo and a must try! Mutton Othelede is a bit spicy so order according to the choice of your tatste buds. The muttons are supersoft
Malabar Paratha- More like laccha partha but will not fail to amaze with the taste
Veg Korma- Good taste but like other veg korma
Addai Dosa- again a must try!!! Along with coconut chutney and sambhar, it is served with a third type of chutney (different from the one served with paniyarappams) and I really liked it! The dosa is entirely different from the usual look of dosa and tasty as well

First and foremost the ambience is cool. Not a very big place though. Food is divine, if you like the South Indian way. The spices will invigorate your taste buds like nothing else. The Apam, is light and sensuous and the Paratha is just the way we like it. Nice & Fluffy. For chicken & mutton lovers, enjoy! Desserts were not as per my expectation though. However, I will surely visit whenever I am near enough. Kudos to the owner and the concept.

Small eatery in a household locality, away from the crowds. A place to be if you're in the mood for some authentic kerelian cuisine. Bright, cheery place where the food is served on a banana leaf. The aapams there are my favourite. Try the same with some egg curry or mutton stew. They also offer vegetarian meals which comprise of rice, rasam and two types of sabjis. The quantities don't look too much initially, but the taste is yumm and the food is surprisingly filling. Their prices are pocket friendly, but not if you decide to become a regular visitor. Overall a nice place, will keep visiting.

I pass by this small eatery almost everyday. Though not very fond of South Indian food, I decided to try this restaurant & was simply bowled over by the food. It's a small joint, nice & cozy. But didn't like the open kitchen idea. The buttermilk was nice & so was the Ghee roast (dosa). The onion & red chilli coconut chutneys were fantastic. Something that I've never tasted before. The Addai dosa (spicy lentil dosa) was a bit too spicy for my taste. Nevertheless it was very tasty & a must try. Kozhi (chicken roast) was again very spicy but tasted fabulous. Had it with Malabar parathas which was soft & yummy. 
For dessert we tried their Filter Coffee ice cream & mango ice cream. Both were too good, specially the filter coffee one. The suji halwa Kesari was nice but the Unniappams or dumplings made with gur & bananas were nothing to write to write home about. I would suggest to avoid it.
The staff were courteous enough. Was dissapointed that we didn't get any mutton dishes. So have to visit this place again.

Ammini was on my bucket list since quite some time now till I dropped in a couple of days back. 
Its pretty easy to find and car parking wasn't a big issue for me. For some reason I was expecting a bigger place but it turned out to be quite the opposite. 
We were greeted very courteously and seated immediately. The place being small was bound to be loud as almost all the tables were occupied. However, when the server brought the orders of the table alongside ours we began to get enamored. 
We went for the mutton olathede with malabar parathas, chicken kozhi curry with appams and a addai dosa. 
The mutton was extremely tender almost melting in the mouth, and since it was hot and spicy paired really well with the flaky and sweet parathas. The appams stole the show really and complimented the chicken curry. (They could have complemented just about any curry for that matter.) The addai dosas being made of lentils had a very interesting texture. We had ordered the onion and red chilli coconut chutney with the dosas. Both the chutneys were delectable to say the least. For desserts we went with the halwa and the sweet dumplings. The halwa was good with delicate flavours but the dumplings were nothing to write home about. 
The service was prompt and courteous. 
The mutton olathede made me crave the Kerala beef fry. That and the constricted space were the only negatives to be honest. A must try.

The ambience is very homely and the decorations were soft and calm. I loved the table tops which has a pastel touch to it. We ordered butter milk, Mutton, appam, fish in banana leaf and 3 different flavours of natural ice-cream: Filter coffee, mango and coconut. The ice-cream was fabulous, it just melted in our mouth. The coconut was the best. The food is very spicy and really makes a dhamaka in the mouth.

The mutton was extremely tender almost melting in the mouth, and since it was hot and spicy paired really well with the flaky and sweet parathas. The appams stole the show really and complimented the chicken curry. (They could have complemented just about any curry for that matter.) The addai dosas being made of lentils had a very interesting texture. We had ordered the onion and red chilli coconut chutney with the dosas. Both the chutneys were delectable to say the least. For desserts we went with the halwa and the sweet dumplings. The halwa was good with delicate flavours but the dumplings were nothing to write home about. 
The service was prompt and courteous. 
The mutton olathede made me crave the Kerala beef fry. That and the constricted space were the only negatives to be honest. A must try.

The ambience is very homely and the decorations were soft and calm. I loved the table tops which has a pastel touch to it. We ordered butter milk, Mutton, appam, fish in banana leaf and 3 different flavours of natural ice-cream: Filter coffee, mango and coconut. The ice-cream was fabulous, it just melted in our mouth. The coconut was the best. The food is very spicy and really makes a dhamaka in the mouth.

Oh how I loved this place :) small and cozy, the interiors are simple. The service was warm and fast enough. The food was real good, a mutton dry fry which was yummy, a chicken curry which was soft and nice and appams! I finished my meal with a lovely strong filter Coffee! Would re-visit soon!

Glad we found this interesting little restaurant serving southern Indian food.  The mutton was melt in your mouth and the fish cooked to spicy perfection.  String hoppers were a perfect compliment to the meal.  Service was spot on, quick and professional.  Will definitely visit again.

It's a decent petite outlet,just few mins from the kalighat metro,near sarat bose road,sort of  homely atmosphere,decorated with greens outside,and it's an open kitchen so the air condition doesn't really works well,specially sitting infront of the glass door you feel very hot as the door can't get completely closed because of the chimney,so in the summer one doesn't feels very comfortable and in our city we have summer almost the year,coming to the service,we were 12 people out there,and they just forgot the orders we placed,they didn't serve the coffee to everyone,we kept on asking so we actually left without eating anything and then went to the Oudh,as other people were frustrated...by seeing the place we actually wanted to try it out but don't think can visit again.

This is such a fresh story in our city. Cosy and neat this little restaurant on monoharpukur road is perfect for both quick and relaxed meals. Being so different in what they have to offer and doing such a good job with it, there's nothing I find wrong with this place. The Mutton stew that they serve on Saturdays is to die for. Only wish they'd do it all week long

This place is indeed a hidden gem. A small eatery, located just a few minutes walk from Hazra More. The ambiance is pleasant. They serve their food on banana leaves which is quite appealing. We ordered a plate of 2 Appams with Kerala Kozhi Curry. Appam was basically a type of pancake which tasted good. But the chicken curry served with it tasted delicious. The chicken was tenderly cooked and the curry was so full of flavours. For desert, we had Kesari which tasted absolutely yum. It was rich with a good sweetness which wasn't overpowering. 
Overall this is a nice place to change your usual taste buds and a must visit place for south indian food lovers.

After having lots of buffets of North Indian, I had to change the taste and was having cravings for South Indian foods... So in one afternoon we went Ammini, a south Indian Joint... Ammini is located just 5 minutes walking distance from Hazra More... Now in spite of being a small outlet, the ambience was really nice and attractive with all the pictures and showpieces from South specially Kerala...
Coming to the Food we ordered
Masala Dhosa
Kesari Madhiram

Masala Dhosa came with Samber and two condiments... It was delicious and served hot...
Waiter suggested us to have Kesari and we took it ... it didn't disappoint us... Kesari was a hot suji halwa and tastes yummy...
Service was good and quick ...

This was my first online order via Zomato and Ammini did not disappoint. The food was spicy and set my taste buds on fire. The order was for Mutton Olathede, Kerala Kozhi Curry, Fish in banana leaf, Kozhi Roast and Malabar Paratha. Each and every item was unique, the best amongst them was the Mutton Olathede...really good pieces of mutton cooked in really spicy gravy.
Won't be able to talk about the ambience as this was a home delivery but can say that the packaging was excellent. The order was delivered in pretty quick time. Looking forward to visiting the place and checking out the ambience.

great place for having non veg south indian, i wonder why this is still a "hidden" gem. Their combos - appam/ idiappam + one curry are must try.

fluffy light idiappams, their chicken and mutton dishes are well flavoured and unlike many so called south indian joints arent doused in heavy cocoanut - very well balanced, highly recommended for anyone who wants to try south indian beyond regular idli -dosa-vada.
best part is its not overpriced

The taste of God's Own Country in the city of Joy.
Its is located at the Sarat Bose Road Manoharpukur Crossing.
I took 
Appam, Kerala style Mutton Kosha and Chicken Olethade..
The Appam is hard on the sides but soft like idli in the Centre. It tastes different but quite good
Kerala style Mutton Kosha is kosha mangsho cooked with keralian spices.I loved it!!
Chicken olethade is a chicken dish which is incredibly spicy, but in my opinion it had an authentic taste.
All in all a good place for Keralian food in Calcutta..
This place will set you back my 600-800 rupees..

We have stereotype notion of south indian food of being idli , dosa or uttapam. But this notion will be changed once we visit Ammini. Ammini specialises in kerala cuisine and have variety of different dishes both veg and nonveg. We ordered for mutton olathede , appam , fish in banana leaf( as written in the menu, it has a name but I forgot) along with rice and sambhar and kozhi roast.
Mutton and appam are mind blowing. I will give them 5 on 5. Bit spicy , juicy and well cooked mutton simply make us fall in love with it. The fish is another gem. I paired it up with rice and sambhar. Do try this out . Kozhi roast is chicken roast which is comparatively mild in taste but like other items this item too is a delicious one. Will be visit it soon to try out their mutton stew which is only available on Saturdays and Sundays.

This small gem is located in the Monohorpukur Road in hazra, I always searched the city for the authentic south indian dishes beside the typical dosa - sambar - idly. So at last my search ends in ammini, I have visited the place and ordered for appams, malabar paratha and idiappapams along with Kozi Curry and in the sweet tooth Unnaippam. I liked all the items now looking forward from them "puttu" and "nool" "chiratta" along with the neel dosa.

Excellent !!! one can at least give it a try

This is not in comparison to the outlets present in the southern parts of the country

Ammini is a hidden gem wrapped up in utter deliciousness with an array of Kerala cuisine. A quick word on the ambience and service before we dive into the food....the restaurant seats 24 people and the space is small. And since we were a group of 8 close cousins, nephews and nieces displaying copious quantities of camaraderie and bonhomie, there was much laughter and loudness. The small space made this louder! We ordered many items and the orders were handled with care and attention. Now the food....we had ordered a range of items....Dahi Vada, dry mutton, fish curry, fish wrapped in banana leaf, appams, egg appams AND mutton stew. Yes!! The Mutton Stew is the piece de resistance of Ammini....the main event and their signature dish. I have had this 3 times now and the mutton is as succulent as the gravy is mellow with the right blend of spices. This has to be pre-ordered though (along with the fish curry). All other items on the menu are available every day....including their chicken roast. The fish curry and the fish wrapped in banana leaf were spice and hot but very tasty. All in all, a great meal experience. Will definitely go back.

I have always been on the lookout for eateries,that strike a different chord,in terms of culinary delicacies..and that's why Zomato is so close to my heart.So it wasn't surprising,when I ventured forth unto trying something we don't usually find in Kolkata,...and needless to say,the ratings of this eatery  in here,kept my stakes high.So,I hopped in one fine afternoon,again,google maps,played the Messiah,as the neighbourhood was unknown to me.This eatery,for good had limited options to choose from..I ordered,Mutton Olathede,Chicken Kozhi Roast,Appams,Malabar Paratha,Kesari,and Masala Chai...It took them about 25 mins to serve my order.I just don't know from where i shall begin...each of the dishes were so perfectly prepared,i was transported to God's own country for a moment(hyperbole! i know).The Mutton preparation was the star of the show,I don't remember the last time i had such well cooked tender mutton.The Appams were very soft,and delicious and went well with the olathede.The kozhi chicken tasted best with the malabar paratha..and even the kesari,was a delightfully flavorful epilogue to this journey...

The food here is heavy and filling. This place is not your typical South Indian restaurant where you have idli, dosa and wada and be satisfied. 

If one visits the place, these things should take a back seat and should be treated as side dished. Go for the fried dumplings, the potato stew, the kormas, the malabar paratha and the iddiappam. These things will fill you. 

Overall, a good eating experience.

The KERALA CUISINE was something very new and interesting to me to change my taste buds, and the ammini experiece was one of it kind!
We had APPAM, a soft pancake made from fermented rice batter, with a soft spongy middle laced with crispy edges was brilliant and consumed it with spicy dry MUTTON OLATHEDE. The meat was tender and the way it was spiced, it has to be a dish from the 'Land of spices'. This combination is highly recommended.
The next round saw us with KOZHI CHICKEN ROAST, which was tongue teasing peppery hot(not for faint hearted people) and IDDIAPAM or rice noodles topped with rich ground coconut.
Though the portion size was dissapointing for the quoted prices, somehow the quality made it up.
The menu in framed wooden boards, water poured on mud glasses the food served on banana leaf in the traditional way, helpful and polite staff, time efficient service and the aromatic, flavoured and fresh food, the flavoured beetel sachets before leaving..
we experienced gourmet with a difference, truely a bite of Gods own country - kerala.

Mutton stew! Mutton stew! Whatever you order at Amini, save space for Mutton stew! The only catch is that you have to pre-order it a day in advance, except for Sundays. I like it best with this special paratha they make (you could also try it with something called apam) and the gravy is so yum that I don’t spare a drop at the end. 

Service is good too. Polite waiters with welcoming smiles on faces. 

The place is cosy and clean (even the washroom, which is a relief!) Half a chance and I head to Amini. Thank you and keep it up, team Amini!

The place is small (20 – 25 seats) and has a cosy feeling.  The tables are placed well apart to avoid the cramped feeling. They have an open kitchen.

We ordered –
Podi Idli – It tasted great although we were also extremely hungry when it arrived.  It had too many curry leaves that we removed. The onion chutney served with it was excellent.

Dahi Vada – The Vada was big and wasn’t soft and the Dahi wasn’t enough. I have eaten better Dahi Vada and Rasam Vada.

Paniyarappam – It was oily and again was okay. 

Appam and Potato Stew – Excellent! I wish they served Veg. Stew instead of only Potato stew.

Veg. Korma – Excellent again!

Ghee Roast – The first order was dry and slightly overcooked. On mentioning how we like it, the second order was great. Both Dosas were paper-thin.

Rasam Vada – They serve generous quantities and we were quite full when it arrived. It tasted okay.
The service is efficient and the servers well trained. The lead for dining was a change but keeping the serve ware on it and also eating on it, it was getting weird. The leaves are too big for the table size and made it inconvenient.

The portions are good. Pricing is also decent – came to about Rs. 350 per person.
I have a mixed feeling about the food; some dishes are good and some very average. Would visit it again only when desperately craving Appam and Stew. 

Visit on Sunday for lunch - 
Service is very slow and not good. Bowls and plates very piling up on the table and no one to clean. They were slow with taking the order and bringing food too. 

Good - Podi Idli, Appam, Korma and Potato Stew, Buttermilk, Kesari

Not good - Paniyarappam, Rasam Wada
New - Veg Thali. Comes with rice, Sambhar, Rasam, Avial, Jackfruit veggie ( which I wasn't aware of before I ate and was good), Chutney, Payasam and Papad. It was a  meal if would share. No roti was given. 

Overall feeling - food was mostly yummy but service was a pain today!

First thing that comes to my mind is that this place definitely deserves more love and popularity. The food is great!! Service is prompt. Staffs are friendly and always are wearing a smile. The place is small, but the open kitchen actually adds to the whole aroma and feel of the store. Been there a couple of times, and would definitely go back for their non veg spread

Ah ! Ammini

Truly a gem....not so hidden.

I am that person who's sure that in some past birth I was a South Indian.If probed farther my choice will be between Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.

I love the sourness of tamarind,the zing of the curry patta,the magic enforced by the humble coconut........both veg and non veg.

I have been to this place before and as always found the lady owner gracious as ever behind the counter assisted by some energetic and helpful staff.

Always loved the decor and inspite of being small,even tiny by restaurant standards,it's well appointed and more importantly clean.

Asked for appams,the Kerala dry mutton and the chicken curry.

Everything was good but only thing lacking was the fiery factor,probably thinking of the local palette.The pieces were discernible and succulent and the thick curry delicious.

Followed it with filter coffee.

Just two points.I feel orders should be served in sequence of K.O.T's and not arbitarily as it was done today and I feel the menu should be explained better by the manager,as we asked for a thali,thinking it would come with veggies which I love but were served only appam and the meat.

However

Ah ! Ammini

Excellent food! Always ask for the specials, they serve mutton stew only on specific days. The appams and idiappams are absolutely fantastic! Never been disappointed with them. Oh, and it's super spicy so if you prefer less spice, just mention it while ordering and they are more than happy to indulge. Bon apetit!

The place is small (20 – 25 seats) and has a cosy feeling.  The tables are placed well apart to avoid the cramped feeling. They have an open kitchen.

We ordered –
Podi Idli – It tasted great although we were also extremely hungry when it arrived.  It had too many curry leaves that we removed. The onion chutney served with it was excellent.

Dahi Vada – The Vada was big and wasn’t soft and the Dahi wasn’t enough. I have eaten better Dahi Vada and Rasam Vada.

Paniyarappam – It was oily and again was okay. 

Appam and Potato Stew – Excellent! I wish they served Veg. Stew instead of only Potato stew.

Veg. Korma – Excellent again!

Ghee Roast – The first order was dry and slightly overcooked. On mentioning how we like it, the second order was great. Both Dosas were paper-thin.

Rasam Vada – They serve generous quantities and we were quite full when it arrived. It tasted okay.
The service is efficient and the servers well trained. The lead for dining was a change but keeping the serve ware on it and also eating on it, it was getting weird. The leaves are too big for the table size and made it inconvenient.

The portions are good. Pricing is also decent – came to about Rs. 350 per person.
I have a mixed feeling about the food; some dishes are good and some very average. Would visit it again only when desperately craving Appam and Stew. 

Visit on Sunday for lunch -

I think as a Malayali, I can give a good review as to whether the food tastes authentic or not. My friend who was with me happens to be a Kolkatan. I stuck with my favorite puttu kadala, a typical keralite breakfast item while my friend ordered appam and stew. The puttu tasted very authentic and kadala wasnt too far behind. The veg korma was slighlty off the mark but the appams made up for it. In entirity, we enjoyed the food. We ordered a malabar parota which tasted good but was slighlty sweet. The ambience is great. I have tried non vegetarian food earlier and had felt the same about the restaurant. I however feel that the snacks are hugely overpriced. Great place to try some Kerala cuisine.

Mutton Olathede is something that will throw that calicut aromas into your nose. If you like mutton or chicken cooked in a rich coconut gravy that makes you time travel 2000kms down south,  the moment you take your first bite, I guess you'll head straight there rather reading my review. Awesomeness at its best

Well the place is good. Ambience fine. But the quantity of dosa is really not upto the mark. One cannot really rely for dinner or lunch on one dosa over here. Compared to the food price the quantity is very poor. Not at all satisfactory.

Good food. A great place to dine if you're a fan of authentic Kerala dishes. The food is good enough if you're far away from the god's own country and want to take a stroll down your "food memory lane " while you're in Calcutta. Although it's not really light on your wallet.

Visited today. I am gonna rate this categorywise.

1. Food. The most important aspect of any restaurant I visit. And I must say, it was an overwhelmingly pleasing experience. This was my first time having malayali food, and man! Did I savour every morsel of them!

2. Service. Very nice, cooperative and crisp service. Although they looked somewhat short of stuff. Food arrived a little late, but probably due to they were being cooked after we ordered, not like they were prepared beforehand and just served hot. For the taste of the food, the waiting was worthwhile.

3. Ambiance. It was pretty homely, but somewhat cramped. Would definitely like a more spacious ambiance.

4. Pricing. Just right. It wasn't costly, wasn't cheap. Just right.

A very limited menu, done to perfection. 

The service is absolutely top notch, and my friends and I end up ordering almost everything on the menu whenever we come here. If you havent worked up as much of an appetite, and dont feel up to the whole menu, I would recommend the addai dosa to start with, their spicy dry mutton with appams as the main course, and the kesari( Suji Halwa) to finish it off.

The filter coffee could have been better though.

It wasnt the first time that i was visiting Ammini. Going towards the Hazra side is always an excuse to drop by and endulge in some healthy, non-fattening Karalite food. True enough, Ammini sets a perfect balance of taste and health at once! moreover, their ambience and decore is very welcoming as well! Perfect for college going students and those who dont wish to spend too much,Ammini has it all. Its not the regular south indian food joint, its very unique, starting from the earthern clay glasses which serve cool wather to the banana leaves which enhance the taste of the food.
      I am a vegetarian, so those who are non-vegetarians, this bit might be slightly un-interesting (just saying). I ordered a Malabar Paratha which was served to me in 10 mins, along with a Veg Korma. the combination,however didnt appeal all that much to me. The Korma had plenty of carrots which was dominating all the other subtle flavours. the paratha was good though. i even tasted the masala dosa, which was very satisfactory and much better than what most other keralite food joints have to offer. One of my friends ordered a Combo meal, and Good God!-it was gorgeous! 4 curries, one bowl of steaming rice and lemon pickle! Even though the Beetroot dish/curry (?) didnt appeal to my tongue that much! The sambhar was good, i loved its thickness, it wasnt very watery, not was it too thick-it was just perfect-making a clear distinction between the rassam and the sambhar. The Tamrind added in both of them enhanced the taste, and did taste truly keralite. Lastly, i ordered a dish i consume almost on a daily basis, owing to its nutritious value, Idli. The Idli was soft, VERYY soft, and even though some might consider it to be a great thing-but I personally dont. and why i say that, is because when i dipped the Idli into the chuttney,it broke! i feel its consistency could have been much better. The best thing about Ammini,according to me was the perfect and accurate use od spices, and the CHUTTNEYS!  the varieties of the different chuttneys was fabulous, ranging from soothing coconut chuttney, to a subtle sweet-ish Pink Chutteny to my favourite THE ONION CHUTTNEY!-that was just brilliant.
                                                Ammini is a nice, no very nice place-but it could be better! they keep details in mind, like using a sheet of butter paper under the banana leaf, and serving the bill with local moth freshners. even their menu card, was very striking and simple. the location is eye catching and even though the place might not be too big, its decore is simple and very traditional. I would wish though, that their menu would include some keralite drinks as well, except the filter coffee of course. and yes! the flies that enter from the main road may cause a bit of hygine issues for  many. talking about hygine, the washroom is spick and span and  very hyginic. the staff is friendly and well mannered and the service is VERY FAST! in short, Ammini is a good place for south indian delicacies and good food! If you're craving something which satisfies quantity and quality, its the right place to go to!
Best wishes to the entire team. :)

Food is tasty and also in its authentic kerala style served on banana leaf

Ambiance is great for a small restaurant and especially clean and kitchen is set such a way that u can see how they prepare.

Service is at its best.

Location is bit off from the main areas.
But Food is bit highly priced.

Attractions are:
Parata,Appam, non veg kerala style just too good.

Bottem line is...its a must visit place at least once for any south indian food lovers in kolkata.

Been there on Saturday night for dinner. I must say truly experienced the Malayali flavours I kolkata. Food was awesome, service was good too. I must recommend the Chicken n Mutton items. But it is spicy as expected which is completely justified. Two suggestions. Need to increase the sitting capacity as popularity is growing. Also we would love to see some more dishes in the menu card.

Ammini, really had no clue what that means. But if it means great food served in true keralian style with a great host, then it lives by its name. Located at a very familiar stretch of monoharpukur road ahead of the sarat bose road crossing towards ballygunge, this eatery is culturally very rich. I say that coz of the detailing that has gone into serving authentic keralian delights making the experience worthy of remembering. The host pays a lot of attention to your comfort that's a +1. We had ordered kozi chichen curry, kozhi chicken roast, malabar paratha and appams. Mostly suggested by the people manning the not so big eatery. The chicken roast with such aroma and taste is something I had rarely eaten elsewhere. The malabar paratha is a more decent version of our roadside 'petai porota'. The appams were evenly cooked. While the kozhi chicken curry went too generous with the curry leaves, it was very light and had a distinctive flavour. The rasam was delightfully refreshing. The style and flavour of this eatery hopefully will be a trendsetter if it can maintain both for years to come. Our dining experience was as sweet as their Kesari, a variant of the suji halwa that is possibly too oily becoz of the ghee that is used, yet you will be left wondering how simple suji halwa can be so aromatic! We rounded off with a glass of buttermilk and a cup of filtered coffee and loads of fine dining experience at a very affordable price. Hopefully they come up with a more elaborate menu in days ahead and more tender chicken pieces.

One of the best for South Indian in Kolkata for sure. Jyoti Vihar is good for just idlis and dosas. But here you get a larger variety of South Indian food. The aadi dosas, malabar paratha, appam, veg stew and veg korma are my regular food items along with a glass of rasam. The place decor is cute with your servings being on a banana leaf and terracotta cups for your rasam and water. Its a small place with a few tables which I think is good so that you get your fresh food with good service and that makes this more sustainable.

Mutton is as tender as it gets and appam...  can have 10 of them on a normal... absolutely thin n soft...  a must visit if you are the spices of the south

I did not realise that I had missed writing a review for Ammini. A bright and cosy little place I love to visit because one is always assured of good food here ..... the fact that they never disappoint is a huge plus for me at least. 
On our latest visit three of us visited. Our order was for Idli , Masala Dosa , Parupe Wada , Mutton Olathede , Aappams and Filter Coffee. The Idli's were soft and fluffy , the Masala Dosa spot on , the Vada with onion , chili and spices was a tad spicy but crisp and yummy and the Mutton Olathede with Aappams were outstanding. The quality of Mutton was very good and it was perfectly cooked. I found it a bit spicy but those who like spice will find this dish outstanding.
Finished off with the Filter Coffee which was decent and will surely visit again. Recommended ! One thing I love is the fact that they serve you on banana leaves and provide earthenware glasses. A yummy experience.

Visited this one solely based on zomato reviews. To tell the truth finding it was quite a bit problematic. Basically situated near deshapriya park this joint serves authentic Kerala cuisines. It's nothing close to all the idli dosa we know as 'south Indian food' . give it a try and you will know. (However the portions are moderate so order accordingly)

One of the best for South Indian in Kolkata for sure. Jyoti Vihar is good for just idlis and dosas. But here you get a larger variety of South Indian food. The aadi dosas, malabar paratha, appam, veg stew and veg korma are my regular food items along with a glass of rasam. The place decor is cute with your servings being on a banana leaf and terracotta cups for your rasam and water. Its a small place with a few tables which I think is good so that you get your fresh food with good service and that makes this more sustainable.

Welcome change and amazed at the taste n aroma of food here...  for people who think idly n Sosa is all the south India food has.. this will eye opener for them. Mutton is as tender as it gets and appam...  can have 10 of them on a normal... absolutely thin n soft...  a must visit if you are the spices of the south

Love the place. Just find that their mutton olathede is just a bit too spicy for me and I really wish that they could keep the mutton stew permanently on the menu. The owners are also lovely people and are always very nice and courteous.

I did not realise that I had missed writing a review for Ammini. A bright and cosy little place I love to visit because one is always assured of good food here ..... the fact that they never disappoint is a huge plus for me at least.

This tiny South Indian restaurant, tucked away in a residential area in Hazra, is worth a visit if you like authentic Kerala cuisine. The bright interiors and massive window overlooking the road make it look a lot bigger than it actually is. The restaurant only seats about 20 people, and was crowded even on a Tuesday afternoon, so be prepared to squeeze in and maybe even wait a while to be seated. 

The menu here is pretty limited, but the staff is happy to recommend dishes. Arguably the best thing available is not actually on the menu - call ahead and order the chicken stew, if possible. Also great picks are the chicken curry and mutton olathede (spicy dry mutton that virtually melts in your mouth). The food is full of flavour, but nothing overwhelms your tastebuds. The staff will bring you as many appams (crunchy on the perimeter but soft and pillowy in the centre - heaven!) as you can consume; some dishes are available in combos with appams/iddiappams/parathas. If you're a dosa fan, try the ghee roast (the only paper dosa available), and revel in the red chilli coconut chutney and the spicy onion chutney that accompany it. The coffee isn't great, but serves as a satisfying end to a really good meal. The best part? It's ridiculously affordable! A non-vegetarian meal for five hungry people will only set you back ₹2000 :D

I am always a great fan of places that stick to a specific region cuisine as opposed to pan-south indian food ( as if south india is a state or continent). So here we have Ammini with food from God's own country, and seriously good food that too (with the highly commendable eco friendly paper bags for parcel ! )

We ordered a combo meal that came with sambar (perfect texture on the thicker side which I like), rasam ( tangy-spicy bliss), bean sabji and avial ( both very tasty) with a nice chutney, and a very, very miserly portion of quarter of a papadam ( why such a dampner?!). It came with white rice though I would have preferred an option of red rice as well and I would have liked it much if it came with a small sweet dish ( or just a banana even to end it on a sweet note). Sambar and rasam are served in all thalis across south India, but parippu (dal), pachdri ( curd based curry), and pulliseries (this is still mango season), come only with kerela thalis and show the wonderful variety of veg dishes. So a wish list to the management - a special veg thali please ?

The slightly limited variety in veg dishes makes up with a diverse option of non veg dishes (fish, chicken, mutton and prawn) - truly reflective of kerela style eating places, but why the heart -breaker of not including beef in true Kerela style ?? We have no prohibition of beef in our state ( and hopefully not following maharastra), and beef served in family restraurants in park street ( thankfully!). So let's get beef back ! :)

In non-veg, we ordered a Kozhi chicken curry and iddiappams ( which came with a generous helping of grated coconut). It was really good, but I had a lot of chicken left after the very thin iddiappams, which I ate just like that, but if you have a healthy apetite, you have to add extra appam/parantha/ iddiappams.

In fact, that brings to my comments on the helpings - for all the combo meals, the helpings are not enough for a person with medium to high apetite, so one needs to order extras ( the veg thali is for 220 bucks and often needs a non-veg side, and the special combos need more appams or idiappams or paranthas) making the bill on the higher side. What it does that adding extra items creates an impression of everything being expensive (since it negates the cognitive understanding of a combo being a good value adequate deal) , but a slightly higher priced combo with adequate helpings don't ( since the customer doesn't interact with the price aspect beyond ordering from menu, and a set price is more palatable in terms of its cognitive acceptance). In addition to this, most people do not have idea on the various sides ( like the excellent inji podi), and a higher priced combo with greater items introduces a customer to it. Alternatively, do away with a combo idea, and make everything ala carte large helping shared helpings). So I would like it the management strategises a bit on this aspect.

We got a parcel of unni appams which is deep fried dumpling of jaggery and banana, and is highly recommended. We had to wait a bit for the food, but that's not a lot of time.

Anyways, there are a lot of dishes I have not tried yet and I am going back again ! Overall, I mark Ammini 4.5 for the food and .5 for the adorablr paper bags , but will deduct marks for not getting basics of consumer psychology and pricing strategy correct. It isn't enough to serve good food, for food is a serious business as well, and one needs to work on business aspects in equal measures.

I didn't have a soft corner for south indian dishes. My idea was they don't know to eat non veg. Only thing they have were dosas, idli, utthapam, upma etc. But my idea changed totally after visiting Tamarind. Frankly speaking I am now a fan of south indian non veg. So from a long time I was trying to get a chance to visit Ammini. Today I had a take away from Ammini. It was the combo of Appam & Kerala Kozhi Curry. I was overwhelmed to taste the dishes after getting home. But they totally let me down. The combo was of ₹ 318 with tax. They even added vat to aluminium foil & container. But alas. The Appam is good, soft. But the curry is totally waste of money. Chicken pieces are not bad though (5 pcs). The curry is just a normal homemade curry with a bit better consistency than water. Just the difference is it has some coconut and curry leaves in it. Come on, I can cook chicken chettinad so well that they will keep licking their fingers. ₹ 260 is the price of the combo. ₹ 60 can be for appams. ₹ 200 for the chicken is totally waste of money.

Being an ardent lover of South Indian cuisine, Ammini had always been on my list ever since I read about the Onam sadya they serve. It didn't fail to surprise me when we headed for this Manoharpukur joint during Durga Puja. The ambience is exactly what is needed to have such delicacies in peace. The appam, Kozhi chicken curry, Rasam vada, Fish in banana leaf were the best I've ever tasted. Buttermilk was served in earthen glasses. A must place to dig in Kerala cuisine.

Fantastic place. Great keral food. I personally had never tried this cuisine. Hence was a little sceptical about visiting this place. But this place proved my notions wrong. I went with a friend of mine and we ordered almost everything on their veg menu and loved it all. There's a dessert they serve on weekends which is made of gur. It's a must try!

May be I didn't order the right dish else I shouldn't have been confused with my perception vs the reviews of repute on Amini.
The food is authentic  Keralite cuisine , but my kolkata tastebuds could not justify the minuscule quantity at the hefty price charged . The dosas are good but does not justify paying extra for chutney and other condiments with idiapamms. The interiors are subtle and soon to be taken over by the scores of accolades from times food guide and many others . 
The presentation is something nice and different with banana leaves on trays replacing the usual dinner plate . 
Once again the food is good as the reviews suggest but I expected a bit more to quench my thirst to visit on reading the reviews.

Starting with the mutton starter then moving on to the appam, potato stew, chicken kozhikade and ending with typical Kerala's payasham, there was nothing that I could single out as bad.

So went there expecting an authentic Kerala experience and was not at all disappointed. The food is beautifully prepared. The open kitchen adds to the charm and is also reassuaring about their high hygiene standards. Do try the kozhi chicken curry and the mutton dish. The appam and idiyappam were delightful. The vegetarian meal was average. Have had better elsewhere. The spicy dal dosa though was not really appetising. Also i found the place to be a tad bit overpriced. Or maybe the quantity should be increased to compensate for the cost of the dishes. All in all a place worth going to at the end of the day. Since they use the freshest ingredients and the best quality meat and chicken. Looking forward to trying the fish next time

Ammini a name which I relate to nice Keralan food. While Tamarind is a lot glaze and fashion Ammini is a nice place with soft décor with hints of Kerala, house boats and paintings. The restaurant is run by a Keralan lady and she often would drop by to talk to people and know from them about the food.
Well the food menu is rather narrow and limited but its better to make few good quality food than a lot many poor quality ones. The food is served on banana leaves placed on cane plates (trays to be proper) and has a live kitchen which often drags the smell of freshly made food to you thus making you hungrier. Have tried the Ghee roast and the wadas once but the absolute favorite is the Spicy Dry Mutton. Spices and chilli with fried mutton and mutton fat. The Chicken roast is awesome and order them with the nice Appams. They are a bit different from the ones you get in Tamarind but a lot similar to which a very cute Keralan lady (whom I cutely call grandmother) makes for me at her home for my birthdays. The potato stoo is also awesome with the rich taste of coconut oozing out adding to make the base for the gravy, I though like potato stew a little sweeter with coconut milk and ground coconut as base but you will like it.  IF you are vegetarian try the potato stew or the Veg Korma and you will not be disappointed.
I hated the fish in banana leaf but the rest are awesome. They have a few specialties for the day when they serve prawn roast and am a fan of the same.  
Try out some Kesari to end your meal.  
All in all a nice place to have food and it wont blow up your budget totally.

My high Rating of 4.0 because Ammini literally took me to Kerala -  both in terms of food & feel of the ambiance! 
Located near the manoharpukur & sarat bose rd crossing, this 20 odd seater eatery is well lit, has motifs and decor that are classy, subtle & exudes keralite aura. The restaurant has an open kitchen, which was very neat & clean, thus depicting the high hygiene standards! As per the manager,  this kitchen only makes vegetarian items. The non veg ones are cooked in a separate kitchen in the vicinity of the restaurant. 
It has an interesting Menu card, resembling a photo frame. The plates, covered with banana leaf, & earthen glasses, add to the total south Indian feel. We had the following veg items:
Paniyarappams - spicy dumplings made of idly batter. These were crisp from outside but soft from inside - awesome in taste! (rating 9/10)
Idli - so soft that the Idli melted in the mouth. (rating 8/10)
Adha dosa - one of the signature items, this spicy dosa was more like an uttapam to me, so spicy that almost started sweating,  but very good to taste! (rating 8/10)
Veg Korma - south Indian mix veg korma,  authentic aroma of typical southie spices, a must have! (rating 9/10)
Potato stew - few pieces of potatoes in white stew with onions put in, quite decent. (rating 7/10)
Appam - I must confess that this was by far the best Appam I had, crisp from outer layers but so soft and tender from inside! (rating 9. 5/10)
Malabar Paratha - This paratha rocks! A big sized which had so many thin lachhas and perfectly crisped to taste! Simply sumptuous! (rating 10/10)
Kesari - a typical malayalee suji ka halwa made in ghee, with saffron aroma and garnished with fried cashew nuts & raisins on top. Very sweet,  but very different taste. (rating 7/10). 
The manager was knowledgeable and courteous enough to respond to some of my queries of the ingredients and the style of cooking. 
The cons:
1. The place became Stuffy as the ac couldn't work optimum due to the open kitchen. We struggled somewhat to enjoy the spicy food in the absence of good cooling. 
2. Also, no finger bowl is served but only wet wipes are given to clean the fingers. It is indeed very difficult to do this given the oil present in a typical south Indian food item. Had to visit the washroom for cleaning my hands, which was small but nicely made.
Cost for 2 - around Rs 800-1000
P. S. my ratings could have been 4.5 but just because of the cons. Hope the management takes care of it.

Though not a big fan of South Indian cuisine..yet I had to visit this place once..Took a bit of risk
The seating is not much but the ambience is good..
I took their thali containing idiappam and chicken Kozhi curry...it tasted different but loved the food nevertheless....the idiappams were soft and the chicken well cooked..the dosas and vadas tasted good too
The only  drawback that I found was their quantity of food served...not suitable for a person who normally eats a lot...But overall was a good experience

It was my first visit today at Ammini and the experience was overall a good one. It is located at Manohar Pukur Road and is easy to locate. It is a small place with a few tables, but nevertheless the place is done up very well. The first look of it would make you feel as if you are actually in a restaurant in Kerala. Coming to the food, we went there for an early lunch, so at first ordered 2 plates of Masala Dosas and 2 plates of Idlis. Each plate of Dosa consisted of 2 small dosas..tastewise it was good, very soft in texture. The chutneys served alongwith the dosas and idlis were really good, although I personally didn't like the Sambhar, which tasted more like a bland dal wit vegetables. Idlis were 3 in number and came in small square plates, and were extremely soft and tender. Later we ordered Parupe Vadas, which were extremely crispy and I liked the taste. For desserts, we ordered 2 portions Mallu Suji Halwa, which stole the show. Loved it to the core. Not too sugary, yet it tasted yumm with dry fruits in it. Masala Chai which was ordered later was very ordinary and not worth the money at all. For all of this the bill came upto Rs. 1110 inclusive of taxes, although they couldn't provide us wit a computerized bill as they were having some problems with their machine. It was a handwritten bill, where they charged the Vat separately of Rs. 140. The service of staff is slow. They had to be told thrice for refilling water in the glasses before they finally did. Food is decent, nothing extraordinary. But the presentation of food and the ambience are much to my liking. On my next visit, I would like to try their Appams n Prawn curry.

Food is great. I'm not a very big fan of south indian food but the dry mutton and the Malabar paratha quite praise worthy. Service, however is not as good as their food. We had to ask for a refill of water thrice before it was actually done. Maybe because it was a Sunday but they should look into that.

Food, ambience, location, pricing, service everything is perfect. I was introduced to iddiappam and appams 2 decades ago when I was living in Chennai. Every South Indian food joint I've visited in kolkata has disappointed me on that point. Finally a place that is just not an idli-dosa server. Good addition. Was a good experience.

This is the only place that serves adai dosai, the way it is supposed to be made.
Only issue I felt was the delay in delivery to the table. Which could've been because I visited the place for a Saturday brunch.
And... They don't use coconut oil!

Very satisfied with this food joint...a small restaurant, but very clean, well maintained, carrying the theme properly....though they don't have banner outside the joint as of now (may be for maintenance issue), so it's a little confusing to find.....staffs are very helpful and friendly.....
Now coming to the food....we ordered 1. dry mutton which comes with two appam, 2. Idiappam, 3. Onion chutney, 4. Thumbs up....all the foods are very good...Mutton was little spicy but very tasty, appam and Idiappam are perfect, onion chutney was also good, and they served canned thumbs up....the banana leaf on a tray in the place of dinner plate and earthen glass are perfect for the ambience....the washroom was also good- small but compact and beautiful....they billed us Rs.468 only....will definitely visit again and again...:-)

So, the only real con here is that the price range tends towards the exorbitant end. The quality of the food is really good. We had the rice meal and mutton olathede. Sambar, rasam, cabbage thoran, avial and inji curry. There are nothing but superlative complements to describe them. Well worth the money you shell out. Magnificent authentic Kerala food. The uniyappam serves as an excellent post-meal sweetener.

As an aside, I would like to point out that the porotta is ridiculously overpriced. Seeing that it was priced at INR 60 a piece, I ordered one for curiosity sake. It is most definitely not worth it. So I would suggest sticking to the rice meal with some non veg side dish to go with it.

Amazing food! Mutton athileb with appam is the one to go for in the menu, soft and great taste..the addai dosa is too spicy for my tongue but tastes good nonetheless..

I just could not swallow  South Indian food in Calcutta after staying with an amazing South Indian family in Mumbai. But Ammini got me back to eating South Indian in my city!

The food is delicious and like South Indian is supposed to be; the decor is heart warming and so are the banana leaf plates and earthen water glasses. The service is the best I've experienced in a long time in Calcutta and all staff members had a genuine smile on their faces at all times. 

Way to go Ammini, for brining this to my lovely city!!

If you are searching for authentic Kerala cuisine, you've reached your destination. Hands down, the best Kerala cuisine restaurant of Kolkata.
Amminis features a mixed crowd of foreign tourists, foodie crowd of Kolkata looking for a different cuisine, executives looking for a place with good ambience n taste to bring their south Indian colleagues for lunch , and a bunch of regulars (read malayalees) for whom this is their home away from home.
Pros :
1. Tasty. As in yum. Quality of food served is high.
2. Lovely ambience
3. Prompt, friendly staff
4. Neat and hygienic.
5. Best Kerala cuisine available in Kolkata

Cons :
1. Prices are on the higher side, even thou customers Dont mind it cos of the quality of food being served.
2. Seating capacity is on the lower side, which becomes a problem on festival days.

Must order items:
1. Kerala paratta
2. Mutton Olathedey
3. Combo meals on weekends
4. Appam with potato/mutton stew
5. Dont miss the specials menu which changes everyday!
For malayalees here, don't forget to go there on Onam and Vishnu or ull miss a chance to have a delightful sadhya!

Loved this restaurant as I got something besides the tradition south indian fare to gorge on! We started off with Appams and Idiappams with potato stew and veg korma, which were both delicious! paniyarams were also great! The chutneys were pretty good, especially the onion one. Overalll, a must try for everyone!

So, the only real con here is that the price range tends towards the exorbitant end. The quality of the food is really good. We had the rice meal and mutton olathede.

Friday being the last working day automatically makes you feel good that a long two day weekend is ahead. And weekends are more welcoming after a super hectic week in office. So me and my friend cum colleague wanted to get out of this fatigue badly and so we decided to spend our evening the way we like the most. What can be more refreshing than a good food experience. We had a name in our wish list for quite a long time but wasn't really able to visit it. So without wasting much time we headed to Ammini. And we being ardent followers of zomato, had already saw through the menu,seen pictures, read reviews and were all set to experience 'the taste of Kerala.' As soon we entered Ammini, I started liking the place with a simple but classy decor and found it very cosy and comfortable. The menu card was short but had good names and we were hoping that the dishes will live up to our expectations. Without wasting much time, we ordered the food as it was predecided( thanks to Zomato). We ordered butter milk and rasam to start with and both were quite refreshing in their own ways. Kerala cuisine has always been interesting for me as being a hard core Bangali, I love spicy food and of course meat and fish on my platter. We decided to go for a starter and ordered Addai Dosa. Food was served on banana leaves which immediately had sent us a message that we were going to have a good time. The Addai dosas came which not at all looked like the dosas we usually have. They were spicy pancakes made from primarily rice, lentils, Chopped onions,chillies and coriander served with coconut chutney, sambhar and ulli chamandi, a spicy onion chutney, which was a complementary chutney served to us as we had insisted on tasting it. And, trust me it was one of the best chutneys I have ever had. We loved whatever was served to us till now. Finally it was time for the protagonist to enter the stage and it was a combo of mutton olathede and appams. I would rather not begin to compliment the olathede as I would go short of adjectives. Only I can add that two of us were silent throughout this 10mins relishing the flavours. The mutton olathede is a bit spicy but it's supposed to be this way to taste the best. You would not feel the hotness of the dry chillies and the pepper corns till you actually finish the entire dish as you will not really waste your time thinking of such trivial things. My friend insisted that we rather finish our meal with a dessert. I was not really sure but still did not object. So we had Kesari(mallu suji halwa). I have had this halwa earlier in another south indian joint, but hated it for its extra sweetness. But today I just could not stop myself having a spoon one after the other. A meal that started with good entrees, followed by a great main course and ending with a lovely dessert was just perfect to make you feel happy about the way the day ended with a big smile on our faces. I have saved the .5 score for the fish in banana leaf to have on my next visit :)

Last Sunday evening we had an exceptional movie-going stint and decided to top it up with an equally good dining experience – we decided to check out Ammini (these days we are avoiding the oft repeated Chinese, continental and mughlai fares). 

One is welcomed by a fragrant spicy ambience because of the open kitchen, which in fact gives you a high – as you can see the food cooked in front of your eyes - the smell, the sound of food transports you to a different land – the view of Manoharpukur street through the glass doors actually remind you that you are still in Kolkata

Heard a lot about Ammini’s famed combination of Mutton and Appam – so that was a default order. And needless to say, it did not disappoint us – on the contrary, the spicy, succulent mutton teamed with soft, fluffy appams created magic for our taste buds.

Kozhu curry, masala dosa, kesari completed our spread – but could not surpass the deadly combo of mutton-appam. Dosas were not that crisp and was not liked much by my daughter – Kesari lifted her mood though.

Ammini has a small concise menu, no one will get confused – additionally, there are certain daily surprises. Prices are very reasonable and absolutely value for money ….

Saw an article in the paper so decided to try it out.. Small restaurant, like 15 ppl at the time. 

It was full, but the owner was able to promptly seat us within 5 mins when a table opened up. 

She was very helpful with explaining to us what the menu items were and their specials. 

Started with rasam, which was refreshing and perfect. Then ordered chicken roast with appam, veg uppadam and mutton currry. 

At first when the food comes, it doesnt look like its enough to fill the tummy, but once u finish it is enough. Food was amazing and have already recommended everyone to try it. Will definitely return. 

The mutton and the chicken dish with appam is a must have! You wont regret it.

A stone throw distance from my house hence a frequent visitor.This is the place where i developed my love for south indian condiments specially molaga podi. No matter what i have i ensure to complement my dish with this special powder.The potato stew is yum and so are the paniyarappams and rasam.
The non veg served is pretty good.
Though you cant count it in if u want typical keralian taste but a good option for light lunch.
The best part is no matter what u have u will never feel heavy and bloated.
A special applause for the ambience...a small place place neatly done with proper lights.
I am totally in love with this place.. :)

Nicely done small restaurant. We went for lunch and started with Rasam which was just awesome. In the main course, mutton was very tasty but we missed the actual Kerala flavours in it, it was more of a Bengali touch of kosha mangsho. The chicken was really good with authentic taste. Veg korma was purely north Indian taste. The best part was the appam and the idiappam, which definitely draws the accolades. The lachcha paratha was ok. We heard a lot of appreciation about the fish preparation in banana leaf but unfortunately, the same was not available. Considering the service standard and ambiance, the pricing could have been little cheaper, but still can be ignored.

This restaurant was in my wish list since long. I did not know South Indian cuisine tastes so good before I visited Ammini. I went there with my office college for a part. Had some delicious Mutton Pepper Fry, Chicken Stew, Potato Stew, Uppam, Rasam, Prawn and a sweet dish,I forgot the name. Ambience was awesome. Though having a smaller space, its nicely decorated. But resources are very less for catering to an office party. Overall a nice experience.

I have been reading rave reviews about Ammini on Zomato for a while now and the restaurant has been on my wish list for sometime now. However, I wasn't having a company who was willing to try out non-vegetarian South Indian cuisine, so was pushing off my visit. Finally, I could convince a friend of mine to go with me on Friday for dinner. 
The restaurant is quaint, small enough to sit 12-15 people at a time. It is conveniently located near Deshapriya park. The decor is simple and traditional South Indian. They have the menu printed on wooden slates which is kind of nice. The food is served on banana leaves which is extremely good. The concept of live kitchen gets a thumbs up. You can see you food being prepared and indulge in the smell of coconut and mint leaves. 
We ordered for a masala dosa with two condiments and the traditional chicken curry with appams (I hope I pronounced the name correctly). The dosa was very light and the masala had a distinct flavour of mint leaves. My friend chose a onion and red chilly condiment and a coconut condiment. The coconut condiment was quite mild to my taste but the spicy onion condiment was awesome. I almost cheated on my friend to have the major portion of it. 
Now coming to the chicken mains, the appams are like giant sized idli with thin crunchy outer crust and thick middle portion. It is infact made from rice flour, same as idli, just that it's quite big. The chicken curry was simply outstanding. It was delicately spiced and had the aroma of coconut and mint leaves. The chicken pieces were soft and tender and one portion should be good for two. 
We finished our Meal with friend sweet dumplings which I was told was made from banana and semolina. It was good and definitely different from the desserts I'm used to having.
I will surely recommend this place to everyone to give your tastebuds something different from the usual mughlai and Chinese cuisine that we are so used to having.@

The spread is modest but each and every dish is worth coming back for. Appam with Spicy dry mutton or with fish in banana leaf - are just amazing. Recent addition are thalis which have good spread and are quite sumptuous. Sambar, rasam, and the vegetables are cooked in typical Kerala style and are very tasty. The restaurant is small, cozy and service is quick. The dishes may be a bit too spicy for those who are not accustomed.

A small, quaint little joint in hazra, with seating for just 25 people, offers the best south Indian food in the city. Its not your regular dosa and idly but authentic Kerala twist to it.

Im surprised that i discovered this place after so many years.

Lets talk the food its yummy, ended up trying everything veg in the menu. Also offers non veg items which go great with the appum.

The veg stew and the potato stew were great goes well with appum and idiappam.
 Addai dosa, paniyarappams and dosa were really good.
And the upma is to die for, so try it.
Also call for the filter coffee, its nice.

Try to reach early, cause it gets packed really fast.

Definitely going there again.

And finally my south indian cuisine hunt led me here. Ever since I have visited tamarind I have been an qrdent fan of south indian non-veg delicacies. Had some work in hazra and it was lunch hours when it got over and I decided I would visit ammini. Gave them a call and they could not properly guide me through. So Gmap was the last resort. I think it is easier from kalighat metro than j.d.metro. so giving the easiest possible directions. Drop into deshapriya park and walk towards sarat bose road. The fifth right is the manaharpukur-sarat bose road junction.  Take the right and there is the amulyajyoti eye foundation.  Opposite to it is ammini. I loved many a things about this joint. Firstly the lush green cafe with a few rot iron chairs beautifully etched. The checkerboard tables. And ofcourse the painting of the kathakali dancer. It just blew me off my mind. Also the open kitchen and the smell that causes tactile sensations to blurt out. What i loved is the concept of giving the good in a banana leaf and the water in an earthern glass. The water tasted amazing. As I was not well acquainted I did ask for a suggestion. So the cook immediately came out to help me out. Though there was a tiff between malyali and bengali, still I understood that he wanted me to try the appam. Since I was behaving like a hungry bunny,  definitely it had to be appam and mutton olathede.  And finally the banana leaf laid in front of me, arrived the rasam, which was tasty to a superlative degree. And then came the mutton olathede, which was basically a dry spicy mutton which is superbly tasty. And along with it came in the hot soft appams. It is basically a rice preparation with coconut milk made to rise with yeast. And the taste was amazing as never. After an amazing wholesome meal, the special kannad betel nut they provided was again phenomenal.  And it is quite easy on the pocket.  Thus would conclude I am superbly pleased with ammini and I am rushing soon.

2nd comes quality of food: like awesome is a less worthy word...
The chicken roast as a starter have no competition...
Then came mutton which simply had a taste which was like out of this world...
Then the last was the potato stew like I have never tasted a stew so good...
The waiter were very friendly...

As a foodie and a true blue Keralite, I have to say that this place is amazing. So amazing that I gorged on to the food before clicking photographs. I ordered Kerala style chicken along with appam and idiyappam. The chicken was well done, exactly how I am used to back home. The appam was crispy on the outer end. And soft inside, just like it should be. Idiyappam was wonderful , I missed my home like anything after that. I ended up ordering more after that. I had a glass of buttermilk along with it, which was served in these earthern tumblers. The ambiance was very Kerala-like, the service was courteous. The specials are a little overpriced, but the yum makes it worth it.

Easter Sunday brunch at Ammini. Passed this place a zillion times and also heard some reviews but never ventures in. The fare available for breakfast is limited - Appams and Potato Stew, Dosha and Adai. No Mutton, Chicken and Fish - which are served only for lunch and dinner. The Appams were steamed just right - fluffy without being heavy. Potato Stew was excellent - though would have preferred a vegetable stew instead. The assortment of chutneys and podis were interesting especially the onion chutney. Loved the presentation and hygiene (open kitchen) somewhat rare in Calcutta. The filter coffee was brilliant - made with fresh decoction. Service was very friendly and courteous - but a bit slow for a barely 30 cover restaurant. The kitchen staff seemed a but disorganised. Some training and processes might help. The decor was neat with the minimalist ethnic touches. Certainly, the first authentic Kerala cuisine speciality restaurant - a welcome addition to ia city that has so far been dominated by only "Madrassi" Tiffin by way of South Indian Comfort food.

As a foodie and a true blue Keralite, I have to say that this place is amazing. So amazing that I gorged on to the food before clicking photographs. I ordered Kerala style chicken along with appam and idiyappam. The chicken was well done, exactly how I am used to back home. The appam was crispy on the outer end. And soft inside, just like it should be. Idiyappam was wonderful , I missed my home like anything after that. I ended up ordering more after that. I had a glass of buttermilk along with it, which was served in these earthern tumblers. The ambiance was very Kerala-like, the service was courteous. The specials are a little overpriced, but the yum makes it worth it.

Easter Sunday brunch at Ammini. Passed this place a zillion times and also heard some reviews but never ventures in. The fare available for breakfast is limited - Appams and Potato Stew, Dosha and Adai. No Mutton, Chicken and Fish - which are served only for lunch and dinner. The Appams were steamed just right - fluffy without being heavy. Potato Stew was excellent - though would have preferred a vegetable stew instead. The assortment of chutneys and podis were interesting especially the onion chutney. Loved the presentation and hygiene (open kitchen) somewhat rare in Calcutta. The filter coffee was brilliant - made with fresh decoction. Service was very friendly and courteous - but a bit slow for a barely 30 cover restaurant. The kitchen staff seemed a but disorganised. Some training and processes might help. The decor was neat with the minimalist ethnic touches. Certainly, the first authentic Kerala cuisine speciality restaurant - a welcome addition to ia city that has so far been dominated by only "Madrassi" Tiffin by way of South Indian Comfort food.

Went here to spoil my Sunday ..... 3rd class act..... I don't understand how people rate them highly...... Service is very very slow for whichever tables were occupied ...... They will give appams at such a pace that the stew gets over by that time..... Zero service ......?The food wasn't any thing special at all.

Have been to this place quite a lot of times ,i just loved their potato stew  with appam,n kerala paratha with veg korma...but unfortunately in the last few times that i have been there and i have got dissapointed  with the food.Once i went on a weekday afternoon with a friend to whom i had recommended this place,all the possible veg food they had on the menu was over,went there specially for the potato stew n it was over too!!!anyways they did make me a veg dry dish but i hoped they had make bigger portions on other days.Again i had been there last week for lunch,wada wasnt available,the potato stew doesnt taste same anymore,the appam is served cold.i really want this place to serve the same quality of food that they used to serve and have food available all the time unless its been too busy on a weekend.I don expect things been not available on a weekday afternoon!!!i hope things will get better the next time im there!!!

Ammini - Taste of Kerala in Kolkata
=====
Intro + Location: I don't know how i could miss to review this place. This is located when you head straight from Raj (South Indian Restaurant) Near JD park Metro and after crossing the first signal (If coming from JD Park Metro side), on the left side you discover Ammini. To be precise, Near Manoharpukur road - Sarat Bose Road crossing

It is a small place for dining but remains full at quite some times. I was new to the Kerala's cuisine and managed to get a seat after 10 minutes. They kept their banana leaf style plates in front of us and thereafter, i continued with my order. 
=====

1) Appam - It tasted really different. Crisp on the sides and soft like idli on the center. Did not feel heavy after eating it. A good dish for a change. 

2) Potato Stew - It was plain and had very few pieces of potato .

3) Chicken Olathede - It had with bone chicken pieces and was cooked in spicy kerala's ingredients. It is not just spicy but VERY VERY SPICY!! I literally burnt my tounge and literally gulped two cokes down to balance my palate. I probably feel this is how the dish indeed is. 
=====
Meal for two: 500-800 max
=====
Pros:

1) Location.
2) Authentic Cuisine.
3) Prompt service.
4) Food quality is really good.
5) Reasonably priced
=====
Summary:

Food quality 4.3/5
Food Quantity 3.8/5
Taste 4/5
Hygiene 3.7/5
Ambience 3.8/5
Hospitality 3.7/5
=====
Conclusion:

We ended our meal with the soaf. 
I would revisit again to try their special kerala kozhi curry with malabar paratha!! Really enjoyed the meal. #recommended.

Awesome place.  Went for lunch today with my daughter.  Small restaurant,  basic decor,  welll mannered staff.  Ordered Appam with Veg Kurma and Masala Dosa.  Appam was extremely fluffy and well made.  Kurma was yummy.  Had probably the best sambhar in town with the Dosa. Menu is limited,  but the quality is nice and time taken is quick too. Will visit again.

Amazing food. Reasonable price. Starting from rasam and buttermilk to mallu i.e. halwa. Appam is tasty . Keralite chicken is yum and light. Both dry mutton and mutton stew is delicious. Only it will be better if they introduce different types of Appam like Cheese Appam and Egg Appam . Rest is good. Please maintain this food quality and price. Thank you.

Ammini is located at Monoharpukur Road near Desapriya park.Today I went this Non-vegeterian South-Indian restaurant with my lover for lunch.First of all they have open kitchen beside of sitting place.The ambience is totally keralian style like Picture of Kathakali,Show piece of House Boat etc.They have few seating table but the ambience is too good & well decorated.Waiter gave us a small menu card,only few items are there & water with clay glass.We ordered  one special kerala Kozhi curry,one Mutton Olathede & one Malabar Paratha.Special Kerala Kozhi Curry is Chicken Curry with 4 pcs chicken,gravy is very light & it cooked Curry leaves & coconut.It served with 2 pcs Appam,so it is called special.Appam is average tasty.Mutton Olathede is delicious,It is a dry & spicy preparation.I love it.Malabar Paratha is very tasty,it tastes like laccha paratha & less oilly.They served food on banana leaves.Overall unique food & good experience.Waiter is very polite & well mannered.Atlast waiter gave us a packet of wipes for hand & mouth washing.Restaurant & toilet is neat & clean.Price is moderate.

I’ve been to Ammini for Lunch & Dinner multiple times and it seems that this small Keralite restaurant gets better every single time. It also happens to be very well priced for the kind of food & service you get. The last visit was at lunch a couple of days ago and I’m already planning when I can go again!

The Food:
To start of with we ordered some rasam & buttermilk – both were excellent – the rasam was quite tangy & spicy, just how I like it! Since we were a vegetarian & a non vegetarian lunching together, we ordered quite a variety of things – the iddiappams with veg korma, the appams with the Kerela kohzi curry (chicken), the paniharrans with sambar, pink chutney, ulli chamandi and on the side we ordered the fish in banana leaf, a potato stew, injli puli & molaga podi. 
All were brilliant and in short time we polished it off. Every single main was hot & freshly made, the potato stew was subtle yet delicious. The chicken & fish were both served on the bone but I believe my friend had no qualms in digging in. All the condiments added more depth & taste to every bite.
My personal favorites are the appams with veg korma & inji puli - the perfect combination of crisp, spicy & tart! 

The Ambience & Service:
Ammini being a small place the ambience is very relaxed, with people talking & having a great meal. The place has been 80 to 90% full every time I’ve gone but never have I seen a ton of people waiting long enough to make the servers seem like they’re rushing your meal. The service was great to the point where our waiter apologized for not giving us a four person table so we could accommodate all our food (even though it was just two people eating!).

All in all, I go to Ammini when I want to be guaranteed brilliant food, without having to dress up too much & so far I’ve never left unsatisfied!

The food is no where near the authentic kerala food.  Every item on the menu is over priced.  I had combo meals and chicken curry from there. To begin with the rice used was raw rice and the the rasam was sweet.  The chicken curry was also not good.

Recommended only if you very badly miss Kerala food. The menu is limited and half the things in the menu will not be available. You ask for one type of rice and they give you another. You are expected to be happy with it. Ambiance is over-hyped and the food is good but super expensive.

Near Deshapriya Park a small Keralian place. The ambiance is fantastic. The food is good. Service - well not bad. Menu - limited and they didn't have the fish the day we went.

We ordered Filtered coffee, Veg Korma with Idiappams and Chicken Curry with Appam. The Coffee was good and strong, Veg Korma strictly average, Idiappams not so great, Chicken Curry was good, the appams were very good, warm and fluffy.

A tad bit expensive for the amount and quality of food they serve.

In a city filled with South Indian restaurants that range from legendary to veritable pilgrimages Ammini has managed to hold its own. Winning several awards including ponder three years in a row from the very reputable TOI awards. 
Ammini though is different that it serves a small Menu consisting only of Kerala cuisine. 
I was a little bit disappointed that this place was empty on a Friday lunch time. Places like these deserve more patronage. 
The Appams and Iddyappams were awesome. 
Freshly made the Appams had the right tang and crispness. The dry mutton curry was also excellent. 
The Sambhar which is so often seen as a make or break part of the meal was great. It isn't as spicy as the other places in town. But it was excellent. A different kind of Sambhar if you will. 
The other thing I must mention is the Buttermilk. It was great. We had one at the start of the lunch and it had a nice spiciness to it. It wasn't  killer spicy obviously as it is Buttermilk but it had a nice edge. All in all this is a great little place and fully deserves its many awards.

The food especially the mutton had a fresh new taste to it.

However the menu is quite short and would be great if they could add more dishes.

The appam and the Mutton form a formidable partnership!

A very different - if not the only exclusively Keralite - dining option, it pleased us with its perfect utthapams and the richly but not abrasively spiced mutton olathede.  But the best was the Rasam, literally a balm for my sore throat.  A chicken curry that we had wasn't as good as the rest of the fare.  The staff are very polite and helpful.  I would have given it a 4.5 had it not been for the fact they are not really prepared to open the restaurant by noon, and kept us waiting for about 40 minutes.  Overall, a must-go for any foodie!

Best appams in kolkata ! Mutton olathede with appams are divine. Only wish there were less chillis in the mutton. Highly recommended.

I am basically from Kerala and visited the restaurant on Christmas day. Without any prejudice - I would say the charges are exorbitant...for 2 appam and Chicken curry for Rs 230.. plus tax is very high...While Quality of appam is extremely good the chicken curry doesn't essentially gives the quality expected for the charged price...If u r looking to taste some kerala experience this place is good..but definitely the promotors should review the charges ...

Ammini Rocks ! Its just that simple.
Every time been there every time vowed to come back for more of it's yummiest appams & mutton olathede.
This quaint out-of-the-way Kerala food joint seriously packs a punch - be it's offbeat menu which is a winner...always... or it's minimalistic yet pleasant decor or it's ever helpful staff. Over & above it's the food which is Right Up There !
Anyone thinks South Indian food is only about dosas & idlis & vadas & uttappams & VEG ... please step in & be amazed !
Sample this - the appams ( a cross between an idli & a dosa ) soft sticky & lil sweet at the centre & crispy & flaky on the outer rim ... goes perfectly with the mutton olathede a dry curry with whole spices & melt-in-your-mouth mutton pieces on the bone with & hint of coconut ... a combo from the gastronomic heaven !
Also highly recommended - fish wrapped in banana leaf ... a thick mackerel fillet in a pungent spicy mix ... one can almost taste the sea.
Finally an unusual treat worth every single penny ...no wonder it has won so many foodie awards.
Hats off to Ammini from a big fan !

Looking for something new to eat we landed up in Ammini. Its a short walk from Deshapriya Park crossing and once you get into the right lane it is easy to spot. It is a comfortable area with about eight tables and an open kitchen. It is very clean and warmly decorated.
They have a short and precise menu and incase of unfamiliarity with the cuisine the staff provide description. We started with a glass of butter milk which was of the right consistency, followed by a glass of Rasam which worked well as appetiser. We then ordered uppam with Mutton Olathede. The uppam was perfect to taste with the right amout of sourness. The Mutton Olathede was perfectly rich and spicy. We also tried their iddyuppam which are a kind of string noodles with Fish in banana leaf. I am not a big fan of he iddyuppams but the Fish is my second favourite after the Mutton. I have also tried the Kerala Kozhi Chicken which is slightly bland for my taste but is tasty nonetheless. For dessert I tried their Kesari and have never tried anything else since it is absolutely heavenly. With every bite you can tastr ghee in it and a hint of camphor. Nothing beats this dessert. I have visited thrice and intend to try their rest of the menu and unniuppams for dessert. If you are looking for south Indian dishes other than the same old Dosai and Idli, do try this place. If you stuff yourself and gorge youe heart out the toll on your pocket will be around 1000/-. Totally worth it. Enjoy!

The food is very good and the service is also quite competent. We had ordered for Appam with Mutton Stew, Chicken (Kuzhi) roast and small fried stuff called Kuzhi Paniyarams. The Paniyarams were absolutely delicious and not at all oily like the ones I had eaten at Grand Restaurant in Chennai. The Mutton stew was excellent and the mutton was cooked perfectly so that it was soft and subtle. The rasams were very good. I suspect they may have applied some oil, but there was no feel of such otherwise and they were delivered pretty fast. They have a unique way of giving Rasams - in the clay tea glasses made popular by Tea Junction, only the glasses were bigger. The Kozhi roast was a semi dry dish but was not as good as the others - I felt it had a bit too many spices this was bad only in comparison with the other dishes.
The prices are high - especially if one has gone to South Indis, the cost is quite high. Biggest problem is directions to the restaurant. Google maps has got it absolutely wrong. Best way to reach the place is to take a right turn at Jugals, coming from Gariahat side. Then drive along the road for approx 100 meters. The shop will be on right side. Also they have some fixed menus of the day which means not all options may be available, or can take more time. I had asked for Karimeen on banana leaf, while they do have similar fish preparations on Surmai, Karimeen alas is not there. Cost for meal for 4 is likely to be around Rs 1500 which is decent. They do have desserts like Payasams etc which I had not tasted. I would recommend the restaurant to all those who like South Indian food. Also did not get any coconut oil taste anywhere

Ammini is not your "everyday-idli-dosa-joint", it is so much more than just that. I have an affinity towards south-indian cuisine and when I found this food joint that promised to serve authentic Kerala cuisine, I was more than excited to visit Ammini and devour the delicious dosas and appams. I have been there twice and both the times I have come out with a huge smile on my face and a tummy full of yummy and satisfying food! I just LOVE their Wadas! They are the best in town, trust me. They are crunchy from outside and so tender when you break through that crusty brown outer-layer. With a hint of green chilli in every bite, this makes for one of their best prepared dishes. Have with it the heavenly-spicy Pink Chutney... Made with coconut and red chillis, this one is not for the faint-hearted. I love their dosas that come two pieces per serving. They are light and fluffy. Reminds me of dosas that I would have at a regular south-indian household. Their idlis are amazing as well. I think the sambhar is a bit too tangy for my taste, but then that's a personal choice. I have tried their Addai Dosa and am not very fond of the hardiness of the lentils. It's a bit too tough and the lentils are just difficult to chew. Not a fan. I am yet ti try their Dry Mutton, which I heard is fantastic! It's such a comfy little eating joint. Their chutneys are amazing, each one of them. I love how they use minimal oil to cook their food in. So refreshing and so tasty. The best south indian joint in town.

I had the pleasure of dining here

Cons:
1. If Address comes with landmark it will be easier to find the place. I forgot the name of the temple that is the lankmark.
2. The revolving daily special items that need to be known is not printed on the menu, and is missed by guests. This gives limited option to patrons. Look at he chalkboard ppl.

Pros:
1. Healthy delicious heart warming food, in kerala level cleanliness. 
2. To those who only eat chicken, this is the perfect place to explore something outside of that. The vegetarian fare is just wonderful. You will look at vegetables differently.
3. Good decent service

I am glad that they will be available on Mondays and are starting weekend breakfast menu. Im gonna be there.

My humble request to all niche joints: Please do not alter/moghalify your dishes according to ill-percieved 'whats popular'. Your uniqueness is your strength, and please dont change. Retain the quality. Also, please dont unnecessarily add chili for no reason because Sanjeev Kapoor does it. It is so unrequired. I know so many other joints here have done that after a period of time. WRONG!

This place serves Kerala cuisine and we we're really excited and in short they serve excellent Kerela cuisine . Just awesome!!

We ordered appams  and iddiapams with Mutton olathede  and Kerala Kohzi curry . Along with this we had fish in banana leaf .In desert to ordered Payasam 

Each one of the dishes were just fantastic ... However you have to keep in mind that Kerala cuisine  is spicy and it was spicy (chicken ,mutton and even the fish)..

Mutton olathede is a dry mutton preparation - awesome

Kerala Kohzi curry is chicken curry - it was a coconut based curry - awesome 

Fish in banana leaf - steamed fish with special spices - just don't miss it !

Appams - awesome 

Idiappams was good but we liked appams more than idiappams.

Payasam - sweet dish made with moong dal - just don't miss this preparation. 

Overall awesome food - if you want to have a different South Indian food than what we usually understand - this place is a must visit.

Small warm place with the owner and the staff doing their best to please. Menu is very small (so for me, being a regular is unlikely), but amazing at what they serve. Spicy dry mutton, fish in a banana leaf, roast chicken - all very lovely (and spicy)

The variety of chutneys they serve are worth a try! We especially recommend the fish achar :)

Awesome Kerala food.. Nice ambience. Must haves: appam and kozhi curry; rasa vada; kesari. Staying at salt lake, I feel this is a bit far for me to go regularly. Other than that, I don't see any negatives here. A must go place for any one who likes south Indian cuisine

Being a South Indian and relatively new to the city i was missing my favourite idiappams and appams and wanted more than just the usual dosas and idlis.Thankfully Ammini lived up to my expectations.
The restaurant is small with  Kathakali pickle jars and Kerala style murals on the wall giving a contemporary Kerela feel.However the tables and chairs seeem to be a mismatch in the decor.
The menu is limited but has all the staples.They also have daily specials like avial and parathas and the food is enticingly served on a banana leaf platter.I tried the idiyappams-fluffy and sprinkled with coconut ,which went wonderfully with vegetable korma.Hubby had appams with mutton olathede.The mutton was soft,well spiced and delicious.We also tried the Malabar parathas- crisp and flaky and non oily.Ended the meal with degree coffee-Dark and strong..one of the best i ve had.

Kerala cuisine - Appams, Iddiappams and Mutton Stew defines Amini. Amini provides wholesome food prepared and served with utmost care. Like the way they have upheld the use of banana leaf while serving food. 
Love their food and highly recommended service.

After a long wait, I could finally go to Ammini and was I overjoyed. Neatly tucked under an apartment off Manoharpukur Road, it is one of those cute little innovative restaurants in this city. I had heard much about the place, and exactly knew what I wanted to eat. So pat came my order - a plate of Appams with Mutton Olathede, a plate of Iddiappams with Kerala style Chicken Curry, Ghee Roast Masala Dosa with condiments, and Kesari in the end.

We waited impatiently for the food, and checked out the decor. it was simple and cozy, and had an interesting Kathakali painting. The tray that they had placed in front of us, wrapped in Banana leaf acted like the bell sound stimulus in Pavlov's experiment! The wait indeed was worth it, and what came in the end was surely mouthwatering.

The steamed Appams were tender, and tasty when teamed with the chicken or mutton curry. The Iddiappams were interesting, soft, stringy, fresh, with a generous sprinkling of grated coconut. Some slice of Kerala on my plate!
The chicken curry was done in cocunut gravy, seasoned with curry leaves and some tamarind. It was delicious. The mutton was spicy with a generous dose of red chillies and curry leaves again. It was a little chewy, on the harder side - I would have preferred more tender, overdone mutton.

The dosa was a bit overdone, had a bitter aftertaste, but the masala went well with it, and the condiments were mindblowing - the sambhar was the authentic ground spiced sambhar, unlike the quick-fixed ones that you normally get in north india. The texture was beatifully thick and the sourness just right. The spicy onion chamandi was mindblowing!

I was quite full, but enjoyed the Kesari to the fullest. It was heavenly again, except of the strong smell of camphor. I am a little aversive to camphor, I daresay, but actual Kerala cuisine uses it often! It is supposed to be healthy! In all, it was a yummylicious experience!

Next time, I want to try the paratha and avial. Also I would request the management to introduce the Kerala-style Mutton Stew and Appam for breakfast. 

I spent Rs 813 for all this. They gave us fragrant wet wipes after eating, and served mallu supari packs imported straight from malluland. Could not read the name but tasted nice...cute!

Considering I have never tried Keralite food, I was intrigued by this place when it opened. But since the first time, I have been there thrice, primarily owing to the distance from my area, but had it been somewhere closeby would have been there a dozen times by now. 
Not much of a red meat person, I opted for the Kerala Kozhi Curry special that came with two Idiappams, the first time I went there. Served on banana leafs, which added to the feel, the food was piping hot. Only after finishing the first Idiappam did the second one come so that it doesn't grow cold while I finish the first one. Thoughtful service. The chicken made with curry leaves had enough of gravy to go along with it. A friend trying out the Mutton Olathede insisted that I try out the spicy dried mutton. And to my delight it was beautiful. Since then, I kept asking for the Mutton. But only opt for it if you like spicy food, as it is quite, quite spicy.
If in for some experimentation, experience the various kind of chutneys on offer and also look up the day's specials. I once ended up having a paratha, which was layered and fried, yet soft. But nothing can replace the soft Idiappams.
The place might be small, simple and accommodate barely 20-25 people, but the food is just irresistibly good. So while I drool over thoughts of it, I would suggest just head out there right now :)

Love this place, love their food. Their idiappams, chicken curry and mutton curry are fantastic. Their staff are very warm and friendly. Really like the fact that they serve their fare on banana leaves placed on their plates.

They should think about adding a small side dish like Dal or a chutney or Sri Lankan Coconut Sambol to their combos, just to add that little extra something. Am yet to try their South Indian staples like Idlis and Dosas which I am now eagerly looking forward to.

My girl introduced me to this place. Nicely located ( i pass that road a many times but never spotted ) . This is not your regular south indian place, its serves only keralite food (and yes 100% non-veg also ) with a small & compact menu. Food is good, small place with nice ambiance and decor . One big turn off is the portion they serve but will go back to try other items. 

Thanks to my girl

Happy Eating

Last evening, i took my partner to Ammini. What had caught my eye was their unique menu and as none of us had tried Kerala Cuisine, i was very eager to take him there.
Located a few steps from the Sarat Bose - Manoharpukur crossing, this is a fine dining arrangement in a small set up.
The seating capacity is not as i would have expected, but the decor is really nice.. very subtle, yet eye-catching, especially liked the tabletops. The menu card is also different, framed to showcase its limited offerings. The person waiting was well mannered, helped us with the "today's special" menu as well as some items on the regular menu and we ordered Mutton Olathede with appam and Unniappam. The waiting time was very less, some 10-15 min.Meanwhile, they set up our table with banana -leaf covered trays as the serving platter. All this sparked up our appetite a little more and then the food arrived. The mutton was delicious - tender pieces of meat in a spicy tangy gravy. The appam was soft and light.Not too heavy. Unniappam is a sweet dish.. sweet dumplings. Tasted nice, crispy on the outside, soft inside. I liked it. 
The total eating experience was very good here.. perfect ambiance, good food,proper set-up with the banana leaf and earthen glasses and little packets of supari as mouth-fresheners and fragrant wipes to clean your hands. Shows thoughtfulness which is highly appreciated.
The only thing i would like to mention is that though the dishes do not cost that much to raise a brow, the amount they serve is not sufficient for two.So, a little bit on the expensive side for a casual dining. Having said that, i would also mention that this is the only place in the town that offers an unique Kerelean Cuisine ( if i am wrong, please suggest some others). I am a big fan of south indian authentic dishes and by that i mean dishes apart from dosa -idly-utthapam. Ammini has lived upto every expectation i had in mind and is worth multiple repeat visits for me.

Ammini is situated in sarat bose road.It is a small restaurant offering authentic kerala cuisine.My brother had tried their food at the times food awards last year(2013) and he suggested this place yesterday for a sunday dinner.We reached the place and found the ambience to be neat,fuss free.We were served trays covered with a banana leaf as plates.What felt weird was that we were given folks and spoons(spoons i get for sambhar,but why a folk?south indian food tastes best with messy hand eating).
Our order: 
 2 plates of addai dosa,which was spicy lentil dosa served with sambhar, and 3 chutneys(white usual,spicy coconut and tamarind chutney).The dosa was nice but a little too spicy and it had a bitter after taste.
2 plates of appams which were light and tasty.(recommended)
1 plate idli
1 masala dosa
Kerala paratha with veg korma (amazing,much recommended)
2 filter coffees.(do try)
Surprisingly there were NO free extra service of the accompaniments like sambhar and chutney and that ticked my mood off for a while.
The food was good,but a little on the spicy side.
But the service was really good.What i liked was that they gave us fragnant wet wipes to clean our hands.And later supari packets as refreshments.
Our bill was around 900 and overall a decent time spent.

What a wonderful find, I must say. I have often passed this restaurant by car and never gave much thought about trying. And then few weeks back I did and was elated to find something so neat. We tried their appams with potato curry and chicken curry and I for one simply loved what was served on those banana leaves. The service was quick even though the place was crowded. I was sick and tired of ordering dosas whenever I am having south-indian dishes and this piece of Kerala felt good. We ended with mouth fresheners and went home happy. Definitely waiting to visit again.

Ammini is one of the cutest well done places in Kolkata. Though very small it has enough space for a personalized experience without making you feel too cramped. 
I ordered  had a plate of 2 different vadas which were very tasty. The chutneys they served were totally out of this world. 

For the main course we ordered thali which was yumm except for the rasam which was a but too sweet for my liking. The masala dosas were upto the mark. Then came the appams which were absolutely perfect along with the chicken gravy which was delicious. What disappointed me the most was the potato stew which i absolutely did not like at all. The lady who handles the joint was extremely courteous and did not charge for the stew. The staff too was courteous. No complaints from the service end.

OverallI would definitely visit them again!

I had heard good things about ammini before going and this small eatery did not disappoint. 

We called for the vegetarian thali, the appams with coconut stew, malabar paratha and the addai dosa. 

I did not like the addai dosa very much. However some others in my group loved it. 

The veg thali was good and the appams were wonderful. The dish of the day however was the malabar paratha. They melted in your mouth and were the best I have ever eaten. 

Overall it was a great meal and very reasonably priced as well.

For a person who does not really like South Indian food, it took some convincing by my friends to check out Ammini. Even before I ordered anything, the interior impressed me, with the urali and other brass pieces. The plates were lined with coconut leaf and the buttermilk, although rather thinned down, arrived nicely in an earthen glass. The Kerala Parotas were very authentic and the mutton was to die for! The waiters are nice and courteous, without being pushy and they make excellent recommendations to add to your order. They recommended we taste the Molaga Podi with our order of Mutton Olathede and Parota, and it was a brilliant mix! It tasted a great deal of wasabi and for a first-timer, it was a fabulous introduction to Kerala food. 

The tables are placed very closely, and while the place still does not feel very cramped, it does feel a little uncomfortable with people on the next table staring at our food and discussing among themselves if they should have the same meat dish that "that girl" is eating. 

I would ideally like a few more things in the menu - I mean, an Appam without the mutton stew is hardly the most authentic Kerala food. But yes, as of now, I am pleased with the food. My friend tried the Fish in Banana Leaf with some Appam, and was not terribly impressed with it, but I am certainly going back for the Mutton Olathede again.

I am really disappointed with Ammini.. After reading lots of rave reviews we me & my family decided to go there after watching a film at Priya cinema, when we went there at 9.30 pm it was totally empty and during our stay at it nobody else came either.. We ordered masala dosas , rasam vada and Idlis, traditional south indian items, foods came very very quickly and piping hot but after that all disappointing. one plate of dosa consists of 2 medium sized dosas, Dosas were not at all crispy, and the masala was absolutely tasteless and without salt, i dont know whether keralian dosas are supposed to be like this, soft, tasteless and without salt but we didnot like them at all and the samber with it was also not that tasty but the condiments like spicy onion chutny, ginger pickle were new and tasty. Rasam vadas consists of 2 vadas in rasam, though vadas were ok but the rasam was too hot and spicy.. idly was good but the samber with that was bad so idlis became dull also.. Though the food is very low priced but the quality is not good at all, maybe we ordered wrong items, maybe their non veg items are good but whatever we ate we are disappointed with that and never go there again...

This place is a nice change of pace from the standard south indian fair we are used to. I was really happy to get some great appams and a lovely thali which i have missed for years since returning from Bangalore. There are some interesting new items as well for those not familiar like the addai dosa, ulli chamandi and the kesari is excellent.
Good service, good food and very reasonable.

" Amini - Giving an Authentic taste of Kerala in Kolkata "
Even though Amini is a small place, its authentic Keralan feel in the city of Joy "Kolkata" was refreshing. We had ordered Upma, Idli and Appam. The service was surprisingly very quick and nice. It has been a long time since I have been to an authentic Keralan Restaurant in Kolkata and Amini totally satisifed my food experience. Before our food was served, the plates were lined with green Banana leaves which brought back my Trivandrum experience in Kerala a couple of years ago.  Being a pure vegetarian, I was wanting to see how were the dishes. When the Idli and Upma arrived ( Quantity of Upma was good ), both the dishes instantly melted in my mouth. They were truly lip smacking. The Idlis were  soft and crispy and the Sambar  was to die for.  To add to the great taste , we had ordered the White and  spicy Pink Chutney which added great flavour to our food. The Appam was crispy and was made well. Hoever, the best was reserved for the last as the Upma was fantastic. Added with spices, it exploded in my mouth giving a variety of  flavours. Adding to the Upma was the "Podi" ( GunPowder ) and the Ghee which left me drooling for more.  At last, the quintessential Butter Milk was well made and seemed to be the perfect finish to a mouth-watering food journey. 
The service was great and quick,the waiters are polite and friendly,. Even being an odd 20 seater, the ambience was peaceful. The prices of each dish are moderate and not expensive at all. In short, money well spent.
What was refreshing to see the mouth freshner sachets at the end with batelnuts to finish it up.
A thoroughly foodylicious experience. So here is my Food Quotient.

Ambience - 8/10.
Service      - 9/10
Food          - 9/10
Overall Food Quotient - 8.5/10.
PS : The only drawbacks are of the limited menu and the limited seats.
Kudos to Amini. Guys, please check out this place.. I assure you, your taste buds will be wanting more by the time you leave through the doors of Amini.

'Ammini  _ a bite of kerala'..... ya...its a fact..its a piece of kerala in our city of joy... Ammini serves south Indian delights with speciality..foods  are simply mouth watering....all the curries and chutnys are just too good...they are perfectly spicy and tasty... the word chatpata goes really good with the chutnys... i tried the dosa... it was really different than the ordinary dosas we get mostly in kolkata..it was different __ but on the good side...we orderd their daily special keralian veg thali..and it had rice, bhaji, sambar, rasam , another awesomely tasty pickle, papd,and last but not the least one curd with tomato and spices.. the totamo-curd was something i have never taste before, it was creamy-buttery and so yummm....i just loved it all...
The place is small but seating arrangement was descent; and the ambience is very peaceful and cozy.. its a nice little to go for lunch or diner with anybody u want to..
The amount of the foods are not really great for the very hungry visitors...and the price of foods may seem a bit high but the taste will defend that..the quality of food made me forget about it completely....
At last i must mention at the end of your meal don’t forget to have the unique flavored betel nuts from kerala!...those made my meal complete..i am thoroughly satisfied and gonna visit again to taste their non veg dishes soon....!

Tucked away neatly in the garage of an apartment is this lovely little place. The place is small, yet has enough leg-space unlike many new eateries of the city and has been done up pretty aesthetically. 
We ordered mutton olathede with idiappams, fried dumplings and buttermilk. The service was astonishingly quick. The plates were lined with banana leaf and that in itself earned a few brownie points from my side. The dumplings were good, nothing extraordinary, and the buttermilk was a notch above it. But then the mutton was juicy, succulent, tender and done perfectly! It reminded me of the mysore mutton of Tamarind to a certain extent but was not a complete rip-off. The spices were balanced to the T and the meat was literally falling off the bone. Aaah! Now that's what i call a real pleasure. 
The mouth freshner sachets that they give at the end of your meal carry forward their authenticity. Also, the prices were very moderate. 
So, hell yeah! would definitely visit this place again. If i have to point out any negatives, then it would be that its not too easy to locate. 
P.S. - Do check out the loo, because that too has a Keralan feel (don't know what i meant by that exactly, but whatever do check it out!).

“Ammini – South Indian Food With A Difference”

Want to visit a little Kerala in The City of Joy? Ammini at Monohan Pukur Road, near Sarat Bose Road area is the place to step in. A 22 seater restaurant driven by Ramani Menon serves authentic Kerala and coastal cuisine at honest prices.
It is a small cozy place with nicely done up ambience which gives you the Kerala feel. It has hues of brown and ochre elegantly understated to give the feel of Kerala. It has an open kitchen with a nice simple décor.

The menu is refreshingly original and offers enough to satisfy both vegetarians and meat lovers. Their menu is not very extensive but they do have specials every day. They serve food in banana leaf plates and earthen glasses which give their service a personalized touch. Their service is very courteous and reasonably quick. Their staff is friendly and polite. Their prices are worth paying for the delicious authentic Kerala food they serve.

The potato stew was a delicious preparation and was quite light. I loved it and highly recommend it. Appams with Kerala Kozhi Curry were very well cooked and tasted nice. The Kerala parathas were soft and fluffy though not the best in town.  The chicken roast and the dry spicy mutton were simply out of the world and tasted amazing. The cuisine is spicy but it also had a very distinct flavor which is good enough to tantalize the taste buds.

Amini overall is a refreshing change from the standard South Indian food found in Kolkata. I loved the food on offer and will definitely care to drop in here the next time I want to have authentic South Indian food.
 
P.S. After your meal don’t forget to have the unique Southey flavored betel nuts!

Ammini serves south Indian delights with speciality..foods  are simply mouth watering....all the curries and chutnys are just too good...they are perfectly spicy and tasty... the word chatpata goes really good with the chutnys... i tried the dosa... it was really different than the ordinary dosas we get mostly in kolkata..it was different __ but on the good side...we orderd their daily special keralian veg thali..and it had rice, bhaji, sambar, rasam , another awesomely tasty pickle, papd,and last but not the least one curd with tomato and spices.. the totamo-curd was something i have never taste before, it was creamy-buttery and so yummm....i just loved it all...
The place is small but seating arrangement was descent; and the ambience is very peaceful and cozy.. its a nice little to go for lunch or diner with anybody u want to..
The amount of the foods are not really great for the very hungry visitors...and the price of foods may seem a bit high but the taste will defend that..the quality of food made me forget about it completely....
At last i must mention at the end of your meal don’t forget to have the unique flavored betel nuts from kerala!...those made my meal complete..i am thoroughly satisfied and gonna visit again to taste their non veg dishes soon....!

Tucked away neatly in the garage of an apartment is this lovely little place. The place is small, yet has enough leg-space unlike many new eateries of the city and has been done up pretty aesthetically. 
We ordered mutton olathede with idiappams, fried dumplings and buttermilk. The service was astonishingly quick. The plates were lined with banana leaf and that in itself earned a few brownie points from my side. The dumplings were good, nothing extraordinary, and the buttermilk was a notch above it. But then the mutton was juicy, succulent, tender and done perfectly! It reminded me of the mysore mutton of Tamarind to a certain extent but was not a complete rip-off. The spices were balanced to the T and the meat was literally falling off the bone. Aaah! Now that's what i call a real pleasure. 
The mouth freshner sachets that they give at the end of your meal carry forward their authenticity. Also, the prices were very moderate. 
So, hell yeah! would definitely visit this place again. If i have to point out any negatives, then it would be that its not too easy to locate. 
P.S. - Do check out the loo, because that too has a Keralan feel (don't know what i meant by that exactly, but whatever do check it out!).

“Ammini – South Indian Food With A Difference”

Want to visit a little Kerala in The City of Joy? Ammini at Monohan Pukur Road, near Sarat Bose Road area is the place to step in. A 22 seater restaurant driven by Ramani Menon serves authentic Kerala and coastal cuisine at honest prices.
It is a small cozy place with nicely done up ambience which gives you the Kerala feel. It has hues of brown and ochre elegantly understated to give the feel of Kerala. It has an open kitchen with a nice simple décor.

The menu is refreshingly original and offers enough to satisfy both vegetarians and meat lovers. Their menu is not very extensive but they do have specials every day. They serve food in banana leaf plates and earthen glasses which give their service a personalized touch. Their service is very courteous and reasonably quick. Their staff is friendly and polite. Their prices are worth paying for the delicious authentic Kerala food they serve.

The potato stew was a delicious preparation and was quite light. I loved it and highly recommend it. Appams with Kerala Kozhi Curry were very well cooked and tasted nice. The Kerala parathas were soft and fluffy though not the best in town.  The chicken roast and the dry spicy mutton were simply out of the world and tasted amazing. The cuisine is spicy but it also had a very distinct flavor which is good enough to tantalize the taste buds.

Amini overall is a refreshing change from the standard South Indian food found in Kolkata. I loved the food on offer and will definitely care to drop in here the next time I want to have authentic South Indian food.
 
P.S. After your meal don’t forget to have the unique Southey flavored betel nuts!

To night me n my cousin tried  this place out for dinner as he found very good reviews in Zomato. First the place looked pretty decent and people are comfortable. It was absolute empty but order of mutton n rice, and iddiapams with veg korma along with fried dumplings took 20 mins or more (though we were informed that steam rice will take 15 mins to serve)..
Now the shock came with portion size.. well the rice was a actually kind of 15 gms and charged 50 + taxes, mutton was 210 + taxes but it was just two pieces(physically it was cut to 4 pieces to make it look filling). Me being veggie all i can say i had to order 190  + taxes iddiapams twice ...and after a hour while iam typing this thing now..well I feel like eating sumthing cuz my hunger is coming back.. also almost forgot.. dumplings were 5 in number and trust me you can hold all of them on your one palm.
Taste of veggie stuffs was ok---stew was less than ok but korma is decent.Cousin said the mutton tasted amazing but he was hungry and ordering another portion will still not be filling and as it will hit the wallet (cuz by that time i ordered my items once more) so he decided to go back n eat at home ..so we paid Rs.830/- and moved out. 

Bottom line: They forgot that people go out to eat to fulfill their hunger ( Ex-in star categories restaurants you are charged at star ratings par but portion sizes are wholesome n more). If you play tricks with portion size then you are actually making them feel cheated (cuz u want them to order more as he cant leave the place while he/she is still hungry). ..N if you cheat your customers well they will never come back again.

It is a tiny place as most of the reviews suggest, but the seating is not cramped and quite snazzy. The kitchen is partly visible so you can have a look at you food being cooked. The food is refreshingly different and thoroughly enjoyable. My friend urged me to try the potato stew. Though I was skeptical at first because I was in no mood to have vegetarian food. To top it off I expected something very bland. To my surprise, it was a delicious preparation. It wasn't bland at all and yet it was quite light. I strongly recommend it.

I also tried mutton and chicken preparations. The chicken tasted better. Appams were really good. It was the first time I had iddiyappam. Service is very courteous and reasonably quick. The prices are a little on the higher end but nothing worth paying for once in a while.

Ammini is little Kerala in Kolkata heartland!! A small cozy place with about 20 covers, there are usually full during lunch hours. My vists have been more than couple of times and my experience has been enhanced each time.. First - Let's come to  the Ambiance - the place is nicely done up with knick knacks which gives you the Kerala feel.The place is clean and service & behaviour of the staff is really good. Coming to Food:- The menu is not very extensive but they do have specials everyday. Upon my first visit, I tried the combination of Appams with Kerala Kozhi Curry(chicken curry) and it turned out very well. The Kozhi Curry was rightly spiced and the appams were fluffy and light! On 2nd occasion, Mutton Olathede(Dry  Spicy Mutton preparation) with appams were really an experience! On the 3rd Occasion, my friend and I ordered for Appams & Potato Stew and Malabar Paratha with Kozhi Curry tasted awesome! I am yet to try the fish preparation but I am sure it will not be a letdown.. Their Dosa is also good and crispy served with Sambhar and other condiments.. One must not leave the place without tasting the Mallu Suji Halwa prepared with pure ghee and flavoured with a hint of camphor & cardamom and packed with raisins..After a hearty meal while leaving do not forget to try the unique southy flavoured betalnuts!

This nice, little cosy restaurant is definitely worth a visit if food is all you care about. While it may not serve a diverse menu, the morceau of Kerala that you get to bite here is a pleasant, soulful bite indeed. What we ordered were Mutton Stew and Fish in Banana Leaves with Appams followed by Kesari which is suji halwa in some form. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. This is a place that calls for several visits, I am sure.

This is very small eatery, seats about 15 people at a time, large groups will have trouble finding seating.
It has a very limited menu. Apart from some set meals, they also have kerala style mutton and chicken curries, idli, dosa, appams, fried dumplings and the likes. We wanted to taste the fish wrapped in banana leaves but it was not available. The other items were nice, though the sambar was a quite bland and the appams were too thick in the middle, almost like bread. 
There's not much else to say about this place. A bigger menu will be welcome since if you eat here a couple of times you will have already tasted everything on the menu and it could get boring.

I have been there twice. My friend Anwesha intoduced this place to me. One thing I must admit, the 'mutton olathede' is one of the best preparation of mutton i've ever tasted. It's my second favourite after 'The Golbari Mutton Kasha'. Although the 'Appams' with which it's generally served contains a slight smell of coconut oil which disturbed my taste buds being a bengali. Another dish i've tried is some fried dumplings. I don't remembar the original name of the dish but it's the item which I want to order every time i be there. Although food costs are a little bit higher but the food taste will take over your mind after each & every bite.
The place is very small but ambience is very peaceful. You can enjoy a good romantic lunch or dinner with your partner here. 
Now lets come to the service. Service is a bit slow but in overall not bad. When i visited for the first time, Anwesha & I shared just one dish but they took care of us pretty well. Except of very small order we spent a lot of time there.
Overall it's a good place to be & it's a revoution for those who think that South Indian food means idly & dhosa only.

been there last weekend with my girlfriend. She introduced me to this place having the catchline ' a bite of kerala'. And to speak the truth, i was a bit bamboozled in my mind to eat at a place like ammini as I did not held south indian cuisines in very high regard excepting a few like dhosas and lentil with curry leaves etc. But to all people out there in and out of the virtual walls of Zomato, go take a sprint to this place if you want your taste buds to be rocked by kerala. The place is small in dimensions but the food they provide is simply the reverse. I started with paniyarappams, the dumplings as they say. to dip in the sambar and rasam that comes along with, it feels like listening to beethovens 5th, and not to mention the chutney that is prepared by garlic,chilli and tomato paste. Next we had the mutton olathede. O my sweet god of taste buds, that felt like being in a rock concert with the stage being manhandled by the iron maiden. Served with appams, these sweet little things are just the perfect partners in romance with the spicy dry mutton olathede.
Thereafter my opinion about south indian food has changed. Requesting all out there to grab a seat at the earliest on a Sunday lunch, as the place is small ( 5-6 tables as far as I remember) and the rush is increasing exponentially now a days. And do try the kerala kozhi currz. I missed out on that one but saw people quote about that being a winner too. 
RUCHIKARAM..

I went there last weekend and the food was so so good..... very authentic kerela food..... and the aula fish curry was just a delight.

Disclaimer: Although I have nothing very bad to say about the food, this review is based on two separate incidents, where the service left a lot to be desired. Being one of the places that is very close to a friend's house, I went there on a lazy afternoon, and the place was quite empty. We ordered a chicken curry with appams, and as they had a very limited menu, one friend ordered something veg... probably a stew of sort ... I don't really remember. 

Our food came after about 40 minutes, which was Waaaaaay too much time for any joint which is nearly empty. This was repeated on another day where we had just ordered two things from the menu.

Although the food tasted good, by the time they had come to our table they were mostly warm and not piping hot. We were quite disappointed also by the portion size. The chicken was a miniscule portion, and not enough for one appam, let alone two. 

I do like the place, and would urge the proprietors to have more meal choices as well as more attentive service.

One of my repeat visits on 8th March 2013. What I experienced was not a very good sign.

1. Service took rather long.

2. They served the starter along with the main course. Their reasoning was it was a side dish... maybe they are right. The dish was the Chicken Kozhi. Was slightly undercooked I felt. Last time it was better done.

3. We ordered the usual... Mutton Olathede with appams. The mutton pieces were far better than before (attributed to a change in the distributor). The dish itself wasn't too well done. I am used to it being drier and more cooked. What was served was more damper, and semi boiled. It wasn't really that bad.

4. What disappointed were the appams. They were soft and undercooked on the uncooked side and almost half burnt outside. No way I would be happy with that. And I love appams.

5. They were out of Thums Up... not good in my books :)

6. My friend also had the thali and quite liked it. I didnt taste any of it.

7. Service as mentioned was slow. In addition, they took ages after we asked for the check and then told us to do it across the counter!

My second visit to this place, and my experience was better than the first. We got seating space immediately on Sunday (09.12.2012) afternoon. My chair was right next to the entry door and it would get in the way of the door and I would get a gust of breeze every time the door opened.

One thing I noticed (second time) is the lady who runs the place attends to certain customers personally. I am not sure whether I like this.

We tried the chicken roast which was a special for the day. Nice and spicy. I wish there was more chicken and less bones. One does not appreciate being served a piece of neck!

We then had the Mutton Olathede with appams. Good serving and well made. Less dry spicy than last time and went very well. I was surprised to find chicken bits in it :) The server very nicely served me some extra. The appams were slightly underdone (especially the extra one). Also, the prices for extra appams  (and parathas) is kind of over the top.

Overall a very satisfying meal. Thank you.



----- 15 Oct, 2012 -----

We visited Ammini some months back. After a long wait (they had just opened and everyone seated and just begun their meals), we got a place to sit. Interiors were nice but too crowded. Service was nothing to write home about. Food was reasonably tasty.

I recall the dry mutton fry with appams that I had ordered. Well made, but I got served almost all bones initially and had to ask for a change, which made it much better ( I think restaurants need to be a little more careful about this). I thought there was too much red chilli powder or something else, as when I tried to suck in the marrow from a bone, the spiciness really irritated my throat. The fish curry was decent.

I recall the coffee being very substandard.

Food

They make an awesome Mutton Olathede. The prawn curry (daily special) was also spicy and tasty. The appams are great. Idiappams though are just OK.

Hands down the service, the decor, the presentation and most importantly the food is just Excellent. Having a small seating area the guests are mostly a class apart. As it seems they are all foodies and savors good cuisine. Presentation is immaculate followed by an authentic taste of Kerala cuisine. 
Appams with Avial for the vegetarians and Kerala Kozy Curry or Mutton dish is a must for all. 
Kudos to who ever is running the place and request to keep up with the quality of food and service given as on date. 
p.s: Staff is extremely cordial and well behaved.

The attention to detail and perfectionist approach to everything is evident, even before the first incredible bite, in the way the food is served. The small sitting space seems to tell the customer, "we can handle only so many of you, but we will treat each of you like Masterchef judges sampling our fare". 

Some people may find the menu overpriced and slightly spartan; but considering the recent birth of the restaurant, the quality of the food and the niche cuisine it celebrates, this is indeed an absolute must-visit.

Usually visit this place on my way home, take a parcel, get intoxcated by the smells of the live kitchen. have been to Ammini 3 times already. and wish i cud eat here every day. Kerela food is a little uncommom to the bengal but sunday lunch they have house full and even waiting. 

food is served on plates lined with banana leaves and the lady who runs the place is very warm and generous. the dry lamb preparation they make is soft tender and juicy. i happened to order a curry meen (banana wrapped fish ) the other day and ghee bhat, and the aromats used were beautiful every ingredient respecting each other and complimenting each other. the apams are fresh and the fish curry that is served is finger licking good. 

although they have a very small menu but everything they make is with a lot of love and care. 

hope to have many more meals here.

This place is for real enthusiasts of quality food from the land of the Gods. Does not boast of an extensive menu, but every dish on the menu is perfectly prepared. The Addai Dosa, Paniyarappams and Rasam Vadas are to die for! If you are looking for authentic south Indian filter coffee, you'll love the coffee here. Service is impeccable as there is someone always ready to attend to you.
Many more visits to come...

The attention to detail and perfectionist approach to everything is evident, even before the first incredible bite, in the way the food is served. The small sitting space seems to tell the customer, "we can handle only so many of you, but we will treat each of you like Masterchef judges sampling our fare". 

Some people may find the menu overpriced and slightly spartan; but considering the recent birth of the restaurant, the quality of the food and the niche cuisine it celebrates, this is indeed an absolute must-visit.

Usually visit this place on my way home, take a parcel, get intoxcated by the smells of the live kitchen. have been to Ammini 3 times already. and wish i cud eat here every day. Kerela food is a little uncommom to the bengal but sunday lunch they have house full and even waiting. 

food is served on plates lined with banana leaves and the lady who runs the place is very warm and generous. the dry lamb preparation they make is soft tender and juicy. i happened to order a curry meen (banana wrapped fish ) the other day and ghee bhat, and the aromats used were beautiful every ingredient respecting each other and complimenting each other. the apams are fresh and the fish curry that is served is finger licking good. 

although they have a very small menu but everything they make is with a lot of love and care. 

hope to have many more meals here.

An overcast rainy afternoon turned into the perfect lunch-out with Mum and Dad. Being partial South-Indian we really crave good South-Indian food, and especially Keralite cuisine which is such a rarity in Kolkata. Ammini was a prayer answered. 

We loved the Appams, Idiappams, Kozhi Curry and Mutton Olathede. The Fish in Banana Leaf was a special today, not a regular menu item, and it was quite a treat. Knowing the authentic flavors of South-Indian cuisine we were very pleased with what we were served and will definitely be coming back for more. It's a cozy set up with interesting decor though the service could have been quicker, or maybe we felt so coz we were too hungry! :)

I would recommend Ammini to all you guys looking for yummy Keralite cuisine. It would be great if they added more items to their menu though, more reasons for the tummy to be happy!

Ammini truly is God sent. The food is here is excellent and it is always a pleasure dinning at this restaurant. Though the menu for vegetarians is extremely limited but the few items that are there are fantastic. They do have some items for vegetarians which are not on the menu but if you ask the staff will tell you what is the extra available that day. The chutneys  especially the ginger and the onion ones are yumm. Even though it is a relatively small place,it is done up very tastefully and   is  very welcoming.

Ammini is a God send. Everything about is perfect - the classical and authentic menu. No pandering to local tastes - but just the way the dishes are supposed to be ; the limited menu of 10 items which represent the most popular Kerala dishes ; the daily special - which is always an interesting experience ; the highly personalized advice by the lady who runs the place ; the sheer lightness of the appams - genuinely you just can't stop at 1 ;  the spicy mutton stew - everything is perfect. 
I have spent many years working in the Southern states and now sorely miss the authentic cuisines & this is a boon. 
I was also lucky to have their special Kerala New Year feast - which had the most amazing textures and tastes - vegetables with pineapples, red-banana fritters sweetened with jaggery & the unforgettable 'mung dal payasam'. For a pure veg meal - it was outstanding. 

I recommend this place to every serious foodie - as long as you expect authentic cuisine & are not looking for innovations.

For excellent Kerala cuisine, this is the place to go to. Simple, tastefully done decor creates a lovely ambiance. An open kitchen, even though this is not a very large restaurant, adds to the charm. Service is hospitable, and quick. 

The appams and dosa were exactly as they should be - tasty and light, and the stew took me right back home... . The simple, delicious meal, with each dish distinct in its taste, topped off with filter coffee was a treat!
