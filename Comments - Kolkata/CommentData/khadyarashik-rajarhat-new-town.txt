Amazing home cooked food.... We ordered 14 Fish Thalis on saturday. All the items were fresh, light and delicious. The Rice was of good quality, Dal was thick, Fry was nice, vegetable was delicious....never had such soyabean curry earlier,  fish was very tender fre,sh and sweet.  Chutny was also nice.
The packaging, quantity, delivery & quality was  perfect !!    

Kudos to the Khadyarashik team !! Highly recommended.

Very rarely I review a restaurant in zomato but this Tym I m making an exception..the reason being exceptional food I got from this newly opened home based food venture...I had ordered pure veg thalis for my housewarming puja from khadyarashik....they did a fantastic job with the quality of food, affordable pricing, customization options and to my surprise on time delivery....I would highly recommend this venture for folks planning to organize house parties, small get together, office treats or even for no cooking weekends....a good option for ppl in rajarhat, Newtown area.
Kudos to owner priyanka.

I ordered 28 full plats from Khadyarashik. I had no prior experience dealing with them. Basically the order was for office(ERICSSON,DLF2) lunch party. It had been told that the food would be delivered by 1 to 1.30PM but unfortunately  it came 2.45PM. They are totally unprofessional in term of deliveryman. Food is also not as expected. Please don't order ever in chunk or bulk from them.

Awesome food with variety on offer from Khadyarashik.. very happy with the quality as well as quantity of the food so far... Khadyarashik is the place for the foodies as the name suggests to have healthy authentic Bangali food cooked in less oil.
