Ambience :  A small and cozy place, pretty well decor,neatly done. 

Food : For main course, We ordered a gravy chilly chicken and egg chicken fried rice, . The fried rice was of that  regular and normal taste, a little non - spicy as i prefer. The rice was perfectly cooked. But the quantity of egg and chicken in the rice was less. 
Coming to the chicken preparation, it was really really tender and soft and perfectly spiced up from within. The platter offered 8 pieces which were quite big in size and sufficient for us. The gravy was rich in spices which complimented the rice pretty well. 

Service : They took the order and  returned with food in 10 -15 mins.   So for service, i would say was okay-ish. 

Also, its a very very pocket-friendly place. So would like to visit it again.

A small air conditioned restaurant having 5-6tables but the food is really yummy and tasty compared to the price which is not at all high and quite affordable. The quantity is fair too. Staffs are friendly. The bill is tax free but at the end they will ask for some tips which is quite normal.
And last but not the least the decor is mesmerizing.

The most awkward part is the information that is given by zomato is totally incorrect as this small little excellent food joint does have seating and also very accepts cards so sumwhere sumthing needs to be corrected, this place is new but has excellent Chinese and yummylious Indian kebabs ... Great place for family and friends to g n eat and by the way the combo meals are just worth every rupee payed , minor things are required to be done rest all ok ,all the best guys ... By the way the extremely pocket friendly combo meals are a total delight to eat and the best part is for the biryani lover's in the Indian or u can call it biryani combo u get a full plate of biryani not just a portion .....
