It’s a nice little setup with okay-ish food.

Staff and management are pleasantly welcoming and polite. Ambience is quite nice. But the food is slightly overpriced for being a vegetarian setup.

The Hazra outlet is slightly tough to spot unless you’re locating it via Zomato Directions. 

Overall, I would rate it a bit more than 3.5 out of 5. But not 4 out of 5.

It’s a small place in Hazra , and pretty easy to miss. They have a very attractive menu. We ordered coffee , Americano, iced tea and apple chamomile tea. 
For food we had the goat cheese tarts. They were really good. The goat cheese was soft and melted in your mouth. It was served with a tomato jam with chunks of tomato in it. A highly recommended dish. Next we ordered the mushroom crostini. It was marvellous and was served on bite sized slices of baguette. 
For dessert we had the dark chocolate mousse. It was divine. The mousse was light and airy , with a ganache covering it. It was served with a chocolate sorbet that balanced the bitterness of the mousse all too well. Atop the dish was a chocolate biscuit. 
The prices are bit on the higher side. But the food and ambience and the staff are very good.

Italian food is known for being succulent and packed with flavor. To die for doesn't disappoint in terms of either what it does lack is that oomph factor, which doesn't make it worth a second visit. The eggplant fettuccini and their cheese cake deserve a special mention in a crowd of spinach soup, mushroom crostini, goat cheese tart, pumpkin ravioli and a couple of other dishes -- I have had way better than what was served here. The price-to-quantity ratio is a big let down. Had they packed a punch in terms of flavor like Serafina or maybe The Corner Courtyard, I would have ranked them better.

I was sceptical about this place at first as it's a pure vegetarian restaurant but now i feel this place does the best Italian fare (sans pizza) in the city. Everything that we ordered for (and we ordered 60% of the menu) was very good but the eggplant fettuccine and pumpkin ravioli deserve a special mention as they were outstanding. Kudos.

In the myriad by-lanes of Kolkata there lies a small nondescript eatery which serves food to die for and thus is aptly named To Die For. Situated on Manoharpukur Road Behind Hazra Road this small wonder serves lovely Italian dishes and awesome dessert choices. While the portions are pretty small for the price charged the food quality and taste is pretty good. 

We had Arancini, goat cheese tarts, Asparagus risotto and to die for dessert Dark chocolate with white chocolate sorbet. Price pinch is around Rs. 300/- per dish

Tucked away in a quaint south Kolkata neighbourhood this food joint was a great discovery for a foodie like me. The ambiance is warm, cozy and inviting. However the highlight of this joint is the food, my favourite dish being the pumpkin ravioli and mushroom linguini. I've frequented this restaurant several times and never been disappointed. The desserts are delicious too! I'd highly recommend the pannacotta with chilli and orange drizzle.

Authentic Italian. Could do with a more comprehensive menu. Great service. Some items were very inconsistent though. And portion size is very small, not enough for one person, especially compared to the high prices.
Average cost isn't 1000 for two, I'd say it'll be closer to 1500 or more for a proper meal.
They recommend pumpkin ravioli, but it was very bland.
There mushroom spaghetti with truffle oil is amazing.
The apple cake and Panna Cotta are a must try.
The coffees are good, but my ice tea was horrible.
The service is a definite highlight, they're courteous, and helpful, but not overbearing.

Located on a bylane on the Manoharpukur Road in Hazra, To Die For, can easily be missed even though it has a big glass window display. That's because the interiors are dark shades of grey and not bright and vibrant as the name might suggest. Decorated in classic, subtle silhouettes, this place definitely does not look as fancy as the dishes on its menu. We had dropped by in the evening to get a cup of coffee and to sample one of the desserts that this place is famous for. After being seated we were handed the coffee and the food menu, but had to ask for the dessert menu. This place serves fancy Italian dishes done up in a MasterCheffy fashion which is really exciting to see in your regular next-door restaurant which is basically a garage converted into a sit down place. Kolkata is coming up with many such hidden gems!
We ordered two coffees, small, and a Pannacota with Orange and Chilli sauce. The dessert came first, a lovely set Pannacota, with the trademark wobble that it should have. The coffees came with a small cookie each. We were wondering whether to sample a pasta but I was really looking for a non vegetarian option. I will come back later for that when I'm on the mood for some veggies! We had a word with one of the chefs who seemed very enthusiastic about the menu selection and explained a few of the dishes very well to us.
The prices are pretty steep, considering each dish is designed to be enough for just one person. Also taking into account the pack of meat options, the process to seem to be a big sized pinch on your pocket.
Our waiter also seemed to not be too fluent in the menu offerings, we had specially asked for small coffees but got billed for regular ones. Never the less, the experience was pleasant as were the look and feel of dishes that were being served up on the tables around us. Do visit if you are in the mood for some fancy, good looking Italian food!

Paid a visit with my wife. I totally agree with zomato that this place is truly a hidden gem of kolkata.

We tried the beetroot salad and caprese salad. Both were perfect on flavours.

The sauteed asparagus for me was the highlight. Their risotto and spagetti tasted truly italian!!

My wife had the white choclate rasberry in dessert and i had a dark roasted cappuccino !! Both were near perfection !! Kudos to the restaurant. 

I think the quaint place, its sitting arrangement and hospitable staff contribute immensely to the experience. 

What i loved the most was the involvement of its owner who is truly passionate about food and what he is serving. 

Kolkata really needs more of such places !!

This place is hyped. 

Menu options - Very limited menu - only 1 page that also is laminated gives a cheap feel .  They say its vegetarian ( reason why we went) but they also serve egg which was a big turn off. 


Ambience - The ambience gives a feel of a college hang out place and is just average. Rather below average - wouldn't have gone if I zonato had captured the actual pics. 
Doesn't give a good dining feel. But the problem is the costs and prices do not simply match the offering. 

Cost - Prices are way too high compared to the location / decor / service and the food. the open kitchen gives a casual look and doesn't really match up with the high prices. 

The portions are small and taste was very average. 

Never going again

This place was bookmarked since long and I'm glad I decided to try it out for my birthday lunch with my friends. It's a small place In one of the lanes of hazra road. They serve fresh lemon water which is very refreshing. I loved the appetisers more than the mains. We ordered goat cheese tarts,sautéed asparagus,tomato bruschetta. All were superb. For mains my favourite was the pumpkin ravioli , it was a surprise that it was so delicious. The fettuccine and spaghetti was okay. I heard. A lot about the deserts being amazing here but I wasn't too excited about it after trying the dark chocolate mousse I've had much better ones. Overall a good lunch and with good food. The decor is minimal so nothing to say about the ambience of the place.

Fantastic experience. Very personal with excellent quality food. International standard taste and presentation. The first time we found out about this place was probably 2-2.5 months back and we have been there 4 times already! Our favourite has to be Cacio & pepe- a very simple spaghetti done in cheese and pink pepper- the best comfort food! And the desert is their version of chocolate moose. This place definitely holds true to its name! Congratulations to the talented young owner, we are looking forward to some more of your scrumptious creations.

Dates with yourself is often a pampering thing and a little bit of it never hurts anyone. To Die For is one such place where you can pamper yourself without any guilt and no staring at you will make you embarrassed as the place is hardly doted by any. Located in the bylanes of Hazra near Paramount Nursing Home, this place is quaint and the decor is minimalistic, something that suited my taste.
I had come here one day after my classes to devour their gorgeous desserts and it was really one of a kind experience. Staffs were very courteous and helpful. The whole experience was very pleasant and I will definitely recommend this place. What I tried - 
Pannacotta - This was the basic white vanilla pannacotta. Orange and Chilli sauce was drizzled on top with a little bit of pepper. The spicy twist to this sweet beauty was a dramatic concoction of elements and very unique in its kind. 
Baked Chocolate Tart - Gosh! This was one of the best tarts I have had in a while. It tasted so good. The Tart was warm and inside it was all gooey. Served with raspberry sorbet and brownie crumbles, I loved it absolutely. The sides served along and the main dessert itself competed with each other in terms of taste, presentation and quality. A must try! 
This place is vegetarian otherwise. Didn't try any of those items. I hope that they are as good as their desserts. Desserts are brilliant (although a bit pricey but yes, quality matters) and I am definitely going to come back here again for the sake of their desserts only! Happy Dining! :)

Tucked away in a lane in Hazra, To Die For is a nice find for vegetarians and dessert lovers with a small menu comprising mostly of Italian dishes and desserts that are kinda expensive given this is a new and badly located place. We ordered:

-Goat Cheese Tarts (exactly what the name suggests, they're tart shells filled with goat cheese and nothing else and so could use a lot more flavor)

-Pumpkin Ravioli (a really interesting and flavorful peanut, butter and caper sauce with fresh pumpkin and cheese stuffed pasta)

-Spaghetti Cacio O Pepe (basically just pasta in white sauce which a fancier name)

-Panna Cotta (with an orange and chili sauce it's a nice variation on a classic dessert)

-Chocolate Mousse (wonderfully plated with a bunch of different elements like a chocolate soil and blueberry sauce, great for your insta)

There's not much of an ambiance to speak of as it's a small one room establishment with barely any decor to speak of and Beatles put on the sound system only when a customer walks in. There's a lot of staff milling about but it was sometimes hard to get their attention though the service was quick once we ordered. 1600 rs for the above items and a limited menu makes this place difficult to visit again though I enjoyed this visit.

This restaurant is a small establishment in Hazra and one's first opinion by the looks outside would not be good. But as they say, looks can be deceiving and this restaurant proved just that to me. Rather than having a number of items on the menu which are cooked mediocre, this restaurant has a limited number of dishes that are cooked excellent, and that's what I like about this place.
Coming to the food, the Caprese Salad, Sauteed Asparagus, Lasagna and Pumpkin Ravioli were excellent. I could not find a single fault in any of these dishes, and I am not one who is easily content with his food. However, there needs to be working on the Jalapenos in the Cheese and Jalapeno Risotto. The rice is cooked well but those big chunks of Jalapenos in it need some working. Now the desserts. The two desserts I tried were the Dark Chocolate Mousse with Poached Pears and the Lemon Tart with Blood Orange Sorbet. Both these desserts were great, however, the sorbet melted very quickly, so that needs working if its possible.
Overall, I was very surprised with the food and it was something that I was not expecting. I would give this place a double thumbs ups and if you have not visited it yet, then you must.

Been here just two times. A small place in a shady lane of hazra. But the food and the service is amazing. I've tried their cheese jalapeño risotto, lasagne, cream brûlée, panacotta and a chocolate based dessert which has raspberry sorbet with it. 
Though they could serve more variety of dishes. 
Must visit! Aptly named!
Visited again , tried their asparagus and blue cheese risotto, spinach and ricotta ravioli, raspberry And white chocolate dessert, dark chocolate mousse and cheese cake with blue berry sorbet. Their house made iced tea is refreshing

So heard a lot about this place and since both me and my wife are a bit health conscious, we decided to visit the place for lunch to have a healthy bite. Much to our expectation, the staff (Anthony) was really really snooty and snobbish. The restaurant was empty and not a soul was to be found. Unfortunately I could not find parking and dropped my wife at the entrance who then went inside and requested Anthony if there is any space allotted for the restaurant for parking. Sitting inside the restaurant and refusing to budge an inch, he said " look for the parking yourself, we are not responsible for it ". My wife was shocked and said that this is not the treatment expected and when she told her hat she would complain, this is was the answer from Anthony - "that should not be a problem, pls go ahead". 
I have already spread the word in my circle about Anthony's behaviour and would certainly never go there nor would recommend this place to anyone. I hope that action is taken against this guy Anthony as the reputation of the owner and his/her brand is at stake. Such people are not only responsible for business loss but also ensure that no one comes again. 
I would certainly like to have a word with the owner and express my concerns. 
Shocking !!!!!

We are normally averse to vegetarian food unless its south indian, but decided to try this place anyhow. 
There is a subtle minimal vibe to the place which screams out 'serious dining'. There is an open kitchen where the young head chef was cooking,cleaning and coordinating. 
We ordered arrancini, which was risotto wrapped in a fried ball. Great flavour , but a little to much tomato I felt , since the accompanying sauce was also tomato based. For mains we had a pumpkin ravioli which was fantastic. The pasta was light with a perfect amount of filling. The sauce was beautifully balanced and the addition of laterally chopped almonds was a masterpiece.
Also had the linguini tossed in truffle oil with mushrooms. It was bland, rich,oily, yet very subtle. EXACTLY how i like it. Finished up with the chocolate mousse, which was almost perfect. 
This place is like one of the serious home owned Tuscan restaurants, where the chefs take great care and pride in what they make. 
kudos & SKY's the limit !!

Once you enter the place looks dead and you won't expect much from the place 

We ordered beetroot salad and quinoa salad both were excellent . The eggs on the salad was the best eggs I've ever had

For mains we called for a mushroom risotto and fettuccine pasta and both were excellent. The pasta was home made something which no other place in kolkata serves and once you have the first bite you can say.

For deserts ordered shooting star( chocolate mouse with mango curd and biscuit crumble ) it was not very sweet and was excellent.

I would have rated this place 5/5 but I am not Coz 
1) place looks dead
2) no music
3) crazily expensive 1200 per head

But food wise it's excellent !!!

Bottom line / sweet and sound ! Neat lines of the interiors , limited yet exciting food menu, desserts can be surely made broader in their variety and taste ratings 

Presentation : minimalistic food layout , white washed interiors with an open kitchen in view where you would assume the cooking would happen but they have a third layer !

Food ; tried creme brûlée and that was deceiving and tasting like shrikand literally, requested the team to mention the ingredients atleast so people know what they are getting into, literally 😉
Mushroom pasta was fab! Limited range of salads and yes! The potions are pretty small, say for like one and a half men ;p

Service : well served and suggested

This place made my kolkata trip complete. We went there on the last night of my trip for early dinner. Its a small place with limited tables. The owner is really polite and hard working. He takes the order himself and makes the food himself. We had ordered mushrooms risotto,penne,lasagne. All the three dishes were just amazing. I really liked the way they were cooked and served. Then for desserts we ordered shooting star and dark chocolate mousse. They were presented beautifully. I still have the picture in mind. Kolkata's most recommended place it is.

Mediocre food at high price
Our plan was to go to Bon Apetit, but as it was closed for orders, we were looking for nearby places in Zomato, and ended up here. It looked a nice little place from the outside. We noticed that the prices were a tad higher than what we would have liked, but still went on with our orders as the chef seemed friendly and our food was being prepared in front of us. Alas, everything else was disappointing. The muffin used in the item "The Island" was not fresh at all (read stale). We ordered a couple of other desserts which looked classy, tasted okay, but were basically 300 rupees worth of cream. And I saved the ultimate disaster for the last. The name is "Rosemary potato". Fancy names aside, it is just a sliced baked potato with scanty cheese topping, and this thing costs around 200 bucks including "all taxes". Disappointing to say the least. Won't be visiting this place ever again.

Situated in the by lanes of Hazra, a simple yet elegant restaurant where the food and desserts are "to die for". The Italian food on offer is sumptuous, pleasing to the palette and authentic. The interiors are basic, however, it creates a warm ambience and servers are friendly. The superstar is the Italian fare on offer. First up, the starters like arancini served with tomato basil sauce are fantastic. The linguini dish was outstanding with deep flavours of truffle, mushrooms and truffle oil (we ordered a repeat of it). The mushroom risotto too was heavenly. The penne arabiatta was lovely too. We ordered the dark chocolate mousse for dessert which was decadent and looked fantastic. The ricotta and fig tart was decent. The negatives for me were non availability of card payment ( maybe a coincidence), desserts like the famed panna cota not being available and would recommend adding a few more items to the menu. Overall, a positive experience with delicious food and good service. Good food to live for!!

This place was a discovery....a quaint little place which I just walked into thinking it was a cafe and being early evening I'd have a cup of coffee with some savouries. They said yes to the coffee but unfortunately they didn't have any light snacks items. In fact when I perused the menu I was in for a shock, for the food items named there were more suited to a fine dining place!!! So one shouldn't be taken in by the casual look of the place the food named in the menu is anything but casual. The decor is simple and elegant as well as quirky, I admired how they put up broken plates as wall decor!! Unfortunately the evening I walked in to the cafe they had no desserts on display, as the young chef cum owner informed me that their refrigerant wasn't working. So I wasn't able to view any desserts! Also they didn't have any light snacks for that time of evening, so I resigned myself to having just the coffee. But the owner cum chef was gracious enough to make me a savoury mushroom crepe even though it wasn't on the menu. It didn't take too long either in spite of making it fully fresh....voila...it was on the table... amazing presentation and delicious. Loved it. This is what will put this place a step ahead of the herd!! Hat's off to the chef and good luck . I definitely recommend this place and will surely go back to taste their regular items on the menu. Especially their interesting sounding desserts.( Though I was told by the chef that the menu will change every three to four months)
Looking forward.....to tasting some items from here.

The owner cum chef has been trained in UK, and it shows in his work ie the food it's excellent. The ambience is great, service is provided with a smile.prices are reasonable, it's located in a small lane little difficult to locate.Else I would have given it a 5 rating.

Had won a box of cookies from this cafe in a contest held at the Zomato stall at Farmer's Market held at Taj Bengal Hotel Kolkata. It was a box of 10 small butter cookies. They were extremely sweet,totally overpowered my taste buds. I don't understand how can they have overlooked the sweetness in a simple cookie recipe. Disappointed.

The name is a little misnomer, since the food they offer is just above mediocre. It may be a little tricky to locate this place. The easiest way is to walk down the lane beside the Jatin Das Metro Station (the gate before the Hazra crossing) and turn at the first left. 
Zomato had suggested this place, and one five evening, I decided to meet up with an old friend at this place. 

The cafe is pretty spacious, even though the decor is pretty minimal. Broken plates are hung up on the wall to form a design of some sort, and judging by the environment, it's mostly local people who are aware of it or decide to pay it a visit. 

I had ordered the following after going through some reviews, and the rest, by personal judgement:
1. Egg Fritatta: This is a preparation of baked egg with puff pastry, and in my opinion, is not worth a try. 

2. Linguini: Done in truffle oil, this one was pretty tasty, and the mushrooms are plentiful. However, even by that, the price was too high. 

3. Panna Cotta: They offer a chilly Panna cotta, something I have not had in other places. And the new thing on the plate is definitely not bad! 

4. Dark Chocolate Mousse: They serve this with an orange-poached peer. Even though the combination sounds pretty weird, I would say, it was a successful attempt. 

The thing that earns this tiny outlet credit is the way they garnish and present their food. It's really noteworthy. Also, the silence of the place can be a good spot for endless banter. The main drawback are the prices for the quality served. Also, I do hope they introduce more items in their menu.

We were two of us, ordered 2 Panacottas, 1 Poached Pear with chocolate ice cream and 1 Creme brûlée and it set us back by ₹1000. Basically, this place is too expensive for the below par quantity of desserts they serve. 

The panacotta is fab (ask them to remove the chilly sauce) and the creme brûlée is pretty fancy too. Didn't like the poach pear dessert so much. Was kinda full so didn't try the main course, but I've heard fine things about it. 

My rating is 3 because of the over priced food Items and tiny quantity but the place has my recommendation for it's taste, presentation and quality.

So great experience!!! You will never find this kind of fresh food in Kolkata (Italian, French).  The flavor is amazing. The only point is that the chairs need to be more comfortables. 

We had Fetuccini, Dark chocolate mouse, Panna Cotta, Egg frittata, lemond ice tea, and water. The water is amazing because they put an orange and some leaves on it. 
Food 5 / 5

A friend and I had a cosy early dinner today at this lovely place, which proceeded to be a feast with us ordering quite the taster menu. The food and execution was to perfection - the lasagne was heavenly! You seriously won't miss the meat on that one. The desserts were as yummy as they were visually appealing. This is really commendable and worth noticing to the encourage budding chefs in our own city! 

Can't wait to try more :)

Really appreciated the concept of a temporary menu. The Chef's passion for food is reflected on his dishes.
Loved how the iced tea was fresh and had the undertone of green tea. The presentation of the food was well done and the flavours were well placed. My favourite was the red spinach risotto. I also loved the egg fritata and linguini. The truffle oil really complimented the pasta and the sauce. However the highlight was the dessert. Hands down the best chocolate mousse I've had. It was served with a poached pear and a raspberry gel which may appear to be a dicey combination, but in fact it tied the flavours together really well. Even though I couldn't try the different varieties, I really love how coffee has been incorporated into the menu. One of the best experiences I have had so far in this city. The interior was sleek and minimalistic and made the ambience very comfortable. This restaurant could definitely give 5 star hotels a run for their money! Achyut Todi

Superb food and service. Shashvat is doing a really fantastic job. The Arancini , potato and leek soup, the fettuccine with eggplant pate' , linguine with truffle oil and the desserts were amazing. Keep it up. The only thing that needs improvement, I feel is the lighting from the harsh white to a warm white would do wonders for the ambience and the look of the food.
The huge picture window also needs something to protect the privacy. Would definitely be a regular.👍

Not ashamed to admit that I've been here three times already in the past month and have almost tasted the whole menu. It is clear the chef has put thought and creativity into each of his dishes. The linguini is truly delicious and you can definitely taste the truffle oil goodness. We learned that the pasta was homemade- good job! The fettuccine is amazing, full of flavour and I was left craving for more. The grilled cheese sandwich is the best grilled cheese my husband has ever tasted. The cost is very reasonable for the quality you're getting. One dish will do me for a lunch, but not a dinner. I think the chef could get away with larger portions even if it means slight increase in the price. This is the best restaurant in the city serving Italian/western food!! Everybody needs to try it!

To (Seriously) Die For!

A lazy Sunday well spent eating. This place serves dishes you won't really find in our city and kept me wanting more after each and every dish. You can actually see the food being made which makes you even more hungrier by the minute. The menu was complex, but simple. Apart from the food the chef turned out to be one of the chefs in town who actually talks to the people. With a great knowledge of food and an ambition, I got to know he's my age and for a minute I was like "What am I doing in life?" So I went for the classic Lasagne and the Arranchini, which was really good. I was having my Master Chef moments with the chef explaining the dish to me, I felt like a true judge here. I loved it and thought I would keep this in my restaurant for sure. They have their own coffee menu and all of a sudden I was feeling too fancy and ordered the Puro Gusto bean coffee which tasted better than it sounded. To sum up my meal, I ordered the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta and Dark Chocolate Mousse. Stop. I don't know places that serve this in Calcutta. There were many desserts that you won't see in and around Calcutta. They looked great plated and I felt guilty ruining the plating as I was eating it. One of the best places I've had dessert in a really really long time. Overall a must visit and you need to try the food here. I would've given this place a 6/5 if zomato let me. Will visit this place again! 

(PS: No pictures, the words and pictures weren't enough to describe what I was eating :P)

Hi

We had an amazing time here. The food is the best Italian food we have had in India and  I'm half Italian. All the food was amazing, but the fettuccine was especially beautifully done. The arancini was great, but an appetizer portion. The lasagna was also amazing, but a tad smaller than the other pastas. I hope everyone eats here and keeps supporting great food. It would be nice to have more options on the menu, as we already ordered everything we would want. Risotto, eggplant parmesan, caponata, or cacio e pepe would be a nice addition to the menu.

Non-vegetarian or not, this quaint little French Bistro is a must visit. The menu is very affordable and even more appealing - so go on a cheat day because you may want to have one of every thing! The fettuccine was my personal favourite along with the banana bavarois. We also ordered the lasagne, the linguini, the dark chocolate mousse and the very interesting chilli flakes and oregano meringues. Would 10/10 order any of these items again; certainly matched our expectations, if not completely surpassed it. 

The passion for food comes through with every dish the young chef behind the counter serves with pride. Not only are his dishes aesthetically pleasing and absolutely delicious, there is a sense of simplicity in his rather complex dishes, merely because of how the ingredients are respected. Give this place a chance, you will not regret it!

The name of the restaurant is a perfect description! A must visit in Kolkata. Had the linguini which was made to perfection, the excellent quality of the food makes up for the lack of non-vegetarian dishes. The French cuisine is a first to the city, so is the amazing attention to detail. The deserts were amazing as well.

I have had some amazing pasta dishes, here in Calcutta and abroad but I must say that the Linguini with Mushrooms at To Die For, definitely is, far by, the best I have. To wash it down, had a cappuccino and a dark chocolate mousse and i was in food heaven. Aptly named, the service, the food and the personal touch by the Owner & Chef is amazing. A delight in the culinary world, its a hidden gem and I absolutely love it !!

To Die For is a petite restaurant or more of a French Bistro (as the chef/owner prefers to say it) in the dinghy street. They have taken the saying plain and simple way too seriously but knowing that they are open for a month the vapid ambience can be excused. 
The menu is way too short but is brimming with some the most classical French dishes. The starter options are even scarce. The server don't know the difference between a cappuccino and a latte but he still gives you the option to choose from one of them. 
The live cooking counter is quite entertaining to see how the food is being orchestrated from scratch to wonderfully plated food. The young chef is trained all round the world with speciality in patisserie. Hence the dessert precisely are the one's to die for.
There are no cocktail or mocktails for now. The food is served as single proportion without any side plate. 
Overall it's a wonderful experience of refined dining with authentic French taste. 
No particular negatives as for now as there is still a long way to go.

Loving that such authentic and classy places are opening up in Cal!! I love experimenting and this is a definite must visit place! Its a cosy Italian cafe with a limited menu however if youre a foodie or just want to have a delectable meal go here. The entire experience was lovely. From the head Chef (and owner) introducing the cafe and a bit about the basics (its inspired by the French culture) to the meal to the dessert it was great! We had ordered the Beetroot salad, the Quinoa salad, the Fettuccini and Linguini pasta and the Chocolate Mousse dessert - nothing fell short of the expectations.

To Die For is a pleasant departure from most other café’s in the city. Leaning towards the haute French culture, it guarantees every customer a completely refined experience from the moment they step in to the last bite. The pricing was pocket friendly and the food utterly scrumptious. To Die For is a must visit for every passionate foodie in town.

The Lasagne was something to die for - a dish u just can't get enough of. We ordered dark chocolate mousse and pannacotta for desserts - both were too good but I personally loved the dark chocolate mousse.
