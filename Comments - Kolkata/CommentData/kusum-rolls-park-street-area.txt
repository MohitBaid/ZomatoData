You ask for your roll and it will be ready in few minutes. They r constant in rolling the bachha paratha.. cooking it.. Nd stuffing it accordingly with your order. The sale is huge and tbh you get heavy meal at a cheaper price in a high cost area like park St.

Had been to this location umpteen number of times....they serve fresh meat which they cook like kebabs for the rolls....
The size of the roll is also larger than you get in other shops...
The sauce that they put while serving is also spicy and tangy...
Over the time this place has though not grown but the price has definitely increased...but yes for good and quality product you don't need to think twice...
Try to get your servings with a filling of Mayonnaise with the normal tangy sauce that they put...also they have mustard sauce...if you want you can get that one as well...

My personal favs from outlet are liver roll, Chicken Roll, Double egg double Chicken, Mutton Roll, Paneer Roll....

Food: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Value for money: Yes

Will I visit here again?....undoubtedly....Yes....

They do accept food coupons...but strangely they are still not cashless...

This place is located just beside oly pub. I have come here a couple of times and tried the chicken and mutton roll here. Both are really very good. The chicken and mutton pieces were very soft and delicious. The price is a bit high but totally worth it for the taste and quantity.

Now, this place is a legendary one. Do you want to grab the famous Kathi roll? Head straight to this place. Location wise, hygiene-wise, taste wise, it's a winner. This place is very easy to locate. Just beside Oly Pub, there is a huge iron gate. Enter, and on the left-hand side, you've got the famous shop, buzzing with people trying to grab one of those mouth watering rolls.
I ordered for the egg chicken rolls and mutton roll with extra mayo. The paratha was soft and fluffy. They use dalda which blots your stomach after you've gorged down the whole Kathi. That I felt was a bit disappointing, because I generally don't prefer dalda. Nevertheless, the filling was pretty amazing. Try having the rolls with extra mayo. They taste amazing. Also, an extra .5 for the hygeine of this place.

I felt it a bit overhyped going by the quality as per the price and the quantity of fillings they give with its rolls. Ordered one double egg chicken roll, it felt quite average to me.. what irked me a bit qas the amount of chicken fillings was put in to that roll.. i counted, just 5 tiny pieces. I have had better rolls elsewhere and they were worth my money. Gave 3 out of 5 inyead of 2 out of 5 for the hygiene they maintain, apparently....

When in Kolkata you have to try the famous egg rolls. So we picked kusum rolls on Park Street. 
The stall is Easy to locate. A tiny place selling rolls. Not very hygienic and totally unhealthy and oily but it‚Äôs street food. 
We went for egg chicken roll , a veg egg roll , a double chicken egg roll and a egg cheese roll not for a single person but we were 5 people 
Now the paratha was flakey and crisp n egg put was seasoned so it wasn‚Äôt a bland roll to bit into. The stuffing was spicy and tangy with a hint of lemon. The chicken was cooked through n well seasoned. The veg roll was yummy too. 
Even the plain egg roll with onions didn‚Äôt disappoint. A must visit place of u want to try the Kolkata rolls.

You will get kolkata's best authentic kathi roll here.
The chicken stuffings are soft and melts in your mouth with amazing burst of flavours.
I'll suggest you that if you are taking a chicken roll don't let them put sauce in it.. As it will over power the actual taste of the kabas which you don't want.

Kusum Roll's is a famous Roll joint in Kolkata. Though Nizam's made the debut in innovating this lipsmacking Kolkata snack, Kusum took it to another level in terms of taste and variety. 
I had rolls at Kusum several times. But this time, I finally managed to click some photographs. 
30 Dec 2017, rush time in Park Street. We ordered chicken rolls. But we could see only egg rolls were being made as the base. We didn't want to wait for long. So we re-ordered. Egg Chicken Rolls. 
Generally rolls were made with laccha parota here. But this time we saw that they were making thin parotas. It may be due to the Christmas and New Year time. But the taste was spot on thought chicken pieces were a bit less. 
I would suggest that you need to go to this place at some lazy hour.

In search of quality rolls at a reasonable price?!...this is the place. Serves one of the best rolls I've had in several places. Even a plain egg roll will make someone's day. The area however can be expanded which would really help the waiting customers as the place generally remains heavily crowded. Also seating area can be introduced. I'm sure that would pool in a lot more customers.

To be honest, Hot Kathi Roll which is just few paces away from this place is superiorly better in every department. We visited Kusum's on 22nd. The Christmas rush was on and hence we don't complain about the delay. But the amount of kebabs used and the size of each kebab is incomparable to Hot Kathi Roll. Plus the people at the shop were pretty rude. 
P.S give it a try. But i won't be visiting it again!

Such a famous outlet, located just next to Olypub in Park Street from where I've passed by may be a thousand times like an absolute blind person for all these years. But anyways, found it last week. Better late than never.

Ordered a double chicken roll and an egg chicken as mutton was unavailable. The roll size was pretty standard and tasted really good. I wanted to try mutton as well, may be next time. Prices are also reasonable. You might need a coke or pepsi which you can get from a small shop just next to it to wash down the flavours and to get a good burp.

Easy to locate. Just behind Oly pub. On our first visit we tried egg chicken roll and egg liver roll. Both had distinct tastes. I found the liver variant more delicious due to a smoky touch to its flavour. And the flatbread was extremely soft, found rarely in the food joints of Kolkata (which I personally prefer). Hygiene and quality are up to the mark. Highly recommended.
P.S.: If you are in the locality this is a better option than Hot Kati.

Situated in Park Street this place is crazily crowded as there is always a considerable amount of rush for serving the hunger pangs of people. It is well known for its legendary rolls which comes in different varieties. I ordered for a chicken roll. The tender ,juicy,soft,succulent ,flavored meat just melts in your mouth .Along with the chutney and the generous squeez of lime these rolls are surely to drive your taste buds wild. You will simply love every bite that you take. The hygiene of this place is at top knotch and service is really quick. You are sure to fall in love with this place .

The rolls were big and delicious. The chicken was spicy and tasted amazing. The egg cheese roll was a bad idea, it tasted good at the starting but then it became too sweet.

Fresh. Sumptuous. Succulent. Palatable. Delicious. 
Rolls are almost historic to Kolkata. And Park Street is another. 
And Kusum Rolls is one of its finest kind. 
Do keep the good work up. 

P.S. The most important thing, the staff is just not fussy at all. I  like my rolls to be very specific. And not all places keep up to that specification. Mostly because staff is too busy to listen or adhere to. These people out here are adorable. They have so so many customers on a busy weekday afternoon. And yet they listen patiently and serve the finest masterpiece. 
Thank you. ‚úåüèª

When I visited Kolkata after 7 years, I knew I had to revisit this place. I used to go here during my school days and I used to love the rolls because they were mind blowing!
7 years and nothing has changed. The rolls here still taste awesome and are undoubtedly the best in Kolkata. The Parantha outside is so flaky that just at sight of it you start to drool. Coming to the filling, every bite of it makes you feel in heaven.
My favourite has to be the egg chicken roll but of course the others too taste great! 

Thank you kusum rolls, it was a great trip down the memory lane!

Kolkata is synonymous to the popular street food - Rolls. The rolls you get here, are unmatched to the rolls found anywhere else in the world. And to top it all, Kusum Rolls is leading the market. Having had this on my to-try list for a long time, I finally managed to tick it off this last week. I have tried their chicken roll, chicken cheese roll and egg roll. The parathas they make their rolls on are quite soft and definitely not burnt as compared to most other places in town.. the chicken pieces are quite big and is usually marinated in masala, onion and capsicum. I prefer my rolls without sauce Coz that gives the proper taste of the chicken.. but if you‚Äôre having an egg roll, the sauce just gives it an extra kick along with the spiceness of the green chillies. 
For some rolls mean traditional authentic and would frown upon adding cheese to it. I was apprehensive too but somehow the flavours matched with each other and their was nothing odd about the flavour combinations. 
This place is decently priced for the amount they give and the staff is courteous enough to oblige to your requests of extra onion or extra lemon without any complaints. 
Hence, I would highly recommend this place to all you roll lovers..

After watching Foodka wanted to try their roll.  And finally succeeded. Location is good. Whoever went to parkstreet regularly they know its location. It is beside macdonalds. 
The place is always full with food lovers. They have no sitting arrangements. Price is bit high comparison to other roll price. 
I tried chicken roll with extra cheese. Taste is normal. Nothing special. I find one positive point that id if you eat one roll you don't have to eat anything for several hour.

All kinds of rolls are available in their menu and the prices are a bit high considering the fact that they don't have a proper dining space and no seating arrangements.  Out of curiosity I tasted their liver roll which was good but very oily. I will definitely give a try for their other items.

worst food, tastes really bad. No billing system, only hard cash payment, over all a very bad experience. Do not go to this place for rolls. There are far better snacks corner for rolls, that too at much cheaper rate.

Located in a small lane in park street this age old joint is the place I wanted to visit since time immemorial. So finally I had the chance to try their chicken roll which was absolutely delicious. The paratha was crisp with ample amount of soft and juicy chicken and a huge amount of sauce to make the meal absolutely filling. Definitely recommended. :)

I tell you first thing that it‚Äôs a place where you get good rolls and the irony is that there are many roll shops on Park Street but still people throng to this place I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the reason or it‚Äôs just again the same habit of people going to places with tag and not taste

Always frequently ordered rolls from here. Double chiken is my favourite with adding extra cheese. But todays experience is like pani fernewala. Order from Swiggy Disasters egg chicken roll comes with 45 min later with 15min delay home delivery. unclean chicken having feather inside the roll. smelly red black skin wala chicken peices. roll is completely cold egg smells alot. After seeing this i throw it in dustbin. Such a famous spot serving roll like this dont play with anyones health

Is there any Bangali at heart who doesn't drool over Rolls... The wraps of deep fried "Porota" filled with a heart-warming generous amount of chicken and egg, bursting from the weight of overloaded onions and cucumber slices, with luscious red tomato sauce oozing at the end lovingly staining ur oil-soaked fingers.... Well, Kusum rolls offers everything that is called for to satiate a Bangali's Roll-partial tastebuds. I recently tried the chicken egg roll here when a famished stomach after college wanted sumthing cheap yet filling. Hands down, this will go down in my list as the best roll that I have ever had... The chicken rolled up in the wrap was generously added to say the least and the chicken had a slight charred and grilled taste to it... The rolls were huge in size, definitely enough to satiate ur hunger pangs and the service was faster than the furiousüòÖ. In simple words, Kusum rolls can safely be regarded as a textbook example of happiness at just ‚Çπ60üòä... Needless to say, I'm simply dying to visit this gem again as soon as I can.

Well, to start with, I am not quite sure how will I fare heaping more praise for an eatery that has been eulogized time and again,thus making my review umpteenth one in the list. But I'm quite sure and in fact have no doubt to write an honest and straight-forward one. Hence I begin-

1. What -- A street food joint serving delicious rolls

2. Where - tucked in a narrow by-lane branching off the evergreen Park Street, look for the lane right after crossing The Park.

3. When - In the evening, especially an winter or monsoon one, when the sun has set for a good 30 minutes or so and the mist-soaked or droplet-drenched office people,after surviving through all the day's sedentary desk duties, literally try to find an well deserved refuge in a cylindrical piece of spiced kebab meat or potato-stuffed heaven..

Why -- Here, superior-quality lachhas are what you find as the paratha,the mainstay for the roll. So delicious that at any other place or any other time you could simply nimble them as they are. 
             Here, you can have umpteen no. of combinations of rolls,e.g. starting from the quintessential egg roll to the most sumptuous double egg double chicken roll. The marinations of the inner fillings are done separately and to the most perfect proportions. As a result, one bite into your serving will ensure rich, juicy and succulent meat portions girthed  by the heavenly aromatic and sweet lachha parata..combine that with the outside ambiance of a sudden drizzle soaked parl streer, where the street lights,the shop lights and those of the moving cars paint the asphalt with neon rainbows.

One of the many brilliant kahti roll joints of Kolkata. Situated in a convenient corner of park street, this shop has the best selection of rolls you can imagine. Apart from the normal mutton chicken and egg combos they have their special prawn, liver and mayonese rolls. The rolls taste simply divine. They also serve kabaabs but i would personally recommend trying there many roll combinations. Most importantly they add cheese to your rolls if u want which gives a whole new direction to your rolls. You just need to add 30 rupees and you will get a beautiful cheesy chicken or mutton roll which is both mouthwatering and Irresistible.

Though taste of rolls is good, the food is prepared in slightly unhygienic environment. Bang on road, cooks and support staff not using proper gloves etc. But who cares. 
During demonetisation, when ppl didn't have money quickly shifted to online payment options but with money available now refuses to accept it. Just to keep earnings low in books.

Well when you loves fast food you will surely love to have rolls. And when it comes to rolls of Kusum will always come to your mind. This is located at the prime point between Oly pub and Moulin rouge, Park Street. They don't serve rolls only but also varieties of taste.
You see the key to a perfect roll is directing the person who is making your soul according to you needs and likes. You direct them, they add ingredients according to your wish and voila your picture perfect roll is ready. Nevertheless had a great experience At Kusum roll centre. 
So peeps you haven't tried to get then go and have a delicacies.
Looking forward to visit here again.

Kusum, a few minutes away from Park Hotel and located just in the lane between oly pub and Moulin rouge,Park Street, was where people flocked to on weekdays as well as on weekends.
This place is famous for roll lovres as it serves amazing variety of rolls! Chicken roll, egg chicken roll , egg cheese or mutton rolland veg roll!!¬†

A¬†roll¬†is a small, often round loaf of bread served as a meal accompaniment (eaten plain or with butter). A roll can be served and eaten whole or cut transversely and dressed with filling between the two halves.¬†Rolls¬†are also commonly used to make sandwiches similar to those produced using slices of bread. It is commonly confused with a mini baguette.

People over there‚Äã, would walk over to Kusum, shouting orders, as the guys behind the hot stove would diligently dish out our orders: ‚Äúno sauce‚Äù, ‚Äúno¬†capsicum, please no capsicum‚Äù, ‚Äúextra¬†onions‚Äù, and so on.
This is the best place to satisfy your crab, specially when you are on budgeting.
Average cost for 2 - Rs. 200/-

Well,I have only tried their Chicken cheese roll and Prawn cheese roll.One thing common in both of these is the cheese will ooze out ¬†from the first bite.The chicken cheese roll is pretty generic.What stands out is the prawn cheese roll.They fill it with sufficient amount of Tiger prawns(Bagda chingri)which is enough to satisfy your hungry taste buds.And the cherry on the cake is the cheese in it,as I have said earlier.

On park street near McDonalds, this roll centre is very popular among people. They serve quality stuff and affordable prices. I have tried the veg cheese roll and the paneer roll there and both of them are very delicious. These rolls are so heavy and filling that an average appetite would be more than satisfied with just one roll. In the veg cheese roll, these guys put the veg stuffing they have and put an entire cube of cheese with ketchup and fresh onions. The cheese made it even more appealing and delicious. Waiting to try the mayo roll next time. 
Do give them a shot for some authentic calcutta street food which is easy on the pocket and delicious at the same time.

We Bengalis swear by 'rolls'. And especially in the festive seasons or be it pre-puja shopping, an eventful day stays incomplete without a bite on your "handsome" roll. So today was no different. I went shopping with my cousin. We were near Park Street area and we're starving after an extensive shopping spree, so we needed a lot of food to stuff our bellies. And voila! here we were!! 'Kusum Rolls'.

This place wasn't new to me. I have been here before on several occasions. The shop has a tiny kitchen ( chopping room) and an open kitchen ( roll frying and assembly), that is also the sales counter. The menu is written clearly on the wall and rolls / other food items are made after customers place an order. Service is as fast as it could get. Food was too good with an exception that you'll get to know in the later half of the review.

First we ordered Double egg double chicken rolls. Huge rolls. Thick, layery, somewhat lacchadar. Crisp on the outside, soft inside. The paratha had a taste of its own. So loved munching on the corners as it is. Egg made it soft. Chicken kababs in the middle were perfect. Burnt on the edges, soft and juicy within. Flavours of the masala made their presence felt. A tinge of sour from freshly squeezed lemon and a tinge of hotness from roughly chopped green chillies. Overall balance of the roll in terms of taste, texture and flavour was amazing ‚Äì diversity made its presence felt and they all contributed to making the final dish awesome. One of the best rolls this city can offer! We then tried mutton kababs. Turned out to b the same kababs that they use for rolls but they are stir fried with onions and chilies before serving. But it was yummy nonetheless. Succulent and juicy. The meat portion was pretty generous. And the spices "burst" in our mouth as we gulped it down!¬†

Now comes the disturbing part. Paneer mayonnaise Roll. We were intrigued with the concept of mayonnaise rolls. We were told that it was an innovation. It turned out like a pathetic fusion ‚Äì not Indian and Mughlai and not western either. It was an abomination. The simple paneer roll on the other hand was simply great. Paneer filling was very good. Very soft inside and charred on the outside. Seriously never try their Paneer mayo variant. It was a blunder we are still recovering from!

Kathi rolls here are as lip smacking as they can get. Located near Kwality's on Park Street....this roll shop is perhaps one of the best. Since I am an eggetarian....have only sampled their egg and paneer rolls. They are crisp n crunchy with just the right amount of condiments added....here is a tip....hand over a Rs.10 note to the 'ustad' making rolls as a tip and he will take extra care to make your roll crunchy n flaky. Tuck into their rolls and you shall keep returning üëç

When I visited my sister at IIM Calcutta way back in 93, she took me to all her favourite haunts. One of course knows the state of hostel canteen food. It's usually deplorable. So it was with trepidation that I followed her around when she recommended good places to eat. 
Kusum rolls was on top of the list. This actual hole in the wall, street side Calcutta style roll shop looked unhygienic and avoidable. However one bite into any of their rolls and you were transported to gastronomic heaven. They keep it very simple. They only do rolls and they do them better than anyone in Kolkata. The bread is crisp and light. The filling is nicely spiced and sauced. It's not too little or too much. One would complain that their rolls are unlike the gigantic ones that Nizams doles out. But the gold is neither in the quantity or the taste, it's in the balance of the two. Kusum wins hands down. 
Miss it and it's akin to missing the Taj Mahal when in Agra.

Not at all a fan of Kusum rolls. I personally think it is overhyped. Firstly their paranthas are not seasoned properly. Secondly the meat pieces are bland. So if you are a classic roll lover who prefers the rolls without sauce, you will be disappointed. Absolutely tasteless. Only good thing is the egg. They beat it well to make a fluffy layer. Now if you are someone who loves rolls with loads of sauce, its a different story altogether.

The staff handling the place is inept. I wanted to pay via Paytm, they had me pay my price twice and wouldn't acknowledge the first payment for variety of stupid reasons. Food wasn't that good either.

Must try..If you love eating rolls .. then this place will be heaven for you . Pick up any roll and you would not be disappointed. They also have a prawn roll. It's price is very resonable and its road side location in the heart of park Street is like the cherry on a cake.

Legendary place as well as legendary food.The perfect roll stall in Kolkata.Don't know or can't think of what to comment about this place.One after having kusum roll will surely rate it as the Number place  for rolls in Kolkata which I think.The paratha, inside tendering peices,scrambled egg grated cheese and lasty thick layered creamy mayonese.All such contents inside the paratha is something which is beyond ones imagination.Only 1 diappontment this restaurant does not do delivery in Salt Lake but as many times   visit in Park Street will surely visit kusum each time.

Cheese cravings may make an unannounced  visit!!
Don't worry,as long as Kusum rolls exists in the city.
Hunger pangs and rolls are a perfect combination üòç
How about hunger pangs and a "cheese dropping rolls"
Sounds yum isn't it?
Believe me it tastes yum too,if you are a die hard cheese lover and can  walk a little distance,make sure you visit this place which has been slaying since 1971, believe me YOU WILL LOVE IT.
Located in the hearts of posh area in Kolkata( park Street)where places like  Barbeque Nation,The park slays is this one small roll centre which can outshine the rest if you have just 50 bucks in ur wallet.
As per my experience is concerned I would be rating it with 4.5/5 without a doubt,this place would have stolen a 5 from me provided they had a good seating arrangement otherwise a legendary place :')

Excellent Snack Place for when you are not too hungry and want to grab a bite.
Only glitch is the waiting to give the order otherwise food quality is too good.
The goodness of a roll depends upon the filling inside. Their filling is amazing. It is spicy and cooked and non sticky(the best part). 
Told them to add cheese to the egg roll( this combination is not available on the menu) and it turned out to be a gem. They can add grated cheese to any roll you want if you ask them to. Very pocket friendly. üëçüèª
Must try.
4.5/5

Located at the heart of Park Street, Kusum Rolls servers mouthwatering rolls and they are pocket friendly too. It is a well known roll joint in the city of joy. Service is quick despite of the rust. No seating arrangement.
Tried their Chicken‚Äã Egg Roll and Liver Egg Roll. Totally loved them and good amount of fillings, a bit oily but tastes delicious. A must try. :)

An eternal favourite when it comes to mouth-watering rolls. Another so called legendary fast food joint in Park Street famous for their variety of rolls. Swarming with customers all day long for their famous Kanthi Roll. But being a cheese lover, their Cheese Roll is my personal favourite. Highly recommend to satisfy hunger pangs.

Located at park street, it will take 5 minutes from Park Street Metro Station. The place is all time crowded. 
It is the best in rolls in Kolkata. If you are a roll maniac you should try here once. I am eating here since 2009 and still for me it is the best. Price is on the higher side though, but it is worth of every penny. The taste is so good. Have tried Chicken, Egg Chicken and Paneer roll here. It is pretty good and delicious.

The place is clear exemplification of the famous Hindi proverb "Naam bade aur darshan chote", The place serves a variety of rolls . Unfortunately due to unavailability of Mutton we decided to order an egg chicken roll and a double egg veggie roll.

The egg roll was well done and crispy but they lost it on the filling, just 5 to 6 small pieces of chicken and a small portion of veggies in the veg roll was a disappointment for the amount charged. Fillings were topped with onion, ketchup, chilly sauce and lemon juice tasting average due to lack of filling.

All in all just an old classic losing it's charm.

Kusum Rolls is one of my favourite roll centres in Kolkata. The roll shop is located right at the entrance of Harrow Hall School's campus. The rolls can be customized the way u desire. Pocket-friendly rolls with Mayonnaise and Cheese and sauce of your choice will definitely satiate your appetite. During the lunch hours, there is a lot of crowds, but the service is so good you will not have to wait much. Moreover, the best thing is everything is prepared right in front of you, on an open table. Recommended place for quality rolls.

Frankly speaking I found this place a bit overrated! Had the normal egg roll...found nothing special about the same. Moreover it was too oily and the filling was also nothing great. Price was Rs.30 for a single roll. This can be a legendry for rolls but believe me you find far better rolls in more cheaper price at other places in Kolkata

Located in Park Street, it is difficult to find since it is situated just inside an alley in Park Street. I was using maps in my phone to find this restaurant and yet it took me several minutes. You get mainly rolls here but don't be disappointed because one will get all types of rolls, yes literally all types of, its as many as the no of permutation/combination you can do with egg, chicken, mutton, single, double. The rolls are huge in size (both length and diameter) and tastes heavenly. One is enough to keep away hunger for few hours. The parathas are crispy which makes it more tasty. The chicken/mutton inside the roll is soft and spicy. This was the best roll I have ever had and am looking for another opportunity to go there!

An eternal favourite when it comes to good quality rolls! Park Street is decorated with a chain of fine dining restaurants but Kusum Rolls offers you a different variety altogether. The meat chunks are fresh, the rolls are not too oily and the service is prompt. Well, that's what you expect from a take away centre.

This is a take away joint, small in size but great in taste. Very crowded still I didn't wait long for my roll.
I ordered, double paneer roll, the best Kathi paneer roll. 
Lots of paneer chunk cooked with onion in desi style, topped with raw chopped onions, chat masala and lemon juice.
Highly recommended.
Must try.
1 double paneer roll good enough to satiate your hunger.

It was a hot, humid & lazy evening at Park Street. We came out from a meet up of Mohamushkil blog team members & decided to have our dinner at one of the most famous Roll joints in Kolkata. And, it was Kusum Rolls. Bang opposite to Magnolia / Waldorf and if you are coming from Park Street Metro station, it‚Äôs just after the Rajdhani Thali.

¬†We (were 2 of us) opted for a Chicken & a Mutton roll. Directing coming to the food.  The parathas were just apt for making rolls. The thickness & tenderness is perfect. The outer crispiness was a bit lacking as per my liking (my all-time favorite would be Nizam‚Äôs any day on this aspect). Now, coming to the filling / stuffing of the rolls. Both the rolls had almost same ingredients apart from Chicken or Mutton.  The stuffing contained both raw & fried onions, small pieces of capsicum & red chilies Overall the stuffing was juicy & flavorful. No point discussing about the ambience as it‚Äôs a street food joint where you wait for your food which gets prepared right in front of your eyes. And, once you grab it, start munching.    

Final words - Nizam (Yes! I am biased towards them) will get a tough run for their money, by comparing the Kathi Rolls with Kusum. Highly recommended if your mind start rolling towards Rolls when you are in Park Street.

If Nizams is given the credit for inception of kathi rolls in kolkata then kusum rolls should be credited for taking kathi rolls to a new high in kolkata.
A very famous place for its innovative and filling kathi rolls, Kusum rolls is situated in the party street of kolkata (Park Street). As you enter park street from park street metro station you can easily locate it.

Very fairly priced and jampacked all throughout the day this place lets you choose from a wide variety of selections. U can even customise your rolls with cheese,mayonisse or both (my personal favouriteüòâ)
They even provide home delivery service through zomato and its excellant. Their customer handling is excellent worth a praise. Stating from a personal experience- I had placed an order for 4 double chicken cheese mayonisse roll at this place from zomato due to shortage of delivery executives the owner of that place himself came down in his swift dzire to deliver the order. Was really moved by this gesture. Extra points for that.
The rolls are very filling with generous amount of chicken,mutton,paneer or vegetables(as per your order) they can substitute for a meal itself.
According to me this place holds an equal stature with nizams when it comes to kathi rolls.
Keep up the excellent work guys!!

Located right ahead of Oly Pub in Park Street in the ally towards the right while going towards the towards Trinkas.

It's a fairly big shop but it's easy to miss if you're not attentive. 

So we ordered Egg Chicken Rolls for 60 bucks.

And it was good. Crispy parathas, soft chunks of chicken with little sauce. Well made and good to eat. 

Can be tried for quick bites.

When it comes about Kolkata, the street food item like Jhalmuri, Kachuri, Roll etc. comes with its name! And when you mention about the Kati roll, the name like Nizams' , Kusum are ruiling the City of Joy! A small counter, at the heart of city, why so famous??Lets come and explore it!

As per their name, they only serves Rolls and Kebabs only! A small roll joint, near to Hotel Park, always keep busy throughout the day! People from nearby store and office cames here and have their roll, so fell yourself lucky, if you find this stall empty!

They offers different types of Roll with a lots of customisation! From all of them, Double Egg Roll and Egg Chicken Cheese Roll is my personal favourite! Both of them tastes good and the fillings are just enough but I think the paratha could be even better! Overall a perfect spot for a quick bite!

In the battle of the rolles it is a tough competitor in the market with Hot kathi roll and Nizam and seems to be winning the fight..The chickens in the roll us tender and well balanced with good quality sauce and onions.. The egg roll is of classical type..I don't know about the veg ones because I personally can't imagine a roll without egg or meat..

Cutting half a mark for not having enough vegetarian options.

It's one of the legendary roll shop of the whole of park street, most probably in the whole of Kolkata as well and I am wondering why I came to this place so late. We came here around 9 and ordered for two double chicken roll for takeaway. The people there talked to us in English and made things easier for us. A bit expensive as one double chicken roll is rs90, two makes it rs180 but it was really delicious! Recommended.

Just happen to cross through park Street a few days when I just dropped to eat from this eatery....Well and more thing had to try as me being a person who stayed in Kolkata till my 12th and occasional visits during my college days I never had a chance to had from this must have roll joint......Ok I had to wait like for something around 15 mins to get my hands to the egg chicken roll...There were 3 people but they had lots of order in bulk hence the wait....Now I dunno whether it was my bad luck or the scenario that happens there..... Anyways coming to the food taste it was gud but not the best that I had or something of that sort.... Probably my expectations were too much after hearing rave reviews from my friends.....

wanted to try their cheese rolls for a long time . one day got the opportunity ¬†to do so. tasted their cheese roll as well as chicken roll . easy to locate just follow the zomato map . they just stuff the cheese roll with fried onion and rub a small cube of cheese over it and finish it with sauces and lemon juice . the size of the roll is appreciable . a very good place for grab and go . chicken rolls have nothing special in them but they are equally delicious

Nothing to say much about the food quality here, just that in my 3 day visit to Kolkata, my day was not complete without having a roll at this small QSR format outlet, next to Only Pub. 

Tried their Mutton Kebab roll, chicken and egg cheese rolls. Rolls were perfectly cooked with the right amount of filling in them, enough to replace a full meal. Easy to locate, this outlet is a must if you are a roll lover.

P.S- There is a Pandey Ji ka Paan outlet next to Kusum Rolls. The owner there puts in some special red masala in the meetha paan, which actually tastes very good and definitely something unique. Don't miss out on a perfect ending to your meal with this paan. 

Cheers üçª

An awsome Roll joint in the park street area.Better than the kathi roll junction.
The Roll qualities are too good.Parathas used are quite thick but soft and fresh.They also stuff it with maiyonese or cheese with an extra charge and it tastes heavenly.I visit this spot everytime i visit park street.An awsome place to taste some good quality rolls.They have only take away and no sitting arrangments and you cant stand in the place for much long.You have to take your order and walk out.Otherwise this place is a very good and affordable place to taste good rolls.

One of the oldest places in the city serving great Kathi rolls. Although their rolls can be a little too oily at times but as you bite in it, you wont be complaining at all.¬†Ideal for a¬†quick bite if you are there strolling in park street. The meat filling used in the chicken and mutton rolls are¬†tasty and juicy, bursting with flavors. Overall a pretty good place to satisfy your hunger prangs.

The roll had extra cheese in it which made it taste even better. On the other hand kathi kebab was spicy but was fabulous. Kusum rolls have made a good name for themselves over the years and they continue to serve the food loving people of kolkata in best possible way. Recommended for all.

They also have an outlet at the Kolkata airport. So if you are travelling to Kolkata with little time to spare you can try their rolls right at the airport.

Kusum Rolls is one of the most famous roll sellers in kolkata and have been serving since a very long time.It is located in the heart of park street in a lane between olypub and oasis restaurant,it does not have any seating space so we have to stand and eat.We ordered the chicken egg roll and the liver egg roll,both of them tasted good and were quite filling but I felt the quantity of the liver in the roll was less whereas the chicken roll had the right quantity of chicken.Will be heading there soon to try some of their other rolls.

There is always a rush as they are very popular that's why service is bit slow .

Pocket pinch is very friendly instead of quality food.

This roll corner is teeming with people all the time so one needs to patient while placing the order and there is high probability that they will miss-hear your order.. I ordered an egg liver roll. The lachcha parhatha with the layer of egg on the inner side and a stuffing of chicken liver tossed with chillis and onions along with the sauces. If anyone wants they will give raw onions as well bt with me the case was different since i hate raw onions. Anyway, now coming to the taste. The roll was heavenly.  It was so so yumilicious that i instantly craved for more.. I will definitely go back and bring along my other foodie buddies to try this out.
I just hope they add include a mutton liver roll too. I guess then i would be the first to go and eat like a dozen of them. üòÖ.

Overpriced and not nearly as well rounded as it used to be.

The issue I have with Kusum Rolls is the fact that there are roll shops everywhere in the city providing the masses with decent rolls at knockdown prices, whereas the rolls here are a tad bit better but with a very large difference in pricing.

Don't get me wrong, they make a mean filling and it's probably worth it if you've got the cash to spend. But it isn't as if the rolls are phenomenal, or you're getting something you can't find elsewhere. No, on the contrary, their rolls are your standard. The only thing I'd recommend having from these guys are their Mayo rolls. They're actually good and for the price, you're getting a pretty heavy piece of foodwork.

I went to this place today with my friends. We ordered cheese roll, veg roll, chicken roll and egg roll. I had cheese roll. It didn't have much cheese in it. I could taste onion and lime more than cheese. My friend who had egg roll and chicken roll liked the tinge of lime flavour in their rolls but I don't think it tasted that good in cheese roll. All in all it was a good place.

The Kusum Rolls are famous for their Kathi Rolls and so the five of us walked a long way from AIR to Park Street just to have their Rolls. Thankfully we were not disappointed. We ordered 2 Egg Rolls,1 Chicken Roll,1 Veg Roll and 1 Cheese Roll. All the Rolls were good. But the Chicken Roll was the most delicious if you ask me. My vegeterian friends thought the cheese Roll tasted better than the veg Roll. The egg rolls were good too. The dash of lemon along with all the other fillings made it all the more tasteful. The prices were quite economical. All in all it is a very good joint if you want to have a full stomach with little money.

Well even thinking of chicken kebab rolls I start drooling. Kusum is like a wonderland to me...the rolls they serve with that mustard sauce is an absolute treat to the tummy. This place is heavenly.

A great little find, just beside the bar b q restaurant at park Street. It has become my favourite place to order rolls from right after college because they make some of the juiciest cheese chicken rolls. Recommended takeaway shop.

I have visited the oxford store in Park Street and ended up here to have Kathi roll! It's located few shops away from the park hotel in Park Street. It's busy with crowd most of the times. Their Kathi roll is super delicious and the quantity is great. One is enough to fill your tummy. Also they have prawn roll along with chicken , egg etc! Try them .

Ordered rolls from here few times never visited my self but this time something special happened so thought of reviewing this place.  So we were damn hungry in d office and after many brainstorming we thought of ordering smthing special from this place and we ordered double egg double chicken roll. All 7 of us. Shocked to see a foot long roll with atleast 4inch diameter. Tasted superb. It was very filling at first and till 10 we were all filled up. Everyone must try this once if they have good appetite!

One of the best places in Kolkata, for different kinds of rolls...

Ambiance: Its like a small kiosk & there is no sitting arrangements. Ambiance is average.

Service: Swift.

Food: We have ordered egg chicken roll & egg liver roll. ¬†Parathas of both the rolls ¬†were welly fried. Pieces of chicken & mutton liver were very soft. Both of the food items were good in quantity; quality was also good as it had not caused any health hazard; & taste was wonderful.

Price: reasonable.

The high ratings for this dump of a joint only proves the low standards of acceptance a disturbing number of Kolkatans have for street food. I had Kusum for the first (and the last) time and was plain disgusted. My brother and I had the double chicken roll. I should have watched them making other orders ahead of me and should not have ordered. The chicken pieces were disgustingly spicy and curried instead of the dry kabab style meat expected of rolls. The way the chicken was being "mixed" in the sauce was ridiculous. As if it was chaat or something of that nature. Almost 90% of the spices seem to be nothing but red chilly powder (and a lot of salt, I mean a lot!) which burns a hole through your throat and entrails all the way down to the suffering end. The mix is all onions and nothing else. Then they add more onions and lime juice and more spices and salt. The result is - i can only think of one word during this entire review - disgusting. I would stick to the likes of Badshah and Nizaam. These guys still know what they are doing.

Kusum rolls..this is one outlet one must visit if he/she LOVES rolls! Located just in the lane between oly pub and Moulin rouge, park street, this place serves amazing variety of rolls! Chicken roll, egg chicken roll , egg cheese or mutton roll !!! Whatever you order the taste delivers! Well cooked paratha with good amount of filling of those necessary ingredients !!! Yum yum and yum !!! And they are reasonably priced! There's always a que , so it's better to take some extra time and go there.

Truly appreciate the way they are carrying their quality.

I don't know since when we are having / enjoying the rolls from Kusum. It's in the heart of the city and I can't imagine any Calcuttan to miss this wonder. Fast and furious serving of most favourite food of Kolkata, the egg rolls. It serves around 15-20 varieties of rolls and they turn out to be very juicy and crispy. Choose any from their menu and you'll surely be amazed. 

No seating arrangements if you're looking for one.

Till yesterday i didn't know anything about this place until one of my friends took me here.Its a small counter which throughout the day remains crowded with people coming,ordering and taking away rolls.They serve good variety of rolls and they are extremely good in taste.Inspite of such a heavy crowd the service was extremely fast and we believe that this place will continue its legacy by serving the same taste ever.We only tried their vegetarian options-
1:Cheese roll
2:Veg paneer roll

The best roll I have ever had in Kolkata. I opted for an Egg Chicken roll with extra cheese. The roll was simply delicious. The chicken was tender and it simply melted in my mouth. The cheese was the icing on the cake. I would recommend this to anyone who visits Park Street and is fond of street food.
It's extremely affordable and you will be simply mesmerized by the rolls.

Best rolls in Kolkata, hands down! 

The range of rolls is just awesome, we ordered double chicken double eggs, single chicken double eggs, prawns roll and mutton roll. Prawns roll was the best and was quite spicy. 
Being a Mumbaikar, you will have to develop a taste for mustard based sauce. And we developed that taste in no time. 

One should go to Kolkata just to eat Kusum rolls!

It was so good. 
Today I ordered liver roll and it was not upto the mark may be because of the liver itself.
So i would suggest no liver apart you can still try everything.

Will not recommend ordering from this place. They messed up my order. I had ordered for a Egg paneer roll. But instead was given a Veg Paneer roll. And that didn't even taste good. Have had better paneer rolls. I also  ordered for a Mayonnaise roll. It tasted bad. It is a recommended item on the Zomato app, but the taste wasn't good at all. Moreover, it tasted like it had egg inside even though it was vegetarian. Have had a really bad experience. Recommend going to the place, instead of ordering online. Had been there few months back, and the rolls were amazing. But after this experience i don't think i would like to go there again for sometime.

Ideal for a quick bite

This is essentially a takeaway outlet situated near the main road.¬†
The kebabs are succulent and not very greasy and the service is prompt. This place has arguably the best rolls in Kolkata at the prices quoted. The mutton roll is a must!

A definite yes for non-vegetarians. Maybe they can expand the vegetarian menu but then how many bengalis are vegetarian...
Taste: 4/5
Value for money-5/5

I was first introduced to this place years back when chains like Bawarchi and Alibaba were not the talk of the town. It has preserved its quality to be in the leagues of Alibaba and Shiraz and Bawarchi. There's still a sense of nostalgia when I have rolls here. It's a tiny takeaway counter between Olypub and Barbq. They've expanded their menu to include cheese rolls and what not. I stick to the good old egg and chicken rolls. This counter draws a lot of crowd in the evenings. They serve a special Liver Roll too.

Kusum Rolls is situated in a nook in an alley on Park Street. They have a lot of options in rolls and the service is quick. The rolls are generously filled with stuffing and makes for a huge portion. I tried their paneer roll; it was the most sumptuous and economical roll I have ever had. You can have the 'spicy' adjusted as per your endurance. There's no place to sit and eat at Kusum rolls and it is practically like a delivery kitchen, so you either stand or get a take away. There a tea stall right next to the outlet, should you have a craving.

When visiting Kolkata, we were eager to try the much hyped Kolkata roll and see how it matched up to a dilli walah's expectation!! I was happy to see how amazing the rolls were! 
We ordered mutton egg roll. The roll was stuffed with meat and different types of sauces, however the flavour of the meat was not lost amongst the riot of other tastes. The casing was also crisply and yum! Must visit when in Kolkata!!!

Kusum Rolls, as the name suggests is a historically popular roll joint in Kolkata. In fact, it is right up there with the best roll joints in the city. 

With their paratha, they give generous stuffing of meat or vegetable along with your preferred sauces and crispy onions and chillies. People complain it to be too oily, but I find it fine.

Kusum Rolls is located at Park Street, a few minutes walk from The Park Hotel. It is an open stall, but unlike regular roll joints, this place has a decent and semi inside kitchen and counter. Service is fast. If they could only look into the cleanliness of the stall, Kusum Rolls would definitely be more popular than it is now.

Don't know why , but I have grown less and less fonder of rolls which are fried  nowadays. Maybe it's because the quality of even the raw products are detoriating with time , be it the oil or the maida and moyam. Had the itching to have a roll after a long time, was in the park street area so went to kusums. Kusum has been present for a long time and is quite popular along with hot kathi rolls a little ahead. They are priced quite a bit but the servings and quality is sufficient to justify the price given its park street.
 The rolls are soft and they use good meat , which are thoroughly spiced and cooked. And the after feeling was good after having it. You don't get that acidic feeling. But given its popularity , the service will be slow as it is thronged most of the time.

It's one of the best joints for having rolls. The legendary chicken and mutton rolls are to die for. Whenever I'm nearby, I have to grab one to satisfy my hunger pangs. I always go for the double chicken roll. The best thing about their rolls is that they don't put any forms of ketchup in the rolls instead they always add a squeeze of fresh lime. The quality and quantity are good though nowadays the quantity has reduced a bit. But anyway, one of the best places to have a roll in Kolkata at a minimum rate.

The number 1 competitor to the famous Hot Kathi Roll at Park Street.¬†

Personally I like the rolls from Kusum more than the Hot Kathi ones. Very filling, fresh ingredients and lots of varieties to choose from.

One Egg Chicken roll (that's my favorite) from Kusum will keep you full for hours. Price is reasonable and at par with the competitors.¬†

The place is always crowded, specially at the evenings. But a little wait won't harm, right?

Kolkata kati rolls need no introduction - They define the ultimate street food to satisfy hunger pangs. Kusum rolls has made a name for itself over the years and is undoubtedly one of the best in the business around Park street area. My personal favorite is the classic egg-chicken roll. Although I can easily think of a few places that would top my list of best rolls in Kolkata, Kusum rolls isn't only all about the name. What I like is their fast service, good meat portions, and overall tangy blend of taste. They serve decent quantity and have quite a number of options to choose from. Recommended for students or professionals looking for a quick bite on the go.

To be absolutely honest, this place runs on two things.... the name and the nostalgia that people relate to this place. For decades, college students and park street hoggers have made it a point to eat out at this roll joint and this is what has them returning even after years, though not regularly. Once this place served one of the best rolls in all of Park Street area. Stating the same sentence now would be kind of an over statement. 

According to me, the parathas could be a lot better. They are thick and doughy. Replacing them with lacchas will be such a better idea. The meat fillings are without a doubt a contributing factor to the all over popularity of the place. The standards in this sector are met even today. If you are dropping in for a bite, make sure you try the double chicken and double mutton rolls.

During my college days, this was a favourite joint amongst my peer group. Whenever there was time and opportunity we used to drop here for a taste of their rolls. Though i havent visited their joint for a long time( thanks to the lebanese joints, we have almost given up on our very own kolkata rolls) , last week when i and my friend was in park street for some work, and suddenly the smell of rolls almost enticed us while passing through this joint, we immediately decided to have their rolls. We tried the egg roll and egg chicken roll. Both were delicious and yummy to the core.The fillings were ample and there were a lot of chicken pieces. And the good thing was that though many known roll joints have compromised with their quality with time,this one still stnds tall in that category.The pocket pinch is still on the lesser side. Highly recommended for all roll lovers out there. And yes,though the modern kolkata is now equipped with the finest globally recognized dining places, its heritage is still in the 'roll-chop-cutlet', which from time to time gives us the little pleasures of life, and this place is an example of that.

Good food cheap food. That is the essence of this eatery. 
The rolls are fantastic. 
Add cheese to the roll and they evolve to fantabulous (fantastic+fabulous). 
If ordering the food home its better to get the chicken/mutton kebab and paratha separately as the paper gets very oily by the time the food is delivered.

Kusum Rolls created a benchmark here at Park Street. The rolls are served with lot of customisation to suit the need of customer. The meat portions are soft and the Parantha are also succulent. It has fine balance of salt, spice, onion, sauce and everything. The rolls are prepared with lightning speed. And, I found it to be better than Hot Kati Roll. It will be nice if you can have rolls here. Have a great eating!!! üòÉüòÉüòÉ

This has to be amongst the best road side roll stalls in Kolkata. The variety of rolls on offer is just mind boggling. Located at a stone throw away from Park hotel on the same lane. And with Park Street being the favourite for all partygoers, it couldn't have asked for a better location. Despite all the hype, the guys here have managed to ensure that the quality does not deteriorate and the service is quick! Worth a visit!

Kusum Rolls has been on my list of Street Food places to visit for ages. Finally made it there last Saturday. It's right on Park Street easy to miss though if you are driving so keep a close eye out. You can even drive in and park in the big parking lot.
- The are many roll options¬†
- I decided on the chicken roll
- The bread part of the roll is huge¬†
- The filling of chicken, cooked onions, some sauces and raw onions was nice (but nothing to write home about)
- The roll was good but the proportion of filling to bread if inadequate.

Where do you go for midnight snacking or even late dinner on party nights in Park Street? When you are tired after hectic clubbing, where do you catch a breather as you wait for a delicious roll and engage in random conversations with strangers who just came out of a night club in park hotel? I don't know how many kusum rolls I ate since I was a college student, I guess enough to be nostalgic about it.

In kolkata we all loves two food item, one is Fuchkas and another one is Rolls. 

If you pass by this joint you can feel like it's an another simple roll corner around the area but if you are aware of Kusum rolls then you cannot just pass by without grabing a chicken roll. They are famous for their chicken rolls. Balanced minced chickens, crunchy parathas makes the heaven like rolls. 

Excellent Taste and fast service also.

You can never not have rolls when you visit Calcutta! Kusum Rolls at Parkstreet certainly give you the feeels of having the bessssst chicken and egg roll in the world. I completely lOVED it! It was soooo huge and filling. Plus it is quite pocket-friendly. I totally recommend this to everrryone. The chicken was so juicy and spicy, it totally takes you to a different zone of Happiness. And the Egg roll was just perfect! Coming back to Calcutta and having this for sure.

All i can say is the the roll experience in Kolkata has been better and better with every single day. I started with Anamika , then Golden Spoon and now Kusum. 
We got rolls from Kusum because it was highly suggested by the localites.
Kusum serves rolls in very thick and crispy rolls along with ample amounts of filling, seasoning, sauces and chillies.
We asked for double chicken extra spicy rolls and that's how they turned out. The size of one roll enough to fill one person. The chicken filling was delicious and there was no keema only huge pieces ( I always prefer chunks over keema).
Overall the rolls were amazing and shouldn't be missed if one comes to Kolkata.

Kusum  Rolls is horrible. On 22 April we ordered about 45 rolls and had discussed how we wanted them . This was agreed to  by the Owner and Manager . 

We were shocked to find that none of our agreed requests had been done.
1. Parathas were very thick and raw.
2. The chicken pieces too little , in fact they were hardly there .
3. The rolls were over stuffed with green chillies , making it impossible to eat . 
4. The rolls were pre made and cold .

So,  the experience was absolutely terrible and I feel cheated . 

Stay away from Kusum , is my sincere advice .

In the city of Kolkata roll joints are quite famous for quite bites. People who are always in a hurry prefers to get their food from this kind of food joints.  Kusum rolls is one the popular outlet located at the heart of the city.

I have tried their different rolls on couple of occasions. The cheesy and mayonized touch in their rolls not only makes it appealing also make it very tasty. ( CAUTION: strictly no for the health conscious people). I have tried the normal egg chicken roll and their cheesy and mayonise rolls as well. They try to maintain the standard and the taste everytime. I find them very delicious.
I would suggest people to give it a try once. :)

So kusum rolls was one of the stalls in the calcutta classic food festival that was happening in city centres. 1st day I found the shop closed but on the third day I found 2 staffs sitting with variety of rolls which were already prepared before hand. My friend being an admirer of their rolls suggested me to try it out. I did not like the look of it but agreed to the idea. I saw them warming it up in the microwave and giving it to us. The roll looked bad and quite dilapidated. The paratha as expected was soggy and had no crunch at all as one would want it to be. I had to find the chicken pieces minutely. I did not even like the taste. Hence I felt I wasted my money and the price for the chicken roll was rs 60 (quite unreasonable for the quality that they were serving). May be in future when I try their rolls from their live counters I will have a different view point and hence that time i can rate them higher but not after this experience.

Kusum rolls are quiet well known in the city. I wanted to go this place for quiet some time and one fine day when I dint have the time to eat and I was in park Street I gave it a try. We called for a chicken egg roll which tasted ok but tad oily. A egg roll which had a raw smell. I guess Park Street has better options around.

'Kusum Rolls' is a very famous roll centre of Park Street Area. It is a bit difficult locare owing to the fact that it is in a lane beside a gigantic housing complex. This eatery stands head and shoulders above most of the roll centres in Kolkata and it is certainly better than 'Hot Kathi Rolls'. Though the first spot in great rolls will go to 'Haji Saheb', this place will come a close second. I have visited this place before as well.Earlier,I had their chicken roll which was delicious. Today, I visited again. After seven months, I had a roll today. It was the Egv, chicken and cheese roll.The roll was prepared within seven minutes. The first bite gave me a foodgasm. It was delectable. The plus sign of 'Kusum Rolls' is that the pocket pinch is very little. I will certainly visit again.

First thing I wanna say is my experience at this place didn't start off too well. I didn't like the staff here too much and that had dampened the mood but then came the rolls, my oh my they were just awesome. I loved the amount of chicken in those rolls, the perfect quantity of sauce, chilli and masala in it, the paratha was in itself delicious. I've also had their cheese roll and of course nothing with so much cheese in it can taste bad. I've seen on their menu they also have Mayonnaise Roll, would love to try that out sometime. But still my favourite here is the Egg Chicken Roll, the kebabs in the roll are so so much better than most other shops in the city.

This is the place one should come to if you happen to be in and around Park Street, but do not have enough to cash to hop into one of those iconic restaurants and feed yourselves to a hearty meal. Kusum's one of the most popular roll joint in this city have established their supremacy by serving mindblowing and delicious roll in lieu of its competitor located nearby to it.

Such is the popularity here, that this place got telecast in ' David Rocco's Dolce Vita'. The parathas here are soft and the chicken pieces are tended. The dough is made with utmost care and the end. If you are a fan of cheese and mayonnaise, they an option for you as well. Choose one of their cheese varieties and you end up with a roll you can go crazy after!

There happens to be no sitting places here and the hygiene happens to be an issue here. Although, considering the quality they maintain here, is definitely appreciable and definitely warrants a visit here. :-)

Kusum is a Roll lover's paradise. I think it is the 2nd best Roll joint of Kolkata after Nizams. While moving on park street from the Asiatic Society towards McD, keep your eyes on left. Otherwise, chances are you will miss it. 

I ordered one double egg, double chicken roll. It came up with fluffy egg, spicy chicken chucks & just the right ammount of lime & green chilies. Quantity is sufficient for two.

Only problem is, tgis place is always overcrowded. 

But won't worry. Just have some great tea from the adjucent shop afted you finish up your roll. ‚ò∫

Feeling little hungry at Park Street, there's a ton of options open for some small foods & snacks. Where Kusum Rolls are very popular between office goers of Park Street. They also holds a high rating on Zomato, lets see why!

Location : Its very famous in Park Street & located near to the main road, so finding it is not a hassle. You will find it just behind of Olypub.

Decoration : Its just a Roll & Kebabs counter, so no sitings, no decorations & no ambience. But tags of Zomato & an own award showed in front of the restaurant is enough to attract people & show them how famous they are!

Staffs : All the staffs were in Blue Tees printed Kusum on it. They were fast enough to handle the daily office crowd of Park Street. All this makes it authentic from other roll counters.

Foods : As per their name they only have Rolls & Kebabs to feed your hunger. Although there are a ton of variety available in rolls. Even for some extra bugs you can add Extra Cheese or Mayonnaise in your roll.

Chicken Roll with Extra Cheese : The Parathas of the roll was very thin & lightly fried that I didn't expected from such a famous roll counter. But the actual specially was wrapped into this. Kusum's Kathi Kebabs were diced into small pieces that was very nicely grilled. It was soft, lightly spiced & tasted very lite & different. Sauces used with it was of good quality than other roll counters. Option of adding Extra Cheese or Mayonnaise in it is such a pleasure to the taste bugs.

Pricing : Prices of there rolls are quite similar to other roll counters at Park Street. Extra toppings for some extra bugs are also good option.

Conclusion : Feeling hungry at Park Street & searching for some small snacks? Kusum's Roll is the perfect joint. Adding Extra Cheese or Extra Mayonnaise in a roll is something not usually found at every roll counters out there. Where this approach makes their roll even more tasty & completely different.

If you would like to have a chapati roll, an excellent place to go to. The chicken egg roll is great. Ofcourse there is no ambiance and service concept. You just order and eat. But you would not be disappointed I guess. You would ofcourse get some bacteria on the house, looking at the cleanness of the place. Been eating at this place everytime I am in Kolkatta and never got a infection, so I guess these are harmless. Try it to get the flavor of the famous Calcutta rolls.

Popular in park street area, right besides the famed Olypub bar..wanted to grab a roll, typical Calcutta style...spiced with tangy chicken gravy and raw chillies, this place is a very busy fast food joint. Dont expect seating or hygiene but the mere aroma of awesome rolls and kebabs will entice you into its small gulley of an entrance. We had the chicken egg roll and boy was it good.. Spiced up with chicken chunks and wet spicy gravy, the paratha roll wasn't too hard chew on at all and it wasn't that heavy either. An excellent quick bite kinda place for all the calcutta roll lovers.

There are different rolls to try from like a normal chicken roll to a double chicken and a roll with eggs. I said let me try the regular chicken roll as I felt it's quite filling and stuck to the normal chicken roll.  N yes it was nicely done and tasted nice. If you want it spicy they can make it for you. I too would suggest you to try the roll when in calcutta as I am definitely going to miss it once I am back in Goa.

We went in search for The Famous Kolkatta Kati rolls....... And we found Kusums.......we were amazed at the variety and the stuffing inside the Kati rolls.

It was supppppeerrrbbbb..... After eating an Egg roll we also tried the mutton and chicken, and they were equally yummmy.

The only thing was you don't have any parking space or sitting space, so catching a Cab to that place is apt.....but it's worth every penny.

This is one of the places you are always told to drop into when hungry & on Park street.  Ordered the single egg single mutton roll &  boy did I struggle to finish it.... It was sooooooooo oily..... tasty but oily!! Would need a person to be very hungry to attempt a second roll. While I didn't mind the meal, not able to understand why it is on a "must eat list"  to a city which boasts of some fine food options. 

Been there,  eaten that.

One cannot simply ignore the delicious aroma emerging from this roll shop,while strolling past the lane beside Oly Pub in Park Street.There is always a crowd thronging the counters of Kusum Roll shop and the orders keep rolling all day.

Personally i find it the best roll shop In Park Street and my personal favorite is the Chicken Mayo Roll .The kebabs are juicy and succulent topped with a super thick layer of yummy mayo .All the other ingredients mixed in a perfect blend makes this roll a must try.
The other must tries are Egg Chicken roll,Mutton roll and Paneer Roll.
For all the roll lovers and for all those who are looking for a quick yummy bite in a pocket friendly budget,dont miss this out!!

A very known place for delicious rolls in ParkStreet area. It doesn't look that fancy but in Kolkata fancy places doesn't provide such awesome rolls. We ordered five different type of rolls for eight people, but their quick service made it look so easy. Their variety, price and quick service are the most important factors for their popularity. Though it is not my favourite in ParkStreet, but its only my opinion. After all its famous for some reason. So, do try this place when you are around.

Though highly popular for their rolls, there is much left to be desired. Their popularity could perhaps be ascribed to the other roll joints in the vicinity of Park Street that have, over the years, degraded in their quality. A newbie compared to most others in the neighbourhood, Kusum rolls is well on its way on a downward spiral, following suit. The rolls Kusum serve drip with an unending supply of oil, so much so, that even two paper napkins wouldn't be enough to absorb it all - it becomes difficult to grip the roll, constantly slipping between your hands, and I'm not joking here. If that isn't enough, the man who sits to take orders probably has his ears impaired because of sitting there for far too long next to the honk-happy Park Street revelers. But his sense of accounts is on the ball - I recently ordered (with an advanced payment) for an egg chicken roll, and I was handed a chicken roll without the egg (no pun intended). On pointing out this sleight of hand, the impaired man at the counter started to mutter something at me, something that didn't seem very pleasant (as if its my fault), but not loud enough to reach my ears in the din of Park Street evening (we shared a moment of mutual impaired hearing at that moment, such bliss!). The grease, the aggressive behaviour, did much to whet my  appetite, on hindsight. Good luck Kusum, you're on a roll.

"This is the place we used to have those delicious chicken rolls when we used to go to school."

Well, it has become the same for me ever since my uncle recommended the place to me. It is a little pricey when it comes to rolls but given the quality and taste, it is completely worth it. So far it makes technically the best chicken roll I have had in Kolkata. It is simply munch-worthy. Like I had been hooked on so bad that I used to (still do) take a walk at around 10 in the night through Park Street just to treat myself to one of these rolls. If you love rolls or even want to try it out. Go to this place.

Kusum rolls is very famous among school ,college and office folks as this comes as a quick snack in between those hungry cravings and I know some people who treat is as lunch or dinner option also as its quite filling and pocket friendly too.
 So whether you are at noon or at evening around park street you will get your favourite rolls here , they have quite a few options of rolls and kebabs too but I always settle down with chicken roll and there is a pan shop near where I sip on to a cold drink and that is quite a great combination.

Now let's talk about the quality and preparation of the Chicken rolls that they make , which I personally feel that the garnishing of rolls and fillings can improve more with the taste cause number of times they just squeeze lemons so fast on the rolls without understanding excess of it might make it taste bitter , however due to the  hot kebabs inside of the chicken roll it tastes pretty yum but then another problem arises with the dripping oil soaking your napkins which were actually given to wipe your hands and mouth after eating but it gets used to soak in those dripping oil .
Well keeping these few things aside this eatery point for rolls & kebabs is  very interesting as its a major crowd puller in park street and I tend to keep visiting this place without a doubt and overlook a few factors sometimes .

A wee bit bigger than Hot Kathi Rolls, and a worthy competitor for the best roll joint in Park Street - Kusum Rolls has an advantage, you do not have to block the footpath (not considered as an offence in Kolkata though) and jostle with the pedestrians. Usual list of famous rolls, with a twist thrown in in the form of cheese and mayo rolls, but all said and done it is the egg and chicken rolls which rules the roost.. nothing feels better than a hot crispy paratha wrapped over succulent kebabs... on the go ... way to go ....

No wonder it's one of the best roll places in Kolkata. The egg chicken roll is amazing and so is the paneer roll. They're a bit smaller in size , but absolutely delicious. The filling is what matters and that's the best part .  The roti doesn't seem very oily also as it is in some places. The rolls are indeed , worth trying.

Delicious value for money rolls...Kolkata rolls at their best. Simple , delicious, hot & available even at late hours. They've maintained quality over the years and manage to draw crowds from all walks of life. A little spicy , so if you cant handle it , order the mayo ones. Open beyond 1:00 AM, a perfect snack at any time of the day or night. No sit-in space, pick up and eat there or take away.The perfect indian fast food.

This place is located adjacent to Oly pub , and is one of the best I've ever tasted in Kolkata ! The shop is like a take away counter where you pay the money , wait for a few minutes, and your hot Kathi roll is served just as you like it . The rolls are made in a live kitchen to the right of the shop and the chicken used is cooked , retaining a part of the gravy , so that the chicken and mutton pieces are juicy and succulent . They do not put raw onions inside the roll but use the caramelized onions of the meat gravy , which is what makes this roll so distinctly different in taste from most roll shops . The egg used in the egg chicken roll was fluffy , and the parantha is soft , not over fried , almost melts in the mouth . Totally a must try if you want to taste a good ol' Kolkata Kathi roll !

One of the streets in the legendary city of Kolkatta. The common sight of a yellow ambassador and the Victorian buildings in the background. Recently, I went to Kolkata for a work trip. Kolkata is a city I am very fond of. It is a beautiful legendary city where time stands still. Walk down the main old city and admire the Victorian style architecture, visit a fish market (the favourite food of the Bengalis) to watch the customers and sellers haggle with passion, go to a football match for an adrenalin-pumping experience in support of the local team or buy a paper cone of sharp, crunchy, mustard-spiked jhal muri browsing through museums or theatres.

Badhshah used to be my personal favorite some years back, but any longer.
In search of the quintessential chicken roll I happened to stumble across this street-side fare at Park Street, somewhere close to Oly pub.

The single egg single chicken roll is a juicy succulent affair what with ample morsels of the meat spiced with onions, masala and the regular ketchup. The roll is crunchy and not too oily on the hands. The rolls are extremely well priced. At the same time I feel nostalgic about Kathi Rolls situated in the Delhi - Meharuli road whom I consider to be a very close contender.

The staff is indifferent and it would help them immensely if they changed their demeanor.
Be ready to undergo a bureaucratic getting as you queue up to pay and then await your roll.
This is the reason I had to restrain myself while rating them!

Ordered liver roll which was really really yummy. Took another chicken roll that tasted disastrous. Food preparation was completely hygienic and shop is a well lit one. I suggest they should bring some refreshment in the Menu card. Those ghisa pita chicken, egg, paneer, veg rolls are not tasty anymore. Mayonnaise, cheese and liver rolls are three exceptions only. Strongly recommending to try Liver Roll.

Perfect destination to grab a quick bite strolling down park street.

The rolls are just excellent, perfect parathas, excellent mutton stuffing, but a bit more onion than I would prefer.
Overall, the taste of the roll is among the better ones in the city, the price however is bit on the higher side, but definitely manageable.

Would have the rolls again when in the mood. Go check it out if you havent.

My Durga Puja food trips have just sucked. The chicken roll at Kusum was supposed to be the saving grace. But they disappointed too. The chicken and the paratha were very good indeed. But the stuffing just had an excessive amount of onions (yes, they are expensive; and no, you don't get credit for stuffing my roll up with diamonds). On top of that, I regret asking them to add the chilli sauce when they asked which sauces I wanted. They sauce was rotten stale. Completely destroyed their chance of getting a 3.5.

Since it was Puja times, I'll give them another chance. But that's that.

My first egg roll was made by Kusum. 
I still remember that taste...  Yummy
If its an egg roll  I would recommend Kusum than any other roll shop in Kolkata.  
They are experts and Kusum Rolls Rocks.

being into music professionally, I play at someplace else on a regular basis.  so,the only pocket friendly snack spot is definitely kusum! a very very busy shop but one of the fastest delivering roll joints I've ever seen! very tasty and well made rolls.  in Park Street area, the best pocket friendly roll joint it is undoubtedly!

With all due respect to the fans of kusum rolls....i am sorry but this is one of the worst roll experience i ever had... i had a chicken roll last year from there, it was so bad that i never dared to go there again....the paratha was very thick n half cooked, did not find any taste in their chicken kabab it was blunt....
They  might have been good ages back or might have improved now, i dont know..... but i personally dont have courage to go there and eat again...

Apart from Hot Kati roll, this place is a wonderful roll joint in park street. A perfect balance of Sauce, Onion, Chilli, Salt, Lemon and Capcicum in all their servings. Very pocket friendly, used to visit this place while returning from CL in my college days. The quality of the meat they serve in chicken roll is beyond expectation, a must visit if you are looking for a quick bite.

Somewhat pricey but still one of the better places to dish out the favourites. The meat they provide is well cooked and tender, with just the right amount of spices, but a bit miserly in amount. There is not much to speak of regarding their rolls which are otherwise delightful. Adventure lovers can try out the mayonnaise roll sometime.

Mostly went there as a kid coz it was one of the kinds at that time that served rolls. Now rolls are there on every nook n corner and isn't an attraction. Undoubtedly they have the best rolls even today but it's impractical as car parking is a major issue. Though you are allowed to park inside late evenings, but that's not the time you want rolls on any given day. Yet hygiene factor can be improved, it's a little dirty and can put you off at times.

I find everything about their rolls very appetizing - from the filling to the paratha. I like it all. I recommend this joint to everyone who is in Kolkata and visitors who would like to taste the iconic flavours of Kolkata.

The service is good, given the number of customers they attend.

Special mention - Cheese Roll, Double Chicken Roll, Double Mutton Roll, Mutton Roll, Egg Veg Paneer roll, Double Egg Double Mutton Roll and Double Egg Double Chicken Roll are my favourites here.

The roll contains a mind boggling mix of their specially made chicken sikh kebabs with mayonnaise. The taste lingers in your mouth and you relish each bite. 
Kusum Rolls is probably one of the best roll shops in Kolkata and it deserves your pleasure for a snacky roll. :D

God knows how they manage to make the parathas so so soft.  The chicken that they use in rolls has that perfect taste and aroma and surely deserves a special mention. That is why, the chicken roll tastes so good. 
Combine the roll with a perfect squeeze of a lemon and the roll is ready.

This is my honest review on this place but it may disappoint many because it's there one of the favourite place. For me, food is the main ingredient which attracts me about any food joints, other aspects may be considerable. But all in one I am not satisfied what they are providing as per my taste!
Food- We had chicken roll and egg roll last Saturday. Roll was big in size but the taste was lacking. They put too much sauce in it. We told them not to put chillis but they didn't pay attention. In my opinion this place is quite famous because Park Street doesn't offer much street food joints honestly. So it is kind of crowded because its low price compared to other high-priced food joints.
LOCATION- I must say it is situation in a prompt location.
Price- if you compare with other high priced food joints of park street then it may look cheaper but trust me kolkata offers much more good rolls with less price.
So for me it's not a place that excites me with there great taste.

When you crave rolls in kolkata, kusum rolls has to be the place to go for satisfying that craving. Located in a small little alley in the posh area of park street. Seeing the amount of croud there u will know that u r at the right place.

It caters to both veg and non veg pallets. So be sure to try the egg paneer roll and egg double chicken roll. The best thing about this place is that u can customise the roll with the amount of filling, chutney, onions, chillis etc. Dont think about the calories when u come here. The base of the roll (paratha) is literally shallow fried in ghee to add that extra taste and crispness. One of these fully loaded rolls and u are good to go for the whole day without anything else.
The price is also very pocket friendly, which is because most of the people there are students. This place is definitely a gem of kolkata that just can't be missed.

If pornography can titilate , I wonder what a food titilation would be . Trust me kusum roll is not less than food porn. The cavity in the soft and the succulent dough is filled up with the dollop of molten ghee and rolled to an fro for the flakiest parathas. The kabab smeared with spices and onion capsicum makes it just a tad special to firm up the filling and makes it tight and hard . As you take it in the juices secrete in your mouth  but I bet you can't take the stuff out unless you bite on it . The tongue runs riot while it is exasperated with the juices in and leaves you egging for more . I bet you need to try out kusum to feel the provocation , of taste of course.üòõ

Trust me they value your hard earned money,they put so much of mayo that I thought of saying them to put less but their hands are faster. The second bite made me feel the heaven. Well if someone thinks that I am exaggerating,just experience their rolls once. Except you are a health freak and diet conscious one,their quality will pull you to them again and again

Been visiting Kusum's for quite a while now, but refrained from writing a review till I had tried them thoroughly enough. And they have lived up to every expectation, mesmerising my taste buds every single time! The key to good Kathi rolls lies in the balance of flavours and that's what these people have mastered over the years. My personal favourite has been the Single Egg Double Chicken Roll with extra Cheese... the perfect balance of all flavours with sumptous chicken in every bite! And a special mention for the Liver rolls... don't see people mentioning it much but if you're a bit adventurous, it's well worth a try.
Food quality- 5/5
Service- 4/5
Value for money- 4.5/5
Here are a few tips to get the max out of your rolls-
1) Use the cheese topping for the heavier rolls(the ones featuring 'Double' in their titles) and mayo for the lighter ones.
2) Mayo goes better with Mutton whilst cheese is better with Chicken.
3) Do NOT mix cheese with Liver rolls.

P.S.- For God's sake, do NOT worry about calories when you visit this joint! Just experience the magic breaking forth on your tastebuds.

This place is among the top Roll Places I have eaten at. The ambiance is Average but it is to be expected since this is a budget friendly restaurant. The Service is Very Fast but the staff was inattentive to what the cashier was telling him about the orders and made careless mistakes in putting sauces in the wrong roll as another review mentioned on Zomato. I had eaten the Egg Roll, Double Egg Roll, Paneer Roll and Double Paneer Roll and all were very Tasty. Highly recommend this place to anyone who Loves Rolls.

They have taken the art of rolls to a new high.Located just ahead of Olypub, its a joint meant for one and all.They serve at least 20 different type of rolls,from chicken to mutton to egg chicken and so on.The mutton roll is a delight,which finishes by 7.30 on a normal day.Egg chicken roll is my all time favourite, and the new addition, mayonnaise roll is nice.Pocket friendly,yet a roll which fills u up,this place is good for a walk down Park st,and having a roll with friends and family.

VISIT
I visited this outlet on 30/05/2015.

AMBIENCE
The ambience is okay types.The outlet hasn't got any ambience of its own except for the fact that it is located in the "life" of Kolkata-The Park Street area.

FOOD
Coming to the food,i would say that i had ordered for a veg roll but couldn't find any uniqueness in it.There were many vegetables added in the roll but it ¬†didn't have anything special to instigate me to come to this place again.Moreover,i just don't get it why do these roll shops fry the rolls in so much of oil.No matter whether the oil used is good or bad it causes ¬†a great health hazard.They should take more steps to reduce the usage of oil in the making.Further, the rolls should be dried on tissues before handing it to the consumers t gorge on it.

SERVICE
The service is fast.The staff was inattentive to what the cashier was telling him about the orders and made careless mistakes in putting sauces in the wrong roll.

RATINGS
My ratings are as follows:
Ambience-2/5
Food-3/5
Service-4/5
Value for money-3/5
Overall-3/5(12/20)

I happened to chance upon Kusums one fine afternoon when I was in Park Street and my hunger pangs forced me to search for a low-budget place to have a small snack. And oh, what a find! I remember trying out the chicken roll the first time and instantly falling in love with it. My vegetarian friend had ordered a cheese roll. I took a bite out of it and it was heavenly. Their chicken pieces are not just fried but tandoored as well. The paratha might not be as flaky as Zeeshan but it is beautifully seasoned. They add raw onions, which always render a slight sweetness to the rolls, capsicums, two types of sauces, a dash of lime, a pinch of pepper and then sprinkle some of their special masala on top. On request, they add chillis. Till date, I have tried their Chicken Roll, Double Chicken Roll, Egg Chicken Roll, Mutton Roll, Cheese Roll, Egg Cheese Roll, Mayonnaise Roll, Liver Roll and Egg Liver Roll. My absolute favourite is the Double Chicken Roll. You get soft, juicy chicken in every bite. Though, of course, yes, this is not exactly what you call healthy snacking. The rolls are pretty heavy and greasy. If you're moderately hungry, one chicken roll should be enough to satisfy your hunger for quite some time.
Ambiance is not something to write home about here. You grab a roll, you stand nearby, you gobble down the roll and then buy a soft drink from one of the vendors and wash it down.
Service is generally super fast though I have had to wait at times. But never more than 10-12 minutes.

One of the best rolls I have had in Kolkata and that too at a 5 min drive from my place. What more could I ask for a quick evening grub and one which is light on the pocket too! With their quick service and delicious taste, this is a must try out for all roll lovers. I particularly love their single chicken roll with the crisp paratha on the outside and the right balance of chicken chunks, onions, sauces n masala inside. It keeps wanting u for more!

Kusum was a hole in the wall place on Park Street catering to youngsters with little money in their pockets. One didnt know it had pretentions of displacing the iconic Nizams !! ....and how its grown and flourished over the decades and what is good is that it still is pocket friendly.Fortunately for the Air traveller Kusums has opened an outlet at the Calcutta Airport Food Court. So check in early,go through security and get youself a couple of double chicken double andaa and enjoy. Still better have them packed and savour them on the flight,while your neighbour drools over his unsavoury tasteless airlines sandwich !!Great stuff¬† so dont miss out. More power to Kusums !!!

This food corner is located in an unassuming place that‚Äôs quite easy to miss when you are walking towards Park Hotel (walking distance of 5 minutes from park street metro rail). However, the decor is very simple, no sitting position, nearly ¬† ¬† ¬†10 X 8 feet counter where 4/5 stuff busy with their work. Even Cash counter is also force into this small place. Still they were working with charm & energy along with fully surrounding by satisfied customers. 

The mark of a good food corner is not necessarily its size, but the quality of its food and the generosity of its staff.  Ambience rate will be 3 out of 5 in my point of view.

I have visited this Roll Corner before few days. My favorite item as fast food is Roll & Chowmin, so here I press button for one Egg-Chicken Roll. It takes only 5 minutes for the first bite, the Paratha, which is the main part of a Roll, was soft & well prepared. Other ingredients like chicken pieces, onion, green chilly & lemon (no tomato sauce) they added into the roll was also fresh & yummy. After I finish my lunch, took a bottle of cold drinks from another shop situated just opposite of this corner. 

For this pocket friendly non-veg fast food counter my review rate is -

Ambience = 3/5

Food=3.5/5

Price=3.5/5

Service=4/5

Overall=3.5/5

Kusum rolls located at the entrance of Karnani Mansion in Park Street is a famous joint selling rolls for ages now. The outlet is always filled with customers who come here to have a quick grub of various types of rolls served here. I last visited the outlet on Christmas Eve but was totally dissatisfied with the quality of food served. I ordered for a double egg roll but it was half cooked and there was hardly any salt or masala inside.  The egg chicken roll ordered by my husband was equally tasteless. Hope to have a better experience the next time we visit the joint.

I had my doubts about eating at this place since I am a vegetarian and they do not have any separate place to prepare veg rolls. But I have always wanted to have good rolls and every good places I tried were apparently not so good. So after a little convincing from my friend, I gave in.
And I am so glad I did. 
It is located just beside Mc Donald's and wouldn't be difficult to locate as it is always filled with people. 
People who worry about the hygiene part could avoid this place. Also those, who cannot stand the site of non vegeterian.   

The veg roll that we ordered was delicious. Although the roti was tad oily but the filling was amazing. It was undoubtedly the best veg roll I have ever had. Though what it did to my diet is another story. 
So yeah, I am definitely coming again for their cheese rolls. ;)

I absolutely adore Kolkata food. The Fish, the Sweets, and sometimes even their Biryani is just mind blowing. But this time I tried out their rolls that I've heard so much about given the paucity of time on this visit, and glad I got to taste the famous Kusum Rolls of Park Street. 
There's Chicken, Mutton, Veg, in single and double Egg roll options, all made super fast and super fresh right in front of you. 
Tip: 
1. Specifically ask for long duration travel parcel in case you wish to take away, as they use less sauce to ensure the freshness lasts longer 
2. The Kababs inside the Rolls can be ordered separately, and they make excellent value for money starters

Rolls originated from Kolkata and it is surely of the greatest innovations till date. Originally mutton kebabs wrapped in roti used to be served, Kolkata twisted the original version and came up with an paratha, mutton kebab, a hint of lime and fresh onion juliennes - a pure delicacy and something every Kolkatan look forward to in the evening.

Park Street has many good roll joints and Kusum is my favourite roll joint in Kolkata, just beside moulin rouge, enter the iron gate with Kusum just on the left. One of the oldest roll joints who are still serving quality rolls. 

A 10 foot shop with a cook constantly frying the parathas and kebabs in one corner, a person wrapping the rolls with great skill and a manager - This is what the oulook of Kusum is. Every bite of the roll you take is perfect and thrill you. They don't provide you unnecessary sauces in the roll - but just a hint of lime and chat masala. 

I have tried egg roll, chicken roll, mutton roll, egg-mutton, egg-chicken, double egg double chicken, double egg double mutton - all are equally good. The Paneer roll and Vegetable roll is also good.

Hugely recommended to all friends, go visit and enjoy your roll with Kusum snacks bar.

Rolls and rickety lanes are almost synonymous with Kolkata. I can‚Äôt think of suggesting another place for rolls when I have my outstation friends and colleagues visiting Kolkata. Given a choice between another roll favourite in Park Street (without naming the competitor here and being diplomatic). I swear by their recent introduction in Cheese Rolls and also the Chicken Cheese Rolls. Though I only gorge on the plain cheese rolls with a toss of pepper, onions and green chillies.

Go and try all the varieties that are available here. If you are new to Calcutta (K)olkata you should begin your journey to roll snacking with Kusum.

Bengalis swear by their chicken double rolls & mutton double rolls & now I know why... In Kolkata on a work trip, I was given strict instructions not to miss on the legendary kusum rolls & I do follow my food instructions very seriously... I walked down park street to discover this kutty Lille place in on of its corner... They were all fastidiously at work doling our one delicious roll after another! I ordered for a double chicken roll and what I tasted lingers on my taste buds to date... The crispy ghee paratha laced with onions, chilli, chicken, special chilli sauce & the miracle masala which makes the roll taste miraculously good... Hate to admit but this is by far the best roll I've eaten! You Bengalis have a one up on us Mumbaikars here! All this for a measly 40 bucks... Every bite I died & went straight to Bengali heaven!

If you ever have any doubt about why is Kolkata the 'roll capital' of India, head straight to Kusum. They have mastered the art. I have had these rolls in many cities, but what you get here in this city and at Kusum is certainly one of the best. Every flavour is subtle, yet marks its presence. The base for the roll is prepared fresh. And the filling is exactly how it should be. I tried egg double chicken and chicken. Both were perfect. A must have when you are in Calcutta.

The dust and the grime. 
The sweat and the slime. 
Its all evident around Kusum and probably conspire together to play their part in the flavours of the offerings of this "Hole-in-the-Wall" eatery in Park Street. Once famed for its night life and restaurants that have become part of Kolkata cuisine heritage, Park Street also boasts of many such small eateries and Kusum is one of them. Yet this place has become synonymous for its Rolls that are like a soothing balm for a stomach gnawed by hunger pangs and a heart craving for oodles of sinful, grease dripping, food. This Place is the epitome of specialisation and provides any kind of permutations and combinations of roll - filling that you can think of; Double egg single chicken, single egg double chicken, double egg, double chicken, single egg,  single chicken and the list, err menu, goes on!  Then of course comes the special demands of the clients that have to be fulfilled while the roll is being made... some like it spicy, some with spice-less sauce while some prefer lots of onion and a dash of lime; Kusum serves them all, without a smile but minus a frown too!  The one thing common to many other roll shops of Kolkata?  Well, the oil glistens on the surface of the paratha just like they do elsewhere! The price too is quite cheap and for a price like that the owner can always be excused to overlook the inner voice and not provide a wastebin to stop the surrounding place from being littered with the left over papers of the roll. So much for swacchh Bharat. Kolkata being the city of rolls there are at least 2 places which serve better rolls than Kusum, but this Place has built it's own clientele over the years who swear by the thickness of the filling and the texture of the paratha and never lose an opportunity to grab a roll from Kusum of The Park Street of Kolkata!

Yes, it is better than hot kati rolls. And yes, it is better than most other roll joints in the city. When you're in Park Street, make it a point to stop and grab a roll to your liking from here. Maybe ask them to put some extra chilli and lime, and it's festivities for your taste buds. Their paranthas are crispy, the way I like it, and the put the meat in the form of kebabs, which are always perfectly grilled and spiced. 50 bucks well spent.

They serve the best rolls. I've tried rolls almost everywhere, and theirs is simply delicious. The location is perfect, go, grab a roll, and get on the go. You must try their egg-chicken and double egg-chicken. Though chicken roll is also lip smackingly yummy, so are the sandwiches. The service is pretty quick, the only downside is that dine-in is not available. Also, very very pocket friendly.

Thanks to my sis-in-law, I discovered one of the best places in Calcutta serving those famous, mouth watering Calcutta egg rolls. The luscious parathas, the egg slathered over them, the tasty succulent chicken pieces, the caramlized onions and the lip smacking chutneys all come together to create this roll of absolute heaven! No wonder that its popularity is immense despite being a teeny weeny place off Park Street.

If you are from kolkata, there is a high possibility that you have atleast heard of this small roll place on Park Street called Kusum.

Though it is just a small fast food snack corner. Kusum is highly recommended if our are near park street and you are up for some quick snack. The rolls are heavenly and filling. Totally worth the money.

Recommended item: Anything on the menu.

The Chicken Rolls is yumm!!! Juicy pieces of chicken and fried onions with a soft and crispy paratha wrapping it! The mutton roll is delicious also. So is the paneer roll !!
But I'd highly recommend the Liver Roll for people who actually prefer Liver. Really really good to taste!!

I can't wait to go back and have some more rolls ! Mouth watering!

Kolkata is famous for chicken roll,and if you want to taste the best roll available in the city then a visit to this place is a must.
Located in a small lane in park street,they serve all variants of rolls, from egg,veg,paneer,chicken mutton and you can add cheese for some extra rupees(be careful as adding cheese will make the roll saltier). size of roll is also very good.They also serve kababs but never had the opportunity to taste.¬†
Thus highly recommended.

Kusum Roll.. The best frankie or a roll in the city. i have been trying it from last 14 years and its the same. So whenever we travel to the city , make sure that one meal is a huge kathi roll from the place.it all fresh and rolled in front with multi option of meat or veggies. it's a pure indulge so please do not count the calories for that bit. ;). They cook the meat like satey stick and then tawa fry it to make the stuffing.

It's really a high rising roll corner currently in kolkata and i must say your visit won't disappoint you. there can be one small challenge to locate it. it's not exectly on the footpath, just cross the olypub and take left to the entrance of a building. kusum is just the first shop there. 

Regarding rolls, i have tried almost all the non-veg ones here. their mutton / egg mutton are my favourites. there is a provision to add cheese in any rolls and it will cost 20 rupees extra. but if you have an egg mutton cheese roll here, i am sure your stomach will be fulfilled for some times. their parathas are quite large and their best point is they use very very less oil in the roll parathas. this actually differs kusum from other renowned roll corners in park street area or in kolkata ( to some extent ). 

so, as a whole i should highly recommend this place if you want to have short snacks while roaming around park street...

Just took a bite or two from a friend who was having a Chicken roll with extra cheese and I had a really difficult time resisting myself to take a third bite. Yes, their rolls are that good. But honestly I found the cost of extra cheese ( 20 bucks at that time) really overpriced. Other than that I have nothing else to complain about. Service is really fast. This roll center is far better than the Hot Kathi Rolls.

Whenever I am walking down park street. I feel its my moral responsibility to stop in n have the double egg roll or the egg chicken roll. I dont know how they make it. But it is absolutely wow. The onions, capsicum,  chicken n sauce..n ofcourse the chillies.  And a masala that adds to the whole taste of rolls. I love love it.

If u wanna have the chicken rolls Kolkata is famous about then the one place to be is at Kusum. It has the best rolls in town, even though its miniscule eatery in park street but it has brand loyalty equaling any big outlet there. Do try the chicken rolls and I am sure you wont be disappointed. Service is fast, no seating and the staff too is courteous. They had opened an outlet in Siliguri a couple of yrs back which too garnered good crowds but the same has been shut down now

Location: At the entrance of Karnani Mansion, Park Street. 

This is a small eatery serving rolls and is¬†always crowded which itself states about it's quality. 
The rolls taste great, the service is quick and it's a pocket friendly affair. 
In case, you're in park street and prefer a filling quick bite with minimal pocket pinch, then this is a place for you to look out for. :-) 

Have tried the following: 

Paneer Roll: The Paneer pieces are tandoored I suppose, marinated in a flavourful spice-mix. 
The filling comprises of succulent and soft Paneer cubes, raw onion, sauces and a dash of lime! 
Chopped chillies being optional according to the taste and preferences. 
It tasted great overall.¬† 

Cheese Onion Roll: As the name suggests, filling comprised of sliced onion and cheese as the core ingredient. 
The cheese level being low, was a satisfactory bite to me. 

The Egg roll and the chicken rolls also tasted great as stated by my non-vegetarian mates. 

Just that the rolls are a little greasy, so in case you're on diet and avoid oily food, kindly avoid eating out here. :-) 

Overall a Good experience always. :-) 
Hasn't disappointed me.

One of the best location where you get the tastiest rolls in the city... Their MUTTON KEBAB ROLL is truely awesum...
Mutton roll for Rs50
Chicken roll for Rs 35
Often I try their Kabab platter
Mutton Sheek @ Rs 160 will surely take you to the Seventh Heaven of Taste...
This is a must try as evening snacks. Quiet pocket friendly..
No place to sit...

Located at the entrance of the Karnani mansion in Park street beside the iconic Oly Pub,this is one of the more popular roll outlets in the city.The place has been there ever since I had started visiting park street and has stood the test of time.The place is crowded at all times of the day which is testament to the popularity,quality and also of a  group of loyal followers of the place.

There are a various combinations of veg and non veg rolls on offer.I have found most of their rolls to be okay and not brilliant.The parathas are a little on the oily side.The quantity of filling in the roll is quite good.The rolls can be customised according to personal preferences.They generally do not add ketchup which I quite like.The liver roll deserves a special mention.The double egg double chicken rolls are also pretty good.

The prices are reasonable.The service is fast even when it is very crowded.In general a roll here is quite filling.
In short when you are looking for a pocket friendly quick bite in and around Park street this is a nice option.

After hearing a lot from my brother who visits here all the time whenevr he comes to kolkata for their rolls and kebabs ,we decided to hit it..as being students and without wasting pappa's money we try to find pocket friendly places in kolkata to grab a bite..this is one of a kind place..its beside the famous olypub and can be easily located in the park street area i dunno why i never saw it before..:p..and u juz cant miss this place's roll..
we ordered for egg chicken roll and double egg chicken and mutton rolls..it was heavenly..the parantha was less oily and extremely tasty with adequate chicken and mutton pieces in it..and everything was just in the right proportions...aaahhh!lovelyyyyy...

i would be trying their kebabs the next time..and the rolls were awesomeee...the quality of rolls they serve in such lower price is incredible..loved it...will be going there again!!

A Non bengali who has never had rolls and dont know what should be the benchmark. A lot of people recommended me to have rolls and different places around town. I tried a few and Kusums was one of my favorite. The few nice things i look for in Street food were all there. It was very crowded and hence i knew that they use daily fresh ingredients. I could customize the roll as he asked me what toppings and sauces i want. And there perfect taste with great value for money. I would recommend the egg mutton roll without any sauce. There are enough veg options as well. Located right in heart of park street.

Overrated, certainly not the best roll centre in Calcutta. Yes they do make nice double egg rolls and they make it without using bucketful of oil like their competitors.  But price is on higher side for a roadside stall.

A good place for a small snack. The food is good, the rolls obviously. They make them neat and fast too. But obviously the "ambience" is very bad. Crowded place, lots of people, no place to sit. But they arent aiming for a 5 start bar-cum-restaurant anyways. So whatever they are aiming at they have achieved it- fast and delicious food.

I have tried almost all their rolls and one thing I can say is that they serve the best and most amazing Rolls in Park Street. 

Not the best in Kolkata but you do not get anything cheaper than a hot Chicken Roll from Kusum in Park Street as a quick fix to your hunger pangs. Located conveniently in a narrow lane adjacent to the Party hub of Park Street it attracts a huge crowd of youngsters in the evenings. 

The kebabs are not very greasy and are tender and soft which makes for a perfect stuffing though I feel they can improve on their Parathas which don't have a very distinctive taste.

the wait time normally when i eat here is not more than 5 or 10 mins and the roll is divine to have... they make it as per your requirement and dont screw it up normally....

PERFECT!! I had tried several different roll centers in the area. None of them are compared to Kusum‚Äôs Roll. ‚ÄòKusum Snacks Bar‚Äô was located on Karnani Mansion just beside Olypub. Their double egg chicken roll & double egg double mutton rolls are freaking delicious and my favourites. The right balance of sauce, chillies, onions, capsicum, and the special spice which was the real secret of the rolls. The spice and flavours are awesome. Freshly made hot crunchy rolls will just melt in your mouth. The delivery was quick even there was a crowd.

How I used to frequent this place as a college goer. Their rolls are awesome. Except the brain roll they pretty much have kinds of rolls in their repertoire. I haven't tried their paneer rolls simply because I saw no reason to buy one when I could buy a chicken or mutton one.
Personally I don't prefer ketchup is my rolls so I always specify for it to be exluded. The parathas are fantastic and so are the kebabs. Don't count your calories when you grab a roll from here because they are very oily. But one roll doesn't hurt much or two. Definitely recommended.

This outlet is located on the drive of Karnani Mansion, adjacent to the McDonald's outlet. Probably one of the best roll-makers around, Kusum has had its fan of followers (read food-lovers) thronging it since I can remember. It is a rather ordinary place, makes ordinary rolls, just makes them well. They have the usual range on offer, from vegetable right down to mutton rolls, of course in various permutations and combinations.

I have had only the chicken and mutton rolls here. The parathas are soft and reasonably thin. The filling sufficient, and not dry as many others tend to make it. One roll can cure a smallish hunger pangs rather well. They do a fast job, so even if you see a crowd, you can be sure your turn will come soon.

Prices are very reasonable. The only negative aspect if there are no vendors selling Thums Up in the vicinity. They all have Pepsi :(

Please note This review is totally biased cause I am in love with the rolls since I was a child. 

This a small joint near mc d in park street. I could not understand why is it always crowded at any time of the day. But after taking a bite of the rolls they serve all my queries just vanish away. They always make fresh rolls which are served piping hot according to our taste. I love their egg paneer roll, egg chicken roll, double egg double chicken roll( which finishes my appetite for the entire day).  The rates are very kind to our pocket and the taste is heavenly.

It was my first visit to kolkata and rolls were definitely on the agenda. The first roll i had was in the new market area in the wow momo lane and it was amazing..juicy chicken, the perfect slightly crisp wrap and the yummy taste. That left me wanting more. So when I saw kusum rolls with quite a bit of crowd standing outside while strolling on park street. off i went. 

Lots of rolls on the menu..chicken, mutton, egg and ya veg too. I went for the simple chicken roll. They make the roll right in front of you. First the crisp and soft parantha which they lay out. Then a line of the chicken, some onions and ketchup and green chilies if you want. Fold, wrap and there you go.  Now the roll itself was good..nice covering, decent filling and the dash of ketchup giving it tanginess. But with the taste of that first roll still lingering, I was a tad disappointed comparatively.

However it looks to be a great place for a quick bite and seems to be quite popular as well. But if you are new and want to try kolkata rolls, then my reco would be the new market stall.

So this is a small eatery just in front of the Karnani Mansions compund in Park Street. During our college days, we would get high at Oly Pub, have the egg chicken rolls from here and then go listen to free rock music at Someplace Else! Lovely way to spend an evening eh? 

The rolls here are good to taste. I would not rate them to be as good as Zeeshan's since the latter serve the best rolls in town. The rolls are just good enough to be able to satisfy your hunger. It is a crowded place but they are fast and can serve rolls fast.

I would suggest go eat here only if you are short on cash and do not want to spnd much time in eating!

Located in a small lane which serves as the Park Street side entrance to the Karnani Mansions, Kusum Snacks Bar does not serve liquor :) What they do serve is delicious fast food at lower prices. ( As compared to the neighboring food establishments ) This makes them one of a kind on Park Street where eating out has shot up astronomicaly in recent times. Providing an array of delicious fast food options, Kusum is appropiate for grabbing a quick bite. The Paneer roll as well as the egg roll are all times favourites here. They also have a selection of sandwiches. Ever the innovator, they have introduced recently a new range of rolls prepared with mayonnaise and with cheese. Sample one. Try however to abstain from the tuna or the club sandwiches which are nothing like what they should be and are overpriced.
Not having even a few seats however, for patrons are a bummer. Also, the space gets cramped during rush hours or when cars pass through it. :( Also, as much as it pains me to say, the prices havestarted to rise quite dramatically in recent times.

Chakraborty Tips : Directly head over here if you..have lost your wallet / are a student / are on a budget / are not in the mood for burgers and Pizza / just dont wanna spend much / are all of the above.

Kusum is not just a mere roll shop on Park Street but also quite an epic one . They have a huge fan following and people in Delhi have asked me to pack rolls and bring them. Although its not one of my regular roll joints but i do like the double egg doubel mutton roll and the paneer roll . 

The paratha they make is not as flaky as Nizam but the dough is brilliantly seasoned. if they add a few lachhas to their dough it can make a brilliant place. 

As far as i am concerned ... they are decent ... not brilliant ...

During my schooldays, I would take the side of footpath where this Kusum Snacks Bar is located. After school, I use to take Metro from Park Street to return home. Every time I would pass-by this particular roll joint and I have had rolls from here only two times.

Frankly speaking, I did not like their roll at all. Their Chicken Roll was too spicy even though I told them not to add spice. The rolls are too oily and paranthas are very thick which makes you chew the rolls really hard. Good thing though that there is supply of Pepsi and other soft drinks in the next store, if after having the roll you feel spicy and that too on a hot day. They have standard menu that every roll joint should have. Prices are also more or less same as other roll joints.

The store itself is very shabby and looks unhygienic. The area around is smelly and dirty which again questions hygiene. The making time of rolls is fast though.

Finally, I am going to say that if you want better rolls and are ready to do a bit more walking, then you will should go for Hot Kathi Rolls which is on the same footpath located ahead of Kusum Snack Bar. They are much better and you will get to know this at once looking at the crowd difference.

Happened to visit the place after ages.Tried the egg chicken roll-my favourite. Honestly speaking , i found the roll to be pretty ordinary and was disappointed.It failed on both quality and quantity fronts.The parantha was chewy and not crispy as it should be.This was not expected from a place which used to be one of the top roll joints in the city.The stuffing of chicken was not adequate either and had tiny 4-5 pieces of chicken. This is one of the many joints in Kolkata which is surviving on past glory and goodwill.I am sure many roll patrons like me would have the same feedback about this place.The only saving grace is the prompt service and the reasonable pricing in a prime location.

Kusum- it was also there since my dads time. He used to tell me it is very famous for rolls. So I decided to give a visit here. It is located in a lane in parkstreet. I had tried chicken and egg roll here. 

Discussing the pros and cons now:-

Pros:-
1) roll is less oily as compared to mughlai roll makers
2) cheaply priced taking into consideration the area
3) located at the posh place
4) serves the local crowd of parkstreet

Cons:- 
1) quality degraded down the years. 
2) better options available
3) no innovation is taking place
4) no renovation.

Surviving due to its loyal customers. 

Must try: egg roll and chicken roll.

Incredibly crowded, full of bustle - Kusum is one of the most frequented places on Park Street. It makes very good rolls, and patrons would be wise to stick to the basic combinations, and not go for the more exotic versions. What one likes in particular about this place is that it uses good meat in kebab form for the rolls, unlike most roll shops in the city, that use leftovers or stringy meat and fry them or cook them in some sort of revolting curry.

My only regret is that Kusum has become a victim of its own success. It has to spend less time making each roll in order to serve the increasing number of customers, and the quality has dipped slightly over the last three or four years. This, if remedied, would be most welcome.

Kusum Rolls are pure comfort food .... if you like your rolls and most people in this city do then Kusum is a great place for a roll fanatic ..... they have been around for forever and my earliest memories are going to Karnani Mansion for my tutions and waiting for them to finish so I could rush and buy my self a roll to munch on my way home !  The egg chicken roll is my all time favourite and I highly recommend it ..... though I am not one for Veg Rolls my veggie friends say the  Veg and Paneer Rolls are really good !!!!

So, this was a hot evening where I was all about rushing back to work. But then Kusum called and I went back because they had... chicken liver rolls.

Now isn't that so delightful?

I went back, ordered myself a couple of rolls, one I ate standing there... chopped pieces of soft chicken liver and fried onions encased in a perfect, not too thin or too thick paratha, and as much green chillies my heart desired. The roll was possibly one of the best experiences of eating I have had, standing there, my entire being focused on the soft pillows of piping hot chicken liver.

I took the other one home to my sister, who ate, moaned, and sighed at the beauty of it. 

Also, I have never stood here for more than five minutes waiting for my roll. They are incredibly fast, efficient, and makes my roll just the way I like it.

Paratha is not that good but the place is very affordable with likewise food quality., and it is in park street too which attracts a lot of customers
