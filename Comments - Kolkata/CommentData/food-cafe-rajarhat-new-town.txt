Perhaps the only good thing about this place is that it is located inside Eco Park. Horrible food. The chicken pakoras were so bad that we couldn't finish even one properly. Even the tea is terrible here.

To be fair,  the chicken pieces in Chicken Pakora were huge and boneless. But then, the good things ended here, since the chicken was bland and the batter was just only maida. Given that it is located in such a prime location facing a wonderful water body inside Eco Park and the kind of footfall it draws, it should have been a fast food dream location - but sadly it seems like an opportunity totally squandered away.
