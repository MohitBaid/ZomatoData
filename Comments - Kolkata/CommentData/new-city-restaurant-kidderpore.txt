Had ordered the following from this place(order was well before time) -

Chicken Biryani - Was tasty, less masala & less oil.Simple, light and pretty good.

Roomali Roti - Was almost perfect. Will definitely order again.

Plain Paratha - Was nice, thick though quite heavy(just as parathas are)

Chicken Bharta - Was extremely delicious and lovely but it was terribly less in quantity.At Rs.130,it should be filling for at least 2 people but this was just enough for one !! Please increase the quantity. It was very annoying !! 

Mutton Keema - Simply awesome. But again the quantity was very less. (They charged Rs.60 for it only so it's still understandable)

Overall, it's a really nice place for Mughal delicacies, extremely tasty and not overpriced. I'll definitely order again (telling them to provide better quantities this time) !!

I had ordered a mutton biryani from here. The food was ok but they took way lot of time to deliver the order. Had to wait for almost 1hr 45 mins to receive it. Overall not a very satisfying experience.

Order food at 2:07 pm. And received at 4.45pm. spoke to them hotel guys at 3 o'clock owner told me delivery boy will leave now, As your phone. Is not reachable before. I told okay. After speaking to them I had to wait for more 1 hrs 45 mins for the order.
Delivery boy told me he was in Uber pool for more than 3 hours. Food was pathetic it was cold.
And mutton buryani was cold. Mutton not properly cooked looked like 75 rupees one which I can see local guys eating on road. What a waste of money and time for the shit they gave.
Never I my life I will order from them.
They gave bill of 1120 but bill was according to zomato only 1030. So extra 90rupees I payed. Extra money for the cold food that was I think mostly packed in the hotel write next to my home. 
I don't want else to say . Waste experience ever.

The food was not that good, price was ok... but I think in the matter of food all that matter is taste. So poor Quality for me, interior is nice.
Go there only when you're hungry or can't find any place near Zoo and this area.

One of the nicest and neatest restaurant I've been to. Their reshmi kebab is one of the most tastiest dish I've ever tasted. Anyone who wants to go there should order reshmi kebab, I'm sure you'll love it! :)

Kidderpore is a wonderful place for cheap Moglai Food. New City Restaurant is one of the many Restaurants. During the morning one can savour Halwa-puri . During lunch one can treat oneself with lovely muglai food without pinching one's pocket. Food is good and worth the money paid. However hygiene is a concern. Beef is not served in this restaurant , so devout Hindus can patronise this restaurant.
