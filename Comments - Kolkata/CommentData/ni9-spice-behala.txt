This is my first review on Zomato and I will divide my thoughts about this place in two parts. 

1. The food: The Chicken Hyderabadi here was delicious while the Szechuan chicken was equally tasty being sweet and spice at the same time and being very rich. 

2. The chair is a tad uncomfortable as it was slanting to one side.

The bill comes with:
Tandoori roti: 25

Chicken bharta: 200

Justification: it's for gst.. Do you have any mention of cgst or sgst on your bill? No..

The best part of the restaurant was its decor n its ambience, the tangy chicken in the starter n the tandoori roti was awesome, ordered garlic fried rice whose taste was good but the quantity was less in comparison, only the chicken masala was not at all satisfying as I felt it was too sweet n could have been made much spicier,,Anyways as a suggestion for nearby restaurants from Zomato, would rate it at 3•5/5, overall experience was not bad@

I could've given it 3 star until Sept 29 2017.
They waited on us for more than 1 hour.
The table beside us got their food 30 mins ago while they reached after us.
-After an hour of waiting the food came,
Voila, the waiter came with wrong food.
-We asked the manager (Beardo)what was happening and he replied us with attitude.
-Never going again and Never will recommend some one.
PS - To the beardo guy, Learn some hospitality before opening restaurant.

Went here yesterday. Ordered tangy crispy chicken, ni9 spice special fried rice n drunken chicken.
It felt like we were tearing leather with our teeth. The crispy chicken was crispy by name only. It was of very low quality. In the rice the brocoli were not fried/boiled. They were hard. The side dish too was not good. Over the top they on our arrival served us a kinley bottle stating their aquaguard was not working. They charged 30rs for the bottle. Horrible service. Confused staff.

It is quite rare for people to rate restaurant for their ability to prepare food at bulk quantity and still make it delicious. I had hosted an ACC Cement conference in Ni9 spice yesterday and I must say that after the event, both as organizer and as a diner was satisfied. Starters included chicken drumstick and baby corn followed by a main course of chicken biryani.
I would highly recommend this restaurant if you wish to host any kind of party or event with the price being reasonable to the pocket as well.

Talking about the food, it's menu is build with a lot of consciousness and the dishes are twisted and redone to make it healthy and benefiting.Try some new dishes like Hyderabadi Chicken Curry which is not in the listed they taste well though & delicious.

Their naan and kulchas are superb. Kashmiri aloodam was the only dish that didnt manage to satisfy my taste buds, i wasnt expecting it to be on the sweeter side. Rest all was great. Looking forward to visit the restaurant soon.

Had a very good experience today at this place. Lovely ambience and modern decor. Delicious food at reasonable prices. We ordered chicken biriyani with chicken masala which was a marriage made in heaven. The chicken masala also went very well with naan and the raita accompanied with the biriyani was like the icing on the cake. The service was perfect as well. The only glitch is its location as one can never imagine a place serving food of this quality can be located in this area. However it is a different story after you enter! Lovely experience overall!

Both are mouth watering and best kebab ...i  have ever eaten..keep up the good work Ni9 spice.

The restaurant is barely spottable. What I can put it as is a hole in the wall.

Pros: The food is delicious- try the pan-fried fish, the chicken tandoori and the chicken momos. They totally stood out. The Manchow soup was too good. The Blue Hawaii is a soothing drink and a must have at this place.
They are very tech savy- they use a tablet to take the orders.

So what went wrong: The SERVICE. Attention to detail. I asked the waiter for more fried noodles in the soup which fell on deaf ears. I asked again and this time the waiter disappeared and never came.
The sauce I wanted to add to my soup had a dead mosquito. I asked another waiter to replace it. He brought the set from another table and this time again there was a dead mosquito in the sauce. The waiter took away the sauce and did not bother to bring a substitute.
The water served on the table is so stale. I almost spit back the water into the glass (and I think I did).
And then comes the worst of all- no cards taken for payments- yeah they accept Paytm though.
Review on zomato and get 5% off- no they did not give any discount. They did not even ask us to review.
Horrible songs- they play songs re-sung by budding artists and trust me you cannot listen to them.

But you know if taste and ambience is one part of the story experience and hygiene is another part.
You have lost it on the second half and a 0 in this part means a 0 rating on the whole. The 2 rating is also for the food

This place is small and well decorated near Behala Chowrasata and serves some nice Chinese food with pocket friendly price.
We have odered 

Konji crispy Chicken: this was not soo good. This dish was too much crunchy that taste of chicken didn't strike on tongue.

Pan fried fish: This was something I love about this place. Fish was sell cooked with all balance flavour of sauce and spring onion. 

Mixed Hakka Noodles: This was good in taste 
 I loved it

Schezwan Chicken: This was not so much good as we expected. Chicken was well cooked with balanced flavor of sauce

All over most good part about this place is so pocket friendly. @

Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Pasta,Mixed Fried Rice and HongKong chicken  !! Quality and Quantity absolutely satisfying.The staffs are extremely well behaved..always there for you.Alright the Pasta is extremely well cooked with the right amount of spices, tastes extremely well,must try.Next the rice and the chicken its very nicely done the quantity is enough for 2 people.

Overall the first experience was awesome.Please do visit as it's a really good and pocket friendly eating house located close to Sakuntala Park Bust Stop.

It's a new place near Shankuntalla Park with nice decorations and ambience. The staff is good. The place is cosy. We have tried both Chinese  & Indian. We find Chinese  was better in main course. But in starters we had tried Crispy Chicken the taste was good but it was too hard to eat.
In Indian we had tried Chicken Biriyani -  this was not up to the mark. It needs a lot of improvement.
In Indian we have also tried Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Butter Nan, & Dal Makhani.
 Dal Makhani  was not good as the salt was less, the quantity of makhana  in the portion of dal was high, & even the rajma was not soaked properly. Rest 2 items were nice.

It's a new place near to Shakuntala park bus stand on the Buren Roy Road (west), Behala. The decoration of the place is fine, not much decorated but it's adequate. The behaviour of the staff is good and they will help one in ordering. I tasted chicken Nizami kabab as started and it was good. Well cooked and was tasty. They served it with salad and chutney. The masala kulcha was really good accompanied by kadai chicken. That's one of the reason for the rating. The chicken biriyani and the mutton biriyani was something but definitely not a biriyani. The smell, essence, taste of biriyani was missing. It was just as if chicken/mutton pieces was placed in a bowl of polau. Mutton biriyani will be having two small pieces of mutton and chicken biriyani will be having one big piece of chicken which justifies the price. The major disappointment came with butter chicken. The chicken was a bit smelly, initially when told the manager defended himself by terming it to be the smell of tomato puree but later when told to taste it himself, he agreed it to be the smell of the chicken. As a compensation we were served a glass of cold drinks but serving smelly or rotten chicken is something that's just not accepted. The other reason for the rating was the chocolate brownie with icecream. It was just awesome. The brownie was soft and served hot and the ice cream was served with molten chocolate. It will just melt in your mouth.The quantity was good. Chicken dishes with bones contains six pieces whereas the boneless ones contain four.  Overall the place is low on one's pocket but definitely would need to improve on the quality of the food they serve.

We ordered chicken and mutton biryani and Hyderabadi chicken, I must say the taste and quality of the biryani was too good, certainly satisfied me. Moreover the quantity was really crazy enough to satisfy three persons easily only with two biryani.. the atmosphere and the attendants were also good. Completely value for money experience, I don't think there are many restaurants around this place which can offer so much.

Went there last night with my parents. Located just opposite of the LIC training building at shakuntala park; easy to locate. Not very spacious , around 30 people can accommodated at a time. Neat n clean, nicely decorated.
          We ordered lemon peanut chicken as starter and it was really good. Chicken was well marinated and juicy inside. Then we placed the order of NI9 special mixed noodle, drunken chicken and plain tandoori roti. Noodle was good, less oily. It contains chicken, prawn, mushroom, egg, broccoli and other vegetables. drunken chicken was pretty ordinary. rotis were served hot and well prepared.
           At last we ordered blue hawai mocktail and brownie with vanila ice cream. mocktail was not tasty and nothing special.
           Overall a good experience. Drinking water can be served cold. Couldn't understand why they didn't accept the credit card.

A very preetily decorated small restraunt over Biren Roy Road, just opposite to LIC training center.Interiors are very tastefully done with some classical musick, and extremely well regulated Air-conditioning.

Now coming to the food, decided to have Fish Tikka Kabab & Crispy Chicken as Starters.
Fish Tikka Kabab -had six pieces of juicy fish pieces, and was very well decorated with garnish though did not get the taste of charcoaled or tandoori flavour.
Chrispy Chicken as portioned was sufficient for three, slightly sweet in taste and was crisp from outside but not soft from inside.Presentation or dishing was pretty good, in comparison to local standards.

In main course, ordered for Chicken Butter Masala and plain tandoori roti.Ended the meal with Masala Cold drink.
Tandoori Roti was soft and uniformly done, and did not get stiff even after being under Air-conditioning for some time.
Chicken Butter Masala had four pieces of chicken and the gravy was smooth and creamy and@ had the perfect balance of spices.
Over all food taste wise is better than any other out let over Biren Roy Road, ambience is above average, and the best in this part of Behala.Prices are moderate and inclusive of taxes in the menu. Good place to take family and friends for small lunch or dinner.

The taste of biriyani and Manchurian was great.. and service was also good.. bt mutton kosha was ok. Overall it's pretty well.

Went to try out this place which is two minutes away from my home on this lazy evening. Let's get over with the bad things first, we had planned to try out their chello kabab and nalli nihari- both weren't available. Though the staffs were gracious but service was way too slow. They made us wait for an hour or so cumulatively for all the dishes. Not cool. Now let's come to the good things. We had ordered pan fried chicken, lemon peanut chicken, butter naan and laal mass. All of them tasted really well with the pan fried chicken being the show stealer but the mutton being a little too stiff for my taste. I was impressed with their small but interesting interiors and they had a food channel going on in the background which did a lot for my hunger. So brownies for that too. I will surely visit again maybe when I have a lot of time to spare and eat.

Simply awesome... Loved the decor as well as the food. Good to have it so near us. The noodles were too good. The mocktails needs to be improved Authentic Chinese.

Finally a good fine dinning restaurant has come up near shakuntala park..visited with family on their inaugural day...quite impressed with their presentations n interiors..
We ordered for malai kofta,palak corn,butter naan, sarson wali fish, n  chicken  biryani..blue lagoon was  served  as complimentary..
The food was  nice except the malai kofta as it was too sweet...The  quality n quantity of the food was really good and pocket friendly  too...
My personal favourite is Chicken Steamed Momo.....very delicious..This is going to be one of my regular food joint for sure.

Location is on the main road. Decor is sweet and small sized restaurant.
Food- tried Chinese food. it was so delicious. The chicken was soft and fresh. The quantity is quite good for 2.

Service - it's not up to the mark. The waiters don't know what to give on the tables. They forgot to give us the plates.
But for good food you can surely try this one within budget.
