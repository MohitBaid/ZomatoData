Today I ordered the mix cheese pizza and pav bhaji from Marwar sweets and snacks, seriously the product taste was very much low quality, cheap, no taste in pav bhaji and cheese pizza.

Bhaji quantity was very much but no taste, so I suggest you too decrease the quantity of bhaji but give the good quality in taste. Otherwise it's difficult to continue the order in future.

Pizza also no taste.

So hope you serve the good quality in taste in future...

I am not happy with today's quality of taste.
