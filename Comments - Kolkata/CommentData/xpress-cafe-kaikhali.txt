Wow Xpress Cafe, this place is located deep in the Eastern jungles of sunderban haha. We had to walk all the way from haldiram to this place in panchavati shyam baba complex. This cafe is situated under a residential Bldg with only 2 seats to sit. We ordered Cheese Grilled Vada Pav which was made well. The amount of Cheese added was perfect. The green chutney was made well as well. Than we ordered Onion Pakoda or Pyazi, which was 6 pieces a plate. My partner never enjoyed it a lot, but I found it satisfactory. Than we ordered a Masala Tea and Cold Coffee. The Masala Tea was made well priced at RS 7 a Cup so was the Cold Coffee at RS 50 a Cup. Over all I would never visit this isolated island again.

Food is not up to mark. Rates are really very low and competitive ¬†but food taste and quality is not so much good. Cafe owner needs to change there quality. I tries Cheese vada paw and maggi, not so good. Onwer please go and taste the cheesy vada paw of Pepperz at Bangur, the finger licking taste with full of cheese and mayonnaise and braed quality was so soft. Please improve your quality.

Friend I stay in nearby complex of Xpress cafe. Frankly speaking I didnt liked the food so much. Shakes are very thin and equivalent to water, less sugar, less chocolaty. ¬†I ordered for fried idly and what i got was normal idly just fried in oil with onion. It was very tight in texture as well. I didnt liked the cafe. Better to visit Nikunj cafe in the same complex and a meter away for Xpress cafe.
