The decor,service and ambience is nice.A small and cute cafe in the lanes of golpark.I ordered Virgin Mojito and Orange drink.Both were okayish,the sugar was not mixed properly.So I didn't have the courage to try the food.Might try next time.

Close to golpark this place can be really tricky to locate. But it is an ideal place for tea lovers. The place has a good variety of tea, all of which are priced adequately without burning a hole in the pocket. But the joint doesn't have a good deal of options as far as food is concerned and also the time taken to serve the food is exhausting. 
If you love tea and have a lot of time at hand to spare then this is the ideal place for you.
P.s. coffee lovers can give it a skip.

Teaching in South City College for the last 16 years never made me come accross this cafe until recently.Its hidden in a lanebeside my college.But the location is very easy if you know there is a cafe there.You just walk straight and straight through the labne adjoining Mouchak Golpark until you hit a house , just gaze left and there you get Tea Time Stories.Its a very cosy place with amazing staff,I did not meet the owner, as she was not there that day.
The decor is good with tea cups hanging all around.Its a homely feeling there with no disturbance at all.If you want to sneak a respite this is the ideal place for you.The server will suggest you dishes from the simple , small yet innovative menu.
We tried my all time favourite Ear Grey Tea, Iced Tea and Mexican Chimicaguda(spelling may be wrong).All of them were brilliant.I think tea boutiques should be such where you get authentic good and original tea.Great Times ahead if you go on promoting your cafe well- Tea Time Stories!!!

A small cafe, not so difficult to locate,with a homely environment.
They have a wide variety of teas.Loved their home made cake and cheese garlic bread.The masala and the lemon tea is not that good .An extremely pocket friendly cafe.

Nice Place Homely Atmosphere and good food with pocket friendly charges.... A thumbs up from me... the only Problem is the Location.... If Directions are given from golpark , it will be easier to find for the newcomers....

Loads of stories over tea.
Usually empty, this place gives a very homely feeling with cups hanged around the window and comfy chairs. 
The owner is extremely cordial and recommends few dishes. On my several occasions i have tried almost everything. Amongst which Shepherds Pie is my favourite. Minced chicken, correcetly spiced with potato mash on top, layered with cheese. Its a whole some dish and is not very heavy. The sandwiches too are great, which comes with great chips by its side. Another highly reccomended dish is the Mexican HotPot, which is the pasta cooked in tomato gravy, baked to perfection with goodness of cheese. 
The fish fingers are crispy, and fresh.
They dont have coffee, but many varieties of tea. I strongly recommend the lemonade as  well.   
A perfect place for a quite date, or great brunch. 
Extremely reasonable. And no tax!

Tucked away in a bylane near Golpark(Gariahat) this cafe is hard to come by. The food may not be great but the key take away was the "TEA". Â Aptly named, this quiet little homely cafe serves superb Green Jasmine and Masala Tea. The sandwich is not that great, but for a tea lover this is a must visit.

Though this place has got poor rating, it was nearest to where I was, so decided to visit.
1st things 1st. Totally basic interior. No other guests were there so it was really calm and quiet inside.
The person who attended us was extremely courteous. Hats off to his service.
We ordered a Green tea, a Smoked tea, a Chicken Egg Sandwich and a fruit cake.
Now, the tea was totally average. Chicken Egg Sandwich was good. Grilled perfectly and moist inside. Filling was adequate. Cake I think was bought from some local store. Tasted okayish.
Price is cheap. Really cheap.

I just couldn't find the place. Called them up 9-10 times to ask about the location and they didnt even pick up. Please, kind sir, pick up the phone if anyone calls you up, it's probably about the location.
