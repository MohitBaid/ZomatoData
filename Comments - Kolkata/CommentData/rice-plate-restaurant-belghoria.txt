It's a streetside food joint located at Belgharia.

Ambience is shabby and unhygienic.

Took away Roti & Egg tarka. Quantity was sufficient. Tastewise, it was nice.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

A casual dining place. I took away Egg Tarka and Chicken Kasa a plate each with Roti while returning from Belgharia late evening. Both Egg Tarka and Chicken Kasa was good. Egg Tarka was of good quantity. One plate of Egg Tarka can be sufficient for 5 rotis.
Prices are very reasonable. Food is clean and hygienic.

It's a very small road side food joint. It's located near one of my friend's college.The quality and quantity of food is quite good and pocket friendly too!

Ya finally this on zomato... this restaurant is a below average restaurant.. food are extremely cheap but really no hygenicity is maintained...
Previously the chicken chap used to be good but has taste has been detoriating day by day..
Recently sitting arrangements have been improved but still no change in the quality of food... :-(
