I love the place for the dosas that they make and the variety of it. The range is enormous. The dosas are crispy with perfect amount of spice to the starchy filling that goes inside. No extra tinge of oil messing around on the plate which sometimes happen at some eateries. No wonder why they make some of the best dosas in Kolkata

Checked In This Outlet While i went to get myself few spices from the market , 
Ordered a quick Steamed Idli and Watermelon Juice ,
Steamed Idli was Decent and Chutneys were Great !
But sadly The Watermelon juice was a great Turn Off ! Extremely Sweet ! Too much of sugar added to the fruit juice which spoilt the taste !
Pocket Pinch was Low ! So would not mind to check in again to try other items though if i order juice again i would instruct them not to add sugar at all !!!

This is a veg resturant just opposite to New Empire cinema hall in Esplanade. They serve both north Indian food but look like they specialises in dhosa mainly.
We had chole batora and a north Indian ved thali along with pineapple juice and sweet lassi.
The quality of food is really great and quantity is more than enough. If you're looking for a veg resturant in new market, then sarang is a good choice.

Being a dosa lover I'd say they've one hell of a menu(in a good sense!!)...you should see their list of dosa... different varieties...great taste...I visited there twice... it's an all taxes inclusive restaurant... they've both AC & non-ac parts... service is quick...today we ordered baby corn cheese masala dosa (105 bucks) & butter idli (50 bucks)...food was absolutely mouthwatering and worth every penny. Situated beside sreeram arcade, this old place is certainly worth a try if you are a south Indian food lover.
PS: the only reason I deducted a mark is because the seating arrangement is a bit inadequate n congested..I had to stand for 7 minutes today outside in the rain:(

Went to eat here after some hectic shopping at New market. The upstairs was air conditioned and has a different and a more pricey menu compared to the ground floor but it was less crowded and the food was value for money.
We had veg roll, paneer roll, orange juice and cold coffee. The rolls were light and tasty and the cold coffee was refreshing. For a bill of meagre 218/- we were completely full so full value of money. The staff behaviour was slightly off but no other complaints.

Located at one of the busiest market of Kolkata, in front of New Empire Cinema. Offers lots of cuisines, street foods. There are two sections,  ground floor is non A.C nd 1st floor is Air conditioned. Tried their paper masala dosa, the size was amazing and so the taste. The dosa was so crispy. Their Papdi Chat is also one of the best Papdi chat ever tried. Price is reasonable but the ambience was not so impressive.

The dosa was good no complaints. 
The kulfi however was not at all satisfactory. It was half melted and served with less of falooda and rose syrup. We asked the waiter to add some rose syrup to it but he did not.

The most horrible restaurant in new market area. We got "rice" in the lassi and the lassi was thick (as if made of generous quantity of dahi). The lassi from lower part of the glass was hot and in the upper part, some almost melted pieces of ice were floating. It was way too sweet. So any one can clearly make out what this "thick" lassi was made of!!!!!!!!!! Horrible...

I have only had South Indian foods from here every time after shopping or visiting nearby for any purpose.

Food quality is good. Service is fast.
But the space is small and hence is congested.

Another restaurant in new market which serves north and south indian Cuisine with fresh fruit juices and ice creams. Establish in two floors. 1st floor was AC section and ground section fan section practically. Ambience was good. Hospitality was very nice and warming. Service in reasonable time. Presentation was average. I liked more their north indian Cuisine over south indian. Today I tried their kesar pista kulfi which was purely made and tastes Delicious. Loved it. Must try place. Recommended to all.

Located near Sreeram Arcade.It is a duplex  restaurant where, the second floor is air conditioned.I visited this place thrice and I am in love with their dosas. The cheese and paneer dosa with capsicum was absolutely blissful.They add cheese very generously in their dosas.  I did not like their sambar and chutney much but,the dosa was delicious
The staff is not very good.Every time either they place a wrong order or make mistakes in the bill.The place is fine.Good place if you just wanna fill up your tummy.Not a place for people who are particular about good ambience. The AC worked quite fine.

Well...it was raining outside..🌧and starving we were with only few bucks in our pockets..😞.. so we wanted a place to sit,spend some time and eat where the food is pocket frinedly to us. 😀

I have been to Sarang two-three times earlier. But forgot to write a review somehow. Situtated opposite to the KFC,near Sreeram Arcade. So ok...its just a roadside small south indian resturant with sitting arrangements of max 40-50 people. They have 95 varieties of dosa..isn't that great??😊 

So we ordered masala dosa,butter masala dosa...butter onion uttapam and one plate idly. They served within 10mints.

 Two idly costed 35..and those were big fat shaped idly seved with sumbar and chutney. 😃

The dosa was really good and I loved the crispiness,the potato inside the dosa was enough in quantity. The butter masala dosa smelled so good..with every bite I could feel the buttery taste.It tasted yummy,tasty and we all loved this one too much..😍. 

Thn the uttapam..one of the best uttapams I ever had.. it had the perfect texture,colour,taste, crispiness of onions and the butter made it heavenly. Ohh!! I loved it too..👌 

And after all this the bill was 180... 😇🤗

The staff service and sitting arrangements can be done better a little bit,thats all I can say.🤔

 We also had ice cream cones there, each cone costed 12-15rupees. 🍦So atlast we were so full,and happy for our pockets..😋,the ice cream at the last made it a perfect end to our evening. 😊☺

This was a Poila Baisakh day out! 
I was actually not much aware of this place till a few days back when this name came up... 'Sarang'... Well this is a small place... The ground floor is non-AC and the upper floor has an AC. I however feel the upper floor is more congested but that's OK as far you get an AC in this heat... 
Coming to food... Well I am a South Indian cuisine live... Dosas to be more precise and here you are quite spoilt for choice... V took a cheese onion butter masala dosa which was just yum and what I loved equally was the pineapple ice cream shake... And also the mango one... 
Well one thing which I thought was funny and weird was we were given the bill when we were just planning to order another dosa... N I really don't know the reason for so much hurry... Well I am sure that was unintentional... 
Whatever .. I loved the food and this is going to be a permanent choice for dosas from now on..
Cheers!!! :):):)

Love south Indian cuisine? Then you must must must visit this place in the prominent area of New market. Sarang is a really popular place among vegetarians. They have a non air conditioned seating area at the ground floor and an air conditioned one with rarely 10 people to fit in at the first floor. Service is quick and I cannot particularly recommend any one or two dosas or uttapams since I have tried many and each one is as good as the other. The authentic taste of sambar and the chilly sour chutney they serve along with the khatta pickle is just yum!! They also serve chhole bhature which is lip smacking. Quantity is good and the amazing tastes will surely make you long to come to this place again and again. I personally, absolutely adore this place being a vegetarian! 😊

An ordinary little eatery just opposite to KFC , few walks away from sreeram arcade.

Since , I had some work in esplanade and was running out of time. So I wanted something really quick that too totally light.

Since its an ordinary awkward restaurant, I hesitated at first , 
And its quite natural because sarang is a place to eat good ignoring the ambience.

It has both Ac and non Ac floors.
So I chose to sit upstairs that was AC.


Ambience - The little cabin smells really bad in spite of having AC.

Food - I ordered Masala cheese dosa , chole bhature , Sarang special thaali , mixed chaat and chocolate ice cream shake.

Masala cheese dosa - Amazing! It was really nice with the sambar and the chutney.

Chole bhature - spicy yet tasty ! Loved those extra sized bhature and well cooked chaney.

Sarang special thaali - It had 4 poori's, A plate of jeera rice , sambar, , achar , matar paneer and rayeta . Matar paneer was full of salt and not at all edible, the other items were nice.

Mixed chaat - It is great for chaat lovers. 

Chocolate ice cream shake - Do not try their shakes and coffee. Not to blame them because they specialize in south Indian not desserts  so,

If you want to eat well in very less price and real quick. Sarang is for you !

We always sit in the AC upper area. The name of the dosa's are so long but I think longer the name better the taste. Hi hi. The stuffs could be better. Half the time they don't listen to you . The service is really late. You have to wait a good 20 mins before receiving your food. Good place for normal hangout with friends. Very cheap and reasonable.

I am sure nobody would check zomato prior to visiting this bistro, still if anybody does, please avoid this shop. This place is wastage of money, time and death of some taste-buds.  Sandwiches are arid and stale, Dosa isn't crisp and juice is adulterated with water in the ratio of 1:1. Only visit this place if all the shops in the vicinity are closed and you are dying out of hunger.

Its located at such a prime location, people could have done wonders; still this place depress me.

I apologize for this disrespectful review, I hope the owner takes it as a scope to improvise.

After a long days shopping, Sarang came to the rescue. It's huge selection of dosas is mesmerising and some names are so long that it's simply fun just to try and say the name to the waiter. They are generous with the cheese and other ingredients. Even idly,  chola bhatura is quite tasty. Although I didn't like the pakodas that they serve but it's brilliant when it comes to dosa.

This review of mine is solely based on the quality of food there and not on the local and/or centralised ambience, given the fact that it is a street outlet and not some high-end restaurant. 
I visited this quite famous outlet half tired and half soaking in rain. At first look, the place is a bit compact and one could feel a bit hassled if they are travelling with lots of stuff. I was given a table at the ground floor (the non AC section). 
I ordered a paneer dosa and one of my friends had an onion dosa. The food came quick enough and dear boy,  was the dosa huge? For one shade of my hunger, the dosa was two shades of huge. Really huge. And tasty. Sumptuous is the word. 
I tried a mix chaat too and it was equally more than enough for two persons. I didn't like the chaat though, it was not as spicy as I would have liked but no real complaints there. 
The pricing is decent and the menu is really extensive. Deserves over and again visits.

My review is based solely on my indulgence of desserts in here. After a long tiresome day,we decided to drop in here to have some of their renowned kulfi with faluda. Since i am not a very big fan of south indian delicacies,i kept my order to a minimum and ordered kulfi and fresh mango juice to quench my thirst.

This food corner is not small but looks like an old place which is not very well maintained though they seemed to be very well versed with their preparations and people seemed to be enjoying their south indian picks. Service wasn't fast for just an order of a kulfi and juice. We had to wait for over 15mins to get our order done.

The kulfi was really very tasty and delectable along with the faluda which accompanied it quite well. I enjoyed every bite of it. The juice was also very fresh and was just perfectly sweet. It was pulpy and thick. I loved it too. The quantity was also good. A large mug was enough to quench the thirst of both of us.

Overall,a really pocket friendly joint with a large variety of south indian dishes and some awesome kulfi,lassi and juices. Would drop in again soon when around new market.😉

Inspite of not having an appealing rating on Zomato, I will rate it fair.
On a hot sultry exhausted noon, they served us the best they could.

And the Malai Kulfi was so relieving.

Tired of eating at kfc and nizam's, me and my friend tried out Sarang one day. We went were seated at the upper floor a.c section. The place was dimly lit, low ceilinged (i banged my head twice), but it was a comfy place. The downstairs section is brightly done up. So, the decor and ambience was usual .
Coming to the food, we ordered dosa and kulfi. The food was good. The price is affordable. But I thought the dosas were a little overpriced.

Me and My sister went shopping to New Market and after going around the place for sometime we were literally tired and wanted to snack on something. But, we never wanted to try the street food and entered Sarang. We ordered for Chole Bhature and coffee. The place is small but was nice and neat. The waiter was cleaning the table very often to maintain the hygiene. 

Chole Bhature was very tasty and tasted like an authentic Punjabi one. It was offered with Pickles and Onions. Coffee was offered in paper cups and it was great to freshen us up. The place is very economical and is great for the taste, and hygiene it offers in that area. A must try break from your shopping in the new market. Don't forget to try the famous Kulfi out there.

Dis shop is located beside shreeram arcade.
Though not very big,they have somehow managed to build an a.c section in the upper floor which is decorated ndimly lighted. 
Chaat,dahi vada etc are average but i personally love their chaan batora.
A plate of it consists of two large  batoras (absolutely soft,hot and crispy everytime),generous serving of chaana ,achhar n salad.

If you have had enough of KFC and DOMINO's or you are tired of the space crunch in KFC and late delivery in Domino's you should try this North Indian and South Indian restaurant just opposite to New Empire Cinema and beside Sreeram Arcade. 
Don't expect awesome ambiance, good music and stuffs like that. What you get here is quick service and very cheap price menu.

Have tried PLAIN ONION DOSA, CHOLE BHATURE, DAHI VADA, COLD COFFEE and the STRAWBERRY LASSI. If you are very hungry and have very short time go there have your food and leave asap.

A small south Indian joint near New Market in Esplanade, serving quality food and also maintaining a good reputation in cleanliness.. Unlike other street food joints in Esplanade, they both keep their price to a minimum and also a maintain a hygenic place to enjoy your food.. 
This place serves a lot of items, mango lassi and kulfi being my two favorites.. 
Would cost around 100inr for a couple..

A family pave for quick snack. Sitting is a little tight but food is good. Upstairs ac is a cozy one. South Indian delicacies are better than North Indian here.

The service is not that good, even the quality is not appropriate with the price, the sambar dal and chutney are very flaccid. Even when a refilling is asked, they take quite a lot of time to do so. Don't know about the non A.C, but personally experience wasn't that great.

Again an old favorite of my mom!
Earlier whenever we were in new market we always ate from this particular joint until (and I remember this very very vividly) I threw up once after eating here ( I must be 5-6 years old), :P

Anyway went here again sometime back and I was literally dreading idk why!
Loved the juice they prepared and besides that we ordered chola bhatura and dosa. 
The bhatura was as I remembered it- huge and crisp. The chola however could've been better. 
The dosa was good though and the service was fast enough.

Was a decent place to visit and the food was average but was like any other south Indian food joint. Was missing any special touch.
Space is okay and can be a good place to sit down with group and have food with bit of chit chat. However do not expect any kind of real taste to come up to your tables as they are all decent but not having any special taste. Does not hurts pocket much as well so can be considered as an option.

Shopping with friends at New Market, Kolkata is fun, but what add to your excitement are the refreshments and snacks that you can have in various food joints near New Market. But, sometimes your luck is not on your side, and it is on those times that you get to taste most awful food in these food joints. At least this is what happened to me last time when I hit Sarang, a popular food joint near New Market. Tired after our day's shopping, my friend and I decided to drop in at Sarang and recharge ourselves with cool fruit juice and some munchies.
 
Well, I did not particularly like their ambience. The place was too congested and the constant whirr of the fan irked me. Nevertheless we were hungry and we wanted to dig into some lip smacking snacks to satiate our appetites. At first, we ordered some apple juice and orange juice (my friend had orange juice and I preferred apple juice). I was peeved at the way they served our juice. Cleanliness and personal hygiene were overlooked in this place. The waiters served our juices in unclean glasses. And to make matters worse, they hardly paid any attention when we complained. My apple juice tasted sour and my friend complained that there were seeds in her orange juice. We were quite exhausted and hungry and ordered two masala dosas. Though we had a very bitter experience with our fruit juice, we at least expected our dosas to be fresh, hot and crisp as it is offered in almost all roadside joints. But, something else was in store for us. 

The waiter arrived with our dosas after forty five minutes. The dosas had lost their crispiness, it seemed that the cook had prepared it 10 minutes back but the waiter delayed in bringing our plates. In addition, the dosa stuffing was rotten. The vegetable mixture emitted the typical fermented odor and tasted awful.  We tasted a few morsels and put our plates aside (we didn't want to fall ill eating those rotten dosas). Both the owner and the waiters were oblivious to our complaints. It seemed to me that they are used such cribbing and complaints from their customers.  I would suggest everyone not to visit Sarang. It serves unpalatable, rotten food to their customers and their service is just so amateurish!

This is just opposite to new empire...
Its a cheap snacks bar.
Not good for lunch or dinner.. their food is reasonably cheap, and food quality is OK.. their Chana Batora ia my favourite.
The ground floor doesn't have air conditioning, but the first floor does. service is very fast, staff is as we can expect in a mediocre place. But everyone must try their kulfi, its awesome..overall a nice place to have a bite in between shopping.

I went there nearly two years back. This situated just opposite to kfc. Its a mainly South indian restro but u can find some north indian foods. Masala Dosa is ok. Chana batura is good. But Must drink Sarag Special Lassi. Lassi is just awesome. Ambiance is ok. Staffs are ok. Space is also ok. Prices are very very affordable. Overall experience is average. But if u want some good quality indian foods then must go to RUCHIKA RESTAURANT just beside the sarang. Ruchika is far better than Sarang. 
2 stars to Sarang
3 stars to Ruchika.
