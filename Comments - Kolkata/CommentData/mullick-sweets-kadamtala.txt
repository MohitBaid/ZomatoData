It's age old shop but the quality they guarantee. The prices are a bit high but since they are providing what people are asking and they are still in business very well. It's more of a family shop now and the sweets are very good.

This sweet shop is one of the best shops in howrah. Their sweets are amazing. My favourites being Malai Chom Chom and Motichur. Even their snacks like dhokla and dahi vada are good..
Strongly Recommended.. :-)

Visiting this place for me as re-living my childhood, If you are new to Central Howrah and looking for authentic Bengali sweets with this place you will hit the bulls eye.
Â Its located at Powerhouse bus stop. You can try there seasonal sweets along with all time sweets. Apart from the sweets the "Namkeens" as Samosa(Singara) and Puris(Kochuris) are also mouth watering.Â 

A mast visit place for sweet loves.

The oldest  and best sweetshops are found in howrah. My dad went towards that side and brought back a box of sandesh. I don't like sweets much but the sandesh of this shop is delicious :)
