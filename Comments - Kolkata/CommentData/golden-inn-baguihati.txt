I first visited this place around one year back when it was nothing but a shabby singing and dancing bar with a small ground floor room dedicated to a smoking alley (without music) - a typical baguihati-teghoria bar - nothing special to mention about. But recently, they have done a noticeable amount of maintenance in the entire premises. The quality of seating area, the interior decoration, staff behavior, food taste everything. Prices are more or less similar to what they used to keep before. We took one fish finger, one chicken pakoda and one peanut masala with few drinks. Though after the first bite on the fish finger it didn't taste like basa, so obviously I thought it to be Katla or any normal fish coz in that price, I cannot expect bhetki fillet anyway. However, the rollicking tenderness of the smooth chicken stuffing inside the pakoda compelled us to forget about the fish. Definitely worth a try.
Drinks come in standard rate. 1 full peg of Blenders pride costs 160 + 5.8% serv tax.

Not recommended for couples or family but definitely for boozers, it can be a good place to be.

Located on the service lane opposite KFC Baguihati... this is a medium sized bar with a separate family restaurant... serving very average food... the bar section is the only puller... and ambience is just about okayish.

Located on the side lane of VIP road near Raghunathpur.

This  place is purely for the people looking for boozing. Food quality and taste is not extraordinary. Very average may be below average sometimes. Also the interiors are old fashioned too.

The outdoor looks very attractive, however, this is not the case for the interior. It is a bar, mainly for office goers. Food quality is not that good, and I must confess the food served here is cold at times, as happen with us. A so so place.

Looks like a big restaurant from outside, but you won't feel the same once you enter it. One bottle beer costs freaking 280 bucks (without tax)!! We ordered chicken kababs which had a decent taste. The place is usually crowded by old people who come to watch the Bar dancers.Â 
I would suggest keep this place as your last option if you wanna go for drinks.
