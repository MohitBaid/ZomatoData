With the mushroom growth of eataries and bakeries every 10 step u take, sweet cravings can very soon be a thing of the past. Oldschool demand-supply theory. This is when people like glacé comes to the rescue breaking all conventions. I say people bcoz the desserts tht come out the factory has a big heart. Far away from the black forests abd tarts and eclairs, glacé ll take u to a journey so fresh and indulging that u ll literally feel like sueing Lays for taking d tagline. This one deserves it for sure.

Not very happpppy ofcourse my rating clearly shows that. 
I ordered chocolatemudpie which wasnt available. So they sent me choco pyramid.
I didn't receive a bill for my purchase.
I also ordered another chocolate pastry which tasted stale. Diwali was just spoilt. I have a sweet tooth but this was just depressing. 
Oh .. the delivery man refused to walk up the stairs. He made ample no of excuses.

I ordered a cake in haste for my husband's birthday and they contact person was very polite and efficient. I received the cake on time and that too.on COD. Kudos to the service. I have recommended them to all my friends. Now coming to the cake. Did not get a lot of choices and I take the blame on me. I only gave them a few hour' time. But the cake tasted amazing and I received a lot of good comments about it from my family. I will go back again.

The desserts of glace patisserie are worth the price. I have had the red velvet, rainbow cake,mud pie and double truffle cake. Personally I really liked the mud pie. The chocolate used in it was dark and the crust was also crisp. The rainbow and red velvet are equally good. It is a must try as their quantity is also good and the pastries are big enough for one.

This is a cute little hidden gem in the posh area of Ballygunge. Hidden in one of the numerous by-lanes that intertwine the area, Glacé Patisserie
 is one tough place to locate. Unfortunately, Google Maps misguides you badly.

It's a small confectionery shop that serves amazing desserts :)
The prices are not too high; some are even cheap. They take orders as well.
We had a couple of pastries, including the Red Velvet Cake and the Lemon Tart. Both were pretty decent. Add to that the fact that they even have a couple of tables to help the sweet-toothed monsters enjoy the taste in bliss and comfort !

I ordered a red velvet cake and rainbow cake via zomato. Each was for 80/- which is pretty good. I personally love red velvet and their red velvet was very good. The rainbow cake was good, but nothing amazing.
