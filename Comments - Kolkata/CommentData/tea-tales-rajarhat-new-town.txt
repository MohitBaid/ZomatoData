This is a small place behind VIP Sweets which serves sandwiches, burgers, fries and different types of tea with flavours. It's very clean and tidy place proper A/C cooling to spend some time with friends and partner. There are a few seats available to sit. Also some books to read have been kept.All the food items are made fresh in front of you as it's a open kitchen. We took a nearby coupon for RS 89 and got 2 Jasmine Tea, a Cheese Chilli Sandwich and a Egg Sandwich. The Cheese Chilli Sandwich had Cheese, chillies, Onion was made very well. It was too spicy got my mouth on fire ha ha wow. On the other hand the Egg Sandwich was also perfect and yum. Truly value for money a good steal. All this with tomato sauce. To continue we ordered a Omlette combo which contained 4 slices of bread, an omlette and mashed potato all @ RS 25 wow. Finally We had a small fish finger I.e. three pieces of Basa Fish fried at RS 50 plate. The fish fry was served with mustard sauce. Only if it would had been spicy would had got a 5 star rating. Overall it's truly value for money would visit again.

We give a lot of importance to tea and coffee in our daily life. Coffee and tea have a defined space of our diet. It's so relaxing, refreshing, and activates our body. And "Tea Tales" is therefore a perfect place with the best vibe.
Located just inside the lane of Arsalan in Rajarhat, tea tales offers a very relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff and a good selection of tea compared to many other cafes in the city.
This place is very small but perfect for a casual chilling session with friends. The wish tree and red sitting boxes looks super cool moreover this place won't hurt your pocket.
We ordered egg Maggi and with its simple preparation and lingering taste, it came to rescue my Hunger. Flavoured ice tea was unique and refreshing. However hot tea had by mom was average.
This place is worth a try if residing in and around Rajarhat. :) ❤️

Very small place. Prices are low but they should have better ventilation facilities . My first visit , will not come back again. Food is good , better to Swiggy.  One person handling things so service is painfully slow. But the tea is excellent , so rating it highly !

I was there for quite a number of times.Luckily I got invited by a friend at the opening day.Food was fresh and chocolate tea was my favorite. Guitar and tales what a perfect evening.Service was good. In size space is really small but perfect for two girls to sit there and gossip about others or too cozy for a college returned love birds on a rainy evening to share a small cup of pocket friendly tea!! Bravo..I am happy ..and thats what matters :)

The small n cosy joint is located behind arsalan, new town rajarhat. There are lot of options even for people who are not conventional tea lovers like me..mint ice tea and cranberry iced tea are a must try, perfect for the humid summer evenings. Wraps are freshly made, delicious and priced way less compared to nearby food joints. Number of short eat options are available  for quick munch breaks after office/college, priced at exactly "tapri" rates with the hygenic edge to its advantage. Perfect place for pocket friendly hangouts..

This cute little tea joint is a perfect place to hangout with friends. I first went there to have an evening snack, but ended up munching for almost an hour and half.  Iced tea and chicken burgers are my personal favorites :) Do visit them and don’t forget to try their chicken pops and fish fries.

Located behind Arsalan and close to City Centre2,Rajarhat, a chillout place to be with your friends when you are returning home from office or before going to hit the town on weekends. You can enjoy various blends of tea. The menu is good covering your popular breakfast/evening meals. The food is prepared with much love and the service is good and kind. My favourite is the Cranberry Iced Tea and Darjeeling Tea. Staff was also courteous and happy to help. Would definitely visit again and again.

Finally, a "coffee shop" for tea lovers! Honestly I'm a sucker for a good cup of chai and this little chai adda gives me more reasons than just one to love it. I have been there a couple of times and their tea never disappoints. I always order the "Cranberry Iced Tea" which is my favorite and it is absolutely amazing. Their Rose Tea is also worth trying. It's very refreshing. They also have a wide range of mouthwatering snacks. My personal favorites are Chicken burger and potato cheese balls. 
Overall a nice and cozy place with amazing tea and delicious snacks! :-) :-)

Tea tales is the kind of place which gives you the chance of revisiting your college memories. It's quaint and colorful. The spread of teas is delectable, my favourite being the jasmine tea. The place has a really cute and youthful vibe. Do visit if you want to make your own set of tea tales.

A perfect place for a casual date or to hangout with your friends. Love the ice tea out here probably the best in the city for ice teas. Specially love the location of this place, just away from the hustle and bustle of the city and yet well connected and the most attractive part about this place is that its pocket friendly so if you are looking a cheap date this is the place to be. Do hop in sometime. A great place indeed. And as I always say about them is that they make great tea and greater tales.

Tips - Go for their burgers, wraps and iced teas and if you're a tea connoisseur, this is just about the best you can get at such affordable prices! There's a humongous variety of tea on offer and you wouldn't be let down by any of them! An ideal place if you're looking to get a quality quick bite; also an ideal place if you're looking to chill with the best tea in town! Do not miss it!

Tea Tales is a small tea joint located right behind arsalan chinar park. locating the shop is a bit tricky. follow the narrow street beside arsalan and then take a right turn to reach this cozy little place.  a good place to hang out with friends but they have very limited seat capacity. you will find a wide variety of tea options along with snacks items. the range is affordable too.

This place is located in the gali behind arsalan. It's a very small place but definitely one of the best ones of the lot. As the name specifies, they have a wide variety of teas. The best part is that the rates are minimal. Which is ideal for tea lovers like me, since I can try different flavours without burning a hole in my pocket. The food is also very tasty and at minimalistic prices. 
I doubt how they will do in the long run with such low prices, but I do love it as a customer. 
Pros:
1. Very pocket friendly 
2. Great taste
3. Good collection of teas
4. Fresh food

Cons:
1. Since it is located inside a gali, ppl find it difficult to find the place 
2. Not much seating space. Not that good for a family

Suggestions :
If u have a larger seating area, you could charge higher too. If the current quality is maintained, customers will flow in. Also, some signboards on the main road will help.

I am a big tea lover however there are not plenty of places in this city to enjoy a nice hot cup of tea. 

Tea tales is one such place where one will get various types of tea and at very reasonable price. More than anything else they have focused more on the different varieties we have when it comes to tea. 

The ambience is very quaint and charming. The staff are also very courteous. One must try there ice teas and white tea. Also there burgers are really delicious and filing. 

Will be visiting soon!
