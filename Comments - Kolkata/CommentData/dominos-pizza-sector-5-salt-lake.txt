Been there with my office colleagues. We gave us a pizza treat during winters. We ordered veg and non veg pizza, both. Cheese within it is as usual, my favourite part. We even got discounts by showing  the ID card as we work in Millennium City only. All over it's simply awesome. Best place below our office to treat us with delicious pizza on any occasion.

Gonna give -1, but that ain't available.
Extremely unfriendly behavior.Manager Rudely said that they can not 

deliver. It was not the first time I am ordering at this address and by the 

way my address is at one of the core location of kolkata.

I have never expected this kind of rude behavior from Dominos. Looks like 

Dominos kolkata doesn't need any customers now.

I tried reaching customer care for my grievance. However they kept me on 

hold and eventually call got disconnected automatically.

Really very much disappointed. I mean what the hell. Ordered for two medium hand tossed chicken sausage Pizzas with cheese burst. Order got conirmd online payment done but then got a call from the outlet that cheese burst won't be available so they offered to give a thin crust with extra cheese. Wasn't very happy with the idea of thin crust, still agreed as we wore hungry and payment was done already! Domino's policy is 30 minutes or free ! Forget 30 minutes received order after an hour ! No discount on that! Bad service! And when opened the Pizza box more and more disappointment. Crust was average but no signs of extra cheese anywhere. It was horrible! No packets of oregano was given! I mean what did i pay 700 rupees for huh??? First you don't provide what i order for, if you don't have cheese burst available then why put on display? And even after going with your suggestion the pizza you gave was horrible. What extra cheese? I felt i am chewing a doormat !

This is one & only living Dominos in the corporate world of Sec V. Located in the Millinium City building its very near to my office. If you like to dine in then keep in mind this outlet is very small, can only handle 20 people at once. Better to go with their fast promising delivery of 30 min.

Dominos does a wonderful job of maintaining the same ambience in all the outlets of India. Same their staffs are, always polite & helpful. Domino's menu has became familiar to everyone.

Me & my office colleagues were in a mood of little hunger. So we ordered a number of Cheesy, Golden Corn & Veg Spicy Pizza Manias. Each & every pizza mania is of regular size that provides 4 slices. This is the most value for money option in Dominos to choose from & okey for your little hunger. Unlike few other Dominos outlets they provided standard quality Pizzas. The Pizzas were well cooked, tasted good & quite enjoyable but little more cheese would have been better.

If you're a pizza lover & you work nearby then its where you can easily visit. They also provide 15% corporate discount anytime if your organisation provides the card for it.

Went for the pepperoni with the quattro formaggi cheese as the base. And well, if u are an ardent cheese fan, you would absolute love the oozing out of the mozzarella as you bite through. The pepperoni added the extra kick that we needed. Nevertheless, it was pretty good enough

Went to this branch for lunch with my colleagues yesterday. Abysmal service at this branch. Made us wait at the counter for 5 mins while two of the staff members were busy talking. They literally showed us a hand as a gesture to wait. To top it all off, baby corn, golden corn and Paneer was not available.

The pizza itself was pretty bland. 

The attitude of the staff really should be looked into my the management.

A small outlet that is always crowded owing to the amazing location! I have visited this place number of times and their singles are recommended! They have a limited variety of these single pizzas but not only are they affordable but are served with a generous amount of topping!However their medium sized pizzas-
Chef's chicken choice and Chicken lovers pizza disappointed me! They were fresh no doubt but the pizza bread I felt was undercooked also there was hardly any topping! The chef's choice was a little better than the other! With the emergence of so many pizza serving food joints,domino's is sure to face tough competition!
Only the single pizzas are recommended!

***** The Case of Burger Pizza *********


° Where to order :- Domino's outlet .

° Price :- Around 150 (non - veg ) without toppings .

° Description :-
1. Medium sized burger with soft breads as buns .
2. Instead of a patty there's a pizza inside with chicken , mushroom , mayonese , pepper and olive .
3. The lack of cheese is an issue .
4. The chicken pieces are nice and goes well with the Mayo .
5. The bread has chili flakes on top which makes the burger more spicy and yummy .

° Verdict ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Not a conventional burger but does the job . Yes it is recommended for those who donot want a heavy meal but willing to go for a pizza like experience . Those who are trying for the first time won't b dissapointed .

This place is located in the ground floor of the Millennium City just outside the IBM office near College More.Owing to the location,this place is always brewing with customers.The college students and the office goers of the nearby colleges and offices make up for most of their customer base.Hence,getting a table might be difficult,especially during the lunch time.They have around 5 tables which I feel does not suffice the demands.The food served here is nothing different from what we get in the other outlets of Domino's Pizza.I have tried their Single Pizzas a number of times and according to me the Single Pizzas are better than ordering a big pizza and getting a few slices from it.The Single Pizzas are loaded with a fair amount of toppings which you might miss if you are getting slices of a big pizza.In my past experiences in Domino's,I have had slices from medium and large sized chicken pizzas without a single piece of chicken on it.Therefore,ordering Single Pizzas wisely might be of great help.
On my recent visit I had ordered 2 medium sized pizzas for the price of 1.They were the Chicken Lovers and the Chef's Chicken Choice.
The Chef's Chicken Choice was served first and it was tasty.The toppings,as usual,were less but they were not dry unlike a few other pizzas of Domino's.A little bit of more toppings would make this item perfect.
Then came the Chicken Lovers and this was not as tasty as the previous one.This pizza surprisingly had sufficient toppings but it lacked flavours.
The emergence of new pizza eateries in Kolkata might endanger the position of Domino's in the city.Hence,Domino's should improve in the areas it is lagging behind in order to keep up with the newer and better places.
Nevertheless,a good place with amiable staff.The order placed might take a long time to get served due to the huge rush. Definitely worth a try.

Located on the Ground Floor of Millenium City - this outlet draws the  crowd of IT professionals. During early days when Dominos was launched, I used to die for this pizza. But down the line, after experiencing the actual western pizza i feel they are overpriced compared to the amount of filling they dump on the breads. Hardly a piece of meat on each slice. My favourite is only the thin crust slice pizzas with double cheese bursters with mixed meat toppings.

This dominoes pizza joint in millenium city is quite popular and is always brewing with customers. The pizzas served here are quite tasty. We had orderded a meal for two which consisted of two chicken pizzas, one garlic bread a dip and a coke. The pizzas were extremely cheesy and rich in Italian flavours. The garlic bread was soft and tasted good with the dip.The pricing is also very affordable and is good recommendation for a quick bite.:)

Have tried a BBQ Chicken Pizza and Lava Cake. The sauce was good and tasty, but the quantity of cheese was a bit less. So were the portions of the chicken. The savior of the day was the Lava Cake. Hot and molten, the chocolate made the entire experience ecstatic.

Domino's good oven Pizza Burger.. It looks like a burger, smells like a pizza and tastes like a sandwich!!

This got introduced in their menu recently. Unlike a regular burger, it doesn't have a patty, but is filled with pizza toppings such as herbs, vegetables, tomato sauce and mozzarella, sandwiched between two buns.

It's available in veg & non-veg fillings, I tried the vegetarian variant. The taste is not so good, these guys need to work upon it. Ordering a pizza there is a far better option than having this burger. Guys go to McD if you want to eat a burger, dominos is specialised in making pizzas not burgers what I felt ..

An extremely popular pizza store at Millennium City, at the heart of Sector 5. I like the place. Good for spending 30 odd minutes with friends or colleagues. Had last visited a few years back. Recently ordered online the newly launched Burger. Wow, delightful it is! Such an innovative item at such reasonable price. Good job, Domino's. Also liked the Cheesy regular veg pizza. Lovely amount of cheese on it. Very tasty, even though I'm not a great fan of veg, but liked this one. Try your pizzas from this store, they are good. Need to improve on service time though.

It's domino's..  So that I think gives a clear view of what I think about this place. This outlet is a small outlet in sector five.  The management is really good,very polite i must say.  Delivery is fast. And the pizza..  I don't need to tell anyone any should your choose domino's over anything else when it comes to pizza and the new pizza burger is just too good.

Visited this outlet few months back during my campusing days at Techno India,salt lake. It was the only place open at that night,and I was starving badly as I had nothing to eat the whole day. We were four-five people,and ordered veg singles and some other pizzas. Their service was fast,and the pizzas saved us really from our starvation.

Once when I was feeling not so cheerful, dad surprised me with the Chicken Salami Special pizza from this outlet which he'd bought on his way from some work at Sector V. The sight of it had immediately cheered me up, but the taste hadn't really been that good as a Domino's pizza should be. Overall it had tasted marvellous , topped with "exotic chicken salami" and gooey cheese. Irrespective of outlet, Domino's always remains a favourable choice when it comes to pizzas.

Have visited/ ordered for office delivery from this place several times earlier also with good experiences, but, today was my worst at this outlet.

Ordered a Cheese Burst Deluxe Veggie, 1 Choco Lava cake and a Sprite for office delivery. The delivery was made in 30 minutes, but still, the pizza was hardly warm.

Further, it was under cooked and seemed like a "Chapati" instead of a pizza.

My order was placed around 11:30 a.m., when there is least rush - so I don't understand why my pizza was prepared hurriedly!

Choco lava cake was as usual nice and Sprite served was chilled - the way I like it.

Staff behaviour is generally good.

Hope this is a one-off incident and would not be replicated in future!

Pizza has always been good at dominos it was not an exception this time also, along with pizza chicken wings is a must for me. All was good except the unclean table...i waited for my order for atleast 30min by the table then also the remaining of choco lava cake boxes were not cleared out that was quiet a mess to look at... :(

This outlet is located just beneath my workplace so I am a regular here. Be it for the pizzas, taco or the chocolava cake. The taco mexicana is tasty and has a tangy flavor. The chicken parcel tastes more or less the same as the taco. The exotic Italian pizzas are delicious. The quantity served is average. The best thing about this place is that the place was open at 12.30 am during durga puja. We weren't starved to death!!

A pizza day in mood, and Domino's is my choice. I had been pizza-ing a lot of times here since the last two years but the reason that made me give it one less star is that for the late serve that they show up with. It was that last time, We ordered 7 pizzas, and we had to sit for, perhaps, an hour before we sensed the aroma jiggling in...

I like domino's. Always have. The one and only thing I hate is having to shell out so much money on the added crusts and somehow domino's has a way of gifting you that enormous VAT on the final bill. Being a student away from home, I sometimes feel like royalty going to domino's every weekend. Do try the Stuffed garlic bread sticks. Choco lava. Nearly all pizzas, except one with lots of tomatoes are good to go. My favorite is peppy paneer. It's just so awesome with the oregano.. And if you love Mexican, any of those dominos' Taco will just disappoint you!

Dominos is world famous and it keeps on justifying its fame whenever and wherever I have it. However, I personally do not like the idea of making pizzas with Indian toppings like tandoori or tikka or keema. In my opinion, it spoils the authenticity and evolves a delicacy that can be called something like "pizza". As far as traditional pizzas are concerned, Dominos is the best in the city and keeps its high standard consistently.

I like domino's. Always have. The one and only thing I hate is having to shell out so much money on the added crusts and somehow domino's has a way of gifting you that enormous VAT on the final bill. Being a student away from home, I sometimes feel like royalty going to domino's every weekend. Do try the Stuffed garlic bread sticks. Choco lava. Nearly all pizzas, except one with lots of tomatoes are good to go. My favorite is peppy paneer. It's just so awesome with the oregano.. And if you love Mexican, any of those dominos' Taco will just disappoint you!

Dominos is world famous and it keeps on justifying its fame whenever and wherever I have it. However, I personally do not like the idea of making pizzas with Indian toppings like tandoori or tikka or keema. In my opinion, it spoils the authenticity and evolves a delicacy that can be called something like "pizza". As far as traditional pizzas are concerned, Dominos is the best in the city and keeps its high standard consistently.

One of the best Domino's around town for sure... the place is clean and the staff is really nice and help you out with anything that you want... unlike the rest this place has a small seating of 20 - 25 people which is great and you can just order and eat the Piping Hot pizzas right there and then... all together this is one of the finer domino's to come to...

Domino's... Why are you so awesome? 
I mean that if you wanted to give us a nice lil treat then the calzone pockets were enough.. You don't know but they tasted so cheesy and crisp at the same time I was gonna ask you how it was made... Never mind..
Where was I? Yeah..a treat..
You not only had calzone but those super awesome pineapple and jalapeño as well as chicken keema pizza for us...
I can't describe the awesome quotient of the same.. They were just the best I've ever had.. And to add to that.. You gave us a real good ambience and polite staff...
You're a real party monster...
hugs!!!
Enjoy!

Probably the most commonly ordered food at our office, I had kinda grown tired of the same menu lately. Only the cheese burst pizza is something you cannot have enough of! It is what food in heaven tastes like, I'm sure!!

But probably sensing this boredom of people like me, they have revamped their menu card. We had ordered stuffed garlic bread sticks. Don't try it, go for the plain variant with the cheese dip instead. Probably more cheese stuffing might do good to this stuffed variant. Tried their new Chicken Hawaiian pizza. Now this one tasted quite good. We also ordered Seventh Heaven pizza. This one is really a good variant. I simply loved it. It will surely take a while to bore me!

Overall here goes my granular star ratings -
Food - ★★★★ 
Service - ★★★★★
Value for money - ★★★★
Innovation - ★★★ 

Cheers!

This Dominos dine in restaurant in particular is not good. Had ordered a medium farmhouse and a medium chicken fiesta, both with extra cheese but the cheese  on the pizza was very less just like the dominos singles pizza. Not recommended !!

Okay, so my absolute favourite is a cheese burst pizza, especially the chicken keema. The cheese burst is just awesome, I mean you bite, and cheese falls out. Thats just awesome. Other than that, loved the choco lava cake. Once we even got the garlic bread, and the dip, and it was nice enough. Overall, try to the cheese burst, though they dont give it in all sizes. It really is worth it.!!

I am not a great fan of pizzas and niether do I detest them. However I had a horrible experience at this specific outlet which I thought I need to pen down. 
On a particular friday I visited this outlet and was pleasantly informed that they were serving one pizza free with a medium pan pizza. We ordered one barbecue chicken pizza and one hawaian twist chicken pizza, both with extra cheese along with coke and butterscotch mousse. 
Feeling like heroes to have struck a deal, we soon realized that Domino's was simply trying to fool its customers. The Hawaian pizza arrived first, but without extra cheese and having one single slice of chicken over each slice of pizza. When we complained about it, they made a fuss but did replace it. The next pizza though was made to our expected specification. However the staffs were extremely rude and was being sarcastic every time we interacted with them after this incident. 
My experience may have been specific to this outlet, but still it was a disastrous one.

Moreover the air condition was not functioning properly and the washroom was completely soiled.

Domino's has been consistently good over the years, and I love it that they keep introducing new flavors from time to time. I had the Spicy Chicken and Chicken Fiesta on a buy one get one free offer. its lovely that they also distrbiute these coupons so you never know when you can get lucky!

Domino is your friend when you want a fancy lunch in office, or a lazy lunch at home, and even a romantic dinner if you please. I have shared their pizza with different pizza partners, and the taste has never failed to satisfy me. 

i truly am loving it!

I have been a big fan of dominos since childhood and its delightful to see their service improving over the years.The Dominos outlet in Millenium City serves as a saviour whenever I crave something better than the street food that is available outside our college.Having been to this place multiple times over the past few years,what i have really enjoyed is their consistency.
Our regular order includes the 4 non-veg doubles pizza,coke,lebanese rolls,garlic bread with the dipping sauce and a choco lava/Butterscotch mousse.
To be honest all the pizzas taste pretty much similar having the cheese,tomato sauce base but are good nonetheless.The crust feels dry at times.
The lebanese roll is the star here.No question,absolutely lipsmacking delicious.
The garlic bread is decent but they overdo with the butter.The dip is okay.Could do without it.
The choco lava is one of those sinful pleasures which you gotta eat no matter the calories that tag along.
The mousse is not a first choice.Okayish.

Overall a very good place for a quick bite or to get it delivered and enjoy that special match.(Sachin's 200 for me! ^_^).

I traditionally feel the crust of Domino's Pizza is too thick and dry. But that doesnt stop me from having pizza at perhaps any possible occasion. This particular outlet is too small, and is perfect for take away pizzas.

Since there's an offer going on with the Fresh Pan Pizza (buy one get the second one at 50% off ... yay!) we decided to order two pizzas. As usual, I wanted something with chillies and pineapples on it, and hot and spicy chicken, and my friend wanted mushrooms on hers. So, we came to a compromise, and ordered ourselves two, so that we could watch IPL in peace. Our pizzas reached us within 25 minutes, with two cokes, and yes, we loved the service! The pizzas were fresh, with a buttery crust, generous topping, and in short exactly what two hungry girls needed.

Edit: okay, not IPL, but NZ Sri Lanka Match. Which was pretty nice too!

Domino's is always the blessing-in-disguise of hunger pangs. Almost my sukh dukh ka saathi, I have ordered from Domino's during Holi, Christmas, Pujas and obviously on days of pizza cravings.
The sector 5 outlet has to be the best delivery service of Domino's in Kolkata. Every person who has ordered from various outlets of Domino's will agree on the discrepancy in terms of bread, toppings and cheese, from time to time. But this aspect is a completely blind folded no-no with regards to the sector 5 outlet. I believe they basically run on delivery here and ought to make sure everything is in place, and do that perfectly. The cheese burst has oodles of cheese, the thin crust is perfect and the fresh pan pizza a melt-in-the-mouth buttery crust. My favourites at Domino's are the cheese burst chicken Mexicana and meatzaa, deep dish non veg supreme, thin crust pepperoni, fresh pan pepperoni, non veg tacos and the butterscotch mousse. I don't think all the classic pan pizzas taste good with the same kind of crusts and over experimentation I have zeroed down on my favourites list, and never have these gone wrong at this particular outlet.
I tried their new fresh pan pizza today and good lord, I love the pack it comes in. Good work with the funky design and description, which btw holds absolutely apt in terms of the freshness, buttery crust, etc. The all round the year different discounts makes it pocket-friendly and an added incentive to order from Domino's. 
When they say 'yeh hain rishton ka time', they sure do mean it. :)

Well,I love Domino'z Pizza and pasta a lottttttttttttttt...Both of them just perfect in test.
Pasta is so delicious that you will regret if you haven't tried it yet.For veggies,Farmhouse and Deluxe Veggie are most adorable Pizzas.In non-veg,Zesty chicken,Keema do Pyaaza,Supreme and Meatzaa are best.
Garlic breadstick is just too yummy with cheesy dip.
Last but not the least,Butterscotch Mouse Cake is must must try item..so perfect..I have fallen in love with this one since 1 year back.Choco lava cake is also good but a bit sweety.
Suggestion?try it, you will love it.

This outlet is very close to my college. I have been to this place since the first day of my college. Since then I visit it twice a month on an average. Yes, I love pizzas!
Most of the times I end up ordering a veg/non-veg singles with a couple of toppings. Filling and pocket friendly. 
The Tacos are also good (not really special though). Margherita, Country Special, Farmhouse are some of my favorites. The Lebanese Rolls are also nice. I also do like the Garlic bread.
The staff in this outlet is very friendly. Domino's has always lived up to my expectations.

I just cant have enough of Dominos!!!
I dnt even remember the number of orders placed here.. but I found my heart happy to its core everytime!
Be it a takeaway or Home delivery or Dine in, the service is just perfect.. so is the food!

Locate your nearest Pizza shop, order your favourites, it will be delivered at ur place in no time.. 30mins delivery is their tagline.. they deliver it quite sooner than that!

My personal favourite is Meatzaa which contains 3 different preparations of chicken.. Zesty chicken and chicken mexicana being the two other preferences.. 
To talk about their Veg pizzas, Peppy Paneer and Deluxe Veggie are two of their best!

The crisp crust with the cheesy inside... will melt your heart away! Just make sure you are consuming it hot.. 

Now their sides..
Pasta italiano , both white and red are yummy.. so as their chicken wings, kickers, garlic breads(specially the stuffed one).. no one can eat just once!

Their butterscotch mousse cake is just perfectly sweet and deliciously creamy! so is the choco lava cake..

Yet to try their Taco Indiana.. looks great.. m sure it will taste great too!!

This restaurant from Dominos cannot be trusted at any cost. I had ordered couple of veg and non-veg pizzas today for my office treat at lunch time. One of the pizza delivered to us was a Non-Veg Pizza which was in a box with a Veg sticker. A Jain girl (pure vegetarian)from my office consumed that Non-Veg pizza unknowingly. How the hell can Domino's do that?? We and especially the girl has been in agony since then. And on top of that, attitude shown by their personals were pathetic. Instead of apologizing of such a big incident, they tried offering a free pizza for exchange. Vegetarians like me please be careful while going for Dominos.
