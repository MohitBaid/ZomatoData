Was on my way home after a tiring day of work and found this outlet just beside Park Sweets on Park Street. Ordered chicken tandoori and it tasted at par with all the good food joints near by area.
Pocket friendly and amazing taste. Also tried their pyaare kabab, though the taste was good but could have been more softer.
Must try Restaurant in Park circus area.

Well on a busy evening , i felt hungry so on my way back i found this new outlet simple and decent frm outside with affordable menu so i planned to dropped in.I ordered a chicken roasted with Paratha as it was a new place i didnt give a much try then my order got placed after 15 mins of waiting through no such crowd and sooner i started hving chicken ,  i felt a very stinking chicken as soon as this happend,  immediatly i complaned about it , first they didnt not accpt then later they did and asked if i want to change but i cudnt as every peice of chicken in the restaurant smells same though the Paratha was light and less oily. The restuarant offered me discount of INR 30. I hope i dont face such situtaions again if i ever visit there. Thank You.
