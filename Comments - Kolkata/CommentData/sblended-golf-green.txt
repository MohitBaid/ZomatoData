Ordered in via Swiggy. Had the classic chicken poppers. Really liked it. Pretty cost-effective too.Loved the additional personal touch of adding the christmas tree alongwith the food. Keep up the good work.

This is a delivery only place situated at Golfgreen serving only natural and organic food. I've ordered a few times from this place and I liked what I got. They're quite punctual on their delivery timings and quite assuring in the quality of the food they provide.
Starting off with their Shakes, I really appreciate how well they were packaged along with their tags and all, there's a nice touch to it. Coming to taste, they were pretty great ! Nothing to really complain about ! Their Unicorn Shake is absolutely a must try, it's much like a Candy Floss Shake but not exactly.
Now with the salads, I've had better elsewhere, I felt the quantity of chicken provided were quite insufficient to be considered as a chicken salad, the salad in itself tasted pretty nice, i'm not saying that it's bad but it's definitely not a treat either.
Overall, definitely try this place out for it's shakes and juices, you won't be disappointed.
What I had -
1. Unicorn Milkshake , Chocolate Overload Milkshake - 4.5/5
2. Thai Chicken Salad, Honey Mustard Chicken Salad - 3/5

This is a new home delivery service that is based in the Golf green area. 

This place is known for their milk shakes and for good reasons. I tried the Chocolate Overload and Unicorn Shake both of which were amazing and something I'd recommend. For Rs.150 each I though it was reasonable enough for what you're getting, though the amount of the shake is a bit less than you'll get at some other places. However if you are looking for shakes or juices I'd definitely recommend you to try it out !

But if you are looking for main meals, there are better options out there. That does not mean the quality of food here is bad. They are okay. I tried the Honey Mustard Chicken and Thai Chicken salad, and while they were okay, for that price and in that area there are much better options so it wasn't anything exceptional that I'd recommend. 

The order didn't take much time to be delivered which is always a plus.

So overall if you're looking for shakes or any kind of drinks I cannot recommend this place enough, but for main meals there are better options out there.

Its a take away which sells smoothies, cold pressed juices, milk shakes, ice teas along with salads and combo meals. 
Every product is fresh and you can actually taste the freshness. I tried their famous unicorn milkshake and a cold pressed yeloiw lime. It was taste and yum.
Their unicorn leaves you wondering about the ingredients till your last sip. Its complex yet tasty.
The only concern regarding this place would be that they deliver really late. I ordered from zomato and they took 1.5 hours to reach. But the products cover it all

S'Blended is a new home delivery outlet which has popped up recently in golfgreen area. I availed the services of swiggy to get my food delivered from the this place. I tried the following items:-

1. Ivory Smoothie - The shakes/smoothies/juices are their speciality since they don't use any artificial sweetners/enhancers for flavours. I decided to go for this from their array of options. This consisted of apples,cinnamon powder & yogurt. The pulp of apple along with the kick of cinnamon totally enlightened my mood & tastebuds. Highly recommended.

2. Bbq chicken poppers - I took the half version of it which consisted of generous serving of 6pcs coated in batter sprinkled with spring onions. The taste of bbq sauce was felt through nicely however i found some flaws. Firstly, the chicken poppers were over fried which left a burnt taste upon every bite. Secondly the batter was under seasoned. The positive being the generous serving of chicken with perfection of its cooking.

3. Cheesy french fries - A huge quantity of fries were given dipped in mozzarella cheese,spring onions & oregano. A separate sachet of liquid cheese was also provided. The taste was good but the fries were mushy. They lacked the crunch would have elevated the dish to the next level. So a disappointment.

The prices are moderate. Also the packaging deserves a special mention which is rarely seen from delivery outlets. The shakes & juices are a must try from this place. The food options are limited & could be improved upon. Would surely love to try more of their juices & shakes.

I ordered via Swiggy from this place today. I took only their beverage items:
¤Baby Pink Juice: It had a distinct taste of Pineapple and Mosambi juice. Pomegranate flavour was less though.
¤Green Smoothie: This was so heavy and filling. It is supposedly having Kiwi, baby spinach, green apple and pineapple.
¤Unicorn Milkshake:I feel the amount they gave was less, also I was disappointed cuz I received a bluish drink unlike the beautiful pink n blue drink i saw in photos.
Nevertheless, they were 100% natural and organic I could feel that from the taste. Being a fruit lover, they managed to leave a good impression for me.
Also, the cute tags and the packaging gave such good vibes.

I ordered the juices. The yellow, orange and green. The green one is my favourite, the right combination and flavour and not too sweet exactly how it should be enjoyed. I really like the yellow one too but it was just too sweet for me but still great. The orange one great too.you can really taste all the fruits fused. It's thoroughly refreshing cheers to that!
The packing is the sweetest.great job there! Well done .will definitely be reordering
