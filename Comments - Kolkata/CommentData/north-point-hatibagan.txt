Finally found out Another Joint in NorthCalcutta with the bestest food.Must try their special "BUTTER NAN"  which is their signature dish and  is so different and delicious, not 2 be found anywhere.U can have it even without any side dish. To add on U can take Chicken Chap or Bharta which was also too good.

Best chinese food in North Kolkata. Very neat and clean restaurant. They will make your food spicy or non spicy as you prefer.  Foods are fresh and very tasty.

This is an old restaurant in the area.
The worth mentioning food are Fish and Chips, Chicken Tandoori and Chikhen Reshmi Kabab.
But nowadays they do not have any option for any cold drink or icecreame which is a bit backdated and ridiculous...

উত্তর কলকাতার সেরা চিনে খাবারের দোকান গুলোর একটা । দাম একটু বেশির দিকে । কিন্তু পরিমাণে যা থাকে খেয়ে শেষ করা যায় না । পরিবেশন বেশ ভালো । ছিম ছাম ।

I, literally, have learnt having chinese cuisine from this restaurant only, they used to be so good. I used to love their fried prawn, then there was fish & chips, fish finger, lovely fried rice also.. But now I feel sad as the quality of the food has gone down drastically.. Hope of a revival from them soon!!

Located opposite to Swami Vivekananda House this is a little cute restro which has been one of my family favorites.  I ordered red pepper chilly chicken, mixed hakka noodles, mixed  gravy noodles. Everything tasted good and the manager narrated the history of the restro and made me feel like home. I brought the food home and thus made everyone happy.

An old favourite! Their fish n chips is one of the finest in the city. Most of the continental food is really nice and so is the Chinese. Golden chicken is a prawn and chicken dish which is an out of menu, still served and one of their signature dishes. A must try out for all foodies.

This used to be our idea of an expensive place during our college days in mid 80 s. It served Chinese and North Indian which was rarer in that chop - cutlet- moghlai dominated territory. It served decent Chinese and North Indian. 

Went back after ages, the food is still good and the ambiance is warm and cozy. Felt good to see the glimmer of recognition in the faces. Keep going.....

This is a small restaurant near hedua park. Sitting arrangement is congested and uncomfortable. Not an appropriate place for quality time spending.
But they serve some delicious items. Golden fried chicken, Fish fry, Fish begambahar were very good. Foods are cooked generously. They do not use ajinomoto if requested. So it's good for health concern people.
Food quality is better than neighbouring restaurants but cost is also high.
Conclusion: If you have to dine in hedua area and quality of food is all you concern then you could try it.

A small restaurant near the Bidhan Sarani crossing, opposite to Chacha's, I found the food pretty amazing!Though it has limited options as far as choice is concerned, never the less the quality & portions is generous and reasonably priced!
Both Chinese as well as North Indian snacks are good!

This place has been around since my father was my age. I've grown up hearing about their family dinners and hangouts with friends, at this place. Though what I could deduce from the experience is that, it might have been a great restaurant once upon a time, but they sure haven't kept up anywhere close to their standards. The price is a notch higher than its contemporary neighbours, and the food isn't value for money.  Seems quite bland and tasteless. The cherry on the cake is the awful sitting arrangements, where a seat for two is not even big enough for one.

Situated in North Kolkata,this restaurant has it's own speciality. All what I can say is the quality of food this small restaurant serves can be compared with a 5* restaurant.

I don't remember how many times I have been to this place as I think since I was not even 1 year old,since then I am their regular client. 
They serve amazing Golden Fried Prawns,Fish fry & Spring fish in starters. Don't miss their Golden chicken,Green Chicken,Paneer Butter masala, Fish Begum bahar in main course. Oh yes! Don't miss their Sea food soup,it's yumm!

This Resurant is my childhood favourite. Best item is the fish and chips. The best available in restaurants in and around Kolkata( excluding the 4 /5 star hotels). Quality remains the same over years. Also the seating capacity.
Environment is friendly, specially if the elder brother is present.

We needed food for our office party. North Kolkata is short of good chinese corner. One of our colleague suggested North Point. 
The place was easy to locate. On entering, the place gave an idea of a budget restaurant. The place is small well lit but small. Anyways we wanted a takeaway so we ordered 8 full plate mixed fried rice 8 plate chilli chicken 1 plate veg fried rice and 1 chilli fish. The food took a long to to prepare.
Coming to the taste, the taste was very mild with no dominating flavour. quantity was average. but the price is on a higher side. I mean much higher the bill was for around rupees 3500.

Overall it is just a ok place, one time vist type.
Sorry for no picture. I clicked a few but got deleted form my phone.

I went there on August 3 with family for dinner. We ordered fish fry, fried prawn, dry chilly chicken and mixed gravy chowmein. We only like fish fry which was definitely different from fish fry which we have tried over so many years at different places. Quality of chicken in chilly chicken was poor. It was very hard to chew and moreover the chicken was over fried. Fried prawn was the worst I have ever had. Even the prawn in gravy chowmein was not cooked properly. Altogether a bad experience for me. And if I have to consider the price, everything was overpriced. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

A really overpriced restaurant in a place like Bidhan Sarani. The food they serve is quite good though. The chinese main dishes are worth a try as well as the chinese fried rices. Our chilly chicken with mushroom tasted nice but we were really hoping for a better quantity of the served platter. Overall a good restaurant if you ignore the prices and have a handful in your pocket.
