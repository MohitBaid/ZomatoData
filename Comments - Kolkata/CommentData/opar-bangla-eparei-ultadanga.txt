খুব ভালো লাগলো। আমরা নিয়েছিলাম ভাত, মুগ মুসুর ডাল, আলু ভাজা, ছানার ডালনা,বাগদা চিংড়ির মালাইকারি, ঢাকাই চিকেন। চিংড়ি মাছের মালাইকারি, চিকেন টা সব থেকে বেশি ভালো লেগেছে। তাছারা সব খাবার এর স্বাদ দুর্দান্ত।👌👌👌
তবে প্রত্যেক দিন মেনু কার্ড এর সব খাবার পাওয়া যায়না। তাই আজ কয়েক টা আইটেম খাওয়া গেলো না।😔😔 কোনো ব্যাপার না। আমি আবার যাবো।।😍😍

I went to this place on 26.09.2017. It's situated near Telengana Bus Stop. From Bidhannagar station one can easily come to this place. Though the appearance of this restaurant may not provide comfort to many people's eyes but if one loves bengali food and wants to reward his/her taste buds with such amazing bengali delicacies just give it a try. We ordered :
1. Plain Rice(1)
2. Lau chingri(1)
3. Macher matha die moong dal(1)
4. Polao(1)
5. Mutton kosha(1 plate-3 pieces)
(adequate for 2 people)
They took only 5 minutes to serve our order. And the taste of the dishes were heavenly. Personally I liked the polao and mutton kosha. With every bite of mutton it was just melting in my mouth. It was so soft and delicate. To all bengali cuisine lovers, do try it once.
The total cost of the above mentioned dishes was 490/- only. Want to visit this place again :)

After hearing a lot about this place from my sister, I decided to give it a Try. Located near Ultadanga Post Office at Telengabagan, this place is a Hidden Gem. This review is not about Ambience, Location or Service, it is based purely on the food which is Divine. If you want to try Bengali Cuisine at an affordable price, this place is recommended.

This is indeed a discovery. Took home delivery of Chingri Malaikari, Lau chingri & Mochar ghonto 3 days back. All were very tasty, more like home cooked food. Ordering again today.

A very small place that you may miss out anytime, but be sure it's one of a gem. 
Food is pretty good and you won't believe your eyes if you go through the price chart.
However, I would suggest for 'take-out' as the place is not very spacious n comfy.

It is a hidden gems for sure... believe me guys... it's a small place just beside the ultadanga post office near muchibazar serving tremendous good quality as well as extremely tasty food... and guess what... it comes in a very affordable price... although the deco was not that good... but the service was very fast... and the staffs are very well mannered, well behaved and friendly too... when I reached their they put down the shutter and taking their post lunch rest... but as soon as I called them... they very positively became ready to serve me... it's a gr8 gesture to show your professionalism... which I believe comes from the heart not by trainings... whatever, coming to the food... I ordered for...

♡ Basmati rice»»» yes it's basmati nothing else... the fragrance and the shape is drooling... perfectly prepared...

♡ Musur dal»»» just yum... so well prepared...

♡ Jhuri jhuri alu bhaja»»» it was still crispy... tasty as well... it was pretty amazing to get the thing in this form after getting packed and also a long 1 hrs journey... gr8...

♡ Lau chingri»»» Excellent taste... getting mouthful of chingri in every bit...

♡ Illish bhapa»»» Awesome... just awesome... such tasty illish and so well prepared in such a pocket friendly price... just can't believe...

♡ Chicken kasa»»» What a pleasure... just think about the fact you are getting back to back good news... how would you feel??? It's totally like that... extremely tasty... again the price... made me feel more happy...

So guys everyone give it a try... it's a fabulous place...

I love this place since i came Kolkata for first time. Then it was a small and non AC restaurant but food was good so my Hubby explored and brought me here.  The quality and quantity is very awesome. The service is very fast and price is reasonable. The people in Kolkata should come here once and try the food.

Reviewing this on Zomato never struck me till date....maybe coz this one is my regular(almost once every week) haunt since the time i discovered it (YES , this indeed is a DISCOVERY!!) on zomato while looking for a cheap bengali restaurant nearby!! Located in a by-lane of Ultadanga, near muchibazar, this place is full of surprises right from the day i first visited. I have never come accross a place that offers bowl full of fine quality Basmati rice at Rs 30, Maacher matha diye Dal for Rs 15, Pure ghee Basanti Pulao for Rs 50, Prawns/bhetki/chitol etc etc for less than Rs 100. A Light pocket, a squealing tummy and tongue craving for some delectable Bengali cuisine??? Too lazy to cook at home?? Head for "Opar bangla Eparei" and thank me when you return . A full course meal for 4 people should range within 500-800 depending on what you order. Bangladeshi dishes like Bhetki Paturi (@90 Rs only) Chitol Muittha(120 for 4 pcs), Chicken/ mutton dhakai kosha (110/160), tyangra, Aar kalia, Katla (60Rs) etc or even the Lau Chingri (Rs 50) , Sukto   chhanar dalna will make you fall head over heals in love with this place.  

Cons of this place is it seats maximum of 16-20 people, Though it is air conditioned This place on a busy day like poila boisakh, jamai sathi etc may become a li'l suffocating. You can opt for Home delivery too if you stay nearby. 

Whatever be, i place this restaurant as a top bengali wishlist much higher than its costlier counterparts offering the same fares at around 4 times the price you get here!!

Yesterday ordered home delivery.. though instructions were given to make items non spicy as children will have the food...all items were rich in color, oily and full of spices. Quality of food was average. Could have been better if taken care of oil and spice. Home delivery was on time. It is good that Bengali items are available at cheap prices in our vicinity.

Opted from mostly home deliveries from here..these guys definitely know how to cook a proper normal bengali meal....The fish preparations here are awesome, space is small so home delivery is a good option specially for people who stay nearby

Promote this food joint if you love bengali food. Very nearby to ultadnga rail station, this restaurant is ready to satisfy with their huge collection of fishes n very tasty items. We took plain basmati rice,vaja moong er dal,macher matha dea chechra,sukto,pabda macher sorshe jhal,amsotto-khejur chatni. All items are very good n they maintain sufficient quantity that 2 persons can eat every item. Price is pocket friendly So no complain, really thank you, the owner to choose that very busy place of office goers hungry people as there is no good bengali restaurant at all.

I had the best Bengali food leaving my mom here in n this unknown joint. Easily commutable close to Ultadanga near Muchibazar this 16 seater restro will take your heart away not only with its taste but also the price quotient. I had the best of fishes like Tel Koi, Malai Chingri & Elish Vapa... All were just awesome. Even the veg food and chutni is also something to mention. I am sure everyone fond of Bengali cuisine will love this place. Special mention: Damn cheap pricing. So my tips while ordering don't look at the prices. Happy eating.
