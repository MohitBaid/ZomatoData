I have been there once only for drinks. We had a couple of beers. It's usually a crowded spot. Although it is air-conditioned you can smoke there. But because it's crowded might need to share table with someone completely unknown. It's a cheap bar so have to aware of the people you face. One more thing to mention no girls.

went to this place on sasthi . of course, with college buddies, wanted to recall college memories while having booze and foods. well, this place is good Â if you go with your male friends. not a good place for taking your girl friends. crowd is not good. best thing about this place is you can booze as much as you can, as the price chart is very pocket friendly. but the food is really bad, except you order chicken tanduri. service is really slow and bad. though i will definitely visit the place next time to have booze only at a cheaper price.

This one is again a very famous bar cum restaurant in Baguihati area. Located just between baguihati bus stop and keshtopur, this place is a predominant "daaru thek" for all local people out there. Separated into 2 parts, ground floor is only bar and 1st floor is singing and dance bar. We took a shared seat in the ground floor, ordered for blenders pride pegs along with dry chilli chicken and pan fried chicken later. The first item was nice however the 2nd was utter disappointing. Price of the items are quite high considering the ambience and facilities. But the waitor Sujit was truly awesome and very helpful. Arranged me to pack my drinks from the off shop beside and included the cost in the total bill. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
If you drop in by car, u wd face issue but for 2 wheelers its heaven!!

It's a near by BAR from my flat. Today evening I was there for boozing with my friends. The place little messy. But chilled out was fantastic. Service was good but cleanness was poor. Another option is it has an off shop counter for Alcohol.

Well if you go with a female friend in this place , it can be really dangerous. Crowd is not good at all. Ambience is disgusting and disturbing , you can hardly see what is going on inside it is so dark. My friend went for beer and I had some chicken pakoras.

Mostly went to their off shop for my occasional ration purchase ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›.. jokes apart..small crowded place..often rents for party purposes..can be disastrous experience if you are with a girl..

Good as a bar though..
