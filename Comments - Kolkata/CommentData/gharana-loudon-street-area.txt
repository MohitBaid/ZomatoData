Well I didn't wanted to come here when my friend suggested seeing the rating of this place..but I had to for my friend! And the rating proved it right! They mentioned that the dinner starts from 7pm.. even when called they confirmed that it was 7pm for dinner! Well when we got there it was 8pm and we were led to an waiting area and made to sit and wait there for half an hour! There were other people too who showed up at 7pm and they had to wait for an hour and a half! People actually had to have a quarrel with them over the time! So finally at 8:30 we were led to the dinning place. Ambience was good, very spacious place but food? Leaving the starters the main course was utterly nonsense.
NOT RECOMMENDED!
