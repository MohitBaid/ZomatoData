It is a very small place with some great fish fries and fish fingers!
The fish fries are priced at 15per piece and tasted super nice. They have slight hygiene problem but that shouldn't affect much because of the price and also the quality!

You can guess if a "chop cutlet er dokan"makes it's place on zomato then it must be dishing out some delicious stuff! This dingy shop located just beside the golpark crossing and is always buzzing with hungry customers.They have a variety of offerings from which I ordered chicken pakora,fish roll and fish finger.The quality of the fish was too good.Fresh and soft and just the right amount of filling.And you really can't go wrong with chicken pakodas.
HappyEating!

Been there several times. The place is really nostalgic. A small food joint . Walk towards Golpark , it will be on your left ,near axis Bank. They are maintaining their quality till now. You may find it looks like an unhealthy one. But it looks like typical 80s or 90s street food corners,which the name suggests as CABIN. happy fooding ;)

Shankar cabin reminds me of all the cabins spread across Kolkata. This snacks corner is a rescue for people who crave for snacks like fish/chicken kabiraji, pakora, fish fry, etc.

Heavenly taste in pocket friendly price ðŸ˜Š. It might look unhygenic but we bengalis are quite used to it. Isn't it? It won't matter when you get to eat some steaming hot, crisp and perfectly spiced fried items. The fish items are 'must try'.

This is a very  old culinary affair with residents of Golpark and also for those who flock to Gariahat for a shopping spree! A tiny shop, brewing excellent fast food without a pinch in your pocket. The ever enthusiastic and prompt owner will pamper you with delicious stuff like Chicken Spring Roll, Fish Fry, Fish Chop among many others. But my personal favourite is the 'Fish Roll' It is an outstanding preparation!                                               

Golpark and its nearby places might have been crowded with uber cool restaurants, but Shankar Cabin with just good food has its loyal following !

This shop falls on the right side of the road on the way from Golpark to Gariahat. They mostly serve chops,cutlets,pakoras and spring rolls.Have tried their chicken pakora,egg chop and fish butter fry.Pakora was good but the egg chop was completely tasteless..it was filled with boiled potatoes which lacked the proper spices..fish butter fry was average..it was filled with fish but again..the filling was not that tasty..and the outer coating did not have any smell of butter.Nevertheless, prices are cheap, and so one can visit the place for some quick snacks.The pakoras and chops are not more than 15Rs, and the butter fry is priced at 40bucks.

Shankar Cabin is a very popular name when it comes to fried food items in the Golpark area. I have been visiting this outlet since my school days. I visited this outlet at 4.30 p.m today. If you are looking for ambence and seating arrangements you will not be getting get either of them. I ordered one butter fish fry first. The food came within five minutes. The butter fish fry was delicious. It was filled with fish. The fish was fresh and did not have any shell. It tasted heavenly. Next, I went for the Chicken Spring Roll. This item was however a let down. It was good in taste. It lacked adequate amount of chicken. The filling had excessive amount of vegetables. They should look into it. All in all, a good store and I will visit again.

This place is a must for me whenever I visit gariahat. I don't expect a huge from them. In very small cabin like them they are best. You will never find the place is empty during rush hours. I have tasted fish fry, chicken pikiran, spring roll. Fish fry was best.

I used to eat from here during my rkm days. I was in the vicinity so I stopped by and got a spring roll n butter fry.
Both were utter disappointing and I threw away most of it. :-(
The chicken spring roll has the same filling that of the cutlets and the butter fry had more of coating than of the fish. Utterly waste of money. :-(

Located on one of the foot paths in golpark.It serves a variety of fried stuff.Like fish fingers,chicken pakoras,drumsticks,mutton chop,spring rolls etc.The mutton chop is really bad with hardly any mutton in it.Their fish batter fry is something to die for.Love it.I keep coming back only for this particular item.

Conveniently located for a shopping break and economical, this hole in the wall joint offers typical bengali Street Food. A variety of meat, fish, egg and veg items are displayed in a glass cabinet and fried to order, then served with salad and kasundi sauce after being dusted with chaat masala. Greasy but tasty as you would expect. Maybe not the most hygienic, but I've not fallen sick yet and I come often, let's hope it lasts :p

This joint is near gangurams,golpark..
This joint is famous for fries,chops,cutlets and many more.. I didn't find it hygienic.. I have tried several items.. specially the fish finger and chicken fry is pathetic because once you start eating u will find blood clots in chicken..
I don't like to eat from this joint...

Located just beside Dhanantary, Golpark... A little tiny joint serving only varieties of fried items... very dirty place and unhygenic too... but for grabbing some snacks like these you need to forget hygiene... 
I tried there...
1. Mutton chops... Good one...
2. Fish fry... Good nothing special...
3. Chicken drumstick... Good in taste... but as soon as I find blood in it... all my love for the food gone in vein... 
Yep I take my words back hygiene matters... specially for these place...
Nevertheless it's one of the pocket friendly options in the locality...

This whole in the wall joint sells an amazing variety of chop cutlet on offer. Consider yourself lucky if you get to try the egg chop since it flies off the shelves as soon as it's fried. Also the proprietors have an excellent ability to remember your preferences even if you haven't been to the store in ages. Just yesterday while I was passing by  the owner asked me  ' didi dimer chop toh ?'

This tiny shop selling deep fried Bengali delicacies is located a few steps away from golpark Ganguram's  and is always teeming with fry lovers . The shop sells the usual egg devil , mutton chop , fish fry , fish butter fry , along with that rarely available popular favourite , fish roll ! They also have their very own 'chicken golqueen' , which is a flat , round deep fried chicken patty that is good to taste and a must try here!  The fish roll however has more of the spice stuffing inside than real fish , and tastes bland . The mutton chop and egg devil have a slightly sweet stuffing and taste good . Overall , if you live in south Calcutta and don't have access to Kalika , this place has a decent variety of non vegetarian chops to satisfy those fry cravings !!

Living in mumbai, i really crave for the fried delicacies from shankar cabin sometimes. The shop may look like a dingy cabin but the food cooked in their is humongously delicious. From their egg devils to their chicken cutlets, each one is just awesome. And what's more, it is damn pocket friendly ! A must visit for all
