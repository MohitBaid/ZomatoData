In short, nicely built place with stupid staffs and bad ambience. The drinks are extremely cheap when you compare it with the way they maintain the place with red table cloths and towel napkins. However, the staff's behavior was strange, as they saw us calling them but tend to ignore for taking the order. That really pissed me off with the combined effect of the tv blaring some action movie at high volume.

It's just a few meters from my house. The food here is good but some items are overpriced. The ambience here is okay but most of the times it's slow in getting you what you ordered. Overall it's a good place to be in.

this was my first visit to hotel shivam...I bought a coupon from groupon...was quite unsure abt the quality of food that will be available there...reached howrah a 5 min walk from the bus stand...
on reaching there were greeted warmly and accompanied to our reserved table...
we didnt hv to wait much after ordering our dishes..
there service was quick promt and their food was far far better than what I had In mind would be...quantity per plate was great...mark my word it is nearly impossible for 2 to finish this five coarse meal frm groupon...at hotel shivam..
tandoor and indian dishes r excellent....
next tym wl surely try out their chinese dishes..
the ambiance is great...although a bar cum resturant..but I assure u ...that u can enjoy a great meal with family at this place..
hoping to visit this place again in the future...thnx groupon...and thnx hotel shivan for making my evening soo great with such good food...

been there twice. the service is really bad. the waiters are dumb as they dont have any idea whats on the menu, which was the case both the time. i ordered for a chicken pan fried rice, he served us fried rice. further upon telling him his mistake, he said said he will look into this matter and served us the same rice fried one more time with lil chilly etc. though the rice was decent.

the good thing is the food is awesome. stick to the basics especially in north indian food. dont try to be experimental as you might have a bad experience.. you can try out chicken boti kabab, chicken 65 as starters. would recommend lacchedar paratha.

the decor is so-so, and is lil dark. the music is decent as well as the crowd. some items are overpriced. overall a very decent place for friends and family especially in howrah.
