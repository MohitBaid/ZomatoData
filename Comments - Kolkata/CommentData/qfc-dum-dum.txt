Tried to be the alternate of kfc though in budget. I went twice. The first time when I visited, I ordered chicken burger for rs 49/- and it sucked. The second time i went had pop corn chicken and chicken breast and that was kinda okay.

So after having heard of Kentucky, Indian, Kolkata, Roy and Wow Fried Chicken, next in line was Quality Fried Chicken.
Ditto copy of their Kentucky brother. The food is cheaper. I had ordered for Chicken Strips, Chicken Wings, Chicken Popcorn and a Chicken Double Patty Burger. The wings didn't taste good. Rest were okay. Cheaper alternative to the original KFC.

A very small food joint, mostly for takeaways,- another copy of KFC like IFC,CFC and the like. Quality food in cheap rates. Obviously can't compare with KFC, but looking at the budget, food provided is really good.
