I always find one of the veggie very oily if that can be reduce then it will be helpful for hygienic food lovers. Rest all items are very tasty and will love to have again and again whenever I fill hungry and obviously when not in a mood to cook üòä

This restaurant taking 1.30 Hrs i.e too much time to deliver a simple dish. Yet not reach..

Pathetic service by both restaurant and zomato. Even call centres are really disappointing. Hope they will give some good services in nearby future

Cons:-
1.Some of the main course veggies on a bit oily side.
2. Didn't find the Laccha Paratha too good as compared with other places. 

Overall its a nice restaurant for dine-in / delivery. Cheers mate for the service. !!üòÉ

Pure vegetarian resturant servicing some finger licking delicacies. This resturant has a great location. I have been to this place many a times. I have the Economy thali which mainly has- dal, Plain rice, 3pulkas, Assorted sabzi of the day, Soft and tender paneer curry. To top it all there is papad and achar. Its absolutely filling and completely a value for money deal. More on the recommendation list you must try the Aloo Paratha and the gulab jamun of this place. They are heavenly. These people have a great home delivery service too. Overall cheap and affordable mouth smacking food is what you get here.

The price is pocket frendly. Quantity of food is enough for 2, except rice. Taste of all items are nice and not so much spicy.

This restaurant serves a little better than average food. If you are too hungry and you want veg food than its alright. Or else food is normal, behavior is extremely rude, and it doesn't have anything as ambience so nothing to specify.¬† Recently added AC in the ground floor which is mostly for taking order and increased the prices.

No staff co-operation. Stand there, look for your own food, no one gonna ask you what you need. Make your bill, give it to the guy and stand there. Once he will ask for your order, if you missed, then you have to look around for your order. Taste of maximum dishes is very good. No doubt about that. But they give very little quantity. Earlier the quantity was high. After renovation, i think they are into full business. If you just want to taste good food, go for it. But quantity is very little according to the prize.

We opted for the home delivery from this place and no doubt our experience wasn't that bad.We had ordered 1 executive thali . The thali consisted of 3 types of curry -
1. Potol aloo curry
2. Phoolkopi aloo matar curry
3. Paneer curry

Alongwith these it had mango pickle , 3 ghee phulkas ,vegetable fried rice , a papad and a gulab jamun

The quality of the food is not that bad but it is effing spicy especially the 1st curry .One thing that was quite disappointing was that I had opted for the 'naan' instead of 'phulkas' but they packed the latter one.

But overall it was good particularly the size of the gulab jamun was large enough.
The delivery was also on time . Looking forward to order from this place again soon . üòä

I have had food here before, although it was a long time back.I don't much remember about my last food experience here.This time around though, the food was much better and hence I am upping my rating.They are a little vegetarian food joint, who mostly do take-away and deliveries.Not much to talk here about.The ordered items were Paneer Lababdar, Kali Daal,Phulkas and Kesari Gulab Jamun.Food is good and quite home-like, quantity is not bad either and most importantly the place is light on the pocket too.All in all, on days one is not much up for cooking it in, you can very much have a take-out from here.It is worth a visit.

This is my fourth time ordering in here and twice in two days.We had Kashmiri Aloo, Aloo Matar, Yellow Dal Fry, Paneer Butter Masala, Matar Pulao and Aloo Parantha.Quantity is great and taste, even better.I am straightaway taking up my rating from 3.5 to 5 for this place.One of the best freaking vegetarian food joints.I have become a regular here.And happily so.Do give them a visit soon.They really deserve it.

Ordered food from this place I.e Phulka's, Paneer Tikka Masala, and Mix Veg. The  Paneer Tikka was well made not at all rich. The Paneer pieces were very tasty, though small in size. It did contain Capsicum and Tomato pieces. The Mix Veg was sweet in taste. It contained beans, cauliflower's, etc. The quality of the food was good and exceeded expectations.

This is restaurant is bad: food quality, food quantity, behaviour, it should not be in the restaurant business in the first place. My order of Jhal Farezie and tandoori roti was more than an hour late. The restaurant manager obviously an illetrate called me up and spoke rudely to me on my mobile. I had to find the delivery boy myself and he threatened me to pay Rs 5 for delivery whereas I had already paid Rs 20 to Zomato apart from the food price for delivery. Don't order from this restaurant ever. Food is so bad I had thrown it in the garbage. You can check the photos.

I ordered the food at 8 and I saw the delivery man coming to my door at 10pm on a cycle, from a restaurant which is 5-6km away from my house! Except that, this is a reasonable and amazing place for people looking for good quality vegetarian north indian food . The quantity is also amazing. We ordered 3 portions of 3 vegetables, and 12 breads all mixed, and the bill was around 1.1k. very nice place. Reasonable. Must visit. Would definitely eat from here again.

Located at Keshtopur crossing at the Vip road. Its just like any other food hub but its a Pure Veg only. Went there with family after a nice aquatica fun. When stepped in the place was dirty and even not ready to dine in as its in renovation. They are increasing their sitting with a ground and first floor sittings. Its been 5 years they are open here and doing very good with their variety full dishes to offer.¬†
We wanted to have the Chola Bhatura which was not available that time, it was only 6 o clock so we cant have our dinner and they were only ready with dinner items. So lastly we ordered Veg chowmien and gulab jamun.
After having a awful roll the chow really turned the mood good. It was tasty and contained good amount of veggies, less oily and good in quantity for two persons. Gulab jamun was also satisfactory.
Service was a bit late and they were not attentive. The worst part that i saw a 10 year old boy was working and even mannerless and i guess thats a child labour and should not be allowed.

Gupta's veg is one of the nicest pure veg outlet which I like personally. They are mainly into take away though have a small place to sit as well.

**Location**

Located at Kestopur more just in front of VIP more auto stand very much easy to locate.

**FOOD**
This is one of the quick veg food options in the area. Though I do not like to eat veg but I really prefer having from this outlet. Their Sahi Paneer and Mushroom Masala is one of the best among their offerings.Jeera rice is a very nice option with both the main gravy options. Also you can opt for Rotis.

**Service**

Service is quite quick. Sometimes they get puzzled due to too much rush at times but that can be excused as long as the food it tasty and good.

Highly Unhygienic !! Will Never recommend anyone who is conscious about his health...

Last time i went there, I found a very dirty glass smelling like ' GUTTER ' and there is a sewage line right below the restaurant !!

One of the best joints for vegatarian food in the area. It maintains the proper hygiene too.
Only one con that you will always find a long queue.
Their Dahi Vada is something your taste buds will love.

I would rather say its the best place in keshtopur to take away food also u can seat over there.
I have tasted every single dish out there.
Gulab jamun is the USP of gupta veg.
The manchurain and chilli baby corn tastes awesome. Whenever u bored frm ur bai aunty ka food then Gupta Veg is the one stop solution for u in keshtopur.
Price is reasonable.

Quality veg dishes at cheap rates is the USP... This eatery is more ideal for non-bengalis considering the variety of the dishes that they serve augurs well more with roti/chapatis than rice... For those who are new , their hot gulabjamun costing a little high at Rs 10/piece is a must try

Saviour for vegetarians as you might not find pure veg restaurants nearby except this one.
1. They have quality food with the cheapest possible rate.
2. Less space to sit but parcel facility is real quick.
3. Lot of variety in sabjis. Ghee roti and also parathe are the best options with them.
4. Snacks and some sweets are also available.
5. Vegetarians will love this place for sure.
6. Plain rice/ roti Thali system is there if you wish not to spend much.
7. I just love the food from this place. They are maintaining their quality as well. Kudos to Gupta veg.

It's a place serving decent veg food.. Good option if you work till late and don't find time to cook. Jeera rice and dal fry are good choices.. Any curry addition is also ok. Not great but good food!

Variety is their U.S.P. Butter Nan se Chilli Paneer yahan sab kuch milega. Plus the really rich flavours. Every dish is prepared with care. The only part which it lacks is inadequate dining space.

For bachelor's-Best Veg Restaurant in this area. Place- neat & Clean. Food- Tasty & clean cooking. For Dine in, they have also provided small space at the first floor with AC, which is good. Not for family dine-in

Over priced garbage with pathetic service. 
This is a shit outlet offering garbage food in Keshtopur. Never order food from here( Specially if you are opting for home delivery) , as there is no guarantee of food to be delivered.

This completely veg food joint is a relief for the vegetarian people living in the area. They have a wide range of vegetarian food starting from dosa, idly, vada to proper main course items like veg polao, veg manchurian, paneer items, mixed veg curry, roti, etc The owner is available all the time so it becomes easier to interact. The joint is kept clean and the food covered most of the time which is something to look forward to. They also take party orders and helps if you have veg eating guests dropping in. Located on VIP road the joint is not much difficult to notice from the main road.

Apart from long percel queue and space crunch, Guptas Veg is awesome. If ¬†you are there, then you must try Hot Gulab Jamun!!

i am from delhi and i happened to be in kolkata last month where my sister and sister in law live....
They ordered food from this Gupta's Veg....and trust me it was awesome...especially their ALOO65 is a aloo recipe that i have not found in delhi till now....
i even went next day again to the shop....i have to admit it needs improvement in terms of seating arrangement ...talked to owner,they said they are working on ambience thing too...... but if you are really foodie and want yummy food with reasonable price go there once....
I highly recommend for  delivery order of this shop....My sister family and neighbours orders for catering and birthday parties all the time....
P.S.   PERFECT RESTAURENT FOR BULK ORDERING/PARTIES/CATERING

This place is where i eat my dinner everyday... Food quality is good. Prices are low. You can actually have a complete meal for around 100 bucks.
On downside, very little space is available, long waiting time. Again, Guptas veg is no fancy restaurant.

Ordered loads of home delivery a week before my Da's Marriage. Food for two is actually enough for three. The mix veg, shahi aloo dum , paneer butter masala and veg pulao are yum. We bulked ordered for around 15-20 people each day and they delivered in time. But later when I visited, the restaurant was closed for some days. Hope it has reopened.
