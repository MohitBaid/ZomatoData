We visited TBL for lunch on 10th Jan.18. I must admit that we had one of the best prawn & chiken preparation over there.We ordered 3 combos from their kolkata flavour list. The star was the chiken gravy & prawn cooked with coconut milk and subtle spices. They served it with steamed rice & daal which was a hit again. I'hv ordered a bhetki paturi combo as well. Though the size of the filet was not very plesent but getting an entire meal along in Rs. 240 makes sence. Only the chutney they serve has bit over sweetness.
Lastly we had nice soft hot gulag jamun.
So Taste wise - 10 out of 10.

ambience - cozy, nice authentic bengali decor.

service - a bit disappointed as they made us wait for more than 15-20 minutes thou we placed our order an hour before.@
Price- It cost us something around Rs.780/- for 3 person which is absolutely value for money. They hv the most minimal vat & tax added with the bill which we liked the most.
overall one should definitely visit this place for some real mouth watering food!!

Visited this place on 09.11.2017. Food, drink and service were all good. Veg Steam Momos could have been better, they tasted weird. Earlier i have also taken meals from this place,  all the meals are very reasonable, good quantity & quality. Must try this place.

This is from house 6 ballygunje place....hence the food is really nice and tasty. They offer some set combo meal which is sufficient for a person. Value for money. Need to add one thing that the decor is superb....old calcutta charm.

Home made food is which we always prefer and the tiffin box did it’s job of storing the food.  A tiffin box has so many memories attached to it that we barely want to lose it.  A few days ago, i was invited to “The Bengal Lounge”, formerly known as “The Palladian Lounge”,  and it is a part of the heritage of the “Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industries Building” and for the first time this was open for all.

” Tiffin Box” is a very important part in everyone’s life, from childhood to till now many people still there who used to carry tiffin boxes. homemade food is something which is very much related to our life closely. i still have my childhood tiffin box which i used to take foods everyday,when i was in school. those days memories came back to when few days back i was invited in the “The Bengal Lounge” former “The Palladian Lounge”,is a part of the heritage “Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industries Building”,and this is the first time open to all. they organised a unique festival that showcased us lunchboxes from across the length and breadth of our country.these are the below tiffin boxes menu,the quintessential Indian “tiffins” served in regular tiffin carriers  or lunch boxes.the festival is going top be a gastronomic adventure. the food quality and the quantity is just incredible in a very reasonable price. the price between Rs. 125 to 265 the tiffins are perfect for a quick office lunch without burning a hole in the pocket.this festival starts from June 1st and continue till June 10th. coming back to the foods there will be various types of foods you can choose it from the menu,

One of the best places in town to enjoy Bengali food in one of the oldest heritage buildings of Kolkata the Bengal Chambers. Located at the office para with very reasonable prices and serving good combos. Food taste n quality is a complete 5. It will give you a old world feeling of British times...service is also 5 but took bit of time to serve.

Good food, good service, excellent ambience ! The crunchy fried chicken tenders, in particular, is splendid. Pretty reasonable rates for alcohols, too. In short, excellent value for money !
