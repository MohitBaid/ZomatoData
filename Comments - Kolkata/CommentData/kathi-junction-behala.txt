I ordered the following through Zomato, the estimated delivery was 1 hour but the food was delivered well before  the estimated time.
Fish Fry [2 Pieces] (1 x ₹100)	₹100
Double Shawarma (1 x ₹110)

Fist Fry was very good in taste. Double Shawarma is basically Shawarma Roll which was ok in taste.

I don't know if they have any minimum amount under which they charge Delivery Charge or not but they charged me the following..which I believe is a let down. Will think twice before placing order as these charges will be in my mind.

Delivery Charge	₹25
Packaging Charge	₹9.45
                    
All the below mentioned food was good...
Crispy Chilli Baby Corn
Fish Fingers
Prawn Torpedo
Chicken Tikka Plate

Note: I was contacted directly by Kathi Junction, they told that these Delivery and Packing Charges are made by Zomato, so if you order directly you can bypass this extra costs. Thanks for the information @Kathi Junction. Ordering through Swiggy also incurred ₹25 as Packaging Charge

I ordered biryani from zomato. Was looking for a cheap alternative, the delivery was almost an hour late, I blame zomato for it. Coming to the biryani, the quantity was huuge, the chicken pieces were large enough and cooked well so were the potatoes. The biryani was average, I wouldn't say bad. Look at the price you're paying and then compare it to other good biryanis. (No eggs were in the biryani by the way, those are the ones I boiled).
