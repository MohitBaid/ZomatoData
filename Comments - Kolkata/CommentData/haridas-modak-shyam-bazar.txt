Very average. To me, that banana leaf thing is over-hyped. Things need to taste better foremost. The luchis were oily, cold and not very large. The tarkari was so-so. The mistis were good, but need to work on cleanliness.

Although I am not someone with a sweet tooth, I visited this place for their luchi and sabji which they serve in banana leaf. Till two years back it tasted like heaven with the smell of desi ghee. But off late their quality has deteriorated drastically and I was very disappointed with my last visit as it tasted too ordinary with their regular flavours missing. Also the staffs are not very friendly.
Their sweets were very famous but now with time they haven't upgraded and so I personally find it very ordinary and with new age sweet shops coming up here and there they are definitely lagging behind. They couldn't quite live up to their age old reputation.

Haridas Modak is a vintage sweet confectionary located near Shyambazar five point crossing.

Service is quick with pure Bangaliana ambience.

Tried their Kochuri-torkari, which was served on a banana leaf was very tasty and light. A must try.

Their Pantua, Kajuborfi were fresh and good too.

Pocket pinch is economical.

Among those few restaurants which are still running on "Nostalgia" definitely Haridas Modak is one of them. A pure veg place where you can have luchi, kochuri,aloor dum, different type of sweets at a very low cost. I still remember my high school days when me and my wife(formerly girlfriend) used to drop in here for the luchi aloordum. They used to have a nice tap with sensor to wash ur hands after you are done, which on my recent visit I could not find. Things change but the taste of food is a genuine legacy.

This restaurant situated at the five point crossing, Shyambazar, Kolkata is a landmark in that area. It is famous for two things- one is traditional bengali sweets and LOOCHI and CHHOLAR DAAL .(RADHABALLAVI / TORKARI) served on banana leaves, they will leave you detached from reality for moments by their fabulous taste. you may find it difficult to stop once you are at the table. And do not forget to try another delicacy- BODE.

Before mentioning the good sides... Let me get to the cons first.... Very scarce of place... Uncomfortable seats... Lack of hygine n cleanliness..

But their proper luchi. .. just fabulous... So thin n tasty.... N they serve on Banana leaves... Following our old bengali tradition.

Besides.. the sweets are also of good quality.. n pocket friendly.. I took paantua-dorbeah-kheerkodom.

One of the oldest & legendary sweet shops in Kolkata.. First heard it's name form my Dad about its  awesome Yogurt & Kochuri Torkari... So 1ce and then a few times went there to taste their Yogurt & Kochuri. 
YOGURT: It was truly awesome with thick layer of cream on top and the sweetness was exact for once palette.
The Kochuri & Torkari: Was also good and was good for price the taste was also nice though the size was not satisfactory to my needs but its taste covered it.

Also had langcha and some other sweets which was good but not remarkable enough.
Liked there way of serving on banana leaf which is a bit different approach.
The Ambience is poor and its very claustrophobic and the place is in real need of renovation...üòë

Not long ago, a typical Bengali breakfast would consist of luchi (Bengali deep fried flatbread), kochuri (deep fried stuffed flatbread), alur torkari (potato curry) or daal (Bengali sweet and spicy lentil curry). Bread, butter, jam or omelettes were consumed occasionally and the breakfast used to end with desserts called jilipis. But, what should you do, if you have a sudden urge to taste those today? Definitely you can make them at home anytime, but easier would be to enter an eatery serving them. Horidas Modak, located bang on Shyambazar crossing is one such place.
                                                                ...

Why should one visit this small sweet shop in Shyambazar five point? Because of their delicious and authentic 'kochuri-sabzi', 'talsansh sondesh'', 'langcha', 'kalakand'; unique serving of food over 'kolapata'; well behaved and helpful staffs and the charm of old north Kolkata eatery.
Why shouldn't one visit it? Unhygienic kitchen, dirty looks.
Nostalgia is attached to this place, I wish it to be more clean, nice and hygienic.

They sell Paneer at exorbitent prices , possiblly at the highest prices around shyambazar area. staff behaviour is not so pleasant. Best for Kachuri Takeaway.

Located at 5 point crossing, this is a legendary place, mostly popular for their exceptional sweets and sabji-kachoris. Fluffy Kachoris served with a potato sabji upon a clean banana leaf. The kochuris easily melt in your mouth and the sabji stands as a perfect accompaniment. End your meal with some delicious sweets, and you wouldn't even feel the pocket pinch. Try this place, if you are near Shyambazar 5 point crossing.

An old sweet shop from the old Kolkata diaries still carries on the legacy with them is Haridas Modak.

They have been truly justifying the real Bengali sweets taste and quality. Must try is the Talersash sandesh and other Nolen Gur er sandesh in winter. Also the Singara is one of the popular one and in snacks Kachori with cholar dal is quite a good option for breakfast as well.

Note: My previous review got deleted automatically due to some issue so its a repost.

Date Of Visit : 12/03/2016

The Place &Location : Exactly on the 5 Poing crossing of Shyambazar. This shop is very difficult to see from road because of the hawkers who placed their stalls on the footpath itself so its hidden behind it. Its a tradational place and still continuing its popularity by serving quality food and desserts. It is built in a small area which has hardly seating capacity of approx 10 heads inside. In this modern world they still follow the authentic way of serving food to customers. If you are wishing to have Kachori at this joint then you will be really surprised to see that they will serve the items in square Banana leaf. Apart from this they sell awesome desserts with high quality and have that tradational touch in it. One of the oldest sweet shop in the city and still offering more day by day. The only thing they need to think about is renovating the place, as because it looks very darkish at some points.

The Food &Dessert : On my visit to this place i tried two items for a evening snack. Those items are 1. Kachori with Sabji& 2.RasMalai.

1. Kachori With Sabji : The surprising way of serving  the food in Banana Leaf looks great. The Kachori served was hot and the sabji given has the potatos with skin on it. The Kachori was so soft that it melted in my mouth when i took it in. Sabji gave the perfect support with kachori and both tasted awesome in combination. I felt that salt is less in sabji but after having few bites it seemed ok to me. The quality of the items was nice, properly cooked and the quantity leveled the price equally. The service was also good and fast. Must try this if you are hungry and in shyambazar area... My Rating 3.5/5

2. RasMalai : One of the most loved sweet by people. Normally the Malai part should be soft enough so that it could easily be teared, but on my visit it was bit hard to tear into halves. The prersentation was looking nice and the colour of this dessert was attractive. Thougi was not so satisfied with it. The Ras  was very nice, it was low in sugar and anyone could have it even the diabieties patients too. Overall the item was good but less satisfactory..  My Rating : 3/5

Overall Experience &Recommencation : Very few old sweet shops are exiusting in city today and its on of those. Maintaining its reputation from somany years it very difficult and serving the same quality too. But this place has carried both in nice fashion. The place may look awkward if you see inside where they cook but one thing i must say that they provide good taste. This place is reasonable and give good taste of kolkata's Kachori and sabji. Must try this place if nearby.

Went in here for a quick breakfast on the way from Dakhsineswar on a calm summer morning. The hot kochuris and hot torkari served on freshly-washed banana leaf were simply awesome and very appetising. They had served some of the finest and tastiest kochuris I've ever tasted. An old shop, one can try out their kochuris or sweets surely for once.

Squeaky clean banana leaf, two fluffy kachoris and a ladle of aloor torkari. A side of sweets at the end of your meal. Take your pick from a considerable range of authentic bangali mishtis. The sheer bliss of nostalgia really....
I remember noticing this tiny roadside sweet shop the first day of my college while going home. Starving, I went in. Although looking back now, I realize that I actually would have preferred a not so shabby shack at that time, I'm glad that I didn't. No matter how big we grow, or how heavy our wallets get, some simple things pull us closer to the roots- and such things are always worth holding on to.

This is an old sweet shop bang on Shyambazar 5 point crossing, with a separate sitting area. Though mainly a sweet shop it is famous for its Bengali luchi daal / torkari served in the authentic way on kolapata.

I have tried their langcha, which was good. The luchi daal / torkari was simple and authentic. There are very few places in Calcutta that serve khoshawala alur torkari (potato with skin curry), fewer that serve luchi. So enjoy them here.

Haridas Modak is one known name in North Kolkata. Their "kochuri-alur torkari" is to die for. The piping hot singaras are enough to give you foodgasm and their docile, juicy roshogollas are a must try! Modak is another name for tradition. Cheap in price, high in quality. Do foodies want anything else?

This sweet shop is located on the lane opposite shyambazar golbari , almost next to the just baked shyambazar outlet. Their sweets are ordinary but tasty and are reasonably priced . The rosogolla is spongy and not the chhena version that I prefer . The gurer gujiya was an innovative and interesting item I tasted here . They have seats and a basin and is usually thronged by loyalists. Overall , an average sweet shop that is conveniently located.

This place actually has 3 divisions...an old-fashioned sweet outlet,a newer one,and a small eating area.
The hot luchis and the aloo curry is really a welcome sight after tiring walks nearby. They serve on pieces of cut banana leaves.
The best part is that the food is fresh and tasty. The mithais they sell are also bery good,especially the array ofnolen gurer sondesh in winters. The talsaash is also worth a double-take. And i also have the kalo-jaam because it is a personal favourite of mine.
Now the lists of all the mishtis i've ever had here is quite long and hence unfeasible...so i suggest you to go and find out for itself the ones you like.

As my workplace is at Shyambazar, I had walked pass this place many a times and never bothered to enter the place as it looks pretty shanty from outside but I did had the knowledge of its tradition. One day my father recommended this shop to me and I finally paid a visit during lunchtime.
I ordered their luchi and cholar dal along with two langcha and followed by a sandesh (forgot the name). Tastewise good, but nothing droolworthy, what repelled me was their use of dalda :(, sandesh was good though.¬†
If you want to visit this place for tradition's sake, then ok, other than that its nothing special.

the shop may not give much attraction to eyes but once you try out the gulab jamun given to after the a healty luchi torkari given its taste stick in your tongue for pretty long hours thats what makes this sweet shop a must visit if you ever comming to shyambazar to for some casual hangout and light dining this sweet shop is the one you shouldn't miss

One of the Oldest and best sweet selling shops in Shyambazaar area of Kolkata.
I would hop into this place for some luchi and cholar dal for breakfast.
For my sweet-tooth I would dig in for the rasagollas of this place.It is so sweet that gulping down 10 of them at one go,seems like a click away.
If you're visiting this place you must have the rosomalai as well.The malai is simply great in taste and adds to the quintessential part of the Bengali Sweet Culture of Calcutta.

Located in Shyambazar crossing this place is a heritage of North Kolkata. A vintage sweet shop carrying on with its tradition with sweets and snacks <3 .. I am particularly fond of their "luchi with alur torkari" which is just fantabulous ! That " ghee e bhaja nyata nyata luchi" with "aloor torkari" is a absolutre bliss. Besides the "singara" is also great! The sweets are really great , can't mention only one or recommend any one particularly! A must try folks if you pass by !!

I have been visting this place since my childhood for morning breakfasts. According to me it serves one of the best traditional bengali luchi and chana daal on a banana leaf. The taste and quality is still the same from last 20 years. Dont judge the place by its looks or hygiene or ambiance as it will not amuse you but trust me the luchi and chana daal is to die for. Luchi costs Rs 4/- per piece.
P.S.- The luchi with chana daal is only served in the morning at it generally is finished by 11 am. so if you wana have it then go there early

Worst sweets. They are using very very low quality DALDA to prepare Luchi and Kachori. The behavior of the staff is pathetic, even the Cash collection person sitting in front of you is very rude. The shop is running due to the positional advantage ( Shyambazar 5-Point Crossing).
