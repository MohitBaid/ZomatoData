This joint serves delicious pastries and cakes at a very economical pricing range....Due to space constraint they are unable to showcase all the items at a go...Though the shop is not very spacious, it is very neat and organised.....This is an all ladies venture who are very sweet and curteous.....I hope they come up with Bakes as well..... Definitely worth giving a try....
Highly recommended......

Absolutely divine. I have tried quite a bit from the menu and have enjoyed every bite of it. It is incredibly delicious and substantial time and effort taken to perfection. A must visit. My all-time favorite place.

I ordered a customised birthday cake for my man's birthday and the work that Nicole did on that cake was just flawless both in taste as well as aesthetic appeal. It was one of the best red velvet cakes I've had in Calcutta so far!

I have been to Nicole's on several occasions and have ordered the Presto cakes which was very neatly made and even tasted awesome. I would give her 100 marks for all the cakes I have tried out.

When Nicole is behind Nicole's, one can only expect lip smacking goodies. An elaborate menu only makes it more difficult to choose, so for once stop bothering about calories and INDULGE @ NICOLE'S
