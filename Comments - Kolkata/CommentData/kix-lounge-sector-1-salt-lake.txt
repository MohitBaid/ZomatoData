It is situated at Salt lake City Centre beside Haka. The ambience was good and the Dj too. They have a 80's menu which is good and affordable. The only thing I don't like the food quality. We ordered Dry chilly chicken and chicken spring rolls. Foods were not up to the mark according to their prices. Overall nice place for boozing.
Will visit again :)

Dated 2nd Jan, 2018, I have visited this place around 5.30 P.M.

Please be informed time is very important when you are visiting this place. We were going by the reviews and ratings before selecting this place as an evening hangout. 

Going by the ambience, the place is very nice in terms of lighting, seating arrangement, decor and music was in right tone as we were able to easily interact among friends.

Going by the food and drinks, it has just one page item on food and very vast menu on drinks. When your main intention is hangout, chit-chat, drinks; then one page food item seems sufficient. We have ordered at-least 80% of the food items excluding desserts and all of them were really delicious as well as you can customize the dishes according to your taste such as to make it more or less spicy. On drinks part, since its a weekday we enjoyed the happy hours service which was the highlighting factor of this place and we took full advantage of it. Additionally, this place will serve you "papad" with drinks and our group ordered to re-fill several times as it is very mouth-watering.

Going by the service and staff, on this part I had second thought after going by the reviews as listed below, however, we as a group decided to give it a try. As mentioned above, we entered around 5.30 and there were one couple and me and my friends. At that time only one staff to take order and serve. Later, it was communicated to us by the same person that the kitchen will remain closed during 18:30 - 19:00 hours. Hence, we have ordered the dishes in advance - so please keep this in mind. However, after 7P.M. there were more staff to help us out and more people were pouring into this place.

Overall, this place was a nice try for us and paisa vasool evening treat on the second evening of new year. 

Cheers!!

I visited this place during the weekends and I was glad that I didn't have to wait for a table. The service was fast but they were not very welcoming. Felt like they were too busy to greet or be courteous to their customers. Coming to the menu, they do not serve non-veg so a big turn off. The prices are decent. All the rates are for 30ml. The DJ was good with the music selection. There is a smoking zone for customers. Overall, A good selection for drinks within budget in Sector 1 but you can get much better options in Sector 5.

I love this place! It has a good ambience, they play good music which eventually becomes loud and happening in late evening. They have a dance floor too. Presently they offer limited but standard menu in happy hours. The food and drinks are very reasonable in usual hours also. The service and behaviour of  staff is pretty good. Only thing i want them to improve is to get some better options in cocktails..for example Long Island Iced Tea! üòã It's worth visiting this place!

This is the perfect pocket friendly place to go during happy hours and have amazing fun. The music is loud and literally drags you to the dance floor. To be honest , I had an amazing entertaining evening full of booze and dance. But yes draught beer wasn't available and also the service is a bit slow. Plus the smoking room should be a bit more spacious.

While this place took a while to find, it was certainly worth the wait. Its a big lounge with pleasant party music that complements its dimly lit ambience. We went here on a Thursday so our drinks were very cheap. We ordered two cocktails, a cosmopolitan and a screwdriver. The drinks were served quite fast and we received some snacks with our drinks, which is rare. The drinks were well made and definitely worth the money. While everything was fine, I felt like they were understaffed during the afternoon. Nevertheless, the best part was our drinks were inclusive of any taxes. I enquired about it and they said that only the food is exclusive of taxes. Awesome! So if you're looking for a cheap place to have drinks when you visit City Centre 1, I'd definitely give this place a try. Good luck!

Visited the place on the ashtami of this year's pujas.
Though in Kolkata for a long time now, this was our first visit to the place. Decent ambience, and even on such a day, we were lucky enough to accomodate ourselves to seats at the front. I took 2 captain Morgan's which I thought was extremely cheap, and the beers too were of a reasonable price. Located at the heart of city centre 1, I strongly recommend this to anyone willing to spend a couple of hours at a good lounge .

It's a nice cafe at Salt Lake City centre. Ambience is warm. Good place to hangout with big group of friends.
Staffs are very well behaved and services are good. 
They have very few food items in the menu, so food menu can get better. Foods are delicious but quantity is less. From the menu Sichuan chilly fish is very yummy.
All over a nice place within budget.

Nice ambience with friendly staffs

After visiting for an umpteenth time finally I decided to review this place. Nice place with very good ambience. No cheap crowds present. Place remains pretty empty most of the times. As it is an extension of Haka, hence the food quality is also quite good. Staffs are very well behaved and the Happy hour menu is good, though can be expanded a bit more. Card is accepted. 
The only problem here is that they start serving food only after 7pm. So, visits during 5-7pm would only let u fill ur stomach with liquid and rice chips. Speaking of rice chips, the rice chips served with drinks are quite good. Available drinks and food items are also pretty good. Definitely will visit again and again. 

P.S: However, after trying in several other places, I can totally vouch that they make the best Caipiroska in the town. Definitely try it.

Kix is a good place to have a drink when you're hanging out with your friends at city centre 1 and you don't want to spend a fortune on expensive pubs. The drinks are moderately priced and I'd suggest going there during the Happy Hours where they'll give 30+30ml for rs 80 or something. The food is okayish and goes well with the alcohol.

When you have friends by your side, every place seems obtuse. But I would like to mention here is the service at Kix lounge, owned by Haka. The place is quite savvy with reasonable prices. No only couples BS on a sunday evening adds to their pro unlike some.  Good food with good ambience creating a mix of lounge. The thing for which I withrew a point is the lack of pitchers at exclusive timings but if you are lucky you might get it.

I went to this place one evening and I was really happy to see that they ve a nice ambience. Service was good nd so was music. What I didn't like was that they don't serve you food until it's 7 pm in the evening. I went there once more after that n had the same story. "Madam, kitchen ready nahi h abhi." I mean dopahar to kya log sirf chakhna k saath hi peg mrenge?? Talking o chakhna, they serve this simple fried noodles which is amazing btw. It is dry; Crispy n will make your mouth want more o it!

We waited till seven n finally ordered some fish. Well it was good. Although quantity wasn't really satisfying still keeping in view that it's in City Center I can let go off that.

Kix is the private lounge of Haka, situated right beside Haka in City Centre Salt Lake.
This is a decent place for boozing now that they have introduced their new 80s menu.
Pros:
‚Ä¢Affordable Expenses
‚Ä¢The new 80s drink menu
‚Ä¢Service was prompt
Cons:
‚Ä¢Not much variety in food menu
‚Ä¢Smoke trails from the smoke room 
‚Ä¢Ambiance is a bit low, no dj or good music

We had screwdriver, Nutty Fruity, Beer and for snacks Drums of Heaven, Chicken Taipei and finally for dessert caramel custard and chocolava cake and vanilla ice cream.
A happy experience.

I was in City Center the other day and was craving for a drink or two after a filling lunch. I decided to put Zomato to some productive use and located Kix Lounge on the third floor. The place is illuminated by dim lights and has a decent ambiance. They do not have the most diverse menu card in terms of food and drinks and the crowd isn't very pleasant. 

I settled for a couple of Vodkatinis and a Screwdriver, each having a rejuvenating taste. The drinks are really easy on the pocket and the availability of draught beer earns them a bonus point. 

Not the most attractive of places, but it's ideal for a few drinks with a friend in the evening.

I have been visiting this place since time immemorial‚Äã but of late I must say this place isn't what it used to be. Kix really needs to up its ante in order to attract more crowd. First of all update your goddamn music. Been hearing‚Äã the same music now for what a year !! Happy hour scheme is good although you can simplify it a bit and please provide food before 7pm also. Sad to see the place once full of people‚Äã dancing their hearts out to now with empty tables with a few scsttered people here and there.

Youngsters always need to hop in a bar which will be quite easy on your pocket and yes this bar features amongst one of them. The atmosphere is nice along with the service and they play good music too. 
This bar has a happy hour starting from 1pm where they serve you 1:1 on some selected range of liqours. Please try the drums of heaven and the soft noodles. They are delicious! Apart from all these they have a seperate smoking zone where they allow you to carry your drink. So alchohol lovers, hit this bar, get high, get along !

The rating is not because of their food but because of their business strategy. We ordered draught beer, spring roll, kamakaze, tequila.
In the menu card all the prices was written like a draught beer was 80, all the prices were around that. 
Now we ordered two tequila shots when the bill came we were surprised that they charged us 320 for two tequila shots, where in the menu it's written 80 + 80. 
If you're selling one product you cannot place it in the menu card as 80 + 80 or 100 + 60, if you're charging 160 for one shot just write it down. When you're writing 80 + 80 in your menu card people may think it's a pair of shots cost 80 each. When someone asks your age you don't say 30 + 30 just so you want to look young with less numeric values mentioned.

The prices here have literally hit the ground. Very very easy on the pocket. But the general crowd which hits the place may be a disappointment to some. Again matter of choice. You cannot complain about the prices.  But couple of issues with this place. 
 Number one - you do not get food between 6- 7 pm. Now these are peak hours on weekends. They should really do something about this because they will be missing out on business due to this. 
Number two - Amateur staff. Not all, but yeah some of them. 
Visit the place if for value for money!!

Visited this place on 7th May, 2017. It's located at City Center 2nd Floor just beside Haka. In fact it's an unit of Haka.
The pub looks as pubs should be, dimly lit, loud music etc. The dance floor requires special mention. Loved to dance with the DJ's tune. But the food & service are of sub par quality. We have ordered some chicken & fish starters. Then pan fried gravy noodles. None of them tasted as it should be. Service was even poorer. It's good that they're don't charge you for service.

Pros:
1. Location
2. Dance floor.

Cons:
1. Food quality.
2. Service.

This lounge is located on the 3rd floor of E block, at CC1. The place is great for chilling after a tiring day, and the side seats are sofas so you can make yourself at home. The lights are dim, with laser lights moving to the beat of popular bollywood tracks . The music may be tad loud for a conversation, but if you're in the mood for dancing two drinks later , then this place is it for you !! The service is good , and the staff are attentive and courteous . The happy hours are the best time to be here, and if you're a beer person , then the draught beer is pitcher perfect ! They also have 1:1 offers on whisky , vodka ,rum and brandy . The smoking zone is separate , a stuffy glass room in a corner with sofas for two. The food here however is limited, so don't go in on an empty stomach, or else you will be disappointed. Their chicken spring rolls are served two in a plate , sliced into 6 pieces . The do make a decent screw driver , but the cosmopolitan tasted unbearably syrupy. They also serve salt with shots , when requested !  Everything about this place is great for unwinding after a tiring day/ week , so hop in , as long as they don't have party bookings inside where you're not invited !!

The best part about this place is its ambience and the soothing music in the background.
It also has a smoking room attached.
The place attracts people of varying age groups starting from college students to middle aged people.The cocktails were amazing.. and the food was  mouth-watering at the same time
The service was good enough 
But since we were the only customers so  it is not a appropriate  situation to evaluate.
I would love to visit this place again.
Kix is a perfect place for small parties.

The lights are dim, with laser lights moving to the beat of popular bollywood tracks . The music may be tad loud for a conversation, but if you're in the mood for dancing two drinks later , then this place is it for you !! The service is good , and the staff are attentive and courteous . The happy hours are the best time to be here, and if you're a beer person , then the draught beer is pitcher perfect ! They also have 1:1 offers on whisky , vodka ,rum and brandy . The smoking zone is separate , a stuffy glass room in a corner with sofas for two. The food here however is limited, so don't go in on an empty stomach, or else you will be disappointed. Their chicken spring rolls are served two in a plate , sliced into 6 pieces . The do make a decent screw driver , but the cosmopolitan tasted unbearably syrupy. They also serve salt with shots , when requested !  Everything about this place is great for unwinding after a tiring day/ week , so hop in , as long as they don't have party bookings inside where you're not invited !!

The best part about this place is its ambience and the soothing music in the background.
It also has a smoking room attached.
The place attracts people of varying age groups starting from college students to middle aged people.The cocktails were amazing.. and the food was  mouth-watering at the same time
The service was good enough 
But since we were the only customers so  it is not a appropriate  situation to evaluate.
I would love to visit this place again.
Kix is a perfect place for small parties.

It was my one of the friends party - newly married guy. Although I'm not a keen party hopper, but it was once in a life time offer- wedding party, so utilise it to max depending on my friend's capacity, I can say to some extent. And Kix(shortlisted and finalised) by my friend didn't let me down. Just half point cut for the quality otherwise it's almost 5 and rest is history, trust my jurisdiction...

The location is very convenient.
We ordered chicken drumsticks, chicken noodles with oyster sauce, mojitos and deep sea diver.
I really liked the mojitos and the food. The drumstick and noodles were delicious. I wish they had more food options in their menu.
The bonus is you get great deals during the happy hour.

An average place to hang out. Do not expect a lot out of this place. The seating arrangement is very formal, which does not feel very comfortable and enjoyable.
The music suddenly bursts through the roof after 8 pm, which might be uncomfortable at the beginning, but then you get used to it.
The place serves only starters as food, that too the average kind.
The waiters seem a little uninterested to take care of you after a little while, which might take away a little bit of the fun.
All in all, I would say there are places in Kolkata better than this one, to hang out.

This place is close to my house so I've been here quite a number of times. We ordered the beer tower which is equivalent to 6 mugs of beer and charges you for 3 mugs (during happy hours which is from 1pm to 8pm) and comes to be around 745/- (which is hell of a lot if you consider it's for 3 mugs only). We also ordered a plate of chilly chicken which was well prepared (Note how this is an extension of Haka and possibly prepared in their kitchen). 
Good ambience, but the playlist is sadly extremely repetitive and worn out. Also this was the second time we went when the power went off and they had to open the door we had to sit in the dark for a while. The service is good and the munchies served with the alcohol is usually refilled on time. One of the better lounges in city center.

I've been a regular visitor for last four years. This place is really pocket friendly. Love their happy hour offers. It has also got a smoking room attached. The ambience is also pretty nice with decent crowds. üëçüèº
But after visiting the place yesterday, I've decided not to go back to the place ever again. The reason being the terrible loud music that they played. I have always disliked their choice of music. But it was somehow tolerable. Last day it crossed all the limits. They played all sorts of cheap bollywood item songs starting from sheela ki jawani to what not! Moreover, they kept increasing the volume even after telling them to change the music. It was so pathetic that we finished all our drinks inside the smoking room itself (where the sound was not so loud) and ran off. 
I really really request the staffs to play better music. But even if you do, I don't think that I'm going to go back their to give it one more try. üòê

I have been meaning to review this place for quite sometime now ... Though I hv been here only once and that to by a prodding friend of mine who happens to be a regular here, I must say the first visit really did the trick. It's a moderate sized lounge in city centre 1, which has a nice and cozy environment till 8 pm . But right after 8pm one can see a huge change in the environment..the sophisticated dimly lit lounge turns  into a crazy dance floor with the music going wild, lights switched off apart from the disco streaks... 
Service, cisting and decor also gets a 4 pointer from mee.... Only issue ..space crunch after 7pm 
Must visit !!

Kix is a lounge bar which is located in the heart of city centre. It has been recently renovated and has been revamped into a classy and luxurious place to hangout. It attracts people of all age groups varying from college students to middle aged men and women. The happy hours which are from 1pm in the afternoon to 8pm in the night is the real deal.The draught beer which comes at a very reasonable price at this hour is worth mentioning.We had orderded a dry chilli chicken as well which was quite tasty.The prawn chips which are on the house is repeated as many times as you ask for it without a frown.The music is very soothing and the dimly lit lights make for a very comfortable atmosphere. After 8 o clock their in house dj takes over the console and the lazer lights are switched on.The atmosphere changes completely and their small dance floor comes to life. It is a perfect place to unwind and shake a leg without being too hard on your wallet. :)

Love to visit the place again and again. Located in the city centre, salt lake, it recieves a good crowd all the time. From 5-8pm it has got happy hours. During that time the place is quite lit up with lamps hanging over each table and the music being not that loud. After 8 pm when the happy hours get over the house dj comes in, and the place suddenly turns to disc but a smaller version. Lasers, flash lights, loud music changes the complete ambiance.

The menu is very much affordable and is very okay compared to a place like this.  The service provided is also to the mark and the food served is really nice. People love visiting the place cause they find both type of environments be it chilling or be it partying. 

So overall its a place where you can either hangout with your friends or you can just go partying.

Location: 2nd floor of Citi Centre 1, adjacent to Haka!

Ambience and decor : Dark interiors lit up by downlighters and LEDs does set the mood for drinking. Choice of music is much appreciated! Crowd is decent enough.

Food ordered: 

‚Ä¢Fire baked fish : This was the best among the rest. The fish was fresh and perfectly cooked. Crispy thin coating on the outside and flaky on the inside, this deserves a recommendation!

‚Ä¢ fried chili chicken : 10 small pieces were served. Lacks punch. Tasted average!

‚Ä¢ chicken drumsticks(Hong Kong style) : Pathetic in taste. Do not try.

‚Ä¢ 3 chocolate ice creams and 1 butterscotch ice cream : Very regular in taste! Nothing special.

Drinks ordered:

‚Ä¢ draught beer (‚Çπ140) - on 1:1 offer. 

‚Ä¢ 30ml Vodka - 2 with 7up!

Service: Very average.

I went during their happy hours time! What I felt was that their drinks was bit diluted! I had 60ml of 6 pegs still didn't feel i was high. When i mixed my drinks with beer i felt something. Fried chicken was tasty but quantity served was very less. Ambience is nice but i felt sound was too high. And also they didn't object to couple who was sitting beside me and was doing all obscene thing openly. Any decent restaurant will not allow it.

A decent lounge bar situated in City Centre 1. Dim lighting, wooden tables, ivory sofas, stools etc and of course the psychedelic bar counter make up the decor of the semi-dark interior befitting a lounge. Since I've been here only once and that also for a short time I really cannot recall everything in minute detail. A few friends and I had dropped in here for some relaxation, friendly chitchat and booze. We'd ordered Smirnoff and Antiquity Blue along with fried chilli chicken. Though I'm a light drinker - almost a teetotaller but not quite - and had dabbled in the alcoholic beverages very little, the whiskey and vodka had been fair enough, though given a choice personally I would go for the whisky any day for its pleasantly mild taste. For loungers looking to enjoy their drinks with ease and leisure, Chinese food, intoxicating alcohol and zesty nightlife Kix is a nice option.

Kix existed from the day CC1 was incepted. The space might be small. But the ambience ever happening. the place attracts a lot of crowd in the afternoon because of their happy hour deals. Remember ordering just a chicken dish.

Super friendly staff, prawn papad with drinks :D Kix is an all time favourite. Their happy hours make the joint one of the most affordable in the city. The DJ comes in sometime post 8 pm and takes requests. You can transform it into your own personal party :P

Situated on the 2nd floor of city centre 1, this place has been a boon to us all these 5 years of college. Initially the place used to look a lot different (shady lights, Red and Blue in particular) however after the renovation it looks lot classier.  The area is spacious, dimly lit... soothing lights and good music. The alcohol here is quite reasonable. Happy hours are from 2-7 and the DJ starts playing music post 7. For people like me who are still is college and don't have a lot of money to spend on alcohol ( but have the urge to drink) ...this my friends is the place to be. üòâ. 3 litre draught beer tower for 745 bucks( including tax) cheap right? Oh and you get prawn papad as chakhna. ‚ù§ I love kix.

I visited this place with a couple of my friends in the happy hours (1 to 8pm).
It had a well equipped and ornate cocktail menu along with beer et cetera. Overall it's a nice place to go to if you have some time to kill. Music playlist was equally impressive. Quick and courteous staff. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone

This lounge is situated just above the KFC floor in City Center 1. I went there thrice and during the happy hour (afternoon time). During this time they run a buy 1 get 1 offer. If I go with two or three people, I usually take the Tower of Kingfisher draught beer (3 litres big tower). I really like the flavour. I tried fried garlic chicken and it was good. Ambience is nice and dark.

The drought conditions of draught beer can be unnerving at times. I visited the place 3 days in a row and could get my hands on draught beer only on the 3rd day. A little pricy too, but all in all the beer flows like water here and the ambience and music complement each other. Best place for a weekend getaway.

A small lounge with decent sized sitting arrangements with a dance floor.

Location: This one located in city centre saltlake E block 2nd floor.

A place for people to booze and have fun with a small dance floor. The bar section looks decent . 
Food is not extra ordinary just about OK. 

For me it's a okish place if you wanna just have drinks and enjoy music.

Disclaimer:This place is a viable option only when visited during happy hours.Because otherwise the ambience and experience don't match up to the prices.
The place is too small and basic to be a plush lounge.The cocktails are watered down and do not provide the necessary kick.
But somehow the perspective totally changes during the happy hours.At half the prices and a less crowded atmosphere you can while away your time with friends for hours over cocktails and finger food.The hawaian iced tea and knock me out are my picks out of the concoctions on offer.
If yoy find yourself in cc1 during their happy hours and have time to kill with friends over some light drinking,this is the place to be.

If you need a place to hang out with friends which has a happy hour/moderately priced booze at CC1,Kix may be an option.And there is not much to say,it's "so so" in all departments so it's better to let the booze do the talking.

It was probably my 3rd or 4th visit today and this was the second time they didn't have any draught in stock. As it is I had a few complaints about this place. The lighting is bad, rather dark (specially once the DJ takes over). Music is too loud (you can barely hear the one sitting right next to you). The only highlight was the draught beer at reasonable price (only during happy hours though), and they fail to maintain its stock. 
Overall, not a pleasant experience.

Great place to hangout at if you have a tad extra cash in your pocket. If you can then go within the happy hours time period. Drinks are as good as in any bar. A bit small for a lounge but the dj will more than suffice for the lack of space. Dont forget to wear your dance shoes. A small warning, dj starts after happy hours is over. Big disappointment.

The place has a good selection of spirits and beer.  The weekdays are good as the place is quiet and u can have a chat with friends. On weekends go there if you are in the mood to dance n party

A good party spot in Saltlake. Have been here a couple of times. Would love to visit again.

Nice ambience. Nice music. Prices are ok. And food is good. Just the staff are a bit lazy. I remember ordering a few plates of chili chicken dry and a pitcher of beer. The food was ready and kept on the counter and the staff instead of serving first, was gossiping with the other staff at the counter. I mean nobody gives a damn what he does after he's done with the work he's meant to do. He should've have served first. That is utterly unprofessional. Otherwise its a good place to be with friends.

target the happy hours (till 8 PM) 1+1 on all drinks including draught beer & to add on that...... unlimited refill of finger foods, Kix is among the best places to booze around CC1 at reasonable price.

Decent ambience with lights changing shades frequently, nice spread of finger food & good music (though at times very loud which could be an issue), KIX offers good relaxing option after a hectic day at work.

I went there with a friend. And was a bit unsure to go as we were two girls. The door is very heavy to open or close. The place is not so lit up as its a lounge. The service is slow. We went during happy hour and ordered only one dish. Haka chilli chicken, it was nice. Draught beer is the speciality of this place. Music is a bit too loud. But the dj was good. Overall we enjoyed there but it's better to go there in a group. If you are a group of nly ladies then it's better to carry something for defense like pepper spray. I would advice the place to have more staff.

Firstly change ur ambiance .secondly, use a proper glass to serve a drink. I hope next time I wont be offended.

Not a great place to party because of damn loud music that would give you a headache and the service is not that refined.

The menu items and the drinks are just about ok and so is the price but the ambience. The experience is not something many would find soothing specially if you want to spend some good time with your friends or lived ones. One visit is all that would be their last for many.

Located at a hotspot like City Center, this place is one of the favorites among the youth for booze. The place is not that big but can accommodate around 30 people and the tables are placed with some distance between them. The interiors are pretty plain and simple with comfortable couches and more stress has been laid on lightings. The entire zone is dimly lit with a wall behind changing colors at intervals. The music gets louder with the night and sometimes it can be very irritating as the very next person wont be able to hear you. The price of alcohol is on the lower side and thus the rush. The food is okayish in terms of finger snacks with me liking the baked fish and the fried chilli chicken. They have a smoking zone inside and i would recommend them to install an air cleaner inside as it gets a lot stuffy and suffocating. Overall a perfect place for bachelors to enjoy at a pocket friendly pricings.

Well went here over a Sunday evening, decent set of crowd comes in, especially for the happy hours (not applicable on a sunday). The ambiance is decent, not something out of the world, but what excites me about this place is the music. They play a good mix of yesteryears and amalgamates it with the Pitbulls and Avici's of the GenX. Definitely makes your feet tune into the music and run up to the small dance floor for a quick dance. Also, coming down to the food, well it was decent, would say amazing, neither would i say bad, but decent to taste. And if you are going for a quick drink, i dont think food really matters that much here either. For a change i ordered for a couple of cocktails here, caprirojca and a screw driver, both of them tasted good, and definitely a recommendation from my bit to go ahead and try them. Overall decent place to hang out, decent place to hangout too with friends. Music lovers might find it interesting and fun as well.

Happy Munchin :)

Kix is adjacent to the Haka restaurant in City Centre,and basically the food served here is same as that of Haka,as it is their lounge section..This place is ideal for tippler as they have a happy hour offer going on till 8pm and virtually they give away 1:1 on most of their drinks and cocktails..They also serve shisha..the interiors though a bit cramped up compared to other lounges,the music is too loud at times..and you might need to actually share your tables at rush hours..Their starters are delicious, the service is prompt and helpfull..definitely you can give this place a try if you are in the vicinity looking for a couple of drinks over conversations..I really enjoyed the Hawain Iced Tea and the Fish Satay..the Iced Tea gives you the perfect kick..overall recommended..

Inspite of havn not so happening ambience being a lounge, but the food experience was way to good! Had the best fried chilli chicken ever! It had d perfect crunch with a juicy tender boneless piece f chicken within. We ordered haka chilli chicken which was quite like any other chilli chicken, but yet again, the tender ness was awesome. In main course we had cheese pan noodles with vegetables which was served in black sauce and tasted good. But yes i admit to the other reviewers, that they mix less alcohol in cocktail, d screwdrivers just failed to unscrew me :-P But the food was way to good and i loved it!

Kix is adjacent to the Haka restaurant in City Centre,and basically the food served here is same as that of Haka,as it is their lounge section..This place is ideal for tippler as they have a happy hour offer going on till 8pm and virtually they give away 1:1 on most of their drinks and cocktails..They also serve shisha..the interiors though a bit cramped up compared to other lounges,the music is too loud at times..and you might need to actually share your tables at rush hours..Their starters are delicious, the service is prompt and helpfull..definitely you can give this place a try if you are in the vicinity looking for a couple of drinks over conversations..I really enjoyed the Hawain Iced Tea and the Fish Satay..the Iced Tea gives you the perfect kick..overall recommended..

Please don't entertain this joint before 8pm. It's as dead as a morgue. Although there are happy hours available here. It is sure to make u anything but happy. The only saving grace here is the menu card.

It is a good place if budget is the main concern.During happy hours on selected drinks you get one free with one which reduces the burden on the pocket.The ambiance is average and the music is pretty boring but who cares after you get the booze in your belly hitting you.

Me & my friends visited this lounge & we had a wild experience of getting booze. We went there during happy hours. Get 3+3 beers & it was 8 o clock. So, they did not take orders for happy hours. So, we ordered some coctail & vodka. Again the waiter came & told someone had cancelled their order. So, we can get more beer of happy hours. We took another 5+5. Total 8 liters of beer among 3 people. It was huge. Starters were also good. Service was slow & only few waiters were over there. Otherwise it's a good place for party & dance over the songs of dj. I am besically a party freak guy from mumbai, the main problem of kolkata z govt takes 27% sale tax from club & which clubs takes from customers. Which is not acceptable. In mumbai liquir rate is more than kolkata bt neither govt or clubs transfer guge amount of taxes over customer.

Hmmm... This is a place in kolkata , which is even pocket friendly , and happening ¬†, specially on Saturday and Sundays. ¬†One thing , absolutely fantastic about Kix is it's Happy hours menu... You get Buy 1 Get 1 on awesome brands as Antiquity Blue , Old Monk , Smiroff, Cool Mocktails and Mojitos. They don't serve dinner , you'll just get lip smacking snacks here .¬†

Downside is the Dj starts playing good music after 9:00 and the Lounge gets shutdown at 10:30 . I am a frequent visitor here , but have never found gatherings after 10:00 , even when it is located at a viablant City Centre , Salt Lake .

It is a perfect place for starters , college goers , and people who want to spend a cool evening , without a crack in their pocket . But don't expect too much or too less. You will definelty be surprised on every visit.

For a girl on budget but needs to PARTY this is the place. Happy hours really makes you happy and they serve these little bundles of happy and FREE titbits with the drinks. I would suggest, go for the beer mug or one of those delightful mocktails. Though the dance space is small,but you'll have a helluva time !

Worst place ever!!
Go at your own risk!! 
This place has degraded so drastically, that iWork's never visit this place again. 
I would not recommend u to go for any cocktails out here. 
One should try the draught beer here during the happy hours. ¬†
It has a separate smoking area...
One thing that is annoying about this place is this place is they play too loud music while the DJ plays ¬†and plus they have a very bad collection of songs.

Nice relaxing space, located just beside Haka at the 2nd floor of city center. Ambience is very nice here. In fact if you just want to chillax with friends and do not want to go to overpriced places in park street then this is a good option. the food is always good, the lighting is interesting. My friends have also liked this place. we last time went for a birthday celebration and we really enjoyed ourselves.

Visited KIX lounge yesterday, i.e. on a Saturday evening at around 6. Its located in City Centre, Salt Lake, the lounge can be located very easily once u r there in city centre. I had read quite positive reviews about KIX on zomato, hence called them prior to ur visit for getting more details. the HAPPY HOURS on drinks(1:1) are from 1-8 pm for all 7 days. However, the happy hours are only for selected drinks, but that was not much of a problem for us.
AMBIANCE: 5/5, the lighting effects were pretty cool,seating was comfortable as well.
SERVICE: A bit on the slower side when it comes to delivering the food, however when serving the drinks they were pretty prompt.
COST: There were 2 of us and we had ordered:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 2 plates of schezwan chicken
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 1 chicken satay with peanut sauce
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 1 item of fish, dont remember the name
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Mojito (had the 1:1 offer)
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Long Island Iced Bull (didnt have the 1:1 offer)
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Big Brothers Visual (1:1 offer applicable)
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Smirnoff (1:1 applicable)
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 2 Brownie with Ice cream
All the above had cost only 2175 :):) which is damn cheap, and the all 3 dishes were just too tasty, and I highly recommend the schezwan chicken.

All in all, a great place to have drinks and food when your pockets are tight. It was a great experience for us coming here, and would obviously visit soon.

Happy hours makes me happy. And I am happier when it is Kix Lounge. The wall lighting was awesome, the peppy numbers played by the Dj, the comfy sofa, and most importantly the smoking corner. The draught beer was chilled and good as always. The screwdriver was equally good. And the Bartender was polite enough. The only problem with the place was that exhaust system of the smoking corner was out of order. This place is surely going to be on the top of my list whenever I need to Grab a drink or two outside or to hangout with my alcoholic friends.

This is a cool place in city centre 1 to hangout with friends if you do not wanna go to park street and is also not heavy on your pocket. The ambience is decent but thebmusic not so good.
The price of booze is not very high. The only thing i do not like much is their limited food menu. However they serve this complimentary prawn chips along with the drinks which is pretty cool.

A hectic day at work should follow a chilled out evening on ideal occasions and this was the case for us . The place located at city centre was quite empty on a Friday evening . Since happy hours were on we went for a draught along with screw driver . The music was not loud and the ambiance was also decent . They could however think of improving their music . Coming to the food we didn't have much option as we were on a veg diet . We ordered 
chilly babycorn : this was pretty good
Crispy chilli mushroom: this was extremely spicy 
French fries : crisp and good 

The staff was kind enough to leave the mushroom out of the bill . The service was great . Prices were cheap. All the guys who are in a mood to drink at cheap price and decent ambiance should head here.

Headed up to this place at around 3 o' clock in the afternoon and found it closed.The staff asked us to come about half an hour later.The place isn't much spacious and the ambience doesn't cast a charm on you either.However it doesn't disappoint in terms of booze.We had gone during happy hours and got Kingfisher draught 1:1 for 170 bucks.The beer was quite awesome. As for starters we had ordered crispy baby corn, mixed veg mushroom chilly dry, french fries.Baby corn and french fries were lip smacking. However the mushroom was too spicy for the taste buds.The waiter was generous enough to leave the mushrooms out of the bill.A must visit if you are looking for a place to have cheap booze and chill out with ur gang.Don't miss the draught :P

I m a regular visitor in KIX. Quite a cool place to hang-out with friends. Ambience is casual. Drinks are quite cheap (happy hours till 8pm 1 : 1). Only drawbacks are no regular resident DJ & there are pretty less food options to opt for. But, foods are tasty & service is also fast as it is a very small place. Have tried dishes like fried chilli chicken, golden drums of heaven, crispy fish chilli flakes with pepper. All are delicious. And, of course dont' shy to ask them for replenishment of the complimentary prawn papads!!!

Dont want to go to park street. want to just jam in somewhere nearby. Kix is such a place where you can go once in a while to enjoy drinks and music. Ambiance is average with a resident dj who plays music ranging from trance, EDM¬† to bollywood. The drinks are pretty reasonable and the food platter is also good. So next time if you are too lazy to party just drop in here if you stay in this side of town... you will have a good time.

I visited this place with my friend,since we were in cc1 and were having a craving for a nice long chat over a bit of booze.The place is dark,with neon lights,which was fine by me.The booze is cheap,especially since we went during the happy hours.We had a pina colada each,since there was no beer.The pins colada,though pleasant to taste,did not have any detectable pineapple flavour as such.The smoking room is definitely cramped.There were six of us,and my eyes were watering due to the smoke.The music is loud,and sometimes rubbish.Overall its just a nice place if u want a couple of drinks to pass a lazy afternoon with ur buddies.

First lounge experience. The music is too loud. The plus points - cost is ok, affordable, didn't have much starters so can't really talk about them. A smoking room is definitely helping for people who needs smoke or two with drink. Nice place nice ambiance. Hard core pub-goers would rate it low though

To start of with very nice place to hangout in happy hours (1-8)  if you want to be too economical because of 1+1 offer :D . It is not that big lounge just capacity of max 10 tables and not over crowded on weekends too :o . Very less variety of food and drinks. Interior is very dark makes difficulties in seeing the menu card. Ambiance is very good in evening and hard core music at night. You do have dance area. Serving was very good. Good place for privacy. Strange I felt is it has smoking area inside and restroom outside the lounge :P

Four of us visited this place. It was my friend's birthday and she was giving us a treat. The decor if not great but was okay but i must say that it is very dark and i was really having difficulty in reading the menu card. We tried two cocktails which were well prepared and we quite liked it. The happy hours makes it economical. But the food is not really good and they hardly have any options in their food items. Overall the place is quite okay and does not really have any unique element which would make me rate this place high.

Went to this place today with few of my friends. I'm all for low lit bars, but this place is a little too dark. Ambience wise, it does not have much to offer other than a colourful wall that keeps changing colour every few seconds (which looks rather nice). Coming to the food, it is strictly average and you might be better off ordering as little as possible because it will invariably disappoint you. They have a decent collection of drinks and have happy hours (1+1 free) on week days, which is nice. However today in beer, all they had was kingfisher - which happens to be my least favourite, so that was a little shocking. All in all, average place with decent price on drinks. Go for it if other places are full or over your budget. Also it is almost never crowded so could be a good place if you needed privacy. Thanks for reading :)

Been there two times.This place is somewhat an isolated one.....Both the times,i went there,hardly there were two three groups around.
                   Ambiance is good and its not a bad kick to your pocket (Depends on your consumption).....We ordered beer and some starters and wrapped up with few pegs of whiskey.
 
About the music-Well its not extreme loud,but loud enough that would resist you to talk with yours pals.Service was okay,not too impressed by their service....They have to prompt.

One of most disappointing thing or the thing I didnt like about Kix,is- they have a separate smoking chamber.A bit smaller and too claustrophobic.Though it is nice,for ppl who don't smoke .For me it was a tiring job to go for a puff every time to that chamber,between your drinks.

So,it is a recommended one,( if you r not to heavy on ur pocket and you r @ city centre 1 ),then you can go n hve some drinks over there.

I visited this place with four other guys and girls on the afternoon of my birthday. My friends had come to meet me and they had wanted a drink. And I am always up for trying new things. I liked the dark ambience of the place and the afternoon meant very few people in there. We had nice drinks and I highly recommend the Dose 3 shots for those who like their high. The drinks were good and the smoking room as usual felt like a damn chimney. But the overall experience was very pleasing to me. Sadly I have never been to Kix again but surely I will go there some time! Try it if you want nice music and a good drink at City Centre!

Been to Kix with a few friends. We had ordered some beer and were sitting and chilling. No one bothered to disturb and we werent in a hurry.

This is one place where you can chill for hours, no one to disturb. Music is a bit loud. They could lower it down maybe. Ambience wine its just fine. But yes, people here are non-chalant about your presence, and its almost empty half the time.
Food, I didnt find anything that good to order. I instead went to kfc straightway!

Its all pitch dark with a few neon lights here and there. They really nee dto pull up their socks because Kix isnt visited very often by people. Work on the ambience. I do not like the crowd here. Even the staff isnt very professional.

Pull up your socks else you'll fall flat!

A second visit might not be coming soon.

probably the only reason I go to this place is coz of the buy one get one free offer... 
the service is pathetic, extremely slow.. the waiters don't refil the snacks that come complimentary with the drink.. you have to ask them for it again n again.. what I find ridiculous is that we usually go in like a group of 6.. n they give one plate of chips.. that's it. 
regardless of that.. the ambience is good. n I like the way my screwdriver tastes.

Too loud music, too slow service are the two things I hate in the Kix lounge. That and the fact that they think that because I am a woman, I probably would not understand it if the server does not mix a drink properly. I went there last time with a friend and had a Bloody Mary which was a huge glass of tomato juice with a slight dousing of Vodka... seriously, there was no taste involved. The service was slow, and although the beer was chilled, I hated the overly loud music right after 6.00 p.m. causing us to shout at each other. The chilli chicken was strictly okay tastewise. 

This place needs to seriously improve its quality.

This is an awesome place to have economical booze cause they have the 1+1 offer going till 8 Pm. Apart from the 1+1 offer their menu prices for premium booze is also very economical. Though their starter options are very limited still this place very pleasing due to the ambience and the music that they play. Weekends post 8 Pm the ambience changes to that of a disc....though if you arrive late u will have a hard time finding a place to sit...

This bar is quietly hidden in one of the block in City Centre.Its a small pub with an exclusive smoking zone.The point of attraction are the Happy Hours.The seating pattern & the service need improvement, the ambience isn't very friendly nor is the staff deployed..The food isn't great either.I would recommend the place only for people looking to avail happy hours.But do drop in for fresh beer at low prices.

I was here with some friends and my wife. The place is dimly lit with changing lights along a wall. It was almost empty when we entered and remained as such till we left. There was a 1+1 offer on which attracted us and we had a total of 6 mugs of draught beer, 2 glasses of draught beer and a mocktail. All this came up to about 800 bucks which I think was extremely economical. The place itself wasn't too great. Service was ok. There were some prawn chips served along with the beer which is fine. Their food menu is not worth going through. I guess I'll go there next time I am looking for cheap liquor.

One of the few places where we college people can go for hangout beacuse of the happy hours(from 3-8).Draught beer here tastes so good that you don't realise when you should stop.Ambience is perfect and the music always suits the mood and the lights keep changing.Perfect place to go for a date or to take your frineds out for a drink.

Food here is a bit overpriced but the starters which i tasted were really good,specially the crispy chicken and chilli baby corn.They also have a wide variety in cocktails  but personally i would go for the draught beer :) :)

A mood bar located in City Center, Kix has become a common hangout for college goers. Happy hours start from afternoon with the 'buy one get one free' offer. A bottle of draught would cost you 80 bucks and you get the second one for free. Vodka is priced at 150 bucks and above and again you'll get the second peg free.

The ambiance is good and the lights keep changing continuously, which acts like quite a mood lifter.
Overall a nice place to hangout alone or with your friends and loved ones.
