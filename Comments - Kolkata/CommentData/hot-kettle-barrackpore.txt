Ethnic decorations with bamboo furnitures and chau masks are quite impressive. Live music setup is there but not regularly staged. Food is not up to the level, less quantity and poor avaibility. Service is okay. Nice place to have a get together and adda with friends.

Ambiance is good.. Good music playing.. Live music is also available sometimes.. Food can be better.. But the cheese omelet we tried was actually good.. Over all a good hang out place specially when you are low in budget and have a big gang to feed..
One issue is some of the items in the menu wasn't available..that needs to change..
Ny way good job team hot kettle..

Ambience is good . Khatiyas placed and seats made of bamboo giving dhaba like feel.Good music plays in the background. There was a drummer too who was playing live.
Menu card is fancy but majority of the items were unavailable. Burger,pasta,chicken wings etc... Whatever you name ,nothing is available. We settled with cold coffee with ice cream,oreo shake,chicken cheese grilled sandwich and chicken in basket. Cold coffee and sandwich were edible. Rest two were terribly bad. Oreo shake tasted like milk with Parle g biscuit mixed with it. Worst was the chicken in basket. Cafe staff had suggested it but it was terrible. Hard,without any taste, seemed like a fish fry but then, fish fry tastes much better.
