Most pathetic place I have ever been to. Worst ambience. The staff quality is poor. They are very rude to their customers. Especially their manager and their owner. 

Coming to the food, the quality is below the par. The ingredients used are not fresh and there is no balance in the taste of the dishes. I had no idea what I was eating. According to the standard of food, it is quite costly. Actually this restaurant is no value for money. 

The food quality is poor. The service and staff behaviour is pathetic. I am not visiting this one again in near future!

I was going thru all the reviews and was really shocked where some said the food was bad. The food is superb man. Especially, Singapore Rice, Schezwan Paneer, Kadhai Paneer, Babycorn etc. It's my go-to place since 2010 (for food only). It's Value for money. Rather way more value for far less money.

A great place to hangout.The foods are delicious as well as the service.The ambience is really good.The tandoori,mutton,chicken dishes are mouth watering.The rice dishes are amazing to taste.The soups are tastes really exotic.Wanna visit there again.
The tandoori dishes are mouth watering like - tandoori chicken,chicken aachari etc.
The mutton dishes is one of the delicasy here.
The rice dishes are so flavoured and lip smacking.
The ambience is comfortable.Quality food.Quality crowed. 
A nice place to hangout with friends and family.A perfect place to dine out.

This place has been the adda spot for many days for me and my friends. Its just 5 minutes away from my house and our gang would occassionally drop here for a pint of beer and good food. The dishes they make are awesome . The indian dishes specially . Chicken tandoori masala, bharta, kadai name it and all of them are delicious. The best feature of this place is that this place is very pocket friendly. The staff are good and very helpful. Totally a hangout destination for youngsters.
Cheers!!
Keep it up !!

Not bad...service is good but it can be execute with more carefully...all type of drinks are available.smoking is allowed.
But it is a only bar.but the atomosphere is family bar.
