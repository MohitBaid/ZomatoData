A lovely little joint serving great Chinese food at good rates, Bay Leaf should have got a 3.5 but I had to give it a 3.0 because of the lack of ambience and it's location. The restaurant is located far away from the common spots in Esplanande and that is a severe disadvantage to people who do not know about it.

• The place - Nice decor could have been much better if there had been no stains on the ceiling or the photos that hang from the wall. 
• The menu - Covers quite a lot from different parts of China & Tibet. It's a good menu that one can explore for fun. 
• The food - Serious lack of good taste. Pan fried drums of heaven were overloaded in garlic sauce. Schezuan (pardon the spelling if incorrect) fried rice was not at all spicy as it should be and the chicken side dish I had, had a smoky flavour coming from the veggies and a burnt gravy which made me lose my appetite.
• A tip for the manager - A Nepali chef can carry out a great job in your kitchen with the help of branded ingredients. Try to find one from the streets nearby. You will get to see them working in the roadside shacks.
• Value for money - Now this is completely perceptual and so for me even if I am paying the standard market rate for good Chinese food then @Bayleaf has let me down.

The place offers good chinese cuisine. Crispy chilli baby corn was too good. Ambience is also nice. Just the waiting period was a tad bit long.

Bayleaf restaurant located at Bentick Street beside Paradise cinema hall is one of the popular joints in esplanade area. Recently though in the pAst year it underwent a renovation. Sadly though the quality and taste of the food has dropped after it got reopened after renovation.we ordered  Sweet corn chicken soup, cantonese chowmin & crispy chili chicken. The order took a huge amount of time to get ready even though the restaurant was quite empty. While the soup tasted good, crispy chilli chicken was not up to the mark. It was dry and extremely spicy. Cantonese noodles had an abundance of vegetables and quantity was enough for 2. But they probably forgot to add salt in it so it tasted bland. We had to mix table salt in order to make it palatable. Overall an average food experience. Interiors are simple. Since I was a frequent visitor to this restaurant in the past before their renovation, I was disappointed with this experience.

Not really hard to find, It is a nice pocket friendly place. We came here to grab lunch and was really shocked to see that the restaurant was pretty much empty, just a family. I mean it is not supposed to be this empty being a really decent place and it was puja time. I do like little peaceful place so in a way it did work well for me. Average ambience. Tasty food.
Yes coming to food, we ordered Chinese combo and drums of heaven for a starter and a Chinese chopsuey for me. It tasted so good. The drums man, you gotta try that. It's more like drums down the heaven.
A decent place with good food and nice service.

After a hectic afternoon of shopping in dhramatala went there for a while. It's a small place nd little bit hard to find. Poor decoration with a very simple lighting. As of food it's average and quantity wise it's good. Service is damn slow though. Nothing much to say about this. Price is cheap. Good for a small eat out.

A very nice and cozy place in the heart of the city

This restaurant is on the ground floor corner of a very old building, but nicely renovated, on Bentinck Street. It's near Paradise cinema hall and in the same building where famous Aliah restaurant is situated. Once one enters Bay Leaf, the first feeling is a huge relief from the cacophony of the surrounding roads. It's a very cosy room, not very big, but decorated in such a way, it makes you relaxed. The seating capacity is for 32 or so. Through a fully glassed wall one side one can watch the hustle and bustle of the outside street while savouring the sumptuous food. The quality, quantity and the taste of every dish we ordered were really good. But the most surprising feature is the price list. Personally I guess there is not a single restaurant in this area where one can get such good food with their (Bay Leaf's) price range. Apart from Chinese they also serve Tibetian dishes like momo, thukpa etc. A very young lady with lot of confidence as well as charm runs the show. Thousand kudos to her.

Visited this place thrice till date. It is just beside the New Aliah Hotel. Ambiance of the place is quite average. Few photographs of various places of Kolkata attached on the wall. The restaurant can accommodate 40 person at a time. The staffs are attentive and suggest you the best combination of food you could taste.
Now coming to the food , they serve extremely delicious food at a very cheap price. 
Well I tried till date , Teriyaki Chicken , Singapore mixed fried rice with hot garlic fish , wanton , Schezwan mixed fried rice with Hong Kong Fish. Every food was mouth watering. 
One thing I suggest , don't visit this place at Lunch hours because the place becomes crowdy at that time and you may not get the proper services.

Good Chinese when it comes to grabbing a quick bite during office lunch break. Conveniently located in the midst of the office area. Easy on the pocket and reasonably good food. Be prepared to come with atleast 1 hour in hand cause they take almost an hour to serve even a starter. We ordered a take away combo which took atleast one hour to get delivered. Quite disappointing

The service and ambience was pretty good . As far as the food goes the quantity and the quality was good. The drums of heaven was really good. The cantonese and chilli garlic noodles were decent.
Hot garlic chicken was awesome.
To conclude this is one of the finest places in Esplande to have either chinese or tibetian cuisine. Definitely a must visit.

It is located just beside Aliyah hotel and was quite easy to find. The restro was quite empty as it was a weekday. Its is a very small joint but quite neatly decorated. We ordered drums of heaven, mixed noodles gravy and dry chillifish.
The drums of heaven was really good. I liked the tangy sauce that was used. The chicken was perfectly cooked and was really tasty. The gravy noodles was kind of okay. It lacked a bit of salt and so lacked taste. The chilli fish was also good but I have had better elsewhere. Lastly we also ordered sweet lime soda. It was served in pretty little jars. Overall a good place to have authentic chinese food without burning a hole in the pocket.

When it comes about City Of Joy, surprise can come in every twist! The Restaurant Bay Leaf came to us with lots of surprise when we visited this restaurant few days ago. After some shopping at Esplanade, we were looking for a restaurant, that we have not visited yet, and after some experiment on Zomato, we decided to visit this restaurant. The restaurant located at Bentick St. , beside famous Aliah Restaurant, so not a hard thing to find it. So, lets come and explore this unknown place.

Positive Point -
1. Food - In one word, beautiful. The Chef really have some good skill. Tasty and quantity wise is also good. So a big Thumb's up.

2. Decoration - Simple decoration, neat and clean, not such fancy look. Cosy sofa and Table sittings are very comfortable too. Overall a decent ambience.

Negative Point -
1. Timing - They take more time than usual but itz ok. Not a big issue.

without this one, I didn't get any negative point here.

We ordered -

Singapore Veg Noodles - Usually I don't prefer Rice or Noodles in veg form, but as per suggestion of one of a stuff, we ordered this one. When the Noodles came to our table, it was looking too delicious, which make me super excited about this item. The noodles were well cooked with sauces lots of veggies keeping a good balance. They also add up mushroom with it, which add extra flavour. Quantity wise it is good for two. Overall a great item as a main course. Strongly recommend it.

Hot Garlic Chicken - This is one of the signature dish here and the stuff recommend us this one. 8 pieces big sized chicken were served in sweet & sour gravy. Chicken pieces were all soft, juicy and very well marinated and cooked. If the chicken pieces were good, then the gravy was heavenly. It has awesome balancing between hot & sweet. Love the honey dew touch it it. Goes very well with any kinda Noodles. Another highly recommended item here.

With above two item mentioned above, it costs only around 360 INR. They added only VAT, surprisingly no Service Charges were added.

In conclusion, I will say Bay Leaf is one of the hidden gems in Esplanade area. They offers Chinese as well as Tibetan food with lots of customisation. I guess this is the best part, so you can choose the right flavour of your desire item. They also served some Awesome combo meal at very affordable price. Overall a great dining experiences and will visit this restaurant again and again.

Bay Leaf is a Chinese & Tiberian restaurant located just beside Aliah Hotel in Esplanade area. Between all the big Mughal restaurants in Esplanade area this one is little ignored & that is why we found this restaurant compleatly empty even at the dinner time.

Decorations & Ambience : Simple design, small added decorations, photo frames on wall, basic lights & comfortable sofa sittings. I would rather call it a simple but modern dining.

Staffs & Management : Staffs were gentle & straight forward. Asked our order & also recommend the good one. They took little longer than usual to serve the food.

Foods : Their menu is also very simple but offers lots of variations in it. We ordered the following...

Singapore Veg Noodles : The Singapore noodes over here just looked as delicious as it tasted like. It was very well cooked with sliced vegitables & mixed with the rich sauce & spices. Unlike other places they also added mushrooms with this that just tasted really good. Quantity could have been little better.

Hot Garlic Chicken : This dish was recommended by their staffs & served in a small bowl by them with 8 pieces of chicken. Chicken pices were small but it was solid unlike other places with a thick layer of cornflower on it. Gravy of this dish was such amazing with the very true balance of hot, sweet & sour. It tasted delicious with the Singapore rice & the tangy sauce used for this was really lovely. Very much recommend dish to order over here.

Pricing : Our total bill for the items were only Rs. 366. Quality of their foods were very good at this price point. I didn't expected added Vat from this place. Surprisingly only Vat was added not service tax like most restaurants. High amount of Vat & service tax on foods is the most cheapest thing in a country like India, thats only my thought.

Conclusion : How the hell this place can be so empty in a popular place like Esplanade that also at the time of dinner. I mean what people are actually willing for in a restaurant? Decent ambience, awesome food &  good pricing, they deliver it all. I don't know about others but I'm surely visiting this place again.

Well to start with, locating this joint could be a lil tricky for new comers..
I went to place with a group friends, as we decided to have Chinese.
To keep it minimal, I would say the ambience was real nice with apt soft music, neat and clean yet had a cozy touch!
We started off by ordering Drums of heaven in starters : Succulent tasty yet crispy pieces! Probably 8 pieces or so.
In main course we had Singaporean chicken noodles, schezwan mixed fried rice, mixed fried rice, Mandarin prawn, chilli fish, hot and garlic chicken. Each and every items were luscious detectable...and the prawn dish was just too good.
And the entire thing was pretty much economic!

Out of the three, only garlic fish couldn't stand out as the fish provided was not fresh at all. But still the rest of the food were really good and tasty. Hope to visit again when we'll be around esplanade area for sure. :)

We ordered the veg thupka which was amazing. It was served hot, it tasted very nice and had lots of veggies. We then ordered the crispy pepper mushrooms, it was simply delicious. I highly recommend it.
For main course we ordered Hakka noodles and chilli paneer. The Paneer was awesome and very well cooked. Overall I feel it is a hidden gem, which serves great food.
The best part is that it is very reasonable as well.

A pretty average experience over here. The chowmein and chicken side dish was very average, but for the pricing the quality is pretty decent. The service needs improvements.

Located just behind the New Aliah restaurant, this place is good to chat and munch amidst the bustling Chandni Chowk area as the place remains comparatively empty during the evenings. The interior is minimal yet soothing. Service is bit slow. Visited around 4-5 times yet nothing special about the food, just moderately decent. Honey Chicken, Crispy Chilly Baby corn and Mixed Singapore Rice are good here.  Pocket pinch is minimal which make it an easy choice to drop in any time.

A small cozy cafe on Bentick Street beside Aliah amazed me with its lip smacking dishes in the very first visit. Thanks to Rajdeep Bhattacharjee for the sudden invitation. 

They specializes in Chinese,Thai and a few delicacies from Myanmar. 

Started with Drums of Chicken (Pan Fried). Each pieces was very meaty, Crispy and perfectly fried. An awesome preparation with almost perfect balance of sweet n Sour. Certainly it could not stopped us from asking for an another plate of the same. NO ONE CAN IT JUST ONE. 

We followed by Kowsway a Myanamar Dish. Full of Creativity and artistic presentation. Very less oily dish. Good for health perhaps. Almost make your own dish with all the ingredients provided over plate and a bowl. Plate comprising of Boiled Chowmein, Boiled Egg, Fried Onion, Fried Garlic Chop pings, Chopped Green Chili, Coriander Leaves, Chopped Green Onions. And the Bowl of Coconut Milk full of Small Chicken pieces. 

Pricing is pocket friendly too keeping the quality of food and the place it situated in mind.

I love the kind of food offered at this place. You guys should give a try !!

I have a feeling that premium restaurants in Kolkata have a very poor vegetarian menu. I understand the economics and all but it is very disappointing when you see the menu and you feel the need of hawk's eye to look for vegetarian stuff. I visited the place on Monday afternoon because I had a craving for Chinese and I was in the nearby area. I looked up Zomato, found this place, it was within my budget so I went there. Ordered for a Veg Cantonese Noodle and Chilli Paneer. While the noodles were very very bland, the chilli paneer was tasty. For 2 plates of cantonese noodle veg and one plate chilli paneer, it costed me 500/- so I realized that the place does not really give you the value for money. Maybe next time I will try non-veg and see how it turns out.

Amidst our puja shopping, we decided to try this place out since it is located to the New Market Area, just beside the Aykar Bhawan. We went there for lunch. The ambiance was comfortable enough. We ordered Crispy Chicken for starters. And in main course we tried out Chicken Szechuan Fried Rice and Chili Honey Prawn. The food was good, espcially the chicken and prawn dishes. However, we found the Chicken Szechaun Fried Rice a bit more spicy than we had expected. It might have been better without that much use of chillies. Other than that, we found the food to our liking. The bill amount came to be around Rs. 570, along with soft drinks. So, it was quite reasonable for us.

A small comfy cafe on Bentick Street amazed me with its lip smacking dishes and the overwhelming quantity they serve! Star Thai Chicken for starters, Singapore Rice and Mandarin Chicken were good. What i actually loved is the Burmese Dish Kowsay or KhaoSuey. Its a coconut milk chicken soup served with a plate full of ingredients like noodles,fried garlic ,chillies and egg to mixed with the soup. Its light and simple and a must try. I am recommending this for its quality, quantity and reasonable prices!

I have had food from Bayleaf earlier, since my office is very close to it. But today was the first time I had, since they re-opened. Even though they don't have a veg version of Khow Suay, they still got one done for me. I had it picked up to my office. 
To keep it simple, it was delicious. The veg broth was sublime and with the garnishes enhanced the taste.
Keep it up. One small suggestion, would appreciate more veg options.

The new and improved bay leaf is absolutely divine. I went there for lunch last Saturday for khowsuay and I've been dreaming about the food ever since. Prior to the fire, the place was pretty okay, though the decor was not upto the mark. However, now the place has received a complete facelift and the owners are very patient too.

I saw this restaurant by chance. The name attracted me. A beautifully cozy place. I especially loved the beautiful lady manager(proprietor?)

It is a small place with tastefully decorated walls. The seating arrangement comprised of a sofa on the one side and two fibre chairs on the other. Those chairs are not comfortable enough, I am afraid.

Anyway, as I made myself comfortable on a sofa, a staff came with the menu card. It comprises of food from Chinese, Tibetan and Burmese cuisine. I have never tasted Burmese food before so I decided to try it here. I chose Khawsuey ( please check the spelling). Before that I took sweet lime soda.
Sweet lime soda was like any other sweet lime soda. Then came the food.
It composed of coconut milk, boiled eggs, boiled noodles, celery and chillies and I think dried shrimp.
Following the manager's advice, I poured everything into the coconut milk, and.........

Simply saying that I fell in love with it.

Car parking is very difficult there so that is a problem. A few red ants, enticed by the smell of the sweet lime soda, came up the table but were driven away promptly by the staff. They should do something about the door hinges. Each time a person opens or closes a door it protests so loudly disturbing us. There is an air of informality in that the lady was scolding one of her staff within our earshot which shouldn't be done.

But overall, a very good experience and would like to repeat my visit.

Another decent Chinese restaurant near esplanade with good food and reasonable pricing. Air conditioned and away from the main Esplanade area therefore the ambiance is good. The food is delicious, however the momo didn't taste as good. But the main courses are served well. Serving time is moderate and the crew is neither too amiable, nor hostile. On a busy working day, its a good place to get your fill without taxing your pocket a lot.

I've tried Singapore noodles, Chicken gravy noodles, Fried chicken and Mashroom based simple Chinese dishes too. They cook really good and the place is inexpensive.

Yes, I give it 5. Because I have been going there since 2009 (last time on yesterday) and completely being addicted to their delicious Chinese cuisines. I want to have some Thai also in future. When I am there, it seems to be very homely in short. Thank you guys for your great hospitality since years.

It has become a custom for me and my colleagues to lunch (Chinese Chopsuey) there every Saturday. A minute walk from our work and light on our pocket. Food as mentioned by others, is between good and very good, considering the price. Staffs are friendly but the facade is not really welcoming. I wish they could take some initiative on their own to keep the pavement clean and dry. I think this would help preventing flies over their guests while they're eating. 

About food, I personally love their red pepper chicken and mixed Chinese Chopsuey. The latter, must try! Nothing special about other usual dishes. They never get it wrong.

Situated  amongst the most busy place like Esplanade, The place is real cool, descent, and perfect for the couples to hang around . Though the price compared to quality and amount of the food served along with a slow sevice, is not really satisfactory, but most of the time there are some combo offers for snacks and main-courses, worth mentioning. The flavor sometimes is too strong, specially in the items like Tom yum soup, Kai-Chee Chicken, but the chicken in Burmese style or the Chicken Tom Kha Pak is interesting by it's off-beat taste of coconut.

Visited this place after almost 2 years.
Sofa is very comfortable and cozy.

If you love eating spicy food, avoid this place. They do not even come close to the spiciness of dishes served at Kimli. Schezuan noodles were mildly spicy at best. And this is the only place which puts some strange looking red sauce in the noodles. So the noodles look ketchup red. Taste is ok.

Shanghai Chilli chicken was good. Looked quite colourful due to the use of different coloured capsicums.

There is a dearth of Chinese eateries in the Chandni Chowk/Esplanade area. But I would recommend Crystal Chimney any day over this. I was forced to visit Bayleaf since Crystal Chimney was closed(it was Monday).

Near the paradise cinema,next to new aliyah on waterloo street.its a very small eatery,with exclusively chinese menu.we browsed through the menu and since it was a very regular one,gave in to a combo meal.the special non veg combo.came with a choice of rice/noodles and momo/spring roll,along with chilly chicken(4pc) and a chicken lollypop.as in a combo meal,the taste is very bland for everything,but didn’t expect the food to resemble kolkata’s street food.sadly,couldn’t find any notion of it being disparate.it was sumptuous,but not delectable.

Yesterday evening I went to ‘Bay Leaf’ for some quick snacks. Ambiance wise the place was okay-ish but sitting arrangements were not at all comfortable. Without wasting any time I ordered ‘Bay Leaf Chicken Chopsuey’, ‘Chicken Khowsey’ & ‘Szechuan Chicken’. I asked for fresh lime soda to pass the serve time, sadly got informed that they can provide only coke or sprite. Anyway Bay Leaf Chicken Chopsuey & Szechuan Chicken was served within 5-10 minutes. Chicken Chopsuey was nicely made and really tasty but Szechuan Chicken was complete disappointment. Chicken Khowsey was another flop item, I had tasted Khowsey several times before & coconut milk should be denser also little more fired onion needs to be added. Somehow I missed the original taste sensation.

Bay leaf is located in the same lane as Amber just opposite to amber rest. The ambiance is nothing great . Small place with 6 7 tables .. What I like about this place is that they serve pan fried momo which are extremely good and spicy the way I like it .. The soup like manchow soup are also good .. All the dishes are pleasant on your palate . Only there quantity is pretty less which I believe could be a place of improvement .

I have to say, Bay Leaf has always left me with a mixed experience. Every time I have been here, and I do mean every time, I have ended up with one brilliantly done dish, and one quite tasteless or bad dish. The last time we came here for a meal, my friend was in a bit of a hurry, so we wanted to eat something fast. The two of us ordered after asking the waiter what would be quick - and we decided on two plates of chicken combo  with noodles - my friend got the chicken szechwan noodles with chilli chicken, and I got the chicken singapore noodles with hot garlic chicken. While the Singapore noodles was quite tasty along with the hot garlic chicken, which was quite hot and therefore perfect for a heat lover such as I, the chicken momos were quite thick skinned and the quantity of the filling inside was low and tasteless. However the swiftness of arrival for the meal made up for it, and the waiter was nice and quite helpful.

One of our regular luncheon joint if we have around an hour's time in hand during lunch. This is a small restaurant tucked away opposite Amber, the ambiance being nothing much to write home about. However, the food makes for an excellent quick lunch option at an affordable cost. Over time, I have sampled a number of dishes here.The hot n sour soup, the lung fung soup and the sweet corn soup all are perfectly made. The drums of heaven are of the batter fried variety without any sauce. The mixed fried rice and the mixed singapore rice are both nicely made and filling to the tummy. However, my staple side dish here is the chilli chicken with honey sauce, my absolute favourite since the first time I tried it. Succulent pieces of boneless chicken in a spicy hot gravy laced with honey. Yummy is the word. The fresh lime soda has not been available the last few times I visited them for some unknown reason. The service is pretty prompt, the waiters nice and helpful. They also have good combo meal options. A quick lunch here for two should not cost more than Rs. 300/-.

Foods are excellent, environment is good, but they should tell at their menu card or by Zomato that it is closed on Sunday. I went their twice on Sunday but disappointed.

After a lot of research work in Chinese Restaurants of Kolkata, this is the only place where you can get decent and a variety of Chinese dishes at very reasonable prices in an acceptable environment.

The place  is  decent but a little small. Waiters are well behaved. Food quality is good. Serves a variety of Chinese dishes ranging from typical ones to Cantonese to Hong Kong ones. You get well cooked food which tastes good. The star dish would be the Veg and Non-Veg Combos : small package with a punch at very much reasonable prices. Quiet environment, so one never feels disturbed.

The place is small. Can get a bit cramped up but usually remains congestion free. Tables can accommodate maximum of people. Bathroom is not satisfactory. Quantity of food per plate is a little less, but compensates for the ambiance and service

Location: Bay leaf located opposite amber restaurant. Or just beside aliah hotel. I visited it today alone as its near to my office. Sitting place is crampy. No renovation. Seats are bad. Lights are not working properly. Due to Dim area the flaws get overlooked. 

Coming to pros and cons:-
Pros
1) has 8 tables inspite of small area
2) staffs are polite
3) service is moderate 
4) prices are very reasonable 
5) clean place 

Cons:- 
1)paneer was tight 
2) momo were bad 

Overall, satisfactory

GOOD FOOD COMES IN SMALL PACKAGES!

Located very close to paradise cinema is the not so popular (for lack of publicity) Chinese restaurant called Bay Leaf. In spite of this apparent disability, they do dish out tasty and quality food at reasonable prices. They offer very simple fare. It is not difficult to locate this restaurant as it is situated in the central business district. The ambience and the decor are simple with comfy sitting arrangements. The servers are friendly and the service is prompt and efficient. 

Begin your meal with their hot and sour Soup. The soup is not very spicy and contains a good quantity of ingredients like mushroom, fungus and other kinds of edibles.  Another recommendation of mine for all their visitors is their Wonton Soup. The soup with the wonton pieces is heavenly. For the main course, order their schezwan chicken Hakka noodles from their noodles section. Have this with either Chilli prawn or Hot Garlic prawn.  The last two dishes are well cooked, have really strong flavor and are aromatic. The prawn pieces are plentiful and tender. Their Sweet and Sour Prawns is another brilliant dish. The prawns are covered in thick gravy and the prawns themselves are big and juicy and look beautiful and rich in colour. For me, their prawn dishes rank higher than their chicken dishes. Other mouthwatering prawn items to be had here are Chilli Prawn, Manchurian Prawn and Szechwan Prawn. If you prefer Mei Foon to rice then order their Mixed Fried Mei Foon. The quantity is generous with everything is wonderfully mixed. Their starters (like Pepper Chicken and Chicken Lollipops) are comparable to the starters served in high end restaurants. Even their Chicken Momos (whether pan fried or steamed) are finger licking good! Their combo meals are also filling. You can choose from chicken to seafood to a special non veg combo.

A small resturant, situated @ end of Waterloo Street. Very good Chineese resturant, & the prices are so less, that you may have to order extra to make bill of Rs. 300/-. Good environment, & staff is also very friendly. 
A good place to spent some time with your partner.
