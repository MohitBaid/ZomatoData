Ordered chicken wings and chicken strips via Swiggy and received the same b4 scheduled time, that too hot and crispy. The outer part was crispy but the inner part juicy prepared with right ingredients. Last but not the least, IFC provides tasty chicken menus at reasonable prices giving a tough competition to its couterpart KYC.  Keep up the good work IFC . üëçüëçüëçüëç‚úå

Average restaurant. Hyderabad has IFC outlet as far as I can rmember. Indian version of KFC. Was afraid of trying, still tried their coffee ( Jamaican coffee) and their non veg cheese pizza. To be honest, coffee was good and pizza base was pretty good. Soft and fresh crust out of oven and ample amount of cheese, onion and chicken. What I didn like was their coffee mug, that seemed of very cheap quality! So overall okay.

Ordered their pizza dishes last night. It was decent and to be honest, pretty good. The price wasn't though. wrapped in a beautiful pizza box, I guess that's what accounted for the pricing!

The food is not up to mark,  staff behavior is also not good,  foods are overpriced.  Outlet like Pizza Hut is also providing free water whereas ifc didn't.  All that glitters is not gold.  Worst place to have food

Located right beside the dominos pizza in the bangur avenue crossing vip road. A very brave decision though to start up a pizzaa venture just beside dmonios. You need to deliver much more with high quality product with great value for money..
Visited yesterday evening with 4 of my friends. Thought of going dominos but saw this outlet and made our mind of going inside as the outlet was full empty with not a single diner and we wanted to enjoy our time. The menu was mixed with pizzaa and burgers with some frued chicken as well.. we decide to try the pannerr tiklaa pizza combo and a sinply veggie .. the crust was not at all good .. it was soggy and with no taste. Need to work a lot on their product. They have the variety but the product quality is really very disheartening with the amount of money u spending its seriously not worth it. I would not recommend dis place for all the foodie lovers in the city..
Wasnt able to click pic this time though..

Great place to have food along with different of varieties. A place to enjoy with friends and treat them. Though a copy of KFC but the it is completely different from KFC menu.. the staff is good and provide the food according to time... No waste of money and time. A superb place to have fried chicken and pizza together.  A very rare combination of menu.

So it was an unplanned visit to Bangur (Towards the vip road end) to meet an old friend. While walking towards Dominos we stopped outside this outlet which was just near bangur dominos. It was named IFC which looked exactly the photocopy of the well known KFC.¬†
We digged inside and the ambiance looked very pleasant with the color red, textures of golden yellow on the walls & food piks as well. Its not too spacious like KFC outlets but decent enough for 25-30 people dinning at once. Interesting the place and interesting the menu is. They have everything that KFC provides on their menu even with some combo meals at some very affordable prices.
The other menu and meals are priced so fairly and close that makes you think and finally we took two Chicken Meal 1 for both of us. (Costed 125x2 + Taxes) and it contained one piece of crispy chicken, French fries and one glassful of Cola.
French fries were decent but needed to be more crunchy. The first bite of Crispy chicken went good until something disastrous happened. Me and my friend figured out very easily that it was uncooked from inside. When complained the staff first said "It is cooked as per the prescribed time". Later they took one of the crispy chicken & changed it with another one.¬†
Its a newly opened place but as per my experience says they need to learn a lot. The staff should be trained properly and handle such situation with polite answers and smile. Talking about the service part so some professionalism is required from them and good interaction with the customers is needed. Well good news for the people at Bangur and nearby places they have a small KFC around.
Thats All... !!!! Good luck.

IFC - Indian Fried Chicken, an Indian duplicate of KFC. Being influenced by its overall good reviews and moderate ratings, tried the restaurant over swiggy. Ordered several items such as 'IFC box' (includes "Fried Chicken", " Chicken Wings", " Chicken Nuggets" and a "Coca Cola"), "Masala Fried Chicken", "Chicken Popcorn", "IFC Special Chicken Burger" and "Korean Style Chicken Wings". The restaurant represents itself as a true Indian copy of KFC for its outlook, packaging, environment, except the taste of their food. They also have the KFC colonel type logo of their founder in their packing boxes. Trust me, however their foods looks mouth watering, the taste of those items are totally a mess, at least for their ranges of fried chicken products. Any kind of chicken fry tasted more or less same, and everything had a bitter taste. Moreover, chickens were too much stiff, no appearance of juicy-ness. Size of the chicken pieces were also small compared to KFC pieces. Chicken Popcorn had a burned flavour, just like chicken tandoori. Korean Chicken Wing tasted like Crispy Conzy Chicken of road side jhupri hotels. Only the chicken nugget tasted averge to me. The burger was also moderatly tasted, however, the inner chicken filling, veggies, cheese and sauces were adequete, the bread lacks the softness and tenderness.

However, the restaurant was less pricy than KFC, but, regarding to the food quality, it was an frustating experience. Never going to try this restaurant again. Thumbs down IFC........

A mini kfc located in bangur, quite cozy and comfortable but number of tables are less, so sometimes maybe you will have to wait. Food is exactly like the kfc snacks, the fried chicken was good.. nice place to visit.

I loved this place. It's so colourful and cozy. The food is really good and very easy on the pocket. They have amazing offers. A small pizza free with a large one or a brownie and ice cream free with a medium pizza. They serve pizzas, burgers and fried chicken, all under the same roof. What's not to love. I am very impressed by this place and it will definitely be my new haunt for some good old adda and gluttony with friends and family.

Okay so I went there thrice..taste is okay. But there are a few things which are too lame.
#They don't accept cards.
#They dont serve you water..you need to buy water.
#No matter how small or big thing you order you ll be always told to wait for 15mins.
#Staff is not that great.

The restaurant is an exact photocopy of the KFC Restaurant chain. Copying everything, from the outside appearance to the menu. I had a Chicken Snacker, a Chicken Zinger and a 8" Chicken Tikka Pizza. The Zinger tasted good. But the sizes were too small wrt the pricing. The pizza had way too much coriander but the crust was fresh. Chicken pieces were more in size compared to what you get at dominos or pizza hut. Overpriced. But the food is still good to eat.
