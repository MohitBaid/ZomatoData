This place was in my wish list for a really long time and atlast we dropped in yesterday. It was our first stop of our #lastdayoftheyear celebration.
We were there around 12 at noon. The small cozy place was empty. No other guests were present. We took a table and settled down with the signature dragon breath. 10 pcs (small; large contains 16 pcs) of bite sized brownies were served with liquid nitrogen. Tastewise nothing extraordinary but it was fun to have that chilled gas getting out while u breathe once you put the brownies into your mouth. üëçüëç 
Then we ordered liquid nitrogen icecreams. Although a lot of flavours were not available,  we have one nuttela and one kairi pudina small scoop. Preparation of the icecreams with nitrogen is itself a process to watch out. The texture of the icecreams was a lil bit different what we usually get. And both of them were just great n rich in taste. But the kairi pudina was the show stealer. Its lyk mango pulse turned into an icecream. Completely hatke in taste and make you crave for it more n more. Kachcha aam with chat masala and pudina can't b wrong. A perfect blend of taste üòòüòò
Wil definitely visit again to taste more flavours.

I was really excited to try dragon breath because it was on news everywhere so finally went to mumble's lab in evening.. We ordered Death by chocolate and Dragon breath
Ambience- The place is quite cool woth the glass doors amd funny and cute pictures.. But the stuffs behavior was disgusting.. When i asked them if we have to pay right now or after having the ice cream their expression was disgusting even when I asked them to recommend the best one they said whatever you choose.. And they looked like they are doing some favor by talking to us.. 
# Food- Dragon breath had 16 small Brownie type cakes with chocolate sauce and a cup of liquid nitrogen.. You have to dip the Brownie in the liquid nitrogen for 7 sec and then eat.. Honestly i didn't like it.. If you wanna make a video and post it somewhere then its cool but taste wise not at all recommended..
Then comes Death by Chocolate.. The procedure was really cool but I didn't like it.. Too Sweet for me..

#Pocket pinch- Too costly.. The bill was 380..and i am not satisfied with the taste..
Verdict - If you wanna try it and make a video of the overrated dragon breath you can go but i will not recommend this place.

Tasty ice creams though, but the whole experience was damaged because of the inattentiveness of staff.

This place has gained a lot of hype thanks to their usage of liquid nitrogen. We ordered for a pizza and cheese chilli fires. Both of them were good but the geese chilli fries weren‚Äôt that cheesy. As for the ice cream we ordered a tiramisu. It had the flavours of a tiramisu but it didn‚Äôt have that itensity in the flavours that a tiramisu normally has. Compared to other places their ice cream is quite high prices but in all fairness they don‚Äôt give you merely one scoop. Worth or not - debatable. The decor and ambiance gives you the feel of a chemistry lab, the difference being you can chill here and not worry about grades. ;)

The concept of nitogen ice cream has already gained popularity internationally, and Mumble's Lab has done the gracious job of introducing Kolkata to an array of quirky and delicious liquid nitrogen ice cream.
A small dessert parlour, with a cheerful decor, Western music in the background and little bottle lamps hanging from the ceiling, it also offers savouries like pizza, sandwiches etc.
Tried their famed Dragon Breath - a set of 10 pieces of little square-shaped yummy cookies garnished with chocolate sauce, and of course a cup of fuming liquid nitogen. One has to pierce the cookie with a long stick provided on the tray, dip it in the nitrogen for 7 seconds and quickly pop it into the mouth for the smoke to issue from the mouth and nose. To better enjoy the fun smoky sensation it's best to have the cookie as soon as possible after dipping, for it turns hard with delay and becomes difficult to chew. One can even record the activity and experience of the nitrogen's cool effects.
For those willing to try out something a little new in the ice cream sector can definitely try out Mumble's Lab! :)

We ordered two regular cups of Death by Chocolate and Nutella. We also took a Conizza. The freezing process is as fascinating as the taste of the ice-cream itself (or is it frozen dessert?). 
Pros:
Good staff.
Nice interiors.
Crazy theatrics with Liquid Nitrogen!! 
Good pizzas. 

Cons:
Volume thoda loud kardo yaar gaano kaa.

When chemistry falls in love with desserts you get nitrogen icecream...

Well once you step into this joint located near birla high school for boys... You'll be greeted with a friendly staff, walls decked up with sweet notes and a board which looks more like a decked up version of chemistry formula but instead makes you aware of the sheer awesomeness on offer. 

 GOT dragons will visit us next season but still you can have a feel of the same with Dragon Breath it's an assortment of bread/cookies which you need to dip in a cup of nitrogen and then chew to relish the taste while fumes comes out of your mouth and nose... It's a must try and don't forget to click and recd the experience.

Another must have is the Cookiewich which is a combo of chocolate cookies topped with chocolate ice-cream, sauce and chips it's full on blast...must have for chocoholics.

End it with a tangy bite of Virgin Mohjito... Because when icecream and Mohjito collide it's a tangy tango for sure.

If Chemistry is or not your favorite subject, then you will start loving it because of this fantastic Mumble's LAB. A superb combination of liquid nitrogen and ice-cream can be found here. It will surely become a favorite spot for any Ice- ¬†cream lover. Located at 10E, Hungerford Street, (Next to Birla High School), Theatre Road, Kolkata. It's the most worthy ice cream parlor in OUR city of JOY.¬†

This  Ice cream place is something out of a sci-fi movie. They mix some powder, chocolate, sugar and other ingredients right in front of your eyes and process them in one of their MAGIC machines and then they add cupfuls of fuming liquid nitrogen into the machine, and voila....!!!!! The ice cream's ready. Watching that whole process is even more fun than eating the ice cream. It is 'love' in fluid state. 

Lists of Food we had:

DRINKS:

1) Blueberry Shake:This shake can keep you feeling full and satisfied all while giving you some serious feel good energy.

2) Death By Chocolate Shake:If you're a Chocoholic, this is the shake for you! This Shake taunts and tempts even the most disciplined of appetites. It's all of your chocolate dreams come true.

FOODS:

1) Funghi Conniza:Pizza In A CONE. WHAT??? Seriously O.oI know, your eyes aren't deceiving you--- these aren't ordinary ice cream cones, but rather pizza cones. Pizza Cones, have to be one of my favourite inventions

2) Fresca Conizza:It's Innovative. It's fun. It's pizza. Definitely the best cone Fresca cone pizza.

3) Corn N Spinach Cheese Sandwich:These cheesy spinach corn sandwiches are very delicious and tasty.

4) Peri Peri French Fries:It's Spicy, it's hot, it's periperilicious.

5) Paneer Tikka Pizza:Indian style pizza topped with marinated paneer cubes and fresh vegetables.

Desserts:

1) Kairi Pudina with Pulse: (Your ICE YOUR way)Need pulse candy? Ignore Candy. Buy this. Which will make you happier. Mix of green mango syrup, pudina and chaat masala turned out to be a balance betwwen sweet and apicy and somewhat resembled pulse hajmola candy.

2) Nutella Ice CReam:WHO can say no to a creamy, chocolate sticks, gems and nutella. It's looks awesome.

3) Mojita:Mojito punched in a ice creamy delight. Could it get any better? I guess not :D

4) Peanut butter With Nutella:Served on top of cookies, nutella chocolate, creamy garnished with chocolate sauce and choco chip, this looked somewhat like krazzy.

5) Tiramisu:The coffee and cocoa combination has its truly unique kick and can be tried for that charred aroma.

6) Guava:With a blend of sweetness salty tinge added to the guava flavor. It reminds of the good old days when I used to cut a guava and apple sweetness chilli salt to it before eating this. Can be nostalgic!!!

7) Orange Caramel:The tang of oranges and the rich sweetness and crunchy texture of caramel strike of a fabulous balance in this ice cream and bring out happiness.

8) Dragon Breath:
It is indeed the Show Topper!! It was just amazing. It was super chilled and cold smoke comes out from your mouth and nose looks like a dragon is breathing from GoT.
It's absolutely amazing. I don't think there is any other place in India which serves this yet. Just dipped soft foods like cakes, marshmallow or something in liquid nitrogen for 7 sec. And once you put in your mouth, it appears as if you're exhaling smokes.When you bite into it, smoke comes out of your mouth, that's why it's called Dragon Breath.

Staff: Friendly and They help in suggesting the flavors, the toppings and I really liked the way they were handling their guests with a smile on their face.

Ambiance: Live nitrogen ice cream counter and good seating arrangement.

Definitely worth visiting if you're ever in ¬†Theatre Road, Kolkata.

And definitely recommend this place for people who have a sweet tooth. :)

Death By Chocolate - Had unique brownie pieces in a chocolate shake which went right up the straw.

Funghi Conizza - A new trend,Cone pizzas with superbly cooked mushroom Topped with cheese.

Corn n Spinach Cheese Sandwich - One of my favourites.This tasted so good.

Mojito Ice Cream - You need to Visit this place for this.Liquid Nitrogen and mojito punched in a ice creamy delight.Just cant get better.

Flavour of your Choice - Now this is the real deal,you bring in anything edible and theyll make an ice cream with it for you.We took Pulse Candys and they punched mint with it and made one of the most unique ice cream i have ever tasted.

GOOD JOB MUMBLE'S :)

This is my 3rd visit to Kolkata First Liquid Nitrogen [LN2] live ice cream cafe...

They also started serving some mouthwatering veg sandwiches, pizzas, fries, conizzas (yes you heard it right... CONIZZA=CONE+PIZZA) and shakes...

Went there yesterday and tried their...

‚ù§ Fungi conizza~ Just Mind blowing...

# Fresca conizza~ Yummy too...

# Paneer Tikka Pizza~ Also very good...

‚ù§ Fungi Pizza~ Heavan in the mouth again...

‚ù§ Corn n Spinach Sandwich~ Extremely tasty... Highly recommended...

‚ù§ Peri Peri French Fries~ Straight n simple... Excellent for good pocket friendly time pass...

# Death by Chocolate Shake~ Quite good...

‚ù§ Blueberry Shake~ Just insane... Highly recommended again...

‚ù§ Kairi Pudina with Pluse~ Here is a story behind it... They had an option of mix n match any of your favorite ingredient for making your own ice cream... Accidentally there were some "pulse" toffees in my pocket... I asked them to make a combination with it... And they presented this one... Not kidding the combination gone perfect... Do try...

‚ù§ Peanut Butter with Snickers~ I also asked them to make this combination all of a sudden... But surprisingly it became another stunner... Must must have from here...

# Neuttla~ Good too...

‚ù§ Mojito~ Another must have one... Amazing it was...

‚ù§ Tiramisu~ This is my all time favorite from here...

‚ù§ Assorted Dragon Breath~ A platter full of bread crumb, brownies, oreo cookies etc... Rather a platter full of fun... What you need to do is... Choose any of the following from the platter, dip it in the liquid nitrogen for 5 sec and put it in the mouth and chew it normally... You will not fill anything much... But your friends will enjoy your dragon breath for sure... Don't forget to make videos of it... It was an amazing experience...

The ambience was very cool... Staffs are very well behaved... service was extremely good... deco was quite smoothing... and we enjoyed the live ice cream making... it's very thrilling... Will went there again for trying there other flavours very soon...

Pocket pinch was very very acceptable...

I loved how the place is science themed. Geeky science quotes all over and the periodic table at the counter representative of different flavours of ice creams they serve. A super cool ambiance that will definitely win you over!
Staffs were so friendly and one of them actually explained how the whole liquid nitrogen process takes place in the making of the ice creams.

Other than ice creams, this place now offers savouries like Sandwich, Pizza, Fries, Cupcakes, Donuts, Pastries, etc.
We tried the Fresca and Funghi Conizza. Loved the Fungi one. The Paneer Tikka Pizza was equally good.
Corn N Spinach Sandwich along with Peri Peri Fries were too yum!
And the shakes - Death by Chocolate and Blueberry.
I actually died by the Blueberry Shake. I could have it all day!

Now comes the amazing ice cream part! We had a huge number of them :
Tiramisu, Peanut Butter with Snickers, Orange Caramel and Kairi Pudina with Pulse (which was a customised flavour chosen and handed over by us and they fused it with mint and turned it into an ice cream)!

The three flavours which I exceptionally liked :
‚Ä¢ Mojito - One of the best here. It's like literally "eating" a virgin mojito. It's so delicious!
‚Ä¢ Nutella - I'm a huge fan of Nutella because who isn't? The consistency was so perfect and the texture was the smoothest I've ever had. I'm a fan!
‚Ä¢ Guava - I loved this one! The taste exactly reminded me of my school times when we would have freshly cut guavas sprinkled with a lot of rock salt. The ice cream bore that saltiness, which, one usually doesn't expect in an ice cream.

Also, the Dragon Breath was an interesting palate of sweet bites like cakes and cookies which you gotta dip into a cup of liquid nitrogen for some seconds, then put them in your mouth to bite into the crunchy solid and watch the cold smoke come out of your nose and mouth.

One of the best places in town to have ice creams. It's heaven for those mad ice cream lovers like me!
Cannot wait to go back!

Yes, it's a treat everytime you enter this place, both to your eyes as well as tongue. Located on theatre road, this place is a heaven.

Desserts have always been an eye catching material and thus it never fails to one who craves for it momentarily. There have been some truly exceptional ice Cream parlours around which are making some money worthy stuff to seduce ones taste buds. The face of ice Cream Industry is changing after the introduction of Live Ice Creams Parlors and still there places who can still surprise you with the same ability putting things to the next level. Where lip smacking food are winning most of the times still there are certain times when you find a dessert finishing the Line and winning the race. Talking about desserts so Mumbles lab has to be one of the finest places in Kolkata who is making a name for itself. Needs no introduction to this place they are already doing their job by putting tremendous effort to satisfy their walk ins.

Walked in to this place and looking inside through the transparent glass gives you so many positivity of what you can expect. The decor tells you how good they are to read your minds. Complete wood finish tables and chair with speaking wall phrases are way good for your comfort for couple hours of hangout. Soft Music and good vibes all around turns the experience far better. Service is prompt as i can say. the guys are well behaved and mannered, listen to your needs and gives you what you desire for.

The Experience went this way :

1. Corn and Spinach Cheese Sandwich : I am not a Spinach lover to be honest but sometimes your nightmares becomes a fairy tale. That is how i was surprised to taste the Sandwich which consisted good amount of cheese and spinach with the presence of corn. Was served with Kasundi and Tomato Ketchup that complemented this brilliantly.

2. Fresco Conizza : Felt like eating a spicy Cornetto with the layer of cheese throned above and all sort of veggies and spices beneath that will not make your mouth cold but hot with the chilli flavour. This is a new concept which i discovered here.

3. Peri Peri French Fries : Fresh Potatoes tossed up in peri peri sauce giving a spicy peri peri feel over the potato sticks. Giving a crispy feel this one did the job well.

4. Flavor of your Choice : When you hear the word "of your choice" so many things revolves around your head. But frankly speaking anything your choose has to have the perfect combination to make the Ice Cream of your choice tastier in every spoon.¬†

The evening was a bliss in the lights of Mumbles Lab and its heart winning food and Ice Creams. There is so much to try here and you need to be mentally prepared if you are going to try their nitrogen incorporated dishes. I guess anything you try here will bring smiles to your face.¬†
I wish them all the best. Cheers!!!!!!

Location: Hungerford Street Near Birla School for Boys.

Ambience and Decor: The ambience is great and the decor is also quite good with the walls filled with quotations and the ice cream deck somewhat resembling a chemistry lab.The lighting is also impressive.

Food and Ice Cream : This place serves ice creams with liquid nitrogen which makes it look really impressive and the taste is equally good too.
What we had:
Blueberry Shake: It was amazing,thick shake woth bits of blueberry. Loved it.

Chocolate Shake: The best for chocolate lovers,filled with chocolate,a very thick shake which is yummy.

Corn and Spinach Sandwich : It was quite crisp and tasty.

Funghi Conizza: It is the newly popular pizza in a cone, this one was filled with mushrooms and tasted quite good.

Kairi Pudina With Pulse: They also have an option of making ice creams of your choice and this one was quite interesting as it was filled with pulse candy and was perfect combination of sweet and tangy flavours.

Tiramisu: This one was also quite good,not too sweet.

Dragons Breath: This was by far the most interesting item, it was an assortment of tiny bits of brownie,oreo cookies and other sweet nibbles which had to be dipped in a cup of liquid nitrogen and had which upon chewing released the fumes of the liquid nitrogen from our mouth. 

Service:
The service was quick and the staff were very courteous and helpful,the owner himself was very attentive and explained in detail all the items.

Overall a great place! A big thumbs up. üëç

Mumble's lab is a unique addition to the food and beverage scene of kolkata. The introduction of nitrogen ice cream by them has now opened up a new genre for the icecream lovers. They have an array of combinations to choose from. You can make your own combination too with any ingredient you wish to add. Nutella , butterscotch and peanut butter were my favourites here. The inclusion of tidbits have now elaborated the menu. Tried the Fresca conizza and panner tikka pizza .Both were upto the mark. Coming to the attention seeking dragon breath. Loved the way how nitrogen is incorporated to the dish in order to create the visual wow factor. This easily becomes the staple for all boomerang(app) lovers.

Lovely food and ambience along with impromtu service. Recommended for all.

What an experience. You have to go to mumbles, if you love ice creams and innovation at the same time.
It's a laboratory set up, and they've introduced a scheme called "make your own ice cream" . Here you can bring in any flavour you wish for, we had taken PULSE along with us. And hey, they turned it into ice cream *_* how amazing. 
Apart from it, we had blueberry shake, piri piri fries, death by chocolate shake, corn and spinach cheese sandwich, fresca/funghi conizza, pizza a la basilico, and paneer pizza from the little kiosk outside the lab. Must say, each and every item was perfection. The conizza or pizza in a cone was amazing. 
For ice creams we ordered for nutella, mojito (MUST MUST HAVE) , guava, tiramisu, orange and caramel, peanut butter ice cream. Absolutely divine. 
Grab yourself a concoction from the lab asap.

Mumble's Lab has introduced Kolkata to the famous liquid nitrogen ice cream concept! Now you can select your own flavors and watch the ice cream preparation live. Flavors can be anything ranging from the regular Hazelnut, Butterscotch, Guava, Brownie to Tiramusu, Mojito, Peanut Butter, Nutella and many more!

You can also try the popular dragon breath! They present you few bite sized items of different flavors and you need to dip the item to the liquid nitrogen and put it in your mouth only to find smoke coming out of your nose and mouth!

They have recently added tidbits to their menu. You can try the Peri Peri French Fries, thin crust Paneer Tikka Pizza and Fresca Conizza. All items are are prepared with fresh ingredients and they taste delicious.

Price is quite reasonable. Service is great.

Recommended!

This small dessert parlour has a very unique way of making their ice-cream. They use liquid nitrogen to produce their ice-cream and also provide a variety of flavours. I went with a group of friends to try Ln2 ice cream for the first time.
We had:
1. Blueberry shake- thick shake filled with typical blueberry flavour and is really good to taste.
2. Fresca conizza - pizza in a cone is a really unique concept. It's so cheesy that it melts in your mouth in no time. The pizza crust made into a cone together with the cheesy filling tastes out of the world.
3. Funghi conizza- this has mushroom and cheese. Tastes equally good.
4. Mojito icecream- we have always had virgin mojito mocktails but ever tried mojito flavoured ice-cream? It has become my favourite flavour now since the time I have tasted it.
5. Nutella icecream- who doesn't love Nutella and ice cream? Mixing the two best things together creates something which is beyond explanation. I loved it and it is a must order.
6. Tiramisu - I love tiramisu desserts and hence I had to order an ice-cream of this flavour. It had a typical tiramisu flavour with coffee sprinkled on top. 
They have an option of customising your icecream with the flavour of your choice. I chose 'pulse' toffee flavour and they used Ln2 to create a pulse flavoured ice-cream. Isn't it amazing? The taste was commendable.
The ambience is very pretty and colourful, the service is prompt, the unique way of making Ice-cream with liquid nitrogen is anyway a top notch idea and the variety of flavours are sure to attract one. The price is also reasonable and one must try this dessert parlour if they are into experimenting with some unique flavours of ice-cream.

Situated beside Aqua Java, theatre road. Near JD Birla college. Process of making ice-cream is very eye catching. It makes ice cream with the help of liquid nitrogen, which is a new concept in Kolkata. The place is done up well, the walls have writings realted to the theme. We had ordered for Virgin Mojito ice cream. Small portion is enough for 3 people. We had asked for few snacks, but all were unavailable, no one to ready the food.

Want a dessert? You can go. Wanna feel like a dragon? Oh, you must go. And try the Dragon's Breath. The taste is not anyting outstanding, vanilla cake cubes with sauce of your choice. But the feel is absolutely amazing. Also we tried Cookiewich which had a scoop of chocolate ice-cream and two warm cookies. Oh the cookies. I have not had such tasty cookies anywhere else. Yet to try a few more flavors.

In short if you love ice cream, it is a place that should be in your bucket list.

Excellent service and excellent food is hardly to find and Mumble's Lab is one of them. The variety of ice cream prompts us to visit again and again to try new flavors. The staff is courteous and service is prompt. One should try Dragons breath for something new.

Yestarday we went to Mumble's lab. Its process of making ice cream is very eye catching. It makes ice cream with the help of liquid nitrogen, which is a very new concept in Kolkata.We ordered nutella flavoured icecream with red velvet toppings.. I dont feel the ice cream was so much extravagant. It was so so.

Mumble's Lab has a different take on ice cream altogether, it makes the concept of eating ice cream more lively than it already is. 
The place is done up well, the walls have writings related to the theme and the quote of the day will bring a smile to your face. 
Coming to what we ordered
The Famous Dragons Breath - I found the idea of eating cake dipped in nitrogen different, but wasn't impressed by the quality of product being served in matters of the cake.
The Chocolate, Mango, Nutella, Vanilla, Strawberry ice cream in a cup were all excellent. All of us enjoyed it. 
This place is recommended.

I was very excited when a place serving liquid nitrogen based ice cream opened up in the city. I headed there last Christmas and boy I was in for a treat.¬†I have tried Nutella, Fudge Brownie, Orange Caramel, Ginger Honey Basil and Tiramisu flavors till date. I have loved them all but I have to say the Orange Caramel is my favorite for now. Don't be fooled by the name small portion and large portion because the small is just enough to satisfy a single person's cravings and a large is kind of hard to finish, maybe I'd walked in with a full belly too.¬†I have not taken any photos of this place which I cannot add to this review but I will definitely go back for more.

Making ice cream with Liquid Nitrogen is a popular trend in cooking all over the world. Glad to see that Kolkata has caught up with it recently, with the arrival of stores like Mumble's Lab- LN2 Ice Cream. It's great to see the ice creams made in front of you, all the misty smoke looks good. I have had the Mango, Strawberry,Mojito and Nutella flavours of ice cream from here. Apart from the Mojito flavour, I really liked these ice creams. You can feel in your mouth the freshness of the ingredients intact even after it's been churned into ice cream. I would totally recommend the Nutella flavour because it's yummyüòç
Price is on the higher side.

I have never had such great ice-cream, ¬†they have so many varieties. each one of them are mouthwatering. it's like you can have the type of ice-cream YOU WANT. hence the 'lab'. you can even have extra toppings if you want. I had fudge brownie and cookies on top; great chocolate lover. but also I must admit bournvita ice-cream made me nostalgic. i loved it. I am surely looking forward to go there next week again.

Great atmosphere and staff. The ice cream was delicious and the kids had alot of fun! They had been annoying me all day to check out this new ice cream store which they had heard from their friends used liquid nitrogen to create ice cream. I decided to take them there since they promised to study hard in their tuition.

Needless to say the ice cream making process impressed even me! I'll be sure to return at a future time with my children.

Mumble's Lab, Theatre road.. 
On a pleasant evening I went there with my friends to taste ice cream made of nitrogen.. 
It's a LN2 ice cream outlet.. 
Variety of flavor with affordable rates.. 
So we ordered:
Strawberry ice cream
Chocolate one.. 
Virgin mojito
Mango one.. 
  Personally I didn't like the virgin mojito flavor that much as I like this only in mocktails.. 
Love to visit again..

Mumble Lab and their ice cream making using liquid Nitrogen is one of the best live ice cream making you will get to see. I have been here recently and saw their ice cream making. It was delightful to watch their ice cream making in front of us.
I have tried a few and the best I think is their Mango Flavor ice cream. I loved it the most. And also their Black Current.
The ice cream seems bit high in price but the opportunity of seeing it being made in front of you with liquid Nitrogen makes it up.

The concept of liquid nitrogen ice cream is just so new to me and thanks to the team for justifying the preparation with such calibre.

Mango was more refreshing!
The items are overpriced though. Also I wish they had a spacious cafe(at least) if some more chairs could be arranged.

Visited this place with my friends about a week ago. We tried their Mango, Nutella and Strawberry flavours. Apart from the preparation technique, there is nothing extra special about the ice creams here. I can recommend the Nutella one just because its "Nutella", no other reason.
Can be visited once and maybe their signature combinations are worth the try.

Discover gratification with your favourite flavour of ice-cream. How about boosting your exhausted day with a delightful scoop along with some mango and strawberry essence? You may also try their unique flavours like mojito and Nutella. They have got a stunning ambiance which is based on our not so favourite subject Chemistry but I'm sure you haven't felt the chemical formulas or bondings so interesting till now, unless and until you've visited this place. Immensely innovative along with some satisfying flavours. Must try.

Another one I had was * Rose Almond. It was also very good to taste.

The name of this place speaks for itself. The ambiance is of a chemistry lab and totally different with test tubes and conical flask hanging out as lights and the menu resembling short-form chemical symbol from the periodic table. I had Tiramisu with Choco Chips and Butterscotch with gems. The Tiramisu was good but the best part was the Butterscotch, it was the best Butterscotch i ever had till then.

The ice cream was underwhelming at best. We tried the death by chocolate and orange caramel. The chocolate was flat and boring. They should call it 'bored to death by chocolate'. The orange caramel was a mellow chocolatey flavour with the mildest hint of orange. It set us back 350‚Çπ. Thoroughly disappointing, as far as even decent ice creams go. Ergh.

This place is near birla high school. This parlour was in my wishlist since long.  The ambience was sober, chilled out and decorated with pictures of penguins and quotes, and review stickers of customers. The menu was displayed on the wall with initials and funky names.  Tried death by chocolate, and tiramisu ice cream, tiramisu was better. Expected more of death by chocolate,as its my favorite flavour. Though every ice cream is made with liquid nitrogen, the next item was where one can try their hands on it.The main attraction  and next item was dragon's breath. It's actually small piece of cake with chocolate syrup , where one have to dip the cake piece into liquid nitrogen for 7 seconds, with a toothpick, and place it directly to your mouth, where the twist actually is. It was fun. Wish to go again and try out other flavours. The parlour is pocket friendly. @Subhadip Ghosh

Okay, so having read so many good reviews, I decided to visit this place and tried the famous 'Dragon breath'. Plain Brittania cakes, cut in small pieces, with a tiny drop of chocolate sauce on top, with a cup of @liquid nitrogen by the side, to dip the cakes in. Price for that? 250 INR. Have never been that disappointed. Took an Orange Caramel, that wasn't that bad. 
Not paying that for "Ooh smoke coming out of my mouth." üòí
The place has a 'chemical-like smell', the decor is rather simple and the place is unusually empty. The people there are uninterested and it's self-service.

I give 5 stars out of 5 stars. Person at the outlet named Michael was very good at his behaviour. He guided me well in choosing the best ice cream. Very good service was provided. All the best for future. And cookiewich was mind blowing. 
Extremely new concept. Toppings served with choco chips, red velvet and chocolate syrup was awesome. Thanx for giving such wonderful experience.

The penguins stole the show!!

The first thing that took me back by surprise was the minimalist decor of the joint; brilliant work!! The menu looks like a periodic table on the wall, and a family of penguins all around to make you go "awww" throughout.

So, it's raw materials for ice-cream, instant frozen with liquid nitrogen; reminded me of episodes from Dexter's Laboratory (not the bloody one).

We tried "Death by Chocolate" and "Chocowich", an evening ODing on chocolate and brain freeze!

A definite 4‚≠ê, the only reason it doesn't touch a 4.5‚≠ê or 5‚≠ê is because of the 'cold' welcome, as the person at the counter was a little more interested in the IPL match on his phone than a smile at the customer a

right on the hungerford street, this is a sweet n simple place to indulge in desserts. tasted the dragon's breath n chocolate ice cream with oreo topping. the dragon' s breath is served as pieces of cake topped with jam along with a cup of liquid nitrogen at below freezing temperatures. One has to dip the cakes in this n eat quickly only to breath out like a dragon. Its fun food, only the tongue seems paralysed for an hour or 2.

Finally last Saturday went there not with that friend but with another group and found that, there weren't much people there at that time. We ordered Nutella which was amazing. Somehow Rose Almond was not that good. But overall it was amazing experience. Missed Dragon Breath (intentionally). Will try that on my next visit.

We went to this place at around 9:30pm and there weren't much people at this hour. This is one of the small ice cream parlor that uses molecular gastronomy, which is really trending in the world of culinary. We found this one on Zomato and decided to give this place a visit. When we arrived, we decided to sit outside as me and my companion, both are smokers. So ice cream and cig goes well together! We decided to try dragon breath, affogato and butterscotch. It was really amusing to watch them use liquid nitrogen in their ice cream. However, one thing I didn't like about this place is that they don't have any servers to attend the ice cream outside. We had to take it out ourselves and take them back in ourselves. The dragon breath uses brittania cupcakes ( it is funny ) and butterscotch tastes a bit weird.

The only liquid nitrogen ice cream parlour in town! 
Amazing ice cream.. Loved the concept.. Ice creams never tasted so good..

Items ordered :- 

1. Dragon Breathe - New concept. Small pieces of cake with nitrogen liquid . Dip the cake in liquid and have a smoky experience where cold smoke comes out of your mouth. And yes, it tastes awesome. You don't get that feeling that it's just an ice , rather flavours of cake emerges from that ice; making it more delicious.

2. Cookiewich - 2 large chunkies of chocolate  cookies overloaded by chocolate chips with a scoop of Chocolate ice cream in between cookies . This dessert is sort of heaven for Chocolate lovers .

3. Affogato - Unique combination of vanilla ice cream with hot coffee, this dessert was meant to act as balanced between hot and cold and was good. 

Ambience is excellent. Staff are helpful and courteous. 

Waiting to visit again as soon as possible.

3 stars for the process of making the icecream and the staff. 1 star for the ice cream that results from all the fanciness. You can pick and play with the ingredients, create your own mixes. The thandai flavour wasn't particularly amazing, neither was the Nutella one. I'm sure other flavours are better than these though. The service was courteous, and it's fun to watch them make the ice-cream! :D

The only thing to be amazed about was to see how the pieces of cake (tasted like plain Britannia cake) are turned into biscuits instantly while dipped in a glass of Liquid Nitrogen and while eating them , your breathing becomes smokey like a dragon. A bit off track experience as well, to try out ice - cream made with liquid nitrogen as it is often heard that this is very popular around the world. The ice - creams tasted good! Tried their regular size Tiramisu & Nutella flavours.It was creamy and thicker than ordinary ice - creams. Quantities are too little in respect of prices.
Liked their interior, the walls were designed with cool graphities. Finally, to our utter surprise , for the three dishes we ordered the bill came was around a whopping 560/-
According to me , when its about ice - cream , Mama Mia is still the number one choice!! :)

Was planning to visit this place for past 3 weeks. The unique offerings got my attention. Ice cream with liquid nitrogen!! As a chemistry graduate, I just couldn't miss it.
It's a bit tricky to find this joint. Make Map your friend. The decor is very simple but it's quite spacious for an ice cream parlour. It has tried to give you lab vibe with beakers, test tubes etc.
Let's come to the star attraction: Dragon's Breath. U get 10/16 cubes with a cup full of liquid nitrogen. Dip the cube in LN2 and experience the magic. Although it is more about a vanity affair than taste. But u will definitely enjoy smoke coming out of your nostrils. I ordered another hazelnut flavoured ice cream. Which tasted good. The production process is a treat to watch.
I would suggest people to experience this place ASAP. Because Kolkata is not very keen on retaining an unique place. I am.afraid this place will have same fate like IMAX, -6 degrees etc.

Pros:
1. Unique offering
2. Spacious interior.
3. Cordial stuff.

Cons:
1. Very few items on menu. Traditional Kolkatans still expect ice cream as final item on menu, not as the full menu.
2. Tricky location.

Gist : Great concept and ambience but highly overpriced w.r.t. quantity.

I visited this place on 14.1.17 around 10.00PM. Bit tricky to locate this place. Place is big but seating available for 4*4 persons. Toilet is their. Ambience and decor are great and goes well with the concept of the ice cream parlour. Staffs are cordial. Helped explaining the orders. But pricelist should be displayed. Ordered regular sized Tiramisu, Affagato & Rich Chocolate. They served each item one by one as per request within 3 minutes. They are successful to create a new taste of ice cream and their concept of using liquid is awesome. But highly overpriced for the quantity is served. Will visit only if the price falls at least 70%.

Location is a bit tricky. The place is big enough and is decorated well with plenty of lights which gives a very  positive vibe! Ordered a Bournvita flavoured Ice Cream with chocolate chips.The specialty of this place is they prepare the Ice Cream with liquid nitrogen. The price was okayish and you can customise the Ice creams to the way you want it. A good place if you love Ice-Cream!

Not visited the outlet yet but planning to visit soon so I can give you the info of outlet ambience, hospitality etc. Heard a lot about this desserts parlour and always get the positive response. Few days before I attend the event of farmers market at taj bengal where I tried their couple of ice cream desserts and their signature famous dragon breathe. Dragon breathe was just amazing it was complimentary so I liked it even more. It was super chilled and cold smoke comes out from your nose and mouth looks like a dragon is breathing. First ice cream I tried was named kairi pudina which was amazingly delicious giving the true natural flavour of raw mango and mint. Refreshment totally loved it. Second one was tiramisu it was coffee flavored dessert very tasty and comes with a cookie. Price was reasonable. must try desserts. Personal favorite. Highly recommended.

Yes it's fascinating. The liquid nitrogen being poured into the mixer makes great theatre. Even though the texture of the ice cream is commendable, the flavours are not as strong as the drama.

The dragons breath dessert Is absolutely amazing. I don't think there is any other place in India which serves this yet. Hence it's a novelty. It's cake dipped in liquid nitrogen. And once you put it your mouth, it appears as if you're exhaling smoke. Hence the dragon breath. Which is uber cool. Although it doesn't taste all that nice.
The nitrogen ice cream was pretty good too. Above average.
Brownie Points just for the dragon breath cakes!!

Well this place is the first to introduce nitrogen made icecream to the city. Flavours well thought, you are alwyas tempted to try the other one too. Only one cup size available the large ones which makes it a bit costly. 

The desert is heavy, and thicker then other ice creams. Full points for that. We tried Nutella which was class apart and everyone will crave for more. The second one we tried was peanut butter, well made but was a bit at variance with actual peanut butter. We also tried tiramisu on staff suggestions which was also good. 2 large cups here is a complete meal in itself, so check your appetite before ordering.

Located in Theatre Road/Hungerford Street (close to Birla high/ims) this outlet is Kolkata's first tryst with Experimental cooking and that too with Nitrogen! Yes yes, all you MasterChef fans know that I am talking about the freezing technique introduced by legendary chef Heston Blumenthal who explained how liquid nitrogen can freeze anything!
Mumbles Lab has adopted the same technique to serve up some amazing flavours of ice cream at this cute cosy outlet.

I have been at the outlet once and tried the Nutella cup small with hazelnut! Had loved the creaminess from the hazelnut topped by hazelnut :D
Next tried their Death by chocolate with marshmallows at Streets of India and loved it too!

Prices are reasonable per cup and honestly watching them prepare the icecream is an experience altogether!

Kudos to the concept and product!
If you love icecreams, don't miss this one! :)

You know, when I heard about Mumble's Lab, their USP is what caught my ears. Really wanted to check it out. Finally tried one of their ice creams - Death By Chocolate in an event a couple of days back.¬†

The way they make their ice cream was killer. Every couple - a - minutes, when I tried to peep into their huge metal vessel puffing away cold smoke that was churning my ice cream, one of their staff shooed me away :P Curiosity I tell you. :)

To be honest - The first thing I looked at was the Packaging and Logo. Didn't find it appealing at all.

BUT - ¬†Coming to ice cream- It tasted SO FRESH. Fresh is the right word ! Really really fresh !

Word of advice ? ¬†- Should work on the Branding aspects a bit. :) No offence. Rest all will follow since your Ice Cream tasted so good. :)¬†

Will definitely try more of yours ! :)
Oh and I forgot to mention - I was given a cube like sweet thing to taste. Didn't realize after a couple of minutes of talking that I was puffing cold smoke too ! It was really funny. :D

Loved the way they made the ice cream....
With nitrogen. Magical to watch and in taste too. Lovely place, with a great vibe and you feel delighted with the ice cream they serve you. They have a number of different flavours and most probably the most popular ones are the chocolate ones,especially nutella. But we went for orange Caramel and it was really good. When they gave it in the paper cup we were surprised for it looked like chocolate icecream and we had asked for orange. They told us it was inside and so it was!! Great taste and enjoyable. Definitely going back for more

Remember all those times you watched TLC to catch Heston Blumenthal making ice cream out of liquid nitrogen? Yeah, now Kolkata has its own ice cream parlor called Mumble's Lab that sells you ice cream made out of liquid nitrogen.
The laboratory is adorned with scribbled walls relating to their showstopper ingredient; displays live ice cream churning show, and also Dragon breath!
The menu is set on the wall including both popular and not so popular flavors.
We ordered their:
Peanut butter ice cream: churned into a creamy texture and topped with peanuts. Although the texture was smooth and velvety, I personally thought that their flavors need some work.
Nutella: This one was a delight to eat. Sweet and creamy, and after adding toppings the entire ice cream tasted completely yummy.
Our last order was Fudge Brownie. Made out of dark chocolate and churned live was our cup of ice cream. Everything met my criteria however the flavors again failed to hit the spot for me.

Location-Theatre road,Kolkata.

This is one of its own kind and Kolkata's 1st liquid nitrogen ice-cream parlour.Along with indoor seating they also have an option for outdoor seating which is quite nice if the weather is good.The whole place is spacious and decorated in a very adorable manner with small bulbs and posters all around which was going very well with the liquid nitrogen concept.The process of icecream making was also very interesting.

Service-The service at this place was quite fast and reliable.The staff was courteous and cooperative and suggested us some of their best.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place was extremely calm and soothing.Throughout the day a light music is played which goes very well with the lighting.The interiors are also eye catching and as said it has a huge seating capicity.

Food-Though its a new concept but we found the ice cream to be highly priced.The taste was ordinary like any other icecream but the smooth texture feels very good in mouth.We had-
1:Nt nutella
2:Mn mango

Service-4/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Food-3.5/5

Well there was much hype about this place so we decided to visit and try the nitrogen ice cream. Big disappointment. Tastes very very average at best. Nothing special about it, apart from the way they are it. But at the end of the day how will a dessert parlor work if the desserts dont taste good. I doubt if I'd go back.

It's a good ice cream parlour in the city. They have quite nicely decorated it. More importantly, the ice cream was really good, the flavours as well as the add on toppings. Tried the tiramisu and the mango flavours, and both of them were really amazing. I will definitely make more rounds to this place (have to taste all the flavours at least) and will recommend others too.

At first the cup seemed medium but when they filled it up it was a lot. For two people one large is really good. The mixture was amazing and it was so creamy. The flavours were making an amazing gala in my mouth. @

A fun place for ice-creams with a difference. It was our first visit to Mumbles and we were most entertained while selecting flavours and then watching all the theatre of our ice creams being churned and then mixed with the swirling smokey liquid nitrogen. While all the flavours we tried were nice, I would strongly recommend the Orange Caramel and Ginger Honey Basil.

All i can say is.. they are doing an amazing job by serving happiness in the form of their super delicious ice creams.. yummy ice creams with a new technology ... u guys got it!! Really loved the interior .. the beautifully painted walls with ice creams posters were eye catching ... the place was fresh and the catchy songs playing in the background was sufficient to make u feel extra happy and excited.. really loved the chemical reactions painted inside justifing the title "Mumble's Lab"..
Now, coming to the ice cream.. we ordered their bourvita ice cream in a regular size.. although we ordered the regular size.. the quantity was really sufficient for two of us... the ice cream was just  heaven served in a bowl.. it was extremely tasty with the chocolate sauce oozing out.. the small chunks of bourvita reminded us of our childhood days... it was really good!! Really looking forward to this shop as they are probably the best in the city... :D

This one's a cute little liquid nitrogen ice cream parlour! A first for Kolkata...easy to locate. Parking is difficult. Best approached by foot. There have 8-10 ice cream brilliant options painted on their walls. They churn it infront of your eyes n splash the container with some liquid nitrogen, an voila! Your frozen stuff is ready to served! I want to try their other items before rating this place higher! For now, 3.5 is for their bravery to put up such a brilliant show and for their ginger honey basil ice cream!

Kolkata and its affair with dessert is a never-ending saga, so the new address for people having a sweet tooth is Mumble's lab. Mumble‚Äôs Lab is the first spot in this part of the city serving ice-cream made using liquid nitrogen, but what‚Äôs so special about it, you might wonder? Well, it is fresh, it‚Äôs instant? can be customised and its creamynas never. 

Location: Hungerford Street, Theatre Road, Kolkata just next to Birla High School for Boys.

Ambience and Decor: The d√©cor here goes hand-in-hand with the central theme and Mumble ‚Äì the penguin ‚Äì who is the mascot welcomes you to his lab with a wall narrating the story and their journey. The ambiance is that of a lab with various equipment and Pipes. There are flavours in the form of equations on the walls Inspired by the periodic table.

Staffs: The owner herself , Mrs. Devina Parakh is an amazing host by herself. She leads the team of ice cream experts who promises to serve nothing but the best.

Food : The creamy food journey thus began. 

1. Orange Caramel

The combination of Orange and caramel with the exciting brown colour instead of orange which acts as an element of surprise for the customers.

Where Liquid Nitrogen steals the show, Courtesy: Mumble‚Äôs Lab!

The first of its own kind, Mumble‚Äôs Lab focuses on making Ice Cream the modern way, by using Liquid Nitrogen. Located at Hungerford Street, this quaint but popular shop aims at making the process smoother and faster, and hence goes a bit off-track when it comes to the conventional method of preparation of ice creams. Finding this place isn‚Äôt much difficult. Situated close to Birla High, the outlet is spacious, and gives you enough space and room to breathe. The center portion of the outlet has its own laboratory, where the skilled chemists are experimenting on the ingredients along with LN2, or popularly known as Liquid Nitrogen Gas, to give and churn you out the finest quality of ice creams. The naming of this place is a story in itself, but then that‚Äôs a tale which can be told some other day. 

The owner herself is a remarkable woman, and takes utmost care to heed to the needs and requirements of the patrons walking in to Mumble‚Äôs Lab.  If not for anything else, she deserves her credit for going bold, and introducing this concept in the city of Joy. Usage of Liquid Nitrogen does not let formation of any crystals and hence one would usually find the ice creams much smoother. Another advantage here would be that the melting process is quite slow, and hence you can take your own sweet time to chat with your friends, while having the ice cream, without having to fear, if the ice cream is melting out of the cup. Team #panchphoron was invited over for an icecream tasting session, and this was one invitation, which I did not want to miss. A set menu was already made up to make our work easy. Following were the ones which we had tried:

¬†

1. Orange Caramel

The combination of Orange and caramel with the exciting brown colour instead of orange which acts as an element of surprise for the customers. The flavor was very surprising, but we thoroughly enjoyed the sharp contrast. The tanginess and the sweetness of the orange kept hitting our tastebuds, but the Caramel enjoyed its own fine share.

2. Ginger Honey Basil

The first medicinal ice cream of its kind. Inspired by Granny's secret tonic for cough and cold. It has the sweetness from honey, freshness from basil and the zing from ginger. Hints at a quick remedy for cough and cold, the use of honey, basil and ginger is perfect for a throat suffering from cough and cold.

3. Bournvita

The name says it all. Its dark chocolate with bournvita crunches. Who doesn‚Äôt love Bournvita? More like a chilled and thickened Bournvita Shake, this one had dark chocolate with crushed Bournvita crunches. Exotic with every bite, this was one of the best ice cream flavors for the evening.

4. Cookiewich with Nutella

It is a deconstructed ice cream sandwich. A dollop of ice cream with two handmade cookies, The cookied had the right crunch, but the richness of the nutella was beyond any comparison. A sheer delight for the tastebuds.

5. Nutella ‚Äì The fineness and richness of Nutella, churned into an Ice Cream. Rich, gooey and smooth, this one simply won all of our heart.

6. Thandai: The traditional Thandai flavor, this one had the perfect sweetness and incorporated the very familiar Thandai flavor. Introduced specially for Holi, due to high demand, this flavor is still being served to the customers.

7. Kairi Pudina

The zing from Kairi and the soothing taste from Pudina.. Along with some Chaat masala and to top it all - Pulse on top. Has that quintessential chat flavor, we all like to have.

8. Tiramisu: Richness of liquor coffee, with coffee dusted on top.

9. Peanut Butter

It has the sweetness and a bit of saltiness from the peanut.

10. Strawberry: One of my friend liked this a lot. Traditional strawberry flavor, but due to the infusion of LN2, tasted much better.

11. Your ice your way - Nutella with snickers, mars and twix.

As per the tagline, this one is said to be ‚ÄúYour ice your way‚Äù. The customers can choose the ingredients and toppings, and the skillful staffs will prepare it for them.

12. Dragon Balls

Marshmallows dipped in Liquid Nitrogen. Dipping it in LN2 gives it a nice crunchy exterior and soft from inside. Once, it is kept inside the mouth, smoke will apparently come out. Hence the phrase, ‚ÄòDragon Balls‚Äô.

13. Your ice your way-

On our request, this one had Vanilla Ice Cream, topped with the specialty sweet from Krishnanagar, ‚ÄòSwarbhaja‚Äô.

¬†Overall, it was w wonderful experience. We learnt so much about this process for the first time. Seeing LN2 churning the liquid mixture ice cold was a sight we would never forget. The outlet is brand new, and hence needs some time to stand out and learn from its mistakes, if any. But then, who would love to sit back and let an ice cream pass by? So come along today with your friends or relatives and enjoy the richness of ice creams, courtesy:  Mumble‚Äôs Lab!

Finally went there after a long wait. Discovered this place on zomato and it's high ratings and my craving for icecreams got me there.
The interiors looked like a lab only in sync with its name. Chemical formula written here and there and the names of icecreams hung on the wall with their symbols quite reminding you of the periodic table. Innovative must say.
We had one FUDGE BROWNIE and VANILLA ICECREAM
The fudge brownie wasn't impressive.
The vanilla one was perfect, sooo creamy.
Ok so, I had to say that the icecreams were overpriced keeping in mind their quality. Their preparation was totally new but the ultimate result didn't score much. It was served in a boring cup looking much like those regular icecreams . They should work on the presentation and expand the menu.

Absolutely loved this ice cream parlour. They make ice cream with liquid nitrogen and we can see the whole process, and therefore I have no other word to describe it but that it was 'cool'. Coming to the ice creams, we had 
1) orange caramel-which looked like caramel ice cream, but had a predominantly orange flavour
2) kairi pudina- it did taste like raw mango
3) peach flavour- clean refreshing taste
4) ginger honey basil- ginger lovers will love it. Had raw ginger taste in it. Very tasty.

The best things about the ice-creams were that they were creamy, smooth but not heavy. Can't wait to visit again.

And this time it was "Bournvita", it couldn't have been better, tasted Heaven.üòç
The place is really cool and the Decor is nice with good music.
Staff is courteous.
They have very few options, but all are worth trying, it is very unique and made without preservatives.One of the best ice cream parlours in town.
I ll be visiting this place to try all that they have.
It is a bit expensive as compared to other ice cream parlours but its all worth it.üòá‚ò∫

My ice cream stop over the past few days was Mumble's Lab. One of the cutest places with a story that I really adore. Mumble is definitely an ingenious penguin and his lab definitely provides some wonderful ice creams! This was my first experience of seeing liquid nitrogen right in front of my eyes and it was really great. I have tried so far the following :

Orange Caramel - My very first ice cream here left me craving for more! I was blown away by the wonderful orange flavour and the silky smooth texture! That just set the tone for my subsequent visits! 

Tiramisu - If Orange Caramel had the subtle elegant balance of flavour, the Tiramisu was packed with a bold coffee flavour. Another fabulous creation which you simply cannot miss!!

Fudge Brownie - I can never dislike chocolate so I must say I liked this one too! However this one has to be the least impressive of my otherwise magical experience. The ice cream was smooth as ever but the brownie pieces were a bit too cold which made them a little less enjoyable. 

Ginger Honey Basil - An innovative creation with ample amount of ginger and basil. This was a truly memorable experience. I liked it a lot though it wasn't really my favourite. 

So far that's all I have had and I already have my eyes on some other wonderful flavours! Till then, I wish you all Happy Dining and highly recommend this amazing place for your ice cream craving!!

Went to this place on a Sunday and ordered a Nutella and a fudge brownie. But the nutella tasted like an orange ice cream and after reporting it to the staff they changed it immediately (which is appreciated). I liked the texture of the ice cream . It was smoother and softer than the regular ice creams . However the flavours of the ice creams weren't that strong and I felt that the place is a bit over priced, considering the fact that they just give a scoop of the chosen flavour and that too without toppings!

If i ask you what are the things possible to do in real quick 3 mins what would you say ? well for a fact many would have a lot of things to come up with in 3 mins, from eating an apple to polishing your shoes all is possible in 3 mins in our day to day lives .Now what if i say in 3 mins you can get your favourite ice cream made in front of you with the process of liquid nitrogen would you believe me ? Yes you got to believe me as it is possible ,Thanks ! to Mumble‚Äôs Lab Nitrogen ice cream parlour located in¬†10E, Hungerford Street, Kolkata 700 017 West Bengal, India which is indeed very close to Birla High school . Mumble‚Äôs Lab is not your regular ice cream parlour which has ice cream‚Äôs readily frozen and stocked up for display and served straight away . What seperates Mumble‚Äôs Lab from other‚Äôs is its fresh way of using Liquid Nitrogen for the process of freezing the ice cream‚Äôs in a minus 3oo degree temperature and above atmosphere where the ice cream‚Äôs get smoother and yummier in taste.And of course fresh it in the process as a result the ice crystals dont get a chance to form much compared to your regular already frozen ice cream‚Äôs, making liquid Nitrogen process a better choice to save time as well as it create‚Äôs an experience of indulging in your ice cream absolutely safe because Nitrogen evaporate‚Äôs during the freezing process keeping you rest assured .

It's a bit dicey to find the location as it's quite hidden in Hungerford St.
Nevertheless,brownie points for the ice cream

Few days ago I came across the best Ice cream parlor in town that plays with the diatomic gas with atomic number 7! This place was in my wishlist for a long time but since I do not frequent these places much somehow it never happened to me unless I received an invitation from the management few days back. I was pleasantly surprised when I visited their ‚ÄòLab‚Äô at Hungerford Street. Now why is it called a lab and why am I keener to call it a lab rather than an ordinary ice cream parlor? Here playing with the diatomic liquid is very common, people are so used to juggle with this cryogenic liquid day in and day out, hope by now you have guessed the liquid right, it is LN2 or Liquid Nitrogen that still retains the diatomic character of the nitrogen gas even after liquefaction. LN2 is used for rapid freezing and as a refrigerant that is even used for cryocoservation cells, tissues, blood, etc. It is used as a coolant in several fields like spacecrafts, computer hardware, astronomy, and in food science. The last topic interests us most, isn‚Äôt it? Food science or molecular gastronomy is the hot topic nowadays in the city. It is one modern or rather urbane style of cooking or preparation of dishes that utilizes the scientific innovations. With reference to Mumble‚Äôs lab let us only discuss about use of LN2 in preparation of ice creams here, since the branch of molecular gastronomy is really vast; and maybe we can discuss about some other branch of it in another blog post of mine :)

No I won‚Äôt start the post with I scream, you scream thing. Though that‚Äôs what I surely do too. Who doesn‚Äôt love ice cream! From the ice candies to the exotic stuff, any ice cream is thoroughly enjoyable to the last drop (yes, biting has become an issue for me for the past few weeks due to sensitiveness). And Mumble‚Äôs Lab is the recent addition to the ice cream parlours of the city. However it comes with a twist. The ice creams are prepared with the help of liquid nitrogen using principles of ‚ÄòMolecular Gastronomy‚Äô.
The story behind the name of the joint is pretty interesting. It‚Äôs named after a fictional penguin who was fond of ice creams. When school textbooks informed mumble that atmosphere is made up of mostly the inert nitrogen, it sent him thinking about how to use that to make better ice creams. He started working in his lab & used liquid nitrogen to make some of the creamiest ice creams. Pretty adorable story behind the name, Mumble‚Äôs Lab.

Ice cream with ice but ice cream with liquid nitrogen, yes finally it's here in kolkata, I was waiting for it when I will get a chance to taste it, it's been described everywhere as the five minute was to make marvelous lip-smacking ice creams, to make this lovely ice creams just need is a little amount of liquid nitrogen(-320 degree Fahrenheit), with this need some creamy ingredients and appetite for making scientific ice cream. Recently Mubmle's Lab introduced this technology to make this lovely ice creams, located Hungerford street, Theatre road area just next to Birla high school, I was invited there with my fellow foodies to taste their lovely molecular scientific ice creams.

Molecular gastronomy is the kind of scientific equipments along with the techniques with culinary techniques, making this ice cream will produce a smoky atmosphere all over the place for a little time being, basically one of the most benefits of making ice cream using liquid nitrogen the softness of the ice cream as well as it will remain same for a long time period, you can enjoy your ice cream slowly slowly.

after entering there there are different types of wallpapers, there are chemical labs equipments like conical flux, bikar hanging over the ceiling,  various types of equations also there is a some periodic tables elements names over the wall, feels like is this a ice cream lab or is it a chemical lab. concept really good presenting the place, making ice cream with liquid nitrogen, need this type of things to make it more scientific.

1. Orange Caramel - the combination of Orange and caramel with the exciting brown colour instead of orange which acts as an element of surprise for the me, this is the best i have to commit, everyone must try this one, thanks to them for suggesting this one.

2. Ginger Honey Basil- when i had cough and cold i used to eat this ingredients with tea, but making ice cream with this i was really curious, the first medicinal ice cream of its kind. which one was Inspired by Granny's secret tonic for cough and cold. it has the sweetness from honey, freshness from basil and the zing from ginger, i will suggest everyone try this one. 

3. Bournvita - the name says it all.from my childhood i love to eat bournvita, still if someone give me i love to have it.but i was surprised when they told me about this, combination of dark chocolate with bournvita crunches, expectation was high and yes it was just brillant.

4. Cookiewich with Nutella- it is a deconstructed ice cream sandwich. A dollop of ice cream with two handmade cookies, name was quite interesting but it tastes really good while eating and enjying the smoothness of the ice cream take a of home made cookies it was really good in taste, very soft from the inside, putting extra bit of small chocolates gives a lovely texture.

5. Nutella - it was very average what i found after tasting it, introducing this flavour in a ice cream is very unique.

6. Thandai- a flavour which they introduced especially for Holi, continuing with the flavour becauseis is very much demanding, Initially during Holi, everyone walked in thinking it was thandai in the form of the drink. but to surprise them they introduced this in a form of ice cream.

7. Kairi Pudina - the zing from Kairi and the soothing taste from Pudina.. Along with some Chaat masala and to top it all - Pulse on top, over the top using finely chopped corriander leaves lovely combination.

8. Tiramisu - i was known to this name as a dessert, but in the form of ice cream really surprising for me, it has the rich flavour of coffee liqueur along with coffee dusted on top, great taste and very smooth. 

9. Peanut Butter - in order to introduce savoury flavours to Calcutta, we tried to start with peanut butter. It has the sweetness and a bit of saltiness from the peanut. 

10. Strawberry - i love this flavour, good one .

11. Your ice your way - Nutella with snickers, mars and twix.

Our tagline says your ice your way. To keep up to our tagline, we allow customers to invent their own concoctions. Customers can get their own ingredients and our staff will readily make the ice cream for them. It is a very good avenue for amateur cooks and ice cream lovers to try their skills.

12. Dragon Balls - Marshmallows dipped in Liquid Nitrogen. Dipping it in LN2 gives it a nice crunchy extrerior and soft from inside. When you bite into it, smoke comes out of your mouth , thats why its called Dragon Balls 

13. Your ice your way- the perfect way to the amazing evening, Vanilla base along with sweet Speciality. 

i would like to thank for inviting me and give me the chance for tasting it, specially for making this lovely ice creams, innovative flavours that can actually works properly, every type of ice cream the flavor was just mouth-watering, best part is if you give them any kind of foods/fruit/chocolates any thing eatable they will make ice cream with that, which i found quite innovative. wish you all the very best everyone. till then happy eating.

Liquid nitrogen is relatively a new ingredient used in the production of ice creams, which makes it really fast to make any ice cream, thereby reducing the work of storing and frosting, and saving the time involved in this process. Grasping this idea, Mumble‚Äôs Lab has come into the city. With its wide array of flavours and amazing ice creams, this place has gained huge popularity in a very short time. Apart from saving time, liquid nitrogen imparts a proper texture to the ice cream, making it extremely smooth and fresh, unlike normal ice creams which tend to remain as crystals basically under constant freezing. This is where Mumble‚Äôs Lab has gone a step ahead of all other ice cream parlours and the city. The freshness, smooth texture, amazing taste and unique flavours of the liquid nitrogen ice creams have made Mumble‚Äôs Lab a very happening place.

We tried the fudge brownie there. It was kinda less sweet than the normal ice creams but it was still so good . The texture was so smooth and amazing that we ate it in no time . I am definitely recommending it to others and the best part is that they are open till 12 . An extra point for that !

Very funky and new concept of decor in this new Lab in our city.. Was expecting to see Walter White around there I guess.. The place is true to its name with decor and table arrangements made with chemical apparatus. Though the music is rather loud and distasteful.. 
We had the Fudge Brownie and Mango one's and they were mindblowingly awesome.. The texture is a lot different than regular ice cream and is delightfully smooth.. The taste was spot on as well.. Especially the Mango.. This has become my favourite.. 
And the cool part is seeing the ice cream made with LN2!! Kind of a Heston Blumenthal touch we're used to seeing in television!!

Just one little suggestion.. The mascot of yours, that little penguin had gained the attention of both my friends(female) and they were almost trying to pluck out the posters.. If you would make little stuffed toy souvenir mascots, I believe they will be quite a hit..

I had sky high expectations when I heard about an ice cream parlour that uses l liquid nitrogen to prepare ice cream. The decorations are cool and quirky. I mean who wouldn't love to see their fav formulas of chemistry on the counter top.
-----
Its a cool place to have a quick relaxing session with your friends. They served some 10-12 flavors of ice cream that is prepared using liquid NO2. I was very satisfied with the flavors i choose and what's best is that you don't get confused with the numerous add ons that they offer because they have already mentioned in the menu as to which add on hours best with what flavor.
-------
Do give this place a try and fall in love with mumble (the mascot penguin).

P.S: do pay a bit of attention when they prepare the ice cream cox that when the magic happens.
Cheers!! üçª

Mumble's Lab - The FIRST liquid nitrogen ice cream lab in the city of joy.¬†
=====
Intro + Location:¬†

Mumble's lab is located in Hungerford street. It is not at all difficult to locate as it's located right next to Kafe Bindass. (Near Birla High School)

I had been invited at Mumble's Lab to try out their various ice creams. I was quite delighted as i entered this place as it was not small as the usual ice cream shops. The ice cream shop looked more like a lab as the name suggests. The ice creams which are displayed to order from the walls are done in usual chemistry style with abbreviations of the name. I was quite mesmerised with the interiors. They are modern, quirky and chic at the same time. The wall had a penguin named mumble who's story was illustrated on how the mumble's lab came into picture. It is quite a cute place and the concept is altogether knew which might make the visitor's drool over. :)¬†
=====
What i had:

‚Ä¢ Butter Scotch Ice cream - I started tasting with this ice cream. It was served in a cup. When i just poured in my spoon, i felt it to be quite a bit stiff. It was topped with pistachio and almond flakes and had butterscotch crunchy small toffees inside the ice cream. The taste of the ice cream was perfect. However, what turned me off was the stiffness.¬†

‚Ä¢ Nutella Ice Cream - Oh boy! It was heaven on earth. The chocolate chips with jujubes along with nutella was an icing on the cake. It was quite well presented. I loved the taste and it was just melting in the mouth. The chocolate chip perfectly complemented the whole ice cream and thereby, satiated my palate. ‚úå‚úå

‚Ä¢ Peanut Butter - Usually, ice creams are sweet. It was unusual and unique at the same time. It was peanut butter ice cream topped with peanuts. I personally liked it and it was a good change from the usual sweet.

¬†‚Ä¢ Ginger Honey Basil - This indeed is my favorite of Mumble's Lab and i am surely coming back for this one again. It was a perfect concoction. All these three were perfectly melting in the mouth. Would highly recommend this. ¬†#lipsmacking #tasty ‚úå‚úå

¬†‚Ä¢ Orange Caramel - I finished off with my dessert cravings with this. It was actually melting in the mouth. I loved the blend of these two flavour's and the perfect balance which is essential was quite maintained. Recommended. ‚úå‚úå
=====

Special Mentions:

I would specially like to thank Devina and Arihant for having me here. It was a delight meeting you both. :)¬†
=====
Pros:¬†

‚Ä¢ First in Kolkata to bring the liquid nitrogen ice cream concept.
‚Ä¢ Some of the flavours are quite unique out here.
‚Ä¢ One can customized their ice cream and they serve pure vegetarian affairs.¬†
‚Ä¢ The ambiance makes you feel like you are actually in a Lab.¬†
‚Ä¢ The place is quite spacious and not like the usual ice cream parlours.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ The staffs needs to be more courteous and serve with smiling faces.¬†
‚Ä¢ Prices seemed to be a bit inclined. However, the concept of liquid nitrogen as well as the quantity makes up for it.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 180-400 approximate.¬†
=====
Expert Suggestions:

‚Ä¢ Combo offers of the ice creams should keep coming.¬†
‚Ä¢ The presentation of scoop ice creams with each other seems quite similar. I would recommend to work on the presentation a bit.¬†
=====

Loved the idea. Loved watching the nitrogen freeze my ice cream. Ordered small nutella and a small fudge brownie. They served huge portions in the tiny cups. Made me happy. Brownie icecream was not as smooth as the nutella one. Though nutella had a hint of orange flavour. M guessing it was not meant to be. Nutella is supposed to be hazelnutty chocolate not orangy chocolate. Though i had a nice experience.

As a health freak, I was very happy to know that Liquid Nitrogen ice cream is prepared without any chemicals and preservatives. It was prepared fresh right in front of my eyes. I tried the Orange Caramel ice cream and it is absolutely delicious. Keep up the great work, I will surely be back soon for another icy treat.

Liked the concept of choosing the flavour and the ice-cream being prepared in front of you. Nutella is the one I ordered which tasted good.

Also ordered for a dessert with cookies and ice-cream and found it to be delightful.

The place could be more lively and cheerful. Ditto for the music.

The interiors and decor were quite interesting, as they have made their entire set-up like a chemistry lab. Fun, fresh and fabulous, I am definitely coming to Mumbles for a second time.

A new concept, but if u want tasty ice cream u should go somewhere else. ‚Çπ200 plus a scoop. With average flavours and limited choice about 12 flavours. With nothing so great about it. Neither it is fresh nor that tasty. So if u want to see the process which is also hidden. So I wouldn't recommend anyone. And I seriously have doubts over the authenticity of other reviews.

Molecular gastronomy , the latest trend in the world of food ! Although we have restaurants like Gabbars who have applied this to food, this is the very first in town to have experimented with ice-creams.
Not just in Calcutta but even around India, there are only handful of them .
I was lucky enough to be invited for the pre-opening bash and was excitedly part of group who got to try out flavors they wished. Any guesses what we thought of ? Maggi! Lol I think it will take our Pallette a bit of time before they start relishing savory ice-creams.
All this apart, my fav ice cream in the chocolate one with hazelnuts . To begin with, it's good high to eat freshly churned ice-cream which comes into being right before your eyes, the liquid nitrogen's cool smoky effect surely adds to the whole experience.
What I liked was the right amount of creaminess and sweetness that it offered. 
The other thing is that churn out India special festive flavors from time to time , like thandai flavored ice cream in holi season, interesting isn't it ?

Since I am a bournvita girl, the bournvita flavored nitrogen ice-cream added much more taste and fun to it. The ice-creams here are a great combination of freshness and fun. It tasted scrumptious believe me! It had a wonderful consistency. The hospitality is equally great here. A must visit place. Keep it up!

Great to have a place with a new concept. The ice cream making from liquid nitrogen is just wow to watch. A good part this place is they make the ice cream fresh & right in front of your eyes. But they do have a minus point that the ice cream is not that cream & not great with taste. Price is pretty normal.
Should atleast visit once.

The decor and the ambience is very plain and nothing very fancy or something to remember.   The rating goes down a notch because of this but it's open till 11 30pm which is a plus. Also the menu card is very misleading.. .. What appears as part of the order is in fact suggestions and they will charge you extra for that. ... The ice cream is expensive and claims not to be the regular fare... A small scoop will set you back by atleast 150 rupees...

The ice cream is just awesome....‚òÖ. You just have to try this atleast once.... It's such fine texture...

Liquid Nitrogen ice cream in Kolkata.. Well it was about time this place opened up. We tried  Nutella and the taste was just amazing. Not extra sweet and just the perfect flavour. The outlet is spacious and the staff is extremely co-operative. The place is open late into the night so a bonus for all the midnight cravings. One of its kind in Kolkata, this place is a must visit for people who like ice creams. The regular serving is enough for a single person and the flavours are amazing. Although a little more variety would be welcome.

Nitrogen ice-cream is theatre for food. If you are like me who gets super excited about all this stuff , this place is a must visit. I've been there a couple of times but every time he add liquid nitrogen to the mixer it makes me giddy with joy. I've tried the nutella and fudge brownie ice creams. Nutella is my favourite. The ice cream texture is perfect for me . It's soft creamy and most importantly utterly delicious. I would recommend this place.

Liquid Nitrogen ice cream finally comes to Cal! Was super excited to visit this place and was really happy with it. We had a Fudge Brownie, Nutella and Bourn Vita - super creamy and very flavourful. It's not very sweet but the flavour really comes through well. The regular size is more than enough for one person and it's reasonably priced as well. The staff was super helpful. Definitely worth a visit!

I have had liquid nitrogen icecream before but Mumble's Lab really does it the best ! Tried two of their flavours - Butterscotch and Bournvita (New).I just loved the consistency of the icecream- thick and creamy .In terms of flavour , the Butterscotch was nothing to rave about but the Bournvita will surely be a big hit .The essence of the drink is beautifully captured in the icecream and even people who did not like Bournvita as a drink,might start to love it in this form .
I hope Mumble's keeps experimenting , thus providing a wonderful option to icecream lovers in Kolkata.

Yes you have heard it right; liquid nitrogen concoction resulting in a yummilicious ice cream. The first of its kind, it is all set to woo the foodies of kolkata. For all those still wondering how safe is liquid nitrogen ice cream, dont worry because you do inhale nitrogen almost every second.
Nt- Nutella is the favorite and popular one among the 9 available flavours. Topping of hazlenut or a brownie is recommended.
The process is very interesting as you can have a live session of the preparation in front of you. Liquid nitrogen is poured into the requested flavour/sauce and combined with milk. You will witness white smoke coming out during the preparation which is the result of nitrogen coming into contact with air and as a result of which, it vapourizes.
A lot of chemistry dwelled into the preparation of this out of the box idea which has been inherited from London.
Ghb- Ginger honey basil, a lot of ginger in the ice cream is least recommended if you ask me. Since you have abundant flavours available, this one can be opted out. But yes, if you are bored of the usual chocolate, butterscotch, vanilla flavours this one is worth a try.
Quantity of a regular cup is more than enough to serve one person.
The decor is artistic with penguins( their mascot) talking only about nitrogen and the nicknames of flavours reminiscent of the periodic table.
Overall I liked the place and will definitively try other flavours.
I just had one suggestion : The music could be upgraded from the typical Bollywood chartbusters to latest English albums since the latter is favorite among the youngsters : the potential foodies.

this place was like on the must visit list for sometime, visited it a week back. The location is pretty good near to BHS and the place has ample seating inside and in open air.

Ambience, It looks like a chemistry lab as the name suggests with the bulbs and the smoke which comes while they mix no2 to make the ice cream.

Pricing, its decent worth for the newness and they are not slicing throats at all.

Menu, the selection is limited but al they serve is good and trust me the process of making the fresh ice cream in front of your eyes, will steal the show.

There is nothing much i can write about it, you need to experience it yourself, just get in there lab and get the experiment.

Beat the Kolkata heat with chilling liquid nitrogen ice cream prepared instantly. I tries Nutella and fudge brownie. Nutella nailed it. It was like having a spoonful of sinful Nutella I'm every bite. It was damn delicious, creamy and heavenly!! However fudge brownie was disappointing. It was bland, not sweet at all and little better. The frozen fudge was tasteless and brownie was no where. Nutella made up for it. Eager to try other flavors when IL be in Kolkata. Good concept, something new.. Little pricey but worth a visit.

I finally got a chance to visit Mumbles with my family and we were amazed seeing the new concept of liquid nitrogen ice-cream. Whatever we ordered was made infront of us instantly so that you know that the use of preservatives are out of question! The ice creams remain frozen for a longer period of time. We ordered varied favours but the top picks were butterscotch and orange caramel. ¬†The best part about them is that this is one of those few hangout places open till midnight in this city. I love this cozy place and would definitely recommend to go there with family and friends.

Visited today in this super hot and humid weather to cool myself down. Very cutely done. The decor is minimalistic and pretty. They are having a promotion that if you follow them in instagram or give a check in fb you get a free topping. I selected the strawberry flavour where as my friend took the fudge brownie flavour. Although I had thought the fudge flavour would be better but it turned out my strawberry flavor was much more delicious. It looks really nice when they add the liquid nitrogen. Felt like Heston Blumenthal's lab for a bit. :-D The ice-cream were smoothly made. No lumps were there. The fudge brownie tasted a little watery but the strawberry one was yum. I took mine with red velvet topping and the fudge one was with chocolate sticks. Regular strawberry is priced are 130 a cup and the fudge brownie was 160. Both are AI price. Overall a good experience but just because of seeing the ice cream being made infront. Right now they only have the basic flavours with few twists. I am guessing with time the flavours will increase.

We finally have a place where we can sit and enjoy ice creams. The place is done up really well. The ice creams are really good from the texture to the freshness of the ice cream. Tried the Nutella , ginger honey basil and thandai. All the flavours tasted great. The portion size is huge and totally worth the price  . Must visit for all ice cream lovers.

I am absolutely privileged to debut my review on Zomato with Mumble's Lab. From the onset I was very excited for the concept coming to the city after trying LN2 ice-cream at Bombay's Nice Kream and Cyber Hub's Cherry Comet. Although both these places have variety to order from its menu but ML's ice cream stands out for its softness and flavour. I was entrancing from the very moment I had my first taste of Orange Caramel which is the best flavour on offer. Delighted as I was I also ordered a Nutella scoop which was as good.

The ambiance was pristine and the seating comfortable. I was also lucky enough to congratulate the hegemony at Mumble's in person who told that they were already understanding the pulse of the city and would be expanding their menu very soon. I would recommend this place for all you guys with a sweet tooth with my eyes closed.

One word: MAGICAL. The whole experience is just too good to pass. I would recommend the Nutella for all chocolate lovers and the orange caramel for those who crave the orange-chocolate bites from M&S UK.

While looking forward to the first nitrogen ice cream parlor, the place came off as disappointing and not attractive in first look. While the presentation and ambience is very good, the lighting kind of dimmed it. (Maybe try going in afternoon or morning). We were 3 of us so decided to treat ourselves with three flavours. Chocolate brownie,vanilla and butterscotch in order of preference with toppings interestingly choco chips,red velvet and gems respectively. The making with nitrogen fumes make you wonder but tasting makes you a little disappointed. Chocolate and vanilla were not at all soothing. The best came out to be butterscotch with gems. Being so sweet that we wanted to save it for the last.
A little tip: before you enter there is a bulletin board with lots of comments, please check that and accordingly choose. Since the best will be usually the best. I give you butterscotch. But must visit once to explore others flavours too. :)

Limited flavors to choose from but the ice-cream surely is a treat to have. With Kolkata's first Liquid Nitrogen Ice-Cream parlour they can surely work on getting more flavors to give their customers a variation to choose from.Recommended: Fudge Brownie & Roasted Almond

Visited there twice....its a  neat and clean ice cream parlour with a seating arrangement of about 20 people..they have a self service counter...with 3 machines which blends liquid nitrogen and the ice cream...have ordered nutella without any toppings....from the very first bite till the last...the taste was mesmerizing...felt like having nutella itself...the thickness and the quantity of the ice cream is worth mentioning.. :) this 1st visit made me visit there for the second time to try their holi speciality thandai flavour ice cream....that also i ordered without toppings...but it came already with toppings which definitely a glass of thandai has minus the bhaang part...even this tasted great...there is something different..a good different...in their ice cream that makes u want to have more and moreüòõ...would definitely like to visit again..

Oh my god! üòç I just loved this place!! 
I will definitely have to come back here to try everything out.  They have a limited options but it's very unique.  The place is so cool. The staff were friendly enough.  And what's the best thing?  Their playlist! My favourites -coldplay and Tom Odell -were onüòÑ.  Just check this place out.  It actually tastes better than the regular ice creams.  We tried their brownie fudge with red velvet toppings,  choco chips and hershys syrup.  Heaven üòÑ
The prices are average and the locale is awesome.

Have to work hard all the best.

I'll say this the process of how they make the ice cream is itself amazing. Using liquid nitrogen they make fresh ice cream. I love it and definitely visit this place again.

I was really excited that Liquid Nitrogen finally made its way to Calcutta. And this place did not disappoint. Incredible taste. Though the flavour options were few, I guess it'll just grow as soon as they build a good customer base.

Nutella with brownie add ons is a must try.

Decorated like a lab and pretty drawings and comic strips on the walls , has a very different setting altogether.
I had the strawberry ice cream with toppings of red velvet and some dry fruits.
The taste was a little different but not so great!
One regular cup costed me more than I thought.

This is a new outlet in town, this was my first visit and i was amazed.

The decor is very bright and innovative; took me to a flashback of my school days inside the  chemistry lab diff is tht here it was more possitive and colourful.

Icecreams were unique and diff and also the story of Mumble behind the icecream. Thy hv a nice range of topings. I tried chocolate icecream wth choco chips plus a rose almond wth marshmallow...
I will try th other available flavours and also hope to see some more addition in the menu.

Ice cream in winter may not be approved by our elders, but it has its own appeal all the same. After reading about this place in my favourite newspaper, T2 by The Telegraph, I decided to give it a try with my sister.

The place is very easy to locate, in the vicinity of Birla High School for boys. The ambience is very warm and soothing, even the ceiling justifies the name. I especially loved the way they placed the menu, too cool!!üòÅ

Now coming to our order, you can choose your ice cream from a myriad of options and same goes for toppings too. We ordered one Nutella topped with marshmallows and one Orange Caramel topped with red velvet.
The taste is better than the best I had till date. The ice cream smoothly melts in your mouth, making you feel like the layers of the ice cream actually peel off like an onion. Although, I liked Nutella flavoured more, It's reasonably priced and I know for sure that I will be drawn to this lab whenever I'm in the area.

Visited this place. High on the pocket, ice creams, good enough. A place for college goers, with good staff. This place has gloomed after a number of years. Something different!
