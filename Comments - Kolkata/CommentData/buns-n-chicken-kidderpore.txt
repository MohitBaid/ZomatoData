I ordered a Crispy Chicken Burger which is a good snack item at just Rs.40. The filling is crisp and moist. Chicken is succulent. Tastes quite good.

Its a surprise package. Burger and Shawarma my personal favorite. Its a value for money. Want a break from KFCs and McDonalds, this is a good choice. You will not regret it.

Please visit it once. U will forget KFC. What u get here for 200 will cost 500 in KFC. And taste wise its far far better. Chicken wings and fried chicken burger. Have a try

Taste wise bang on tasty,the burger here is vry tasty,it is tastier than KFC or Mcd burgers,tge chicken burger has a lot of cheese at an unbelievably low price @ just RS 50,the shawarma is the third best item served here which is again delicious,the crispy fried chicken and chicken popcorn is yummy,can giv a tough completion to KFC.Just 5 min walking distance from my house,drawback is that it does not have seating arrangement.

Great Food
Unbelievably low price

Chicken Burger was AwesomeÂ 
Crispy Fried Chicken is better than KFC believe me, you will have to taste it to believe itÂ 
Shawarma was yummy & i don't think you will get Chicken Shawarma anywhere in Kolkata @ Rs 60/- Â and that too so tasty. Â 
A Must Visit For Chicken Lovers
