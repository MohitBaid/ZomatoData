Located in the heart of Zakaria Street, also known as Coolootola by the locals, this hidden gem is famous for various dishes for example Dal Gosht, Liver Curry and their Beef Tehri (only Monday). But one dish which completely stands out is their winter specialty the Beef Nihari. It is available only during the winters, for 2.5 months. The consumption of Nihari keeps the body warm during the cold weather. 

Coming to the taste, the food served here has a homely taste to it. The ambience is not that great but the finger licking good food compensates for that. The rich Nihari has a royal taste. Thick gravy, with strong flavours of masala and tender piece of a huge chunk of beef. One portion is quite big and 2 people can eat from it. They have a parcel system. But be careful because they start serving the Nihari at 5am and by 6am there is a high chance that it will be over. So reach there before time.

I am looking forward to visit them again.

What an adventue it was to land at Sufia at 5:30am to taste the much talked about Beef Nihari and Dalpuri. I expected the place to be empty at this time but it was having a buzz which no restaurant can have even during festivals. There were minimum 250+ containers ready with Dalpuri and Beef Nihari to get parcelled at different corner of the city. The place had a waiting que at such an wee hour. We had to wait for 15min before we got our table. We ordered Beef Nihari and Dalpuri and added Mutton Paya too. And the yummylicious taste answered all my questions regarding such a buzz and more. The beef was so well cooked that it came out as strings just by digging slightly with a spoon. The gravy tasted heavenly with some lime juice was added to it. The Mutton Paya was nice. What stood out was the freshly made Dalpuri,crisp, perfectly spiced.. delicious to the core. Will visit soon for a taste of the authentic Nihari.

We mad foodies! It was 28th Dec, we woke up at 4am in the morning, became ready for our journey. All foodies met at Mohammad Ali park at 5’o clock in the morning, then started heading straight towards Sufia in the deserted lanes at night.

If it doesn’t seems unnatural to you, Let me tell you we’re Night Owls. We go to bed at 3’o clock, So 5’o clock is deep night for us. Okey!

Now why we sacrificed our lovely sleep under the blanket in this winter morning?

Well, from last 3 years I was planning to visit this place. But the one and only problem was that, this place serves their most famous dish Nihari and Puri in winter only, that also from 4am and that become out of stock before the clock’s hour hand touches 6.

The road was dark and silent, we started walking straight. Suddenly after few minutes the white light coming from this restaurant made my eyes wide open. I realised somehow we 4 had reached the place by following Google Maps. Surprisingly the city was wide awake in front of the restaurant.

It was damm crowded, we talked with the person sitting in front of the restaurant on cash desk. He very formally replied us in English to wait and he will call us when sit for 4 will be available. I took out my Nikon at the mean time and started clicking pictures of this place.

I noticed hundreds of steel containers was their and an old man was filling those with red spicy gravy of Nihari from a big handi. Meat pieces were kept beside that handi on a huge plate. When we asked what was that, they replied, those are orders to be delivered.

Finally we got our sit for 4 sharing a table. Unlike most of the Muslim hotels this place was very neat and clean. A simple straight dining, metal tables and chairs are spread on two sides. Their service was fast and after taking the order they served us within few minutes.

NIHARI AND DALPURI @ Rs.140 (4.9/5) :
------------------------------------------------------
A red spicy thin curry was served on a plate with coriander on top of it for garnishing and a piece of meat was peeping under it. This dish was the result for sacrificing our sleep. Oh! God this looked hot and tasted even hotter while I took a spoon of it. The gravy was so rich, spicy and flavourful that you can’t stop yourself to have the full dish of it.

Beef piece was solid and of best quality. It was cooked so well that even every cell of it can be divided with a minimum effort of spoon. It was that soft that just melted in my mouth with some wonderful flavours in it. Undoubtedly it was the best beef I’ve tried till date. Don’t know about you but I became a fan of this meat.

This were the best quality of Dalpuri I’ve ever tried in Kolkata. It was thick and after tearing it off thick pulse pouring fall apart from it on the plate. There was 4 pieces on a plate and this kind of quality is hard to get nowadays. Taste wise it was as pure and great as it looked from inside and with Nihari it was mind blowing. Also this dish was enough that made our tummy full at early morning. 

MUTTON PAYA AND TANDOORI ROTI @ Rs.80 (4/5) : 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Now those people take religion seriously and have problem eating beef can have Mutton Paya over here. The best part is gravy of Mutton Paya is the same as Nihari, so you can enjoy each and every bit of their most famous dish with your favourite Mutton. But frankly speaking raw smell of mutton flesh was coming from the Mutton felt bit disgusting to me. Also the paya piece that was served was having very less flesh in it where mostly it was mutton fat. They still need to know how to cook mutton properly.

Tandoori Roti was made very prominently even without any burning flavour or mark on it. This Tandoori Roti was extremely soft and tasted brilliant unlike other places where tandoori is served crispy and hard, sometimes a piece of rubber.

MUTTON TAMATER STEW @ Rs.100 (4/5):
------------------------------------------------------
It wasn’t traditional stew where Mutton and vegetables are boiled and served with white soup of it. It was something with the richness of their kind of food and sweet taste. It was mainly made of mashed tomatoes and onions, those gave it a distinct taste of sweetness with lots of rich spices that made it look just mouth watering. Mutton piece in it was better than paya and this dish was quite enjoyable with Tandoori Roti.

Pricing :
---------------------------------
Rs.140 for beef item felt quite unusual to me as the area where beef is the cheapest meat available in market. But what shocked me was the prices of Mutton dishes that was priced below beef dishes at Rs.100 and Rs.80. Where Mutton is one of the most expensive meat available in Kolkata for Rs.500-580 per Kg. Puri costs Rs.5 per piece. It seemed that they’re purely taking advantage of their popularity of Beef Nihari.

Final Words :
---------------------------------
This is the richest breakfast available in town. It was one of the best food journey till date of my life. Prove that you are a true foodie, show your madness towards foods, it was our moto and today we all proved it.

Early winter morning is the perfect time to visit this restaurant. Yes, you need to sacrifice your sleep and visit this place. Me and my friends gathered in the early chilly winter morning mainly to have Nihari. As we have heard about its famous Nihari, its difficult to wait long for such foodies like us. As the place is famous for its beef nihari, I was reluctant to go as am not a beef eater. Nevertheless I went there to try some mutton items and wished that mutton nihari may available for my early morning breakfast.
                    

As we reached there we were surprised to see such crowd in that early morning. Its obvious that winter is a time to sleep well. If you won’t visit this place it will be difficult for you to believe that people are so enthusiastic to have those beef nihari in the early morning. The people are craving for this special item. The main part is that you will get this nihari only in winter. Numerous tiffin cans were there. As we asked the owner about this he told that those cans are kept for advance order done by the customers for Beef Nihari
.

The location is quite simple. Its just adjacent to Nakhoda Masjid of Barabazar, Kolkata near chitpur road. Don’t expect any ambience but the crowdy thing in the early morning will surprise you with some feeling.

As I asked if there is any mutton dish available or not, the service boy told that mutton stew and mutton paya is available. So I decided to go for mutton paya and my friends for as usual beef nihari.

Puri (5/5)- Made of maida and its so crispy and tasty that you will have it without any side dish. In a plate they will serve you four pieces. The price is ₹5 per piece ie ₹ 20 a plate.

Mutton Paya(3.5/5) – The gravy was same as of beef nihari but they wont mix it. Beef and mutton are kept separately with gravy separately too. The cooked mutton and beef are kept separately and as per your order they mix the gravy into it. The gravy was too light and tasty. Loved it but I need to order mutton stew as mutton paya piece doesn’t have any flesh in it.

Mutton Stew (2.5/5)- The mutton piece was moderate not that of good quality as the beef, heard from my friends. They were happy to have those beef for its taste and quality, but disappointed me for this mutton pieces. The gravy was also not that great. It was made mixing tomatoes and crushed onions. The preparation was sweet enough as tomatoes and onions itself have some sweetness in it.
                                          ...

Located in the heart of Zakaria Street also known as Colootola by the localites. This place is famous only for one dish and that is the Beef Nihari. But Mind you this dish is only available in winter because it is believed that its consumption keeps you warm. So its specially for winter. The Beef Nihari is available throughout winter from 5 am and its finished by 6am. So my advise is if anyone wants to try this dish, you@ need to be their before 5am😝
Talking about the food once you take your first bite of nihari which is specially eaten with pea puri or tandoori roti you will realise all this waking up at 5am and waiting to have Nihari was worth it. 
The Nihari is very delicious and they have maintained their quality and the beef is so tender that it melts in your mouth. 
Looking forward to visiting them again.

Not good ... Roaming around due to some work ... Suddenly my craving for beef drove me towards sufia ... But the experience was shitty ... They are neither polite nor welcoming in attitude ... I was visited there around 6 pm but Biryani was not available there ... My suggestion is please visit the Bombay hotel if you are around this zone ... But I have heard of NIHARI ... Want to try it another day ..

It's a 5 minute walk from central metro station, gate no. 5, located right opposite to the nakhoda masjid. 
The ambience is one star.
Coming to the food 
The beef bhuna is literally an explosion of delicious flavors complementing the tender meat. The quantity was very low.
The Roti's were rubbery
The shammi kebab was average
And the firni was heavenly
Overall a must visit for beef lovers.

This is located just opposite to Nakhoda Masjid or Bari masjid. About the Niharis "Oh my god" just amazing. I have tried their tandoori roti as well as dal Puri and both of them complements the Nihari. If you are not into beef try mutton stew. But the only challenge is that it is available during winters and that too early morning at 5. But early morning treat will make you fall in love.

Above everything,this is a place where no one compromises with taste and quality.Had their mutton tomato (Tammatar!)stew and beef bhuna.In one word wonderful.And I must not forget to mention their dalpuris(deep fried breads filled with smashed lentils and peas).There are scarce places for parking.But one gourmet must not care for that and rush hungry to this eatery to experience unadulterated mughlai delicacies.

No injustice if I call this a hidden legend of Kolkata. Visited tgis joint today. Small and simple place. The road in front of it is not clean but the inside is clean. I visited the place specifically hearing a lot about Beef Nehari. I had it today - a full plate with two tandoori rotis. Meat at its best! Super tender it was and it just melted in mouth! Taste was heavenly. It is not a fine dining restaurant but the food is of supreme quality without any bit of compromise. Only problem is - Nehari is available only in early morning and the stock finishes up by 6:30 AM. Sundays are too much crowded and I would not recommend to visit on Sundays.
It is a must visit for all the meat lovers. As Roasted Chili Pork @ Tibetan Delight, as Dab Sarbat @ Paramount, so as Beef Nehari @ Sufia. Wish Sufia goes on serving this outstanding delicacy to all food lover in the city.

The worst nehari I had till date. And the price was too high that a middle class family will also think to buy or not. 120 rupees per plate. They are just exploiting the customers. In Uttar Pradesh districts near delhi you will find awsome nehari in just 50 rupees. First time had nehari in kolkata and it was worst. Other things in sufia is best like beef bhuna, chicken korma and all but their nehari is worst. Full money got wasted.

A very no frills/ no nonsense eatery where I got to taste the most tender beef I've had in Kolkata. They do not entertain to go orders because a lot of working class people come to eat here so Its a very community mentality, which I felt was very nice simply because the waiter gave me a reason with so much patience as to why it isn't possible. Now, coming to the food, the beef nihari was had along with the most awesome tandoori rotis, that came out fresh and piping hot from the tandoor. The nihari itself was an oily bowl of awesomeness. The meat was dug into with a teaspoon and it was the most tender piece of meat there was. A spoon of gravy went down my throat and the warmth and soothing sensation that was felt was heavenly. The rotis were nice and moistly fluffy to the extent that the gravy that was left was all soaked up by the spongelike fluff. After finishing your gravy, the waiter comes and patiently throws in another extra helping of the soothing gravy and asks you if you'd like more roti which arrives on your plate in the blink of an eye. Seating is communal. No such idea of you having the table all to yourself. If you are two people, then expect the other 3 empty seats to be filled up with random strangers which is quite an experience in the most positive way. I would  definitely visit this place again. Big Thumbs up!

I have long been an early riser. And sadly, it's also been very long since I have seen early morning in the recent past!! Well, I guess I am being aged silently!! Phew!!

Now, being aged has a few advantages as well. The taste buds get refined and selective - both in metaphorical and realistic ways!!
So, after making it to the Maidan few times with my friends and a football, the early morning jitter was now gone. And I was ready to walk in to Sufia to taste the legendary Nihari!

I woke up at 4 am, got out of my house at 4:30 when the only living ones on the roads were the street dogs who have an age-old habit of barking at anyone who doesn't look like them!! Believe me, I am going to taste Nihari, not for a secret government mission!

I will skip the part between this point and when I reached Sufia - I will tell you why, later.
But when I reached Sufia, it was around 6 in the morning, and trust me, the eatery was swarming with people - eating Nihari, or waiting for that!!
When I got a table, err, a chair, I ordered a plate of that Nectar, and a tandoori roti.

Trust me, when the dish arrived in front of me, and I touched the meat with the spoon, it just split with a soft swoosh - I have never ever seen a meat cooked in such a soft manner!! And then I put one piece of that meat into my eagerly waiting mouth - and boom!!
It just exploded inside my mouth, a burst of flavours, a layer of creamy softness, and everything else - the dirty tables, messy ambience, crowded tables - dissolved!!
I was in the Wonderland!!

I have heard that it takes approximately 14 hours to cook this dish!! Now I know why!!

Note - for the skipped part in between, and more, please read this blog by

Well well well !! Nehaariiiii is all i have to say about.. 
Heard about Sufia's Nehari frm many people and lately in Telegraph T2 saw in one article about it. Decided that time only that lets give it a try.. 
So went there in the morning of January 1st around 4 30a.m. and to my surprise we didn't get a seat inside which holds maybe maximum 40 - 50 peoples and on the other hand saw huge crowd for take away. 
Waited till the first Namaz after which they start serving and after a wait of half an hour got our share.. 
It was sooooo much delicious... The meat was soo much tender and they give a good amount of Beef in it and it was perfect with the puri.. 
After having it i can really say that yeah in Telegraph they mentioned the Nehari as "Legendary" and they are perfectly correct..

I visited Sufia after a long time in a saturday morning at 5:45 am for the famous Nihari. I found the quality is just the same. Had a Nihari and fresh baked rotis. The guy who was serving at this table quickly ask you about your choice. There are not much choices here. You have to choose between Daalpuris or Tandoori Rotis. Both are good. My personal choice is roti, since the Daalpuri would be too heavy for a man of my age, with Nihari. Now, what is that? “Nihari”, a word almost unknown to “Bengali Gentlemen” of this city, but widely known and popular throughout  Northern India and Pakistan. It is a medium spicy meat stew, cooked for prolonged hours on a low heat (I heard they cook it for 14 hours to derive that taste). A considerable portion of Northern India and Pakistan live the day with Nihari. It is very popular even in Bangladesh. There it is coming. After you order for it, it hardly takes a minute or two to get the big bowl. It is a thick brownish yellow aromatic stew, garnished with chopped coriander leaves and quarter of a lemon. Now, here is the catch. Usually Mughlai dishes are not served with so much chopped coriander leaves and lemon. This is a typical Punjabi kind of a serving style. But as I told you, this dish is for the sturdy working class people. It lacks the sophistication and fancy spice balance. Hence, they` manage it with the garnishing. But believe me, the end product is something splendid. The Rotis are excellent here. I would say, they are better than many of the fancy restaurant the city. It just takes a few seconds (Yes, seconds, not minutes) for the Rotis to come out of the oven and land in your plate. They are perfectly baked, yet nowhere charred. The outer crust is slightly crispy, and are very soft and moist inside.  Squeeze the lemon and add few drops to the stew. Take the spoon, and just touch the pieces of meat in the stew. The tenderness of the legendary Nihari meat will reveal itself to you. It will split. Amazing tender and soft. Bring one piece of meat from the stew to your plate, tear the roti, and wrap it onto some meat, smear with the stew and put it in your mouth. You can feel thousand years of Indian culinary history bursting inside. The meat is tender soft, kind of a creamy milky textured. The stew has the perfect balance of spices. Coriander and lemon has added some rustic edge to the taste. This is not the dish for the Nawabs. This is the dish which runs India. The meat is not the rich man’s mutton. Rather, it is what they called “Badaa Gosht”. Literally means the big meat. In a word, it is beef. The meat with a very low price tag. If you have a taboo  for beef,  this is not a place for you. But if you want to be driven only by taste, you must have it at least once in your lifetime.

Everyone, who knows this city, will agree that Calcutta winters have shrunk a lot. Its no more a November to February affair with early morning fog, bright jackets and endless beef. But some places continue to show their loyalty to these four months. Winter for them is November to February, winter for them are the early mornings and winter for them is the Nihari!

So I have heard a lot of good things about the Nihari and Daalpuri of this place from a friend for years now but could never get people to accompany me to travel 15/20Kms and have breakfast at 4am in the morning. 
Finally on 3rd January being over excited we reached here at 4am ie. an hour before the shop opens on weekdays. People started gathering outside and the shop opened dot at 5am and we went inside.
On 1st look, the shop is too small, broken chairs, greasy tables. But even if you are disgusted with the interiors, the aroma of the whole place wont let you leave.
The food came within 3/4mins of ordering. We ordered Nihari, Daalpuri and finished with a cup of tea.
The daalpuri was ok. But the Nihari was out of this world. The meat is sooo tender n buttery, it just melts in your mouth. The stew has the right spices and consistency. 
This is one of those foods for which the word #foodgasm had been coined... :D

Only recommended for Nihari. Not recommended more than once a month due to the massive cholesterol content of this dish. :)

I had heard good things about the nihari and the beef in general at Sufia.One fine evening when I had a beef craving my friend and I decided to try this place located bang opposite the famous Nakhoda mosque.

We were not expecting to get the nihari at that time of the day but we were utterly disappointed and frustrated to hear that none of the beef preparations would be available except for a few cold beef shami kebabs.The kebabs tasted like okay but then they were cold.They would probably taste good when hot.

We also sampled the roti and the mutton bhuna and the phirni.The rotis were nice,soft and fresh.The size of the rotis were larger than the ones you get elsewhere.The mutton bhuna was tasty but the mutton was only decently cooked.The phirni was pretty average.

The ambience was almost non existent.But the place was cleaner than what I expected and the staff were surprisingly nice and friendly.The prices are quite cheap.

Overall we had only an okayish experience.The real charm of this place undoubtedly lies in its beef which I hope to get to taste eventually.And I hope then I can improve my rating for Sufia.

I was totally blown away. Early in the morning (read really early) I was simply blown away. I rate this place a 4 out of 5 only because of its food. I have had nihari before, in three or four places in Kolkata but never quite got around to Sufia. I am now glad that I have finally had it from here. 
I always had heard from fellow foodies that the nihari in Sufia is the best. Now, I can understand why they kept saying so. The soupy-stewy curry tastes rich and spicy and I just kept sipping it from a spoon just by itself after squeezing in a bit of lime and sprinkling a few coriander leaves. The rotis are nice and fluffy and it seemed to me as if these rotis were invented only to be paired with the nihari. 

The servicing was quite efficient and quick not just at our tables but also at the others ones and at the take away counter which was visible from our table. I won't say that the ambiance was poor because in places like this there is a different sort of an ambiance which I really enjoy. It reminds me of the winter while I am eating a hot and spicy and really good meal and sweating all the while. I quite enjoy the prospect of interacting with a complete stranger and hearing his take on the food.

On the whole a brilliant experience and definitely worth going back at 05:45 in the morning.

If you're looking for ambience, cleanliness or any other qualities that are required to be met for you to qualify a place as a restaurant- then this is not it. On the contrary if you want the best nihari and dal puri in town, then Sufia has struck serendipity. Yea, nobody can beat their spicy preparation of the nihari. 
This place is not for the weak-tongued.

i beg to differ with other fellow foodies over the review of this eatery..my experience(yesterday) with this place was very bad..

ambiance.not that i expected a sparkling interiors,but the place is DIRTY...the plates are greasy..the tables are rickety..
the waiters smell of bidis..they have failed to aintain a minimum level of cleanliness by miles..
 coming to food..the beef bhuna was chewy and tough..and had a weird smell in it..i suspect whether it was actually beef or not..

the mutton keema was like some large teaspoons of minced meat submerged in a plate of oil...and it tasted bitter..

the rotis were ok...

maybe the beef nihari that it serves in winters is good..but it is certainly not the case with its regular meal..

in a nutshell ..advice to all AVOID the place..if you are craving for good old fashioned mughlai food walk toward royal hotel( barely 100 mts distance) which is far better .

hope at leastsomeone  benefits from my experience

Obviously the only restaurant to sell the best Nihari in Kolkata or anywhere. Being a Muslim we wait for the whole year for winter just to have Sufia's rich Nehari. I remember as a child we use to wake up in the morning hearing morning ( fajr ) azaan and would rush to Sofia to have their Nehari , and you wouldn't get it after 8am.. Try their Nehari with their Daal Puri u won't get that taste anywhere else. Feeling so happy just reviewing their Nehari.. ;)

My friends and I dropped in at Sufia for at around one. The place is pretty neat and clean ( we had not expected that ) but it can be bit of a hassle reaching it if you cannot navigate congested lanes. 
The options are pretty limited here if you don't have beef. We opted for mutton keema and rotis. The mutton keema was nicely made with pieces of liver thrown in. Not too oily or hot and tasty. it went well with the rotis (larger than what you have at home) which were served hot. The pricing is pretty standard and won't pinch your pocket.
Overall a pretty good experience but there is no point of going to this place if you don't have beef.
Some other day...

If your a lover of non-vegetarian food and like Nihari and you have not eaten at Sufia you have missed out , this dish is made only in the winters and is the specialty of this establishment. Nihari has its origin in Delhi and is a dish that is pretty much exclusive to the sub-continent. Fulfilling , high in protein and rich it is usually partaken only in the cooler months and most often as a breakfast dish. It is prepared with either beef or mutton and Sufiya serves up a beef version. If you want to eat tender juicy succulent beef falling off the bone with a fatty deliciously sinful gravy then you cannot afford to miss out on this. I make it a point to visit atleast once every winter and the delightful warmth of this dish lingers on your tastebuds. Order yourself a plate of Nihari ... make sure its served piping hot , order the lovely tandoori roti's and lots of lemon just get lost in the wonderful food. I can guarantee you feel feel transported to Foodie Heaven. I have tried to Beef Bhuna and the Tikya as well and they are nice but if you compare them with Nihari then they are outclassed. Fresh delicious filling and pocket friendly .... can't ask for more than that !

Sufia has been serving good food for a long period of time. This place has a great strategic importance. It is just located opposite of the famous Nakhoda Mosque, which is a tourist attraction. 
Their signature dish is the Beef Nihari. As it is slow cooked over night which makes the meat very soft and tender. The meat is so soft that it will melt in your mouth very quickly. And the Nihari flavors does the rest making the dish irresistible. Its best enjoyed with the tandoori roti though many people prefer hot puri. Nihari is generally very heavy and so it is availed during the winters. People who order this dish places their utensils as early as 4:00 am in the morning. And believe me it is over maximum by 7, if you are very lucky. Enjoying steamy hot nihari on a winter morning is absolutely blissful. Honestly the experience is awesome. Their beef bhuna is also decent. 
If you are an ambiance freak then this is not your place. Mornings are generally crowded and it might be uncomfortable as people might be standing in a queue right beside your table gazing on the delights.

As a born calcuttan and die hard foodie, I must say that most mughali resturants in Kolkata are not famous for wholesome experience.It is about their specialty about some specific dishes which makes them stand out.Like if you wish to have Nehari in winter then I will recommend Sufia..finest Nehari you will get here.

I love Sufiya. In fact, the photos in the Zomato site were taken from my blog, Presented by P, where I reviewed the place a while back. I really don't want the pictures taken down, however. I am quite happy to see Zomato taking suggestions of fellow Kolkatans. 

This place makes. The best. Beef Nihari. I have. Eaten. In. My. LIFE. And I have eaten a lot of that, I daresay. However, how about this --- soft, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of beef cooked in a thin and tasty gravy and served with some coriander, chillies and lime on the side?

In short, I love Sufiya. It is not just a place, but a part of my heritage.

Places like Sufia are hard to rate. On one side they should get a 4-5 star for food and on the other side will score poorly for the ambiance and hygiene. So if you take the last two points seriously this is not a place for you.  

Sufia is a favourite place for the beef lovers of Calcutta. Located opposite the Nakhoda Masjid (Bara Masjid) in Chitpore. 

Positives

Famous for Beef Haleem (during Ramzaan) and Beef Nihari (November - February). Haleem is served from 4PM. During winter the Nihari is served from 5 AM and its better to visit before 6:30 AM. Spicy Nihari with fresh Tandoori rotis are heavenly on winter mornings. The Beef Paya and Puris are also popular. Firni is delicious.

Negatives

Ambiance and hygiene are big negatives. Its always better to pack and bring the food home.
