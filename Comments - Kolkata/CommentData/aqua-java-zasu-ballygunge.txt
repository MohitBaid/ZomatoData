It's a really nice place to chill and offers board games. But my last few visits have been disappointing because of the deteriorating food quality.

The only place in Ballygunge which had availability for 4 at 11 pm. That kind of says something. Had heard a lot about this place, but it turned out to be overrated. The shisha was fine, but the decor of the place needs a check. Wouldn't really recommended to a friend, since there are many more hookah places, cheaper and better than this in and near Ballygunge itself.

The decoration of the place and the ambience was very good. The staff were also very friendly, but the overpriced food was a disappointment. Though the food quality was quite good, still the price was too much. We ordered 3 cold coffees and it costed approximately 600 inclusive of taxes.

Went here for a date with a friend. A cost casual place to hangout. Best thing was the Pool game we played. It was so much funnn. üòçüòç
Was badly craving for pizza margherita and mixed sauce penne pasta. Both was good.  Not a hookah lover. So no idea about that. 
The lemon ginger mojito was yummmmm. Gotta try.

Went with group of cousins, at midnight. Ambience was soothing. Had a pool also to play with it. Parking is easy. Located on main road. Service was slow. They had also charged service charge, when already GST has been added, so we didnt understood why are they adding service charge to us, when govt. Has removed all other taxes. 
Food was delicious. We had ordered Tossed Mushrooms, Spiked Nachos, Chilli garlic fried rice, chef special Pizza. And in beverages Crunching Java, Mint Mojito, Peach ice tea, and green apple soda. As well as Shisha with it, which was smooth and dense. And lastly chocolate mud cake in deserts. All were damn good.

I had a cold coffee with mint and cookie, it was Fantastic, but it came to almost TWO HUNDRED RUPEES! It said "139" on the menu, so I thought - with tax and all, say.... 150? But when I got the bill, the base price was 149 - I told the guy, but he didn't appear to be fazed. And, that means, the tax was SIXTY...??!! ie. about half the cost of the coffee ITSELF??!! Hmm.....don't know who's at fault here - Modi/Mamata or AquaJava themselves, but....dal mein kuch kala hai :(¬†
I will never have this coffee at least, here again. As I said, it was Fantastic, but not worth 200 bucks. And, just to point out, shortly after that I had a biryani which I got on Nearbuy for 99/- If a whole BIRYANI can be had for 99 bucks, will anybody pay 200 just for a coffee??!! I don't think so. AquaJava will have to learn to compete in the marketplace. Well..... - they will NOW!!..... :)

I visited this place quite a few times as its nearby my place.  
Ambience is quite and calm.  Not something with a big hype. 
The food is average but not something i am big big fan of.
Hookah was nice though.  
According to me the place is littlr overpriced. 
Service was attentive and Friendly.

What a feel good place (incorrect expression but well that's how it is). Cello kebab, burnt garlic noodles, nachos and the hazelnut mocha are absolutely amazing. 
A typical day at Zasu basically means Uno/Deal, Hookah and beverages. Have played on the PS occasionally too. Pretty chill place, great ambience although the pocket pinch is a little too harsh I feel.

We had come on a Sunday evening..they were not having many patrons..we had an issue with the second hookah that we ordered.the flavour in the pipe was different from what we ordered.by mistake we puffed it back and water came out from the spout.after complaining several times the manager gautam mazumdar came and told us rudely that we would have to go for a fresh hookah which would be chargeable.the coffee was ok..food seemed stale..we used to frequent this place before aqua java took it over.the earlier staff was friendly unlike the waiters whom we encountered this time.we vowed never to go back again.would urge everyone to go to chai break instead..disgusting service and bad experience

I think the issue with this place is that they think they're the only such outlet, the service is horrible, the staff does not care whether you're there, you can call them a million times and they will only come when they feel like it.¬†

I mean all you guys serve, is substandard coffee and even worse hookah, these guys need a serious revamp of everything, hookah, food, and most importantly, service.

A very pleasant atmosphere is what made this place stand out. Not too pricey for an AJ . They even had games to be played on the roof top which was well thought of. Really liked the swing-chairs they had which was really fun and was great for the a nice click. We had ordered a penne alfredo , a veggie pizza, a kit kat shake and a cup of hot chocolate italiano. All were up to the mark and I really liked that they actually personalised the pasta with whatever we wished to be added to it. Will surely visit again.

If you have lot of time to waste . One should visit this place . No service at all . They take almost 30 mins to take an order and then same will be served to you in another 30 mins . If you make a complain to so called manager , he laughs and seems so busy that he is a manger of some international MNC , very disappointing place . Avoid

I recently visited Zasu and I have to admit that I love the place. They place the best music and they provide a variety of games like uno and cards and taboo. I love the hookah they serve, the pizza is delicious and I specially love the cold coffee. They make one of the most delicious cold coffees ever and the price  is also considerably pretty low. Love the place. Seating arrangements and interior is also very beautiful.

Right in my neighbourhood, so dropped in with a couple of friends in the evening . Very similar to the other hookah bar-cafe-lounges in terms of pricing . We ordered 3 chocolate shakes , which was surprisingly smooth and tasty. I'm giving points for the decor which I really liked. Spread over 3 floors , it's got a very homely feel to it. It's cosy ,and perfect for a hangout. Also, the terrace seating is a bonus.
