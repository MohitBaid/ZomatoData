A small restaurant near the Shyambazar Five point crossing. Tried their Chicken Chowmine. Quality was decent at a low price. They have small seating arrangement outside. They also make good momos. My friend had the momo and she liked it very much.

They are not only a road side Fast food center but a most loved one too at the Shyambazar 5 points crossing. Rather than Chowmien rolls they also serve some delicious momos. Had their chicken Momo Last Month with my friend and it was absolutely delicious with the taste. Thanks to
