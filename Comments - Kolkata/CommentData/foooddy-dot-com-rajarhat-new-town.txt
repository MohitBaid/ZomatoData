A horrible experience! Who pays money for food like that. The reviews were certainly misleading I must say. Ordered in Jeera Rice, Chicken Chettinad and Chicken Mughlai. Well the chicken items tasted the same. Gravy was too sweet, no flavor whatsoever. Chettinad or Mughlai you wouldn't know the difference. Never going back again!

Very bad quality food. Went for lunch and ordered chicken meal.It was 2 pm and i didn't expect a cold meal. All the food items were cold. And no taste at all. Price is reasonable.

Value for money and tasty & exactly this is how I would describe that home delivery service. We were tried Butter Kulcha, chicken nawabi, chicken kolapuri, paneer tikka butter masala, chicken noddles, sehezwan veg Manchurian......... 

I was totaly surprised to seeing the quantity and also comparrising the bill amount what I paid. The chicken nawabi was tasty. The chicken noddles couldn't finish a single plate for one person. The paneer tikka was nice so was the tikka masala. The trimendus dish for me was the sehezwan veg Manchurian, it was hot, full of flavours, yummmmmmy. 

People who are residing or working in new town area you guys are definitely try at here...........

Though I've not tasted their these delicious dishes but I'm sure those have to be the best. It's a pity I live TOLLYGUNGE , kol - 40. Will they ever give me a chance to have a bite to their food. Truly speaking, the Portion & price , are well ahead of others not only in Rajarhat, New Town but probably whole Kolkata. Yes, I must say, Lage Raho Bhailog ..... But one thing I must h'light, they don't have any Fish item in main course , I think they'll do the needful. I'm a Fish & Mutton lover, feel the pinch. Now, I like to know , will they deliver my order of foods to TOLLYGUNGE ? Though I must pay the delivery charges, even if the order is small as limited to Rs. 400.00-500.00 ? My no. 9432279605. / 9432289605. Fav. Reply is awaited pls.
