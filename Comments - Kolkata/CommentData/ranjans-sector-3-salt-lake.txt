This is a pocket friendly snacks cum dinner place, mainly with take away service. The non veg starters are good, but the main course is a little bland. If you donâ€™t want to spend much on snacks then this is the place for you offering good starter dishes.

This place is adjacent to my aunt's home. As a result, whenever I visit her, she orders home delivery from here. Both of us are fond of Chinese dishes. The mixed fried rice and chili chicken is a favourite. We have tasted it several times and would definitely recommend it.

Great experience.. Ordered chicken lolipop and schezwan style egg chicken fried rice for lunch today. They delivered within 30 minutes of ordering... The quantity of the fried rice was huge, taste was yummy too... Chicken lolipop had gravy which goes really well with the fried rice. Large quantity of tasty food with a pocket friendly budget..

Was looking for a place that delivers food at affordable prices, and stumbled upon Ranjan's while scrolling through Zomato.
Ordered the Paneer Cutlet and Paneer Roll.
Delivery speed is good.
The cutlet was very tasty, while the roll was not bad either.
Can be given a try!

Placed orders like four times. And it gets delivered after 1 hour of the scheduled time. When you call the restaurant they say the delivery guy has left with 3/4 orders so he'll reach you. Why should I wait as it is the EDT Is always 1hour after placing order. And then you wait another extra hour. They should just stop delivering. Ineffecient delivery team.

This is a pretty small place in Sector 3 but the food they serve is by no means small. A well known outlet for quality food at extremely affordable prices, Ranjan's is quite the deal. 

I ordered for Chicken Schezwan noodles, Egg noodles, Chicken Schezwan, and Chicken Chilly. First of all, the quantity was enormous. I ordered all this food keeping two people in mind but in hindsight, now I think that it was probably enough for upto four people. 

The noodles itself aren't something special. Sure, they taste great but there is nothing that separates them from noodles elsewhere in the city. The chicken preparations were quite good. The Schezwan chicken was adequately spicy while the Chilly chicken had very tender pieces.

The food came in very well packaged containers. The price crunch wasn't too great. The food was delectable. What else could anyone want?

The quality was pretty decent and the quantity was adequate more so at the price at which the same was given. We loved the hot garlic chicken especially. Would definitely go back to this place using the service.

A big thank you to Zomato for helping me find this place. I had of course seen this place before but never had the courage to try them out. After reading positive reviews, we decided to try their chicken biriyani. The quantity is immense, they give you a big chicken piece and a smaller one and an additional egg. The rice is extremely flavorsome and quite filling. At 130 bucks, this one's quite a steal!

Well, both â€“ the Zomato search engine as well as Zomato delivery never fail to impress me â€“ and they did impress me a ton this time.

As usual, was on the look-out for some decent food, coupled with office delivery as well as reasonable prices â€“ and the Zomato search engine unveiled the Ranjanâ€™s to me! I immediately placed an order for a plate of mixed vegetables and Zomato delivery ensured that it was delivered within the stipulated timelines. I was charged quit a few extra bucks for packing as well as delivery, but in the end,  I felt that it was worth it!

In came the beauty â€“ the mixed veggie, nicely packed in an air tight plastic container â€“ a superb balance between huge varieties of vegetable â€“ peas, cottage cheese, yellow carrots, beans and what not! The spice laden gravy imparted a unique taste to this mix veg, which is difficult to describe on paper.

All was perfect until I realized that the quantum of oil in the mix veg was so much that they could have prepared 5 more main courses using them! Barring this, everything rocks and they are highly recommended for a dine-in!

Cheers!

Ranjan's is a surprise. Ordering in from this place, I was expecting to have a decent quantity of average food. What I received was large quantities of great food. It's unreal how cheap the restaurant is too.

At prices as low as 60 for a chicken cutlet, I would expect a bad attempt at cooking at best. It's amazing how good their food is actually. The fish fry was well made - sizeable amount of Bhetki with a good amount of coating. The Kebab Fry wasn't as fantastic as the fry, and this is because I was expecting larger pieces. The fry was good nevertheless.

I'm waiting on more. The quantity and quality for the price is unmatchable. Absolute gold.

We often order food from here and the food is pretty good for the price. The Veg chowmein (haka) is good and has been praised by many people who've tried it. We tried the Manchurian a few and it has a decent taste. We had egg roll once and did not like it at all. Give the Veg Chow a try if you're close by and need a quick bite.

food was really good. even the tadka went down well with us. the quantity was a bit less in the matter of tadka. but the star was chicken lollipop. it tasted supaaa-yumm. tangy..not too oily...not too spicy. perfect blend of spices and sauces. wot more to expect at the price of 65/-?? its pocket friendly. i am really impressed with their food and looking forward to taste their other items. as of now - RECOMMENDED.

This one is a small eatery serving both North Indian and Chinese. Since there is no seating, so a takeaway or maybe home delivery is the best option. At several occasions, I have tried both the cuisines they served and every time the Chinese impressed me more than the North indian. However, even the Chinese is nothing to boast of as the food tastes pretty ordinary. But with respect to the neighbourhood, this is the best option to satiate your hunger at a very low budget.

Situated beside the shop Mishras this place is more of a take way place rather than a place to sit and have some. The food I will not say is very good but ok. More of a place where you go if you have a bit of a pocket crunch. I ordered for roll out here the egg chicken kebab roll and the normal egg roll. The parathas of either of the rolls were cooked properly, as well as the egg part which was done also properly and not half cooked. Coming to the egg chicken roll, the chicken was also properly made and not a jawbreaker sort. Overall an ok place for all the pocket friendly, hungry people who just came by it all of a sudden........

My brother got a take-away from this place a couple of months back. Noodles with Chilli Chicken. The noodles were quite filling owing to the large quantity. However the flavor was kind of bland.

Ranjans are in existence from a pretty long time in sector 3 of Saltlake city which used to be my home some years back and have spent my childhood watching these restaurants coming up from a banner to a proper board .

Let's start from the initial period where only rolls where rocking in this place and tarka roti was also taken in full swing in the menu card , then after course of time Chinese dishes like noodles , chilli chicken etc were added and they were hot and lip smacking especially at night for dinner meals you really get a deal here.
Moving on well other Indian dishes came in to play giving a lot of options to eat or simply take away and not to forget the home delivery part which is free in the area.
Thats how it is like over here as they get strong this way in the food chapter of Saltlake area catering in and around for an affordable , fresh and tasty experience .

If you work in an area which does not have too many restaurant options in a 5 minute radius, Ranjan's is a dream come true for you. Their chicken chowmein and sweet garlic chicken has almost become our staple diet. The chowmein portion is big enough to fill three people to the brim. Not being big eaters, we usually order one plate for four people. The sweet garlic chicken is just perfect for our palates. If you are fond of spicy food however, you should opt for the hot garlic chicken. In evening snacks, their egg chicken roll deserves a special mention. If you like having your rolls without sauce, this is definitely the way to go. Their fried chicken, which consist of chicken strips in a slightly spicy coating, are also very tasty. I can not end this review without talking about their mutton biryani. If you have ordered the biryani for take out/home delivery, you are in for a pleasant surprise. The four corners of the box will hold 4 items: 2 pieces of mutton, one potato and one egg. The meat is soft, the amount of rice is enough to feed two, and the price tag is unbelievable!
Ranjan's does not have too much space for a sit down meal (only two tables), but if you live/work in the area, you should certainly order from them and I promise, you will be addicted.

This place is located quite close to my house and is quite famous in the neighbourhood for its rolls. It's mainly a takeaway joint with nominal seating arrangement out in the open.
I went there for dinner a few days back with my brother. 
We knew that their seating arrangement was not up to the mark but still decided to have our dinner there. No complaints about that.
Coming to the food , we had ordered crispy babycorn for starters; paneer butter masala dal makhani and lachha paratha for main course. As it was our first tryst with the place, we had no idea about their serving quantity. Well it was huge. Atleast 3 adults could easily eat out of one plate of any dish.
The babycorn was the worst I have ever had. The size of the babycorns were so big that eating it became a herculean task. Moreover the taste too was not good. It was floating in a sea of bland gravy which just had an oil spill. 
The main course was okayish , the paneer was a bit hard but the spices and gravy were up to the mark. 
Lachha paratha was all right . No fuss about that.
The dal makhani was okay. One thing that I found strange was that , they put makhana( Euryale ferox/lotus seed/Indian popcorn) in the daal. Just because the name is dal makhani doesn't mean you put makhana in it. Moreover makhani signifies the butter used in its preparation and the velvety texture of the dish.  So every time I took a bite something gummy came under my teeth which agitated me. Take the makhana out and the dal would be as good as served at many popular joints.
Coming to the price scenario , it was a bit expensive. I mean if you are ready to spend this much why not go to a proper restaurant and sit peacefully in an air conditioned room and order quality food.

i am a regular customer of this restaurant as i order through swiggy, i love their food quantity and quality also
i always refer this restaurant to my friends for party orders as it their food can be consumed in relish at casual parties.
their biryani tastes great and have no words for noodles, even their half plate hakka noodle quantity is a lot for a single consumption.
please maintain this.........!

If you work in an area which does not have too many restaurant options in a 5 minute radius, Ranjan's is a dream come true for you. Their chicken chowmein and sweet garlic chicken has almost become our staple diet. The chowmein portion is big enough to fill three people to the brim. Not being big eaters, we usually order one plate for four people. The sweet garlic chicken is just perfect for our palates. If you are fond of spicy food however, you should opt for the hot garlic chicken. In evening snacks, their egg chicken roll deserves a special mention. If you like having your rolls without sauce, this is definitely the way to go. Their fried chicken, which consist of chicken strips in a slightly spicy coating, are also very tasty. I can not end this review without talking about their mutton biryani. If you have ordered the biryani for take out/home delivery, you are in for a pleasant surprise. The four corners of the box will hold 4 items: 2 pieces of mutton, one potato and one egg. The meat is soft, the amount of rice is enough to feed two, and the price tag is unbelievable!
Ranjan's does not have too much space for a sit down meal (only two tables), but if you live/work in the area, you should certainly order from them and I promise, you will be addicted.

This place is located quite close to my house and is quite famous in the neighbourhood for its rolls. It's mainly a takeaway joint with nominal seating arrangement out in the open.
I went there for dinner a few days back with my brother. 
We knew that their seating arrangement was not up to the mark but still decided to have our dinner there. No complaints about that.
Coming to the food , we had ordered crispy babycorn for starters; paneer butter masala dal makhani and lachha paratha for main course. As it was our first tryst with the place, we had no idea about their serving quantity. Well it was huge. Atleast 3 adults could easily eat out of one plate of any dish.
The babycorn was the worst I have ever had. The size of the babycorns were so big that eating it became a herculean task. Moreover the taste too was not good. It was floating in a sea of bland gravy which just had an oil spill.

They are open even when it's late so if hungry at the middle of a night and seek for good food then sure to visit. What really disappointed me that apart of eating at the place afterwords I had to wait for more than 40-45mins for the parcel I ordered. They have collaborated with food panda, and sure they get many orders but they shouldn't just engage theirselves for food panda orders only. So overall I'll give them 3/5

Ranjan da's restaurant is a place one can always rely upon. They serve good food at very reasonable rates. There are no hidden charges. The service is consistently good. The staff is extremely dedicated and hard working. Although dine in facility is available, but it is more of a take away outlet. Home delivery service is excellent. Be it rain or thunderstorm, they never fail to impress by delivering on time. Any person is bound to develop an attachment after being acquainted with this restaurant and its staff. I would have rated it 5/5, but I would love to believe that they will grow even better with time.

The best part of Ranjan's is it's food quantity and prompt home delivery. The lunch pack of Fried Rice n Chilly Chicken and Biriyanis are too good.Apart from this the Chicken Butter Masala and Momos are also very tasty.

Ranjan's is a very complete eatery. Barely 4 years into this service the joint has made quite a name in the locality. It has got all kind of dishes available from lunch to snacks to dinner and ranges from Chinese to Indian to Mughlai. More than ala-carte it serves the take away crowd in good numbers. I like its fried rice,  garlic chicken,  chilly chicken, fish fry and Mixed hakka Chowmein. The home delivery service is both prompt and reliable. Over the years it has maintained the same quantity with a consistent price range. The best part is the availability of the items even at the fag end of the day.  Being a neighbour I am holding myself not to go biased. But honestly I like the food and service. Thumbs Up!

I live nearby this joint so have ordered food often from here. The place comes off as a small eatery with options only for take away or delivery. One can't sit and eat there. 
When you read their menu card, they look a little pricey. I mean if I want to treat myself I would rather go to a restaurant than order from here, hence the price although little less than your average restaurants, feels quite expensive. 
Coming to the food now. When you open the box, you don't feel much but when u empty it in a plate the box feels like an Akshay Patra... Never ending. The quantity, simply put is "huge". 1.5 full grown men or 3 women can eat out from that box. But the taste is not compromised. Although I get a feeling that their chilly garlic noodles and Manchurian chow mein taste same. The non veg side items (treated as main dishes following the western culture) have quite a lot if pieces and enough gravy. But every dish is spicy and extremely oily. I have tried all their chow mein and almost all Chinese chicken gravy items and I'm pretty satisfied. But my personal favourite from this place is their biryani. Big chicken piece. A nicely boiled egg and a mush and spicy piece of potato. Aha ki anondo.
I give them 3.5 rating because if their over usage of oil, totally unhealthy and make you feel dizzy after a while. Although in a place like India one shouldn't be complaining about this, but due to their quantity,I never get a chance to order variety of items.

Momo's, chilly chicken, egg tarka, rolls, fried rice, chowmein, they all are good to taste with reasonable price and good quantity. One should try their chicken sweet corn soup. It's delicious.

The taste, the quantity and the quality of the food is very well balanced thus giving full satisfaction to the customers. I love the pan fried momos here... its tangy , spicy and tasty. There is a small seating arrangement outside the joint and the best item for me to try out here is the gravy noodles which is awesome. I remember going to a friend's place nearby and ordering food from Ranjans. We used to order Mutton do piaza and chicken do piaza along with Lachha Parathas. The chinese dishes were good too. Even the biryani is worth a try. Overall an economical tasty food joint which is a must try if you are in Salt Lake.

I have been quite often delivered their food, only because after trying many of the common restaurants of Bidhan Nagar, I have found it excellent both in terms of quality and quantity. Anybody interested in not expecting the best of Kolkata cuisine, but next to it, don't miss it, you will not repent. After trying once you may ask for little shift of ingredients in any specific recipe, for instance, "make the chilly chicken little dry and little more hot", they nicely respond. Their desk behavior is also cordial. Try it.

A no frills, roadside joint, serving great food at reasonable prices.That is how I would describe Ranjan's.I happened to stay at Saltlake HC block for official work for a couple of days, and had my evening snacks and lunch, both from this place.
The place is unassuming, with the typical roll counter in front.There are two plastic red tables in front, right on the pavement with 8-10 chairs.I had the impression that tables were not cleaned regularly.The plastic sauce bottles on the table was also filthy.Those who are hygene conscious should either avoid, or get a home delivery.

The food, however, was really good.For snacks I has dry chilli chicken and fried chicken momo.The momos were very good in size and fillings, crisp and the fillings were perfectly seasoned.I was delighted
4/5
The dry chilli chicken was excellent as well.IT was hot and a bit sweet as well, fried to perfection, albeit oily.Though it is difficult to get wrong with this food, i must admit that this joint makes this extremely well.with 8 boneless pieces, itwas a complete winner.5/5

The next day for lunch we had mixed hakka chowmein, chilly garlic chicken dry, and sweet garlic chicken(Gravy)
The dry garlic chicken was a complete delight.With caramelised garlic bits coating the crispy balls of boneless chicken in a hot and slightly sweet sauce...its droolworthy.
5/5

I didnt quite like the gravy dish, it was ordinary after the dry garlic chicken.
3/5
The mixed chowmein was nothing extraordinary, but good.Good amount of chicken prawn and eggs in it.Not too oily.Quantity enough to be shared by two.
3.5/5

Would like to taste more from them when am in the neighbourhood again

This place is basically a Take away/Home Delivery, but they have few sit out options as well. They serve a variety of food from Chinese to Mughlai to evening snacks. The Roll counter is great, specially the paneer roll and egg chicken.. In mughlai chicken bharta and chicken butter masala are worth mentioning. Among Indian breads you get only parathas. In chinese all forms of chowmein and fried rice are good in quantity and quality. They've recently opened a Biryani Counter, did not get a chance to taste that yet.

If you want home delivery they charge a very nominal fee. 

Only one problem for this joint, they keep on increasing the rates, almost on every visit I am presented with a new rate chart. I am ok with this till the quality is not compromised.

This take away joint is located just close to my Institute, a couple of minutes walk from the South Bidhannagar Police Station and just opposite to the All Indian Institute of Hygiene and Public Health , Saltlake, Sector III. It is mainly a take away joint  and at the front section, it has some seating arrangements with a couple of chairs  and tables. 
I have had their Chinese items during my lunch. I love their Hakka noodles be it Manchurian, Schezwan or Chilli Garlic, it is just lip smacking . I also had their Chilli chicken, Chilli Paneer along with their Hakka noodles  in the lunch pack and it is really satisfying . They give a substantial amount in the lunch pack which is quite filling. The price is not on the higher side and that is why their lunch pack is quite favourite among the office goers . I wanted to try  out their rolls but they prepare it not before 4 PM  . That is why I could not taste it as of now . On my subsequent visits, I will try to have things from their roll section. 
It is a mainly take away joint as there is no proper seating arrangement. But, Ranjan is worth trying to have a good taste at an affordable price.

A young, reasonably good looking girl looked at her best friend and said "I'm Hungry. What's for dinner?" 

Her congenial, always-smiling best friend looked up from where she was playing with her six-month old boy and calmly pointed a finger to the drawer. The drawer contained a menu card for Ranjan's. Six minutes, and a minor, heated fight between best friends over the merits of dry chilli chicken over fried momos, later, the phone rang at Ranjan's. 

After some time, packages were deposited to the house where the reasonably good looking girl was waiting patiently. 

She ripped the tops of the packages off in her haste and ate a fried momo. It was still hot, but slightly soft from the trapped moisture, and filled with chicken and onions. She loved. Then she tried a piece from the dry chilli chicken. It was hot, slightly sweet, and very tasty.

There was also a lightly tossed hakka noodles and a fiery hot chilli garlic noodles. Both were making her happy, so she added to the happiness quotient by dousing the hakka noodles with some chicken in hot garlic sauce. The hot garlic sauce was hot, spicy, garlick-y, and in short a Vampire's nightmare and her dream. She wanted to marry that sauce and live with it. The Szechwan chicken was too sweet on her vitriolic tongue. 

Bliss came for 732/- and home delivery was free. Is this love? Perhaps yes.

This is what satiates my sudden street Chinese cravings. I means as refined as our palette gets we cannot forget that we at heart are Indians and we love our desi Chinese food . I stumbled upon this place when i went to buy wine to make sangria for a dinner at home and it smelt awesome . I felt like i was in a Chinese stall in college street or the one right outside my college and one the days i ordered on the phone . 

Beware, the portion size is HUGE ! i loved the Manchurian Hakka noodles with chicken and egg and also the sweet garlic chicken ( dry ) and the Manchurian chicken were delicious . 

The food was fresh, and wholesome and the prices were brilliant . The service is prompt and the person called me back and was very nice to me on the phone. In spite of the fact that it was a Saturday and they were really busy the food came on time and was worth it... FULL PAISA WASOOL

Ranjan's is our go to place on duty nights in Apollo. We usually order in Chinese or Indian dinner from here. Among the Indian, worth mentioning are chicken do piyaza and chicken korma. Among Chinese both mixed chow and fried rice are quite good with a side of usually garlic chicken. The quantity is quite enough for two people per plate and so is economical. Don't expect finest quality from here, but it is made hygienically and quite prompt service. Overall value for money....

You can avail - their modestly furnished dining service or the insides of your own car parked outside the shop or take away or home delivery for their food. Their food - reasonable prices and generous quantities  - is quite simple. And the owner (Ranjan) takes to his job very seriously.
 
What I Have Had:

Snacks: Chicken Pakora (8 for 90), Fish Pakora (8 for 100), Crispy Chilli Baby Corn (liberal amounts for 110), Chicken Kebab Roll - are all scrumptious AND go easy on the oil save the Chilli Baby Corn which is only slightly oily.

Chinese: They do not make a mess of any of the array of Hakka Noodles or the Fried Rice or the Chicken Side Dishes nor do they blow your mind away. However, everything is delicious, very much worth the money.

This place has been my family's go-to meal service for over two years now and has never disappointed. Although away from the din of Salt Lake, it is a thriving venture.
