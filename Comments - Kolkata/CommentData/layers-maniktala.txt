Could not believe it. The home baker herself is awesome. Placed my order for the cake according to my preferrences 3 to 4 days prior. It was a ferrero rochher and kitkat chocolate rossette cake specially meant for my husband's birthday on 4th oct. This was my 1st experiment with layers and i am really grateful to her for sending just what i wanted. Kept this cake a surprise for my husband till the last moment and the look on his face was really rewarding. Now, coming to the cake, look wise it was outstanding as well as tastewise. The kitkats and ferrero rochhers just added to the taste of the chocolate. The cake itself just melted in the mouth. Would definite order more cakes from layers for the upcoming occassions.

But it's my surprize LAYERS has done it's job so perfectly..that they left no least possible way to say "the cake is bad".😃😂

Even more I can say it's taste n quality is better than any other reputed cake shops.

I have tasted all the cakes which layers makes , they are giving tastful cakes with very professionalised presentation at very low cost from normal market rates and renowned places . My all family members, relatives and friends take cakes from here only . They get more than what they expected in surprising way . Layers are very friendly and very caring towards their customers that's what I like most about them . I have tried all the cakes like 
two tier Ferrero Rocher Cake, Better scotch Sunflower Cake, Pineapple Gateaux, Presto Cake, Kit Kat Gems Overloaded, Chocolate - scotchy Fusion, Eiffel Tower shades, Kesar Pista Cake,      Mixed fruit gateau, Personalized Roadway, Blackforest Cake, Guitar Cake, Semi rossettes, Truffle Rossettes (most popular) and my favourite one . Once you will have these cakes , I guarantee you will visit again and again 🍰

It was a bright pleasant day when Vaishnavi sent each of us a box of her Chocolate Truffle Cake and some of her signature hand made chocolates!. Vaishnavi Jaiswal, a home baker, currently runs her own bakery by the name of Layers. She wanted us to taste some of her hand made delicacies, and, trust us.. the cake was indeed out of the world ￼￼
                                                                ...
