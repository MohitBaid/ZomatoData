Awesome desserts, always freshly made...must try the almond caramel tart & red velvet cupcake...the taste lingers for quite a while! Recently tried the phalahari kuttu cream pastry & loved it..very innovative!

The cake melts into the mouth and the small chocolate chips are a delight to munch on. The freshness of the cake makes it remarkably sorted after in comparison to the other well known bakeries.  Looking forward to experience more variants from you in future.

It was certainly a respite from hunger and same old tastes with Old Brands. Friends, you gotta try this out. As the name goes, it certainly is a bliss for the food connoisseurs who always look out for something different to try. This bakery certainly has the potential to surprise you with amazing taste and surprisingly low prices.. Again you get the value for the money spent..

Its definitely a new spot for my tongue henceforth.

Cheers!!!

The confectionery is really delicious and made my appetite, one doesn't necessarily need to go to a Branded Shops to fulfill his/her taste, it was my real time experience that even smaller vendors can beat BIG PLAYERS and not even hurting your pocket much...
