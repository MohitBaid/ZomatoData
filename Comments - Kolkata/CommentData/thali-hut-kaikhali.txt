The food is just awful. First of all they donot give spoon or napkin. Secondly the packing was not so good.Now coming to the food. The rice and bhaji was somewhat ok.The dal tasted awful without salt.The sabji tasted like shit and the chutney seemed more like dal. we ordered fish thali so lets talk about the fish.The fish curry had all the salt and the fish has a smell and was not at all fresh. It seemed like it has been kept in the freezer for many days. In one word the food was just disgusting. Donot order because its a waste of money.

Good food. Good Packing but need to improve few minor areas. Spoon/Toothpick/Tissue paper missing. Delivery should be more accurate. Delivery person arrived one hr late.
