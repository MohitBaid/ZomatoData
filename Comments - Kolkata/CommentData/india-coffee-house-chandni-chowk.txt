The place has been renovated recently. Service was good. I ordred a cold coffee. It was quite bland. Though i liked the strong aroma. Ambience was peaceful, one can actually spend a lot of time there with only one order.

Wanna some refreshment at a knock down price. Come on in. Nice place. No pom-pom and feels good. Bonus, you could learn a lot about coffee. Wish Tea Board had something similar.

You enter a time wrap , greeted by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. A brief no-frill menu but super service along with a pocket friendly prices. Highly recommended joint in the heart of Kolkata.

Coffee was not at all great but snacks were surprisingly good . ordered sandwiches ,pakoda and Coffee but Coffee was disappointing . Ambience is like good old big banquet full of tables , not very old though . Good place to visit if You are nearby and need to wait for someone or something .

I love how homely the place is. The people behave really well with us and it feels great. The chicken sandwich is a must. The cold coffee is amazing

Food quality has deteriorated over the years but the nostalgia and the memories of Indian Coffee House will be intact. A perfect place for college students.. pocket friendly but they really need to look after their food quality.

Great stuff. Very reasonable. 
Simplistic decor. The food is much better than the coffee house in college Street. This is an Indian coffee board initiative. You can sit here for hours without much intervention.

Has great coffee. Love the cold coffee here.

The Heritage of Old Kolkata rather old India reflects with the eye of India Coffee House. Nothing more to say about this legendary place. And yes, kudos to Zomato for adding the all this all time best in it's map.

India Coffee House is located close to Chadni Chawk Metro. Well the place is old, but not as old as the Coffee House in College Street. I been here once to have a cup of coffee with a friend. It has a big area with lot of table and chairs. Coming to the food, the Coffee was excellent. We then took a egg sandwich with it, which also tasted good.
Ambiance is nice.
Prices pocket friendly.

I do not know what to write about it. Each time I make up my mind to visit this place it remains closed following no trends whatsoever! I have made immense visit to the area only to find the shutter down. Even yesterday, I made a visit and found it to be closed at around 5 in the evening. Luck!

This place located in the prime business district of the city puts those swanky coffee places in their place with its size and the great stuff it serves and at a reasonable price too.

Railway station cofee is far better then this.
Not regreting the money wasted.

INDIA COFFEE HOUSE is strictly a place to just sit,, complete some pending work,, or at most have a conversation with ur "not so favorite"/ casual frndz [please dont bring ur best /good/close/special friends here,] while sipping ( read tolerating) some "not so good coffee" at cheap prices..

Its no fun place! Rather,
A dull and bouring place..
But in chadni chowk,, if u want some cheap coffee at cheap prices.. Then give it a try..
The place has no a.c
After trying their coffee(read hot water 99% coffee 0.5% and 0.5% milk) i am sure u will not dare to try their "sandwich" menu

But still if u HAVe to eat.. Go for their pakoras,, a little less pathetic than their sandwich menu.. Plz avoid their sauce..

Basically, its a big hall where chairs and tables are arranged in a order with no decor ,, in a dull way..
Its a place to land ur ass on the chairs
And just sit.

I can bet with you guys their ₹ 20 coffee is way better then any other most famous café chain's. Situated near E Mall. Big place with large no of tables to sit which were properly arranged but sad part is most of the time it was nearly empty. Ambience was really good. Hospitality was very nice. Friendly and helpful staff. Quick service and good presentation. Pocket friendly and cheapest price on compare to taste, quality and quantity. I had their Coffee it was heavenly Delicious. One of the Best coffee I've tried so far. And I also tried their Onion pakoda they were also superb tasty. Must try place. Personal favorite. Totally loved it. Highly recommended to all.

Feeling nice to write the first review on India Coffee House . Franky speaking I find it better than the congested Indian Coffee House of College Street. In the claustrophobic world of Self Marketing and Promotion high voltage food bloggers have skipped this aged old place and I found very odd when I tried to add review and photos of this joint. After several mails and conversation almost after 1 and half month this Beautiful Place has been added in Zomato listing. Thanks Zomato for giving value to my observations. One place I really like to go for breakfast is India Coffee House. They open shop sometime between 10.30 to 11.00 am in the morning. What I like about the place is the feeling that you are walking into an Old India. The place looks really old and you will find people sipping coffee and reading the papers, a true coffee shop experience which most other coffee shops have missed. There’s no distracting crowd and if you want to have a wonderful conversation early in the morning, this is an excellent place to do that. This place is good value for money, and everything is pretty cheap. Quality coffee at one of the most crowdy area near Chandni and Esplanade is great Deal. You couldn’t get cheaper than this. The only thing to probably look out is for the waiters are sometimes impatient. They would want you out of the restaurant as soon as you have finished your food because they want to serve as many customers as they can, obviously for the tips. To make sure you have a wonderful time at the Coffee House , it’s a good idea picking a seat where you can see the road. It’s simply beautiful just looking out of the window into the sidewalk and the trees across the road. But overall, it’s a wonderful place to take a friend out for breakfast. Nothing better than just sipping coffee and having a wonderful conversation. Enjoy yourself.
