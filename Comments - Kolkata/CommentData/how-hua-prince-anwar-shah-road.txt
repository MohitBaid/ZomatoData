Incredibly delicious food!Even though the size of the restaurant is tiny,the portions are MASSIVE. That chimney soup should be awarded a padma bhushan,it's so bloody good. Hearty,delicious broth with chicken prawns fish tofu and veggies. The best soup I've had, by far. Tried the chilly roast pork-excellent quality of the meat.The veg menu also thoroughly satisfied my veggie niece.The fried fish balls also were delicious. And the prices are really affordable for the care they take behind each dish, with high quality and quantity. Very happy indeed!

Quiet a small and calm place. 

We tried their chimney soup(chicken). One must try this here, and one could have it over a long time as it remains warm throughout. 

I liked their chicken dumplings and pork roast. 

The pocket pinch is higher than you would expect.

How hua is one of the oldest chinese joint of the city, mainly known for chimney soup and pork delicacies. Earlier located in free school street, now relocated at lords more.

Although they are special for the chimney soup that they serve, because of the humongous quantity , we  could not order it. We ordered fried pork balls which were extremely tasty. The chopsuey  was one of the best, I have ever had, but the best of all was roasted pork. They take a lot of time to serve.

Cozy place. Good service. Excellent food. Had taloo mein soup with wantons as starters. The soup was yummy and the wantons crispy and juicy. For the main course, we wanted to try something new and thus ordered Musui Chicken & Chow Chow Rice which was quite tastebud pleasing.

Visited this cozy Chinese food joint today. The food was very delicious. We had the specialty Chimney soup and the serving was huge and I have never had anything like this before. It's actually their specialty. For the main course we had fried chicken dumplings, chilli roast pork, special fried rice with dragon chicken. Absolutely yummy and inspite of being full, we had the urge to have more and ordered for a plate of fish in sweet chilli sauce and that too was just awesome. I will definitely suggest all to do try out this joint and believe me you will want more.

It is quite surprising for me that currently How Hua has been rated so low. It is a small joint with an ordinary decor, not a lavish restaurant but they serve good food. Having heard so much about their Chimney Soup I was extremely curious to know what is it exactly, for not being available in many joints across the city and they cooked it to perfection. It was half a portion of the Chimney Soup but enough for 4-5 people. We also ordered for Prawn Gravy Chow(Noodles) and Garlic Fish and were satisfied with both quantity and the quality of their dishes.

Went to have dinner here and I am definitely not going back. Normally joints like this offer good food but this place is unbelievably bad. Ordered dry chilli pork, chicken fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce. I don't know where they bought the pork from but I nearly died trying to swallow a piece. It was really hard. Not to mention, my friend and I both got sick on returning home.¬†
Don't recommend it at all.

Okay i was here two weeks ago.
Found this place in the lanes of lake gardens with a beautiful light studded balcony.
Had to go there.
We were already full so we just ordered a chimney soup and some fried pork balls.
The service was disgusting.
If you have to wait 50 minutes for just a soup and the starter i really have nothing to say..
Absoulutely nothing.
First came the soup.. I wouldnt deny it tasted good.
But then we kept waiting for the starter to be served.
It took for them such a long time...
And after we told them we are in a time crunch.. They should have listened to us... But the person who was taking our orders paid no heed.
Then the pork ball was served and it was an extremely small quantity.
Very overpriced this place is.
Bad bad service.
Will never go here again.

How Hua had shut its restaurant on Free School street sometimes in 2008 or 2009. It was heart wrenching as back in those days we used to be quite a regular. Infact first time I had been was with my father sometimes in early 80's. It was quite a surprise to see this famed restaurant opening at my backyard and I was overjoyed to discover it. So this Sunday we went for lunch and settled for Chimney soup which was delicious and with a familiar taste. It was filling and served piping hot with a chimney in the middle with a burning coal. This was followed by Drunken Chicken and mixed Chow mien. Must visit for those who romanticize of the bygone era of Calcutta culinary. The sitting area is small but comfortable. Those who visited the original How Hua in Free School Street would remember the place to be dimly lit with 6 seater table affixed with a glass top that had a printed menu slided between. My strong advise to the current torch bearer is to recreate that aura as that has a lot of nostalgia embedded on it. Thanks for the reincarnation. We love the old restaurants getting reincarnated with new lease of life.

A small and cosy place. The food was served quickly. We had Pork prawn balls for starters. It was really tasty and there were ten of them. Totally worth the price. For the main course, we had Pork chopsuey and Mandarin fish. Every item had a huge quantity. Pork chopsuey was enough for two of us. But, the Mandarin fish was too sweet.

Full disclosure: Review is likely to be heavily influenced by nostalgia.

What can I say. Really. How Hua was one of the places we would come to as college kids when someone had money to spare. For good reason. Setting aside the chimney soup for a moment, the food was just so good. These pork dumplings that has been steamed and then pan fried. The omlette (fu Young) which was so filling, and so on and so forth. 

All served in a place that time had forgotten. When news of it shutting down,I shed a silent tear (or two).

And now that it has opened up, well praise be the Lord. The food is bloody good, the chimney soup is filling and warm and  rich. The pork dumplings‚Äã are as good as ever. As is the warm service.

Highly recommended.

We went here during Durga puja when all well known restaurants were crowded and even there was a long waiting queue. Not wanting to stand in long que we started searching restaurants that away from pandel areas. We knew this lane has many food joints and came here in search of uncrowded small joint. That way this was a perfect find. Although we doubted about the taste of the food but to our surprise the food taste is really good compared to food served in big restaurants during puja. The service wasn't prompt. One shouldn't expect too god ambience  as kitchen and sitting area is side by side so can be a bit uncomfy and also sitting area is very small. We ordered Chicken Wanton in starters and szechuan fried rice and szechuan fish. The szechuan sauce was really spicy just the way we wanted

We were a group of four people, desperately looking for someplace to eat. With its tape light draped balcony, this place was staring at us. The place is small but very well thought out. 

We ordered a How Hua special soup bowl which had anything and everything between fish balls, tofu, noodles, mushrooms, pork, chicken and what not. Food is delicious, staff is amiable. This place was supposed to close by 11 and we kept it open till 12:30 am in the morning. 

What is good: the food. The soup bowl serves at least four people. 

What could be better: attention to the individual elements in a dish. For example, we all agreed that the Tofu was having a burnt smell.

Ambience: A small shabby restaurant with a sitting arrangement of  approx 12-15 people. The moment we entered there was a strong pungent smell throughout the place. The bathroom was smelly as well. 

Food- We had ordered a bottle of coco-cola ( since nothing else was available), one plate crispy baby corn and one plate chicken chowmein. Needless to say everything was aweful. The crisy baby corn tasted nothing like one, and the chowmein was oily and cold af. We left both of the dishes unfinished, because eating it all could possibly lead to food poisoning. Also the chowmein had possibly one deep fried insect in it..which the staff claimed as Soya bean seed...but soya bean seeds aren't that small.

Also they charged ‚Çπ30 for ‚Çπ14 rupee cold drinks.

Pocket Pinch- Prices in the menu inclusive of GST. Total bill ‚Çπ400. All wasted. 

Final verdict- Never ever be here.

A must try authentic chinese eatery where the main ingredient is purity and paasion. In spite of being a crunched space all the food served here is with much Love. Best and freshest of edibles used gives the food its repute for authenticity and culinary satisfaction. A pocket friendly menu and a traditional chinese hunan provincial flavour gives you the same feeling of having food at Hongkong pier. The chimney soup , chrispy chilli pork , the fish dumpling soup , momos are some of the best out of the tongue slurping spreads they offer.
All the best How Hua.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to claim that these guys currently serve the best pork in town. Growing up as a teenager with a voracious appetite for any kind of meat, I remember gorging on pork fat obsessively every chance I got. After a while, most of my friends started dumping all the fat they didn't wish to have on my plate. Over the years, however, my appetite for food, in general, and meat, in particular, has undergone radical changes. I have little patience for fat these days and prefer my meat to be lean. If you are looking for completely fat-free and well-cooked pork, then there's arguably no place in town (other than How Hua) that will live up to your demands. You could try their chimney soup as well. It's filling, does not compromise anyhow on any of the promised ingredients, and can easily serve at least 4 individuals.

Unbelievably poor tasting food. Had to bring back two dishes to home for a lot of redo to make them tasty. Over use or under use of salt is a perennial factor all three times I stupidly stumbled in there. And about service, less said the better. No wonder it was empty on a Saturday peak dinner time.

Review of visit on 15 October 2027:
"I can't believe that we visited the same restaurant 2 months back.
Today's experience is absolutely horrible.
We ordered Chicken Dim sum. It's like meat ball stuffed inside. Taste was disappointing.
Thereafter, we ordered Chinese Chop Suey, expecting to get similar experience like last time. We asked the waiter to suggest best chicken side dish. The fat guy suggested Drunken Chicken.
When served we found the chop suey was of very poor quality. Drunken Chicken was absolutely horrible.
After being disappointed with these food, we thought of ordering American Chop Suey. This too was pathetic.
In the beginning we were served with 3 glasses of water. Later I asked for water repeatedly for 3 times to fill up the empty glasses, but waiter did not bothered to serve any water.
We left the restaurant after paying huge amount. By the way even this restaurant is air-conditioned but they do not charge GST.
After returning home my daughter started vomiting several times. Even rest of us are having indigestion & may throw up any moment.
Now you decide about going to this restaurant."

"How Hua restaurant used to be in Free School Street and was famous for chimney soup & other authentic Chinese food. Unfortunately nine years back it was closed.
Four months back it is now opened near South City mall.
Excellent chimney soup, chop suey & dumpling. Both owners (partners) & stuart from Vizag are very welcoming & always caring.
Must visit here (see the location near Lords Junction). Parking in the next right hand side lane.
Will visit again soon to try other attractive menu options."

How Hua or 'How Horrible' is how I would rate my experience. Ordered via Zomato orders and the food was delivered nicely packaged, piping hot. But it turned out to be a highly disappointing dinner for us. I had ordered Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken and Garlic Chicken along with a plate of Noodles, Fried Rice and Meifoon of the Chicken and Prawn variants. Added to this was a plate of Talumein Soup. The sides were one of the worst that I have had in a long, long time. They consisted of rock hard Chicken balls cooked in the least amount of sauces possible. The coating was too thick for our liking and the sauces had failed to penetrate the Chicken balls. The sides ended up tasting like Vadas in some anonymous sauces... ABSOLUTELY tasteless. The Noodles, Rice, Meifoon were low in salt and what we were left with on our plates was a disaster. Mind it.... the quantity of Chicken and Prawns in each was very impressive and the quantity of each individual dish was awesome but somewhere the taste went missing. The Talumein soup was a somewhat face saver.... although not too special, but compared to the others, the soup was the only one that we could hang on to. Highly disappointing.... These people need to step up or become another piece of history in today's highly competitive food business.

Great food but pathetic service. The food has a old school authentic Chinese flavor. Everything was freshly made. Quantity is huge and the place is quite pocket friendly. But most of things on the menu aren't available. They didn't even have rice the day we went. That's the very basic food. Serving time is quite long. They served us wrong item also but changed it after we told them about it. It has every potential of being a good outlet if they improve the service.

Last night I called for food from this newly opened joint since some guests had suddenly come over. We ordered mix fried rice, veg fried rice, manchurian chicken ( boneless) and Garlic fish. 
Thank god I stopped at that! 
The delivery was on time, the packing nice and cautious, pricing is according to what is prevailing around.

Do u want me to talk about their food?
UTTERLY DISSAPOINTED is what I can say. Out of all the dishes ordered,  the one that gets some positive marks is the veg fried rice. 
Let me tell you how bad it actually was.
The mix veg rice had too mich of some tomato based wetspice, completly overpowering all the other ingrediants and the rice clued to each other as if copulating. 
The moment I opened the box of manchurian , the first thing I spotted was an inch of oil floating on top. Though I had requested to make it spicy, I didn't ask for something to burn my taste buds for sure, that also in a bad way. The coated chicken pcs were over fried and we're hard. 
The
I have had never tasted something like this before. It looked like mustard fish, tasted weird. Miraculously those humble chopped up pcs of garlic refused to lend any flavour and we're floating on top.
I yhink thr only good think, tht i will remember isThe guy who spoke to the me over the phone, Siddharth, had a good voice nd talks well!!

But even after so many years when I visited this place tonight the food, the hospitality, the smell, the taste had all remained the same, as if it was halred in time.

How Hua used to be a very famous chinese restaurant in free school street. Recently it got relocated to Lake Gardens, and since I have never tried the original restaurant, my excitement was peaked. So we called them and ordered 3 plates of mixed gravy chowmein and roasted chilly pork.
However I was quite disappointed.

CON- It had been preordered well before time,yet when we reached to pick up our food about an hour later, we were made to wait for about half an hour. I will admit that I haven't had very authentic chinese, so I can't judge their authenticity but I must sa that the chowmein was very unlike the chinese we get here. it was so so non spicy that it almost tasted bland. the side dish was comparatively better but too dry.

PRO- The quantity of each dish was pretty promising and there were generous amounts of meat and shrimps in the gravy. Also the position of the restaurant is very convenient and it has a cutesy homely decor.

Went for dinner yesterday. A tiny mini place( 12 seaters) at Anwar Shah Road - Lords crossings. There is a connection with the original outlet at Free School Street, which closed down few years back. This restaurant we were told has been opened by the grandson of the original owner and they were able to trace back the main cook who now mans the kitchen. Their famous Chimney Soup is also available which they were famous for. We found the food to be good and substantial and most importantly pocket friendly. We ordered, mixed fried rice, American chop Suey, shrimp balls, Chilli pork roast and lemon Chicken. The helpings were good with big chunks of meat in both rice and chop Suey and bill was rs 970/- what I found missing was the poached egg on the American Chop Suey, which is a must for this dish. I also pointed out to the management that the charge for a 200ml small bottle cold drink costing Rs 13 was being billed for Rs 40, which was on the higher side. They immediately reversed the charges and made it complimentary, which was a nice gesture on their part. On the whole, we enjoyed our meal and wish to go back in the near future.

Ordered Chilli roast Pork and fried noodles. Rely upset with the pork as the gravy contained nothing but sliced chilli and garlic. It was tasteless. It costed Rs200.

Fried noodles was the most overpriced dish I ever had in any restaurant. You charge Rs110 just to give noodles fry ? (It did not have any masala or gravy or anything)

Will never visit this place again.

We ordered in some Hakka and gravy noodles along with some roast chilli pork. The noodles were light and delicious. It was a very satisfying meal to say the least. I have feeling How Hua is going to become one of our staples. If I had to be critical, then I would say the pork was a little chewy. Otherwise the everything was subtle and balanced. Hope it stays this way!

After going through the reviews I wanted to visit this resturant to try the chimney soup. We ordered fried Prawn ball, fish chilly balls and Chimney soup. Wanted to order something non spicy for my 3yrs old son. He really enjoyed the taste of the prawn balls. They take little time to serve the soup but when I tried it, I realized why everybody is mentioning about this. It has authentic chinese smell and the taste was superb. The other foods also exceeded our expectation level. According to me one must try the Chilly Roast Pork here. Moreover it gives a very homely feeling as the owners directly get involved in taking the order and serving. 
Above all I should mention the pricing. This is one of the most pocket friendly resturant. Considering everything it was just a wow experience. They are available in Swiggy also so the food can be enjoyed at home.

The erstwhile restaurant of the same name in Free School Street was a regular haunt for me and my friends as we used to study in St. Xavier's. the chimney soup was the main attraction.

This re-incarnation by the same family is closer to home and hence a visit was on the cards. As usual, the chimney soup was ordered. Along with that, we ordered ried pork balls, mixed chowmein and sweet and sour prawn.

The chimney soup did not disappoint at all. The portion sizes are big and the meat servings are generous in it. It brought back a lot of fond memories. Thanks for keeping it the way it was.

The chowmein was nice and again the meat serving was generous. One thing is certain, they do not hold back on the quantity of meat and fish in their dishes. Overall, it was nice.

the restaurant was full when we were there and there were no delays in serving the food. ¬†One thing which I found missing from the original menu was "Pork and Prawn Fried Ball". This is something we missed and maybe the owners can look into this.

Visited this place a few days back for the first time after hearing/reading about it in quite a number of places.
The first time's visit was while we were returning from a nearby Chinese joint. We settled for a light meal of pork wonton soup. While the place was really small, it did give a nice and comfortable feel, thanks to the lights and the uncrowded room. Service was pretty normal as the soup reached us within a few minutes.
Wontons were nice and silky, although the stuffing seemed to fall apart through the thin layer. The sesame oil as used in the soup was overpowering which was a bit unpleasant.

We returned for a second experience after a couple of days. On entering the space, we were welcomed with a bunch of noisy neighbours who seemed to be least bothered by the presence of any other customer. While our neighbours were a considerably larger group, the waiter failed to pay any heed to us. After our first order for fried pork dumplings, we were told that it would take some time. While we agreed to wait for a plate of dumplings, we were pretty much left on our own for more than an hour. Our neighbours were constantly attended with their orders, while the waiter seemed to turn a blind eye to anyone else apart from them. We were unwantedly left to be entertained by the loud discussions of bloggers and food bloggers and unnecessary boasts and brags about their food knowledge.
After a good 75 minutes, a plate of fried dumplings arrive. The dumplings seemed pretty basic. In fact, the stuffing seemed to be that of some kind of sausage, the idea of which is pretty sad and disappointing in itself. As "the people" left, the waiter turned to us for our orders. Around 30 minutes later, three bowls of rice noodle soup arrive which were supposed to be pork meifoon. In my limited experience, pork meifoon is supposed to be in a stir-fry style unless otherwise mentioned. Yet, How Hua taught me to be careful the next time I order for meifoon anywhere else. We had also ordered for roast pork. What arrived was more like chilli pork than roast, as their was no hint of any kind of roasted sense. The meat was so tough that we instantly regretted choosing the place.
Needless to say, we were highly disappointed with the way things turned out contrary to what we had expected from How Hua after our first experience. There's a good chance of not returning to this place for a third time.

The restaurant opened after a long time, was looking forward to have the meal there.
However did not go personally to have the meal ordered it through swiggy. 
Ordered the chicken gravy chowmein and dry chilly chicken. The chowmein gravy did have generous chunks of chicken but the veg part was only made up of only diced cabbages and carrots. Which was not at all good. Wish they had MUSHROOM. POKCHOY, SPINACH, ZUCCINI, etc which would be a so welcoming.  
Chilly chicken was made up of small fragments of chicken made to a a ball with flour/binder, which roughly consisted about 80% of the volume. Hope people can get the taste. 

I strongly believe that Kolkata does serve very high quality Chinese cuisine and efforts to be made to improve it more. 

Hope they improve the quality of the food.

Kolkata's Old world charm is back and how! If ever I had cribbed about an Eatery closing down, was this... and because of its cult Chimney Soup.... and this was what we were here for....

Recommended for CHIMNEY SOUP - must must must have.... even if you don't end up having anything else.... reminded of the old How Hua at Free School Street, having maintained almost similar taste.... this signature dish contains Chicken, Prawns, Fish, Meat Balls, Crab, Tofu, Veggies with Vermicelli... and in reasonable quantities.... enough and more to spare... 

Taste to add to Nostalgia... would come back for sure!!

The 'How Hua' experience

We were aiming for the 'momo I am' outlet in Lake Gardens, but seeing the 'How Hua' signboard, we couldn't stop ourselves from going there as well, after we were done with 'Momo I am'. But since we already had our fill at 'Momo I am', couldn't order the stuff we wanted to. Ended up ordering the pork wonton soup. A bit too much sesame oil for my liking and the wontons were packed with sausages (probably from Kalman's)! It was not mind blowing, but okay-ish. We decided to back again to taste their food again. That was two days back.

So, we went back the second time. The small little room full of people. Some well known faces. We were hungry, so placed our initial order at around 2:30PM. We went for fried pork dumplings.

To entertain us while we waited for our food, our next table neighbors decided to force us to eavesdrop. They seemed to have a developed palate for blogger-bashing. Names rolled like virtual heads (obviously they rolled, because the people who answer to those names, were not around). Some known to me, some I have heard of. There was virtual blogger blood everywhere (heck, they even had questions about parenting methods of those who fathered these bloggers!). Anyway, it was 3:20 already.. almost 50 minutes since we placed our order. The only waiter around was busy tending to out neighbours and I think our neighbors had brought the cook along, as he only prepared the dishes that they ordered.

Finally at around 3:30PM, as the micro-celebs started to leave, we were provided with plates and spoons and forks. After a few minutes we finally got served.

The dumplings too (like the wontons) had the same sausage filling and was a bit chewy. I guess it's really hard to prepare dumplings. It took them 1 hour to prepare one plate of the stuff.

Then we ordered roasted pork and pork meifoon noodles. The roasted pork was as tough as a half rotten shoe and was terribly dry. It was NOT roasted pork. It was chilly pork. The meifoon noodles we ordered, turned out to be pork meifoon SOUP. We had ordered for something completely different and it seemed the cook had totally forgotten what we ordered and prepared whatever HE wanted to prepared.

The only thing that reached our table on time, was the bill. The entire experience was so mind-numbing, we had to go to 'Momo I am' to forget some of the stuff we had to go through at 'How Hua'.

p.s: Bloggers beware. You might get thrown out for telling the manager that you will write in your blog about things that are not right with his restaurant!

Small joint which serves absolutely authentic Chinese food. This is famous for its Chimney Soup, just like Eau Chew and I can assure you that it deserves all the hype. Took home delivery of Chicken Fried and Garlic Chicken today. The food came within 40 minutes. The Fried Rice was perfectly cooked and the chicken was simply divine with robust flavour of garlic!

How Hua is a small Chinese eatery in Lake Gardens. The d√©cor will remind of you of Chinese restaurants of the old. Red wall hangings and Chinese lanterns, very attractive and courful.

Coming to the food, we ordered for the famous chimney soup, which was a massive hit ! The soup had a variety of tastes from different kinds of meat like pork , chicken, praws and loads of veggies. It's a nice healthy and tasty soup.

The soup was followed by mixed fried rice, which was decent, thought they should consider limiting their oil use a bit.

We had also ordered chillie garlic chicken and sweet and sour chicken, but to my disappointment they almost tastes the same, the Same chicken was used on a slightly different tasting gravy. The roast chilli pork was way too dry and tough. Need to have very minimal amount of gravy, the taste being ok.

I'd suggest them to include more chicken dishes, like black bean sauce, mushroom sauce and other varieties.

The owner/host is very nice and cordial and it's definitely worth giving it another shot.  I wish them all the best.

I came to know about this new reopened How Hua today itself through a friend and we didn't waste time. We drove within the next hour to eat the best chimney soup after 9 years. How Hua was quite a landmark restaurant on Free School Street that closed doors in 2008. After 9 years the grandson of the family along with his wife searched and brought back their old cook and reopend the door to our childhood memories. It was my grandfathers favourite restaurant. He is no more. But who knew that his favourite restaurant will one day open in his own locality, Lake Gardens, literally at a stones throw from the house. 
Now let's cut to the chase. The Chimney Soup is bang on. As delightful as ever. Four of us shared a large one. It could be easily shared by 6-7 people. The pork balls in the soup tastes the same. Extremely helpful staff. We didn't plan to eat dinner, hence we just ordered their signature Chicken dumplings- half boiled & half fried. Made to perfection. The menu has the How Hua specials- their French Pork Chops, half Fried chicken, Baked crab, their foo youngs, Mandarin Fish, roast pork and many more. But in my next visit what I'm really looking forward to is their American Chopsuey. One of the underrated pillars of the Heritage Calcutta Chinese. How Hua and Jimmy's Kitchen had the best Chopsuey in town. With the old cook back, that one must be quite the classic. The newly reopened How Hua is a quaint little 14 seater on the mezzanine. My sincere thanks to the authorities for reopening this gem. How Hua's chimney soup is one of those reasons for me to never ever leave this city and settle down elsewhere.

Hands down the best restaurant in Calcutta. The same chef, excellent service. The chilly pork and chimney soup is to die for. Absolutely reasonable prices and the quantity that is given is more than one persons share.

Having the Chimney Soup after almost 15 years was really good and there was no difference in taste and quality when compared to their restaurant in free school street. The food quality was very nice and the pork quality was just amazing. Would recommend you try this out. Authentic Chinese food and definitely not local Chinese food.
