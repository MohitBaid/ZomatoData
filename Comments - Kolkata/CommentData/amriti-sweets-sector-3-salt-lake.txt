Well, a sharp contrast in 2 different outlets of the same brand named ‚ÄúAmriti‚Äù ‚Äì the one based out of Phoolbagan belittled by the ones based out of Saltlake, Sector 3 ‚Äì nearby the Stadium. A casual visit to them just to try out an item or two led to unearthing of this gem of a place ‚Äì and also put me into their list of ‚Äúdog‚Äù customers (Read: Faithful). Nice to see that they set up a cosy ambience although this is more of a take-away as no seats are feasible.

A 1st impression is definitely the last impression and their 1st on me was tremendous. I was quite amazed by the variety of sweets and savouries on offer ‚Äì a list too long to mention over here. However, I was somewhat disappointed that they ran out of samosa stock, an item I definitely wanted to try!

Nevertheless, I settled for their ‚ÄúHard chocolate Sandesh‚Äù ‚Äì the ones resembling those in Balaram Mallick and Radharaman Mallick shops! The ones which have a hard chocolate coating atop! The ones which have great deal of chhena mixed with choco powder inside! The ones which ecstacise your mind into heaven, albeit for just a few seconds! The ones priced at meagre 15 bucks, but are definitely worth thousands! The ones ‚Äì which crave you for a 2nd once the 1st one is over and the ones which crave you for a 3rd, once the 2nd one is over - so on and so forth!

Hope I have made myself clear enough ‚Äì so go, try it out yourself and experience the difference!

Tried their radha ballavi, good enough served with aloo dum. Samosas are good, khasta kachori not so much. Aam doi is yumm but the sondeshes are pretty dry n rosogollas are nice and spongy,good for all those people who like it a lil spongy. Personally i like the 'melt in ur mouth' rosogollas.

This is a new misti shop located opposite to Saltlake Stadium,Gate 2. This place already had so many other shops like momo hut, sweet n sour,mio amore,sugar and spice,hot chips etc. Only thing missing was a standard misti shop and this place has filled up that expectation.

One should definitely try out their radhaballavi-alur dom and dhokla in snacks. Their mistis are also equally good specially roshomalai,aam sandesh,goja etc.

Located near the petrol pump opposite the salt lake stadium this is a recently established sweet shop in my neighbourhood. It's a neat and clean eatery serving snacks like samosas, kachoris, radha ballavi etc along with a plethora of sweets. I went there to taste the samosa but ended up having much more.

The samosa is the best you can get in salt lake. Trust me I have had them at a lot of places but this is very very special. The crust is crispy like the ones served at tewari but the filling is of traditional bengali samosas which makes it light. 
Other than this I had chhena toast - which was good but not as soft as you would expect; strawberry sandesh was Ok:; the rajbhog however was delicious.
Overall the place is good but the sweets are quite overpriced. Given the fact that there is already a firmly established sweet shop in the same block serving somewhat better quality sweets at almost half the price, it will face a tough competition. Let's see how far the samosa carries it. 
Looking forward to visit this place again.
PS: DO TRY THE SAMOSA!!

Finally a good sweet shop in the block. Good quality sweets but what I like most here are the snacks they offer. Love their samosa, khasta kachori, radhaballavi, corn patties etc.
Pretty happy with the shop's performance so far. Still very new to judge though.
