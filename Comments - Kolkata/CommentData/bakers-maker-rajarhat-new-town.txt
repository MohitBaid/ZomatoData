I prefer quality.The premium chocholates and ingredients used by Baker's Maker for the Truffle was very tempting. Being new in town, planning a surprise for hubby...and really consious of quality is worth giving a thought to order from where... making that happens takes an effort. When I received call back from Baker's Maker, Priyanka made it easiest to get the super sumptious,delicious...ummm amazing cake that no invitee could stop themselves from having the another bite of deliciouness. It need not to be an ocassion to have such finger licking desert.
