Ordered the below from this outlet for an office delivery, which is based somewhere in Sector 5 only:-

(i)	Veg thali ‚Äì comprising

Dry and undercooked phulkas ‚Äì pretty inedible

Rice ‚Äì Not refined properly, looked quite unclean

Gajar matar veg ‚Äì Way below expectations

Tomato chutney ‚Äì Nothing brag-worthy

Dal (Yellow) ‚Äì Tasteless and watery

Kadhai Paneer ‚Äì Fine, though not great

Salads

1 pickle pouch

Gulab jamun - worst ever (with a hard dollop of maawa inside it), way too hard!

(ii)	Pepsi 600 ml pet bottle

(iii)	Extra Butter roti ‚Äì was better than the dry ones!

(iv)	Gulab Jamuns ‚Äì 3 pieces (complimentary with Zomato treats)

Delivery is fine (not delayed), but quantity is pretty scarce for a 190 Re thali, much better thalis are available in the 120 Re range!

Packing of the thali is impossible to open and you have to struggle for 5 minutes to tear off half of it!

Overall, an experience to forget ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want any memories of this meal!

This is an updation to my previous review of 3 days back. I was very much disappointed with the food I had ordered which was late as well as pathetic.

I really appreciate the management of this outlet as they took ownership of the situation by acknowledging the mistake and provided a hot, delicious and lip smacking dish this time, that too on time as well. I am truly impressed as the chicken pieces were soft and the masala gravy was too superb! I finished it in minutes!

Thanks a lot guys and keep up the good food. Wish you all the best for my future orders...! üòçüòçüòç

[Based on its Chinese food only]
In one and a half months, this restaurant has not only increased its prices but also reduced its portions.
Sadly, they didn't up their game in terms of food quality or taste.
Food tastes like any other mediocre roadside Chinese takeout...
Delivery is not that reliable.
Staff behaviour however is pretty decent... Hope they improve themselves

This is my first and recent experience. Last night at around 9:45pm I placed my order for one Chicken Butter Masala and it showed that it will be delivered within 10:42pm. I thought this might be a rush hour so they are taking an hour to deliver. No issues with that. At around 10:30pm tracking showed that it's on the way. Now this restaurant is hardly around 10mins distance from my office building (technopolis nayapatty to college more). After around 3 calls to them, including online chat with zomato and 45 minutes later, at 11:30pm approx the delivery guy arrived with the parcel. The item was not even a little hot, very less gravy and the 4 small chicken pieces were not boiled properly hence very chewy. I had to heat it again in microwave oven at the office pantry and waste my dinner timings. Rs 163 for this type of food is not expected at all! Very very disappointed. Not recommended if such continues. :(

This place is situated in Sec V, Salt Lake. I Ordered at 2:00 am and got it delivered at home by 2:50. On time delivery. I ordered chicken biryani which costed me Rs 136. When I got it, the box was already open and their were rice in the plastic. Totally disappointed with the packaging. Now comes the appearance. The biryani looked great. It had a nice aroma. Taste wise it was perfect. Not too oily neither too spicy. Just perfect . But what disappointed me was it was not hot. It was like they just packed and delivered it to me. Not at all hot. It had 1 big piece of chicken, 1 boiled egg and 1 medium piece of boiled potato. Potato was perfectly boiled so was the egg. Chicken was nicely cooked though it lacked salt and spices.

Packaging : 2/5
Taste : 3.5/5
Overall Experience : 3/5.
If u are delivering food at night , make sure that u guys serve it hot or atleast partially hot. The taste is good, just need to work on the packaging thing.
Happy Eating.

In response to my previous review dated 31/11/2017 ("The behaviour of the delivery boy was pathetic and the food was horrible. The quality has degraded badly, not ordering again. The fried chicken kebab was worst.")
The management went forward with brilliantly, they not only took the initiative to look into the matter but they apologized on behalf of this incident and the food. So I was sent the same order as complimentary from the restaurant and this time is tastes yum.

Honestly guys : do try the fried chicken kebab with a chutney they provide, it's a must have in their list.
And this time a really appreciate their efforts to make their client happy and satisfied! Keep it up guys.

Food quality is just okay. They put too much oil and spices in their food. One thing I like about them is their delivery. they deliver food on time or before time.
2nd order through FoodPanda.. Rating -ve10(if possible)Order placed at 12:37 midnight and yet waiting for it at 2:44 am in the morning..The lame excuse that I received from them is that order is delayed due to the traffic jam. :DTraffic that too in midnight in kolkata..Order received at 2:55 am.Now come to the food quality:-worst food, tasteless, oily and full of spices.To sum up my review:- NEVER EVER TRY TO ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT. They are big time cheat and worst food vendor.They don't even know how to talk to their customer.Better cook by yourself late night than ordering from this pathetic restaurant.

This is the worst place to order a midnight food. They would simply delay your order and when calling the restaurant multiple times they would just say that they had too many orders and they were not able to prepare the food and blah blah. This restaurant is completely unreliable in terms of food delivery as well as food quality. I ordered drums of heaven from here which turned out to be the worst shitty food I've ever had.  I would simply opt out of ordering from  this restaurant and prepare maggi for my dinner as this shitty place has no intention of providing or maintaing the slightest quality of food and service.

The food from Bite all Night is really good considering they deliver till 3am. They are very good. I ordered twice, once Indian and once Chinese both the time the quantity and quality both were good as compared to other places serving late night. However it would be nice if they expanded their menu. Including more snacks and beverages.

If you do not want to waste your hard earned money then never order from this place!
I ordered one of their combos at 2am. My office is like 5-10 mins from their restaurant. On zomato it was showing that the delivery will be completed by 2:45am. At around 2:32 the order was showing "on way". I waited till 2:45am and didn't get the delivery. I initiated a chat communication with zomato who assured me that they will call the restaurant and the order will be taken care of. At around 3:30 zomato sent me a message stating the the restaurant people said that they came to my address and called me multiple times but I didn't answer the phone which is a blatant lie!! I complained about this and next morning a lady called me from zomato saying they will communicate with the restaurant and that serious action against this. Zomato and that lady who called me in particular did an amazing job in refunding the money. If it wasn't for Zomato this restaurant who have just cheated me like they do to others I am sure.

Bite All Nite is a delivery only restaurant which serves north indian fare. While looking for restaurants to order from in swiggy and Zomato, I stumbled upon this one. The good rating made me order from them and I wasn't disappointed. The order was simple of Some Tawa Rotis and one Veg Kadai. The rotis were freshly prepared and were warm till the time we started eating. Veg Kadai, although a little oily, was brilliantly prepared and tasted awesome. The delivery was prompt and we were served within 40 minutes of ordering. I would definitely like to try the non-veg dishes when I order from them next. 
P.S. They are open till 4 am, So yayy to late night deliveries. ;)

The quality of the food served will definitely appease the taste buds and one wl not b left wanting for more. The delivery system (considering the brand is in its infancy) is also at par with the bigger players.
Thumbs up to d effort and definitely gets my vote.
Food for thought: online ordering may be attempted at a later stage.

The name "Bite All Nite" was not known until I was being treated by my friend for cracking a IT job. We ordered Mutton ¬†Biryani ,Chicken kasha and kadhai chicken on midnight . The food they delivered were freshly cooked and nice. Quantity is pretty good with very reasonable price and delivered in time as well.

Please carry on your Good services!!!
