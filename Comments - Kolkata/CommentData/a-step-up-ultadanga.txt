If you dont have any option, try it. Basically a dance bar. U can get hookah as well.price is high..and music is too loud that you cant have a proper conversation.food quality is okay.

Guys it's a dance bar, hence never expect a good ambience. Though drinks are costly, few starters are actually good enough but bit over-priced. Waiters are prompt but always looking for more tips; however they behave properly with regular customers. 

The usual crowd is cheap, so better avoid it as much as possible. And yes it's open till 1am.

I gave 3.0 because before my visit, I knew of its ambience and crowd nature, being the restaurant near to my home. The reason I visited here is that there were no other options available for me and my friend that day, otherwise definitely would have avoided. But, we had a slightly different experience from the reviews listed above. 

We walked in straightaway and found a table which was far from the stage. Lot of activities going on but we concentrated on what we  went there for, drinks and food. We ordered reshmi kebab and fried chicken, and both dishes were quite good and up to the standard. Booze was very cheap. The behavior of the waiter was nice and prompt. Was not interested in other activities which was going there, but definitely was fortunate enough to get to hear some great kishore kumar songs...

Do not visit unless you do not have any option....

Even if you have no where to go, stay hungry and avoid this place. I did the mistake of visiting this place during the Durga Pujo this year at midnight. We were looking for a bar cum restaurant and found this after searching for 1.5 hours. The experience was more than pathetic, we didn't expect cabaret dance here but there were around 5-6 girls dancing and singing to entertain the crowd. The people who visit here are local hoodlums and they don't mind fighting with the security guards and bouncers just to touch the girls. We were so hungry that we took a corner table far away from where the girls were dancing and ordered food. Let's say, they cheat their customers, take money, and give extremely low quality food that even your dog will refuse to eat. We asked them to bring their best food, but I guess the guy who was taking the order heard it wrong and brought the "worst dishes" they have. I had no idea about this place. I didn't heard about this previously. What's worse, after having food here I fell so sick that I had to stay in bed for the next 2.5 days and my Pujo was completely ruined. But it was my mistake to visit a third grade bar cum restaurant like this. A lesson well learned.

it's like a dhaba, with some girls crooning and dancing, the best way to describe this place in one word is utter bullshit, people making fast bucks come to this place for enjoyment and throws money as if they were piece of paper, no exhaust fan, very uncomfortable..

Loud, costly and full of lusty girls waiting to grab your money. Better go somewhere else if you want to enjoy.
