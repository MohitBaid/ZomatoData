Been here quite a lot of times, can't actually complain about anything about the quality of their sweets! Very good quality Gulab jamuns, and a few other sandesh. I really liked their Gulab jamun. The rates aren't high at all, keep up the good work.

Definitely the best sweet shop in the Tollygunge area. Never miss out on picking up sweets from here whenever I am travelling by. It is also the place which is visited before travelling to friends' places through this area. Quality is exceptional and has been maintained over the years, which is always the biggest challenge for eateries.

This one is between Prince Anwar Shah Road & Rabindra Sarabar Metro.

I come here quite often as it's the closest one among the sweet shops from my home & it's a nice one with good food.Â 

All kinds of Sweets specially the rosogollas are good. Samosa is very popular here but what I like the most is the delicious misti doi which always makes me hungry!!!

Located on the crossing of Tollygunj Phari on the right if you are coming from Tollygunk Metro Station towards Rabindra Sarobar. Visited number of times to this shop as they maintain standard quality. Love their chanar jilipi and samosas.

" Monomohan Sweets " {we have no branch}!!!
'New Manmohan Sweets' is a separate entity/shop/business altogether...doing piracy of photographs and using the fame and goodwill of the brand "Monomohan Sweets"
People please do not be fooled by such fake and fraud advertisements on Zomato !!! Please stop piracy or get ready 2 go behind the bars.
Contact: 9831180151/9051293244 @ Mintu Ghosh for orders over telephone...Thank you!

Sweets are really good here. Do try them when you are around tollygunge phari. Apart from sweets the evening snacks are also worth mentioning. Do try their paneer rolls (if they still continue to make them).

This place is located close to rabindra sarovar metro station on the foot opposite bhabani cinema hall . The place is prominently visible and is popular among both the young and old sweet lovers . The sweets are unusually large in size and look inviting . The kheer kodom is particularly recommended . The chhanar jilipi however had too much sooji in it that interfered with the raate if kheer , making it almost  tasteless .  The amriti here is good . They also have samosa, khasta kachori  , kachori . The khasta kachori and samosa is served with sweet  chutney . The shop looks neat and is a good choice to grab some sweet something for your loved ones .

Location: Tollygunge Phari Crossing; Adjacent to Asha Apartments.

This Bengali Sweet Shop has been here for years now and has been serving the people of Kolkata with a fare of decent quality. Earlier this sweet shop used to be counted amongst the renowned ones, but, with time taking its toll, Monmohan Sweets has slipped down the spot.
The place is pretty vapid with just a L-shaped display case for their fare.
This place has an array of sweets to offer along with a few snack-type savory options. SAMPLED the following from what they had to offer:

- Boondi
The boondi was warm and well balanced in terms of sweetness. Tasted nice.

- Samosa
Wasn't either warm or crunchy on the outside. The filling was just about decent to taste. Have had better tasting ones.

- Gulab Jamun
Served hot. Was delicious to taste but, nothing exceptional.

The STAFF wasn't as friendly as they could be but, did serve at a nice pace.
PRICES were found to be reasonable.

Overall was an average experience.
