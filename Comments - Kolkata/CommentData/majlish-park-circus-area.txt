Majlish is another restaurant cum bar of Hotel Executive Towers by the PC Chandra Group. While a group of friends had their booze from Silver Nest we thought of completing our dinner from here with their Chinese cuisine. 
Chicken Hakka noodles, fried rice and Gravy noodles along with chilli Chicken and Manchurian. The food was very average to be Frank and didn't quite like the ambiance too. Dark and shabby with limited seats. Taste of the food was not that great felt like having it from an ordinary roadside stall. For me it's below average not recommend at all for food but the booze is quite cheap though.
