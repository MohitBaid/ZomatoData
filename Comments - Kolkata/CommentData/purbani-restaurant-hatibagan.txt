I had a sudden craving for mixed noodles and headed out for this place as its nearby my house. The taste was good but I had hoped they would serve mixed noodles with egg, chicken and prawn and it turned out to be egg, chicken and mutton. You can try out their double egg noodles.

Nothing to say about the ambience here as it is a non-maintained old restaurant.... Food quality is so so.... Enough for a quick-bite but surely not very recommended....

A very nice place to reliving the past. While we are living in a very modern scenario, this Purbani Restaurant
 always maintain the tradition of vintage Kolkata. Their Chicken Afgani with Plain Paratha, is the best combination in my point of view, and in the Snacks section. Their  মাংসের সিঙ্গারা  is just awesome.

I have the worst experience from this restaurant.. Today I first visited Purbani. They are basically cheater. I ordered 1 plate chicken varta and 9 roti for take away . I gave the total bill of nine roti & 1 plate chicken varta. After coming home when I opened there was only 6 roti's.. very disappointing..

Purbani Restaurant is an old & well known  eatery located at Hatibagan.

Ambience is shabby and untidy with little sitting arrangements.

Service is quick.

Tried Chicken cutlet & fish fry , both were nice , a bit oily.

Pocket pinch is low.

This place has lost its charm and need renovation.

It's basically an old, small shop that prepares snacks like fish fry, moglai paratha, chilly chicken. The shop is not very impressive and it has a very unconventional sitting option. I feel some dearth of cleanliness . It's a low budget eatery. It's near Hatibagan, just after Star Theatre.

One of d most old resturant in north kolkata or we can say heritage resturant which is running more than 40 years. Food quality is ok type . They were famous for thr 'Mans r Singara' which also deteriorate day by day.... but still going on within limited capacity n it comes in few who hv CABIN facility till now. Nostalgic n its relation to Rupbani Cinema hall (uttam kumar, tarun kumar n suchitra sen etc. use to visit here )in old days will mk this resturant remembered.

A heritage restro that saw many celebrities from Tollywood like Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen etc when Rupbani Cinema Hall was functional during 1970s. They serve fried snacks and a few main course items. I love their saucy grilled chicken. But in past 15 years their quality has deteriorated quite drastically. Food quality and staff behavior has fallen down. Even due to lack of maintenance the interiors are falling apart. Feels really bad to see this condition. After 5years today I bought their keema samosa মাংসের শিঙাড়া. It tasted good but has lost it's charm.

This is not the place for either good food or ambiance. Old fashioned decors, not good ambiance and worse hygine.
The food is also below average, best to avoid.

Since childhood I've been home delivered from this place. Earlier it use to be a simple but well running restaurant with good crowd. Unfortunately, now other restaurants have come up in the same vicinity with attractive interior, competitive approach and organised serving.

Purbani must make it a point to rise. The quality of food, ambience, hygiene and staff selection all must be taken into account for improvement. The deterioration of the restaurant has reduced a large number of regular visitors. Now it has turned out to be a cheap take away joint for tarka and stuff like that.

Recently I have tasted their chicken noodles, mughlai paratha and chicken cutlets. The noodles were bland  but the other dishes were up to the mark. The only reason to return to Purbani is it's taste of food which is more or less good. 

It must be renovated before it extincts!

One of those restaurants that went out of business for their competitions. Cheap food, average quality but lack of ambition to grow when other eateries were growing up in the same vicinity. Which was once used to remain crowded in the evenings has become a place where people come to buy Tikia, Tarka and Rumali Ruti at night.

I used to like purbanis kosha maangsho n fish kobiraji ....
But both the food quality n ambience including cleanliness have deteriorated a lot....

Have dinner here tonight i.e. 17/04/16.. With rumali roti, haat roti n chickrn kassa.
The chicken kassa was a bit over-salty n the gravy was not that thick as it shd hv been.
