This place is located very near to my house and also near the NSHM college. It's mostly occupied by college students because of the close proximity of this place and also due to the fact that there is no better eating joint nearby. It's open and there are a few chairs in the name of seating. The food is very overpriced and compared to the price the quality is pathetic.

Food is tasteless, unhygienic, overpriced. Even beverages are sold at out of the box prices. The ambience here sucks too. Please do not ever go to this place.

This place located between NSHM Knowledge Campus and South City Garden in Tollygunge. It is almost always filled with NSHM students due to its close proximity to the college and because the area is devoid of any other good eating places. The menu provided here by Zomato is outdated at the moment. Since it is quite near to my house, I had ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles from the place. Although I initially felt, they charged a bit too much but the quantity provided by them justifies the price tag. The noodles tastes good as well and hence it is my go to place when I am struck by hunger.
