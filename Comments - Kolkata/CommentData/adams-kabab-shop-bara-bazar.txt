রমজান মাসে খাদ্যের সন্ধানে চিৎপুরের নাখোদা মসজিদ সংলগ্ন অঞ্চল আক্রমনকালে একদা এই দোকানের(আমি ও আমার ভাই) সামনে উপস্থিত হয়েছিলাম। পরিচিতি ছিল না বললে মিথ্যাবাচন হবে। আক্রমনের স্ট্র্যাটেজি ঠিক করার জন্য ইন্টারনেটের সহায়তা গ্রহণ কালেই এই দোকানের সন্ধান আমাদের নোটবুকে উঠে গিয়েছিল। তবে ওই ভার্চুয়ালি আরকি! সন্ধেবেলা চিৎপুর অঞ্চলে দোকানের খোঁজ করা(তাও গুগল ম্যাপের সাহায্য বিনা) যে গোলকধাঁধায় ইঁদুর খোঁজার সামিল তা অভিজ্ঞতাসম্পন্ন পেটুক মাত্রেই জানেন। চিৎপুরে কাবাব পরোটা খেয়ে এই আদমের কাবাবের,বা বলা ভালো সুতলী কাবাবের অন্বেষণে লেগে পড়লাম। খানিক চক্কর কাটার পর দোকান পেলুম,দোকানদার পেলুম, বলতেই সুতোয় টান মেরে কাগজের প্লেটের উপর জড়ো করে দেয়া কিমা কাবাব পেলুম,সাথে ফ্রি পেলুম পিঁয়াজ আর ধনেপাতার চাটনি। কিন্তু স্বাদে কিছু নতুনত্ব পেলুম না। "এমন একটি ঝিনুক খুঁজে পেলাম না,যাতে মুক্তো আছে"...আশাভঙ্গের দায় নিয়েই ঘরমুখী হলাম।

নাখোদা মসজিদের কাছেই খুঁজে পেলাম এই 'লুকোনো হীরে'। কাছাকাছি থাকলে "আদাম'স কাবাব"-এ একবার ঢুঁ মেরে আসতেই পারেন সুস্বাদু সুতা কাবাব আর বোটি কাবাব খেতে। দাম?? যথাক্রমে ২৫/- ও ৩০/- মাত্র।
বি.দ্রঃ গো-মাংস দিয়ে বানানো হয় এই দুই কাবাব। সন্ধ্যে ৭টায় দুটো কাবাব পাওয়ার সম্ভাবনা বেশি। আগে হলে বোটি কাবাব পাবেন না, পরে হলে সুতা কাবাব পাবেন না।

Adam's kebab shop is a little shop setup in phears lane very nearby nakhoda masjid. Situated in a very congested place where you would observe a common man weaving his art of skewering beef paste into delicious drool worthy boti kebabs. They specialise in making sutli/suta boti kebabs made out of beef.

A plate of suta kebab comes at Rs 25. The portion of kebab is quite commendable for the price charged. Chopped onion,chillies & a piece of lemon is given with the kebab. The kebab is too die for simply because of its taste & texture. The kebab was cooked to perfection in the chulha & flavours were spot on. The texture was very similar to galawti kebabs which just literally melted in our mouths. A must visit place if you are in this area

This place may surprise visitors who find themselves in this claustrophobic lane in the central part of the city. It shouldn't. Adam's Kabab shop played a pivotal role in spreading joy among numerous beef lovers for over a century! 


This place intrigued me on my very first visit today. I arrived near Phear's lane where the streets are jammed with carts and the smell of burnt meat cut through the humid Kolkata's very own "pocha-bhadro".


I knew my first stop: Suta Kebab (or, as they prefer to say "sutli" kebab) since the meat portion is held together by a thread (hence the name)! This food joint ( a rather hole in the wall) sells only 2 types of kebabs, nothing else! One is suta kebabs and the other more meatier variety boti kebabs. The moment I put the tender meat into my mouth, it's where I have just had an epiphany! What I tasted is an alchemy of the highest order. "This is how kebabs should be made..." said the man behind the magic (a direct descendant of Md. Salahuddin). And I couldn't agree more! 


Now I realised what the hype is all about. It's worth it! My final epiphany came by the time I boarded the train: Kebabs are much more than an indulgence. It's an art form!

Don't judge a book by its cover! Adam's Kabab shop at Phears Lane is a so-small joint you can miss it 90% of time unless you knew it. 

It's one of the best Kebab shop in Kolkata and definitely a hidden gem. They serve only beef sutli kebab & boti kebab. They grill it, and serve it. You can eat by standing on the road (no seat arrangement) or pack it to home. 

Coming to kebabs, I had only sutli kebab and it's umm...  heaven!! Hygiene freaks stay away!!

A very small, easy to miss shop in Phears Lane. They serve suta kebabs and boti kebabs. We only had the suta kebabs as boti kebabs were all finished within 7. The suta kebabs comes for ₹25 a plate(sheek) with onions anf a piece of lemon. The kebabs were absolutely mind blowing. We each had 2 plates within minutes. It just melts in the mouth. Most likely to visit again.

This small kebab stall situated at Phears Lane is a famous one with huge demand for the kebabs. The suta kebabs and boti kebabs are mind-blowing. They will melt in your mouth easily and will leave a delicious aftertaste. And it is cheap too! Win-win for all :-)

I have been to this place during the days of Ramadan. Situated in Phears lane near Nakhoda Masjid, it is easy to miss this shop as it's a small one by the side. An old man prepares the kebab and the other one serves. It is 25/- a plate for one sheek of beef suti kebab. The taste was yumm. You can also pack it and take. The location is very congested to stand and eat.

The best beef kebab you can get in town. I am in love with this kebab that was served. Its very cheap 25 rs per kebab. It is been served with onions chillis and lemon. It is very tender and melts in mouth. As it is made by the use of thread it is called sutli kebab. Although the location is very crowded and you can barely stand.but its all worthy after you eat the kebab. Surely will come again. Highly recommended.

After​ a long wait today I visited this shop. I only want to say one thing, if you don't have any problem with the main ingredient of this dish ( which is beef) you should definitely pay a visit to this place as soon as you can. I had beef before once or twice, but i did not like it. But this shop completely changed​ my opinion for this meat. 
We today hear "melt in your mouth" phrase very often. But when you try this kabab you will truly understand what does that phrase mean. The spice blend, the taste and texture was amazing. This is truly a hidden gem of Kolkata.

So we went on a search for the famous sutli kebab at Adam's. After going round and round in Phears lane and Coolotola Road, having asked multiple people for directions, finally located this hole in the wall shop-realising we had already passed this shop without noticing-grilling sutli kebabs. They tie a cotton thread round the skewers to prevent the meat from falling off while grilling, once grilled they take out the string and the meat crumbles and is served in paper plates with green chutney, onion and lemon squeezed over it. The warm melt in your mouth kebabs are simply fabulous and you feel like devouring plate after plate. The specialty here being the ingredients with which the meat is mixed and marinated which makes this joint so famous. Also wanted to try the boti kebab but is not available on Sundays, so I have another excuse to revisit.

Note- Place is situated next to Ilaquat Sweet shop.

It is pretty safe to say that Adam's Kabab makes the finest suti/sutli kababs this side of the subcontinent, let alone the whole nation. For the uninitiated, suti kababs are made by taking a paste of minced meat (it's a sacrilege if it's not beef) & spices and wrapping it up against a sheek with a piece of thread. You need the thread to keep the paste tied to the sheekh. A paste of this fine texture might just fall off in the coal pit (almost like an indigenous barbeque mechanism). It's almost a lost art. A required eating, it is an experience that is unique & must.

Deep inside Collutolla in Phears Lane, this place is basically like a pan er dokan, a hole in the wall where you pay 25 rs for a sheekh worth of kabab. Take the first big right on the right of Rana Pratap's Statue & walk straight. Keep watching the left side walls, it is really really easy to miss. Once found ask for as many sheekhs you want.

Now this will certainly not look like the most hygenic place out there, but stay with me. Let the old man or the young adolescent put the sheekhs above the red hot coals. You will see the meat starting to glisten, result of the pummeled-in fat coming out & tenderizing the kebab. You won't hear the sizzle as the din of the surrounding will drown it out. But you will see the charcoal heat finally searing into the kebab, with it starting to take an attempt at crackling. And you will know it's time. The man will take the sheekh off the fire, the meat off the sheekh & the suti out of the meat. And then he will put it all in it's crumpled glory on to a cheap plastic plate with a dash of chopped onion and an economically cut piece of a lemon. And what you will get, is the best thing 25rs can ever offer. 

Now, I've had a decent amount of meat over the years. Ranging from different animals to different parts of a single animal. Nowhere I've tasted meat that is this smooth. Your teeth will smush through the kebab with the barest amount of pressure. To consider that they did it with beef meat, is supremely commendable. Take a mouthful & you will get all of the flavours unfurling in your mouth. All the spices they use, complement the dish perfectly. They use lentil to bind the meat & the spices together in a mash. But I wouldn't have known that if they hadn't told me about it.

If you are not familiar with the back alleys of Collutolla, it's safe to assume that you will feel like walking into a different world. But when you will walk out of here after absorbing the essence of the place, you will be a whole lot richer in experience.

Make time for this little joint & go have their kebabs. Not a lot of places can survive for years & make a name for themselves serving only one single item in the menu. Go ahead. Squeeze the nimbu on the kabab, throw those chopped peyaaz on it. Experience this. Eat.

Oh my god! How could I miss this place? Back in my childhood, my dad used to bring me to introduce myself to the north and often I was brought here in his favourite kebab shop from Phears Lane during college days. Later, when I was in college, I often haunted down here.
The suta kebabs and boti kebabs here are a must. They are juicy, delicious and lovely. An age old place, I am very emotionally attached here. The prices are damn cheap. Definitely recommended. Lovely place. Happy Dining! :)

On most days you will find the current proprietor Md. Salahuddin at the helm, preparing the kebabs and grilling them. They offer only two varieties of beef kebabs. The famous suta / sutli / suti and the boti kebabs. While the first is priced at Rs. 25, the later comes at Rs. 30 / stick. Now, let us first see why these suta kebabs are so famous. They are basically sheekh kebabs, but here, due to high proportion of meat and under use of binders, the keema remains so soft, that a thread needs to be wrapped over it, to prevent it from falling while being grilled. After the kebab is done, the thread is removed and the crumbled meat served on a paper plate along with chopped onions, chillis and a wedge of lemon.

A few years back, I came across an article on Facebook which mentioned this shop among other rare dishes that should be tasted atleast once. Even though the name Sutli Kabab seemed interesting and I wanted to taste it, I put it off from my mind thinking that I would never be able to find my way to Phears' Lane. Now imagine my surprise when I stumbled onto this stop while on a Ramadan Food Walk(25.6.16) to Zakaria Street. It was a pleasant pleasant coincidence that I got to taste one of the tastiest Kababs made in the city with a bunch of foodies like me. It's located near Zakaria Street and you will have to ask around for Chuna Gali if you ever want to reach this place. Thankfully we had a very helpful guide who helped us find this place. The shop is located in a very narrow and not so clean lane and the street was swarming with people moving about. It is a tiny shop and you will not have to place to stand let alone sit. There were always people telling us to move. Anyway between the Boti Kabab and Suta Kabab, me and my sister settled for the latter. So did the other people in our group. It was my first taste of beef and luckily my first experience can easily called my best. The Kabab was tender and juicy and  spicy. And the price was a mere 25/-. Watching the old man make the Kabab made it all the more interesting and memorable for me. If you people ever want to taste good Kababs, please come here. Its going to be worth it.

This is the place in Kolkata which serves Suta kebab or Sutli kebab.It is located in a quite dingy lane around the Bowbazar area,in Phears lane,Chuna Gali, near Central Metro station and is brimming with people during Ramzan.This place should not be missed if one wants to go for a Ramzan food walk in Zakaria Street!

Have you heard of Suta or Sutli kababs? Have you seen an eatery serving only two dishes? Are you familiar with a 60 sq. ft. or so shop in your very own city of joy producing the best beef Suta kebabs in the country? If not, then you are surely in for a surprise! After reading this post it may seem to you that Calcutta has still more to offer and is just begging for some time and patience from your end. This city has thousands of folds of mystery trapped in it and one such culinary mystery is called ‘Suta kabab’.
 This place is called Adam’s Kabab Shop and is located in the dingy alleys of Phears Lane, Chuna Gali, near Central Metro station; the place is pretty close to the popular Nakhoda Masjid. We were a group of food reviewers and food bloggers out for a Ramadan Walk at the Zakaria street where during this holy month of Ramadan you will find several temporary stalls selling various food items. The streets here are extremely congested, and the crowd keeps on increasing as it gets dark. But I loved the fact that people do tend to adjust a lot which is quite necessary in such places. Now, as it is already evident these streets and most of the shops are very old and the shop we are going to discuss here i.e. Adam’s Kabab shop is also more than 100 years old! Very recently it has surfaced on social media (thanks to some passionate bloggers) and few people have come to know about this hole in the wall kinda place.

I had not heard of this place untill i went for the Ramadan food walk organised by PANCH PHORON ,as this place is located in Phears lane ,what i observed over here is a small little eating point and no provision of sitting or something ,like your next galli shop with no ambiance but the food available here have set a talking point in the city . The real Kabab is like everyone's loves it when its soft,tasty and fleshy for sure and when you get these then you would be a happy person indeed. Thats what happens here as a man who is running the business of Kabab's selling over some decades excels in his food making till date . What do you get here is just two special Kebab's one is boti Kabab and one is suta Kabab . Both have  a different taste but almost same texture and rich on taste . There is a charcoal flame burning and on top of it the Kebab is placed and waited to heat after mixing a nice masala coating on them and served with lime ,salad and sauce on a plate . After tasting it ,definetly has a good impression on me and i have noted this place down for a great recommendation for good Kebab's in the city and the pocket pinch is just 25 rupees so no complains for sure .

This is the most famous kebab stall in the Colootola area. This literally hole in the wall shop serves only two types of kebabs. The sutli sheek and the boti kebabs. A string is wrapped around the meat after fixing it to the sheek, and hence the name sutli. As the meat is very tender the string is used to keep it in place while grilling. 

I have been eating here for a long time now and must say their quality have gone down a lot. Still the boti is better than the sutli kebab, according to me. So if you want to try kebabs here, it is better to order the boti variety. 

Colootola has lots of wonderful kebab stalls, and I personally think there are better places than Adam's nearby.

These are very old and dingy places in old central Kolkata and the eateries near the same character. I have been coming to Zakaria St, Phears Lane and the Colootola area for over a decade for the rate kebabs and rotis and biriyanis, entirely beef. In fact there is a Aminiya and a Bombay Hotel in this area which serves excellent Moghlai fare, entirely beef. 

The speciality is the sootli kebab and the shammi kebab. I have had similar or comparable quality of kebab in Old Delhi and Lucknow. The taste and feeling is ethereal. Completely of a different time and ethos.

In all probabilities the owners of this joint haven't heard of Zomato. But Zomato users please take note of this place for you may be teleported to another dimension after tasting their suta (string) kebabs and boti kebabs.

They really do provide 'otherworldly ' experience. The suta kebab comprises nothing but minced beef and gizzards mixed with various spices and condiments. Since there is no binding agent used the kebab is held together on a sheekh with the help of a strings, which one needs to remove by one's own hand for that ultimate feel. The kebabs basically don't need any chewing, they just literally melt in the mouth. It also undermines the existence of the boti kebab here. But don't you miss that.

There is almost always a crowd around the shop eagerly awaiting their suta kebabs so one might have to wait for a while, but its totally worth the while. At 25 bucks a piece one is never enough. Don't worry about hygiene standards here. Just eat. And be teleported. To another dimension.

Tracing Genesis (of Kababs)

If there is any discovery I will remember for a long long time, it is Adam’s Kabab on Phears Lane, in the Colootola region of Kolkata. Quite the name among patrons, this is a hole-in-the-wall joint which only serves two varieties of beef kebabs – Suta and Boti. A million thanks to Rishav Dey for making me aware of its holy existence.

However, let’s cut to the meat of the story (or is it the story of the meat?). From Allen’s Kitchen, while ruminating on the pure ghee Prawn Cutlets, the two of us made our way towards Colootola. After much asking and walking, we ended up right in front of the destination. The first thing that captured my attention was the speed at which the artist was weaving his magic thread – and literally! The heart of the Suta Kabab lies in the thread which is wound over it, and once it is taken out after the grill, the soft kebab simply crumbles into a mass (maas, rather?) of heaven. I ordered two seekhs of it, enjoyed the aroma while it was grilled and then took over the plate with poignant anticipation. (I mean, really)

The first bite was indescribable – melt in your mouth, super tasty and I could eat this all day long. The meat was at perfect peace with the daal and the flavor can only be experienced, not described. What a winner! I recommend this place to every beef lover in Kolkata and otherwise – do visit Adam's Kabab if chance permits. 

PS: I packed 5 Suta seekhs and 3 Boti kababs for my friends, and they were devoured at lightning speed. The Boti is excellent too, an explosion of spices and slightly fatty chunks of meat. Droool…

Surprising that this is so less known...spread the word folks...
