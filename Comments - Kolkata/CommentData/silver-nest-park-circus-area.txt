A nice, cozy place to chill and booze with your friends. Dim lights and light background music evoke the mood completely. when My friends and I went there, we took beers with Red Pepper chicken and chicken Lollypop which were extremely delicious. Some of us took Bacardi or Smirnoff or tried out tequila shots.

This place was a complete bliss and easy on our pockets. We sat there for hours and carried on endless gossips in that exquisite ambiance. It is definitely a one-time tryout.
