I had ordered the fish and chips fr here. The taste was really good.tjough the size of two pieces of fish were small .Even the no. of French fries served were less. However the packaging was good and they even gave mustard sauce with it which was nice.

Worst place to eat out. No value for customers. Ordered a veg dish and got non veg instead and promised a discount of the cart value next time if I order but when I called they acted like we never had a conversation about it.

Ordered veg mac and cheese and cheese filo rolls. Food wasn't hot when I received. Packaging was good. The filling inside the cheese filo rolls was of vegetables and there was a small pouch of sour cheese was provided with it. Coming to the veg mac n cheese, it had the taste of raw milk which I didn't like it. Will not order these 2 dishes from TFT again. Delivery man was very courteous so the rating was for him and not for the food. If I have to rate the food then it will be 0.

Had the food home delivered. Thrice. Burger, chicken barbeque burger, and Chicken lasagna. And  non veg Chinese combo meal.  And there was a rare case when the manager himself comes to deliver(chicken lasagna)😅

Otherwise the courtesy, and an extreme delay in delivery once(Chinese combo), the food is excellent. There was perhaps no cornflour coating in the chilli chicken served, something which is a rarity. Thank you. Honestly. 

Lasagna was a perfect grail, almost holy, of cheese, white sauce and chicken. And delivered steaming hot. 

And the burger bread was soft and fluffy. Just the way I like it. 🙈

A food truck which sells a mixed bag of things.

I tried a couple of things. 

1. Grilled Chicken Maharaja Burger: A nice burger with a few add on options; overpriced.

2. Masala French Fries: Nothing much to say about this as it was fried as expected.

Hope to try out the other items on the a-la-carte.

After eating at their truck, I discovered that they have a central kitchen very close to my place. So I had to order from there and I was in for a surprise. They have recently introduced a new 99 Everything or Less Menu at the truck and I ordered a Veg Melt Burger, French Fries, Marble Cake Slice and Kiwi Cooler all for Rs.179! Each and every item was amazing. I had also ordered the Veg Au Gratin and it was one of the best I have ever had! Awesome job guys, keep it up!

Whenever I am staying in Lake Town or Bangur, this is my place to order from. Since they serve such a large variety of dishes, we always have hard time choosing what to order as everything is just amazing. While the wraps and maharaja burgers are always a part of the order, I have lately been fond of their Italian dishes.

We ordered Au Gratin, Risotto and Lasagna. I couldn’t decide which one was better. They were all simply amazing. Great job!

I simply love their food and have had lots of it whenever I am staying in Salt Lake at my friends' place. And of course, my favourite is the Scotch Egg Surprise.

The food here is quite tasty. I ordered their Grilled Raja Burger and as all good burgers should be the burger was very juicy and the chicken patty in itself was well seasoned. Their fries were not as good as they should've been, they tasted quite bland and picked up the entire taste of the ketchup once dipped;lacking any substantial flavour of its own. I'll like to order from them once again to see if they maintain their food quality over time.

The order was grilled chicken burger with cheese and fries, fish and chips and chilliy babycorn. 
Orde was 10min late coz the person couldnt find the address. 
Anyways the food was freshly prepared but not hot. The grilled chicken burger was ok, wuldnt order it again. The quantity of the fries was great. 
The fried fish was nice but very thin. For 100 bucks u cant expect more but wasnt upto the mark. The babycorn was alrite. 
For the price they charge the food is decent, all 3 items costed me 345 bucks. 
Dont think i will be ordering again

Being a regular customer at That Food Truck, I had to try TFT Kitchen. I ordered Scotch Egg Surprise which I regularly have at the truck, and along with it I ordered the Chinese combo coz I wanted to have a sumptuous meal. Though after reading another review in Zomato, I was a little apprehensive. Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed. It was delicious and something I wasn't expecting from a non-authentic Chinese place. Keep it up!

Ordered from TFT Kitchen for today's lunch. I had ordered a Veg Chinese Combo Meal and a plate of Cheese Filo Rolls. The combo came with veg chowmein and veg manchurian. The chowmein was average. The manchurian had enough gravy and was very spicy. Also, it didn't taste good at all. For the price of 100 rupees, the quantity is still justified. The cheese filo rolls tasted good.

First of all half the places don't know what a risotto is and ones that have it on their menu can never get it right. Tft kitchen has is down all right. Ordered chinese as well, which was pretty good. But Risotto is the winner! And double thumbs up for on time delivery!
