This place is the eating hub of J.U students mainly. After hour long lectures, students come to this place to satisfy their hunger with the good quality food served here. I am a frequent visiter here and I love the egg noodles, the schezwan fried rice, the momos,and of course,the pastas. Quality and quantity both are good. Price may seem bit high but then considering the ample quantity ,it is reasonable. Nothing special about the ambience; just a young chirpy hangout place where you can chill out with food and topics during free hours.

Moni Da's food café or Moni Da's canteen as it is popularly known as, is a favourite of all JU students! Great Chinese food at cheap prices is what they serve..My favourites are their Chicken fried rice and Chicken Chowmin.Their rice combo meal @ 65 bucks is good value for money. It contains half a plate of veg fried rice,2 pieces of chilli chicken, and a few pieces of crispy babycorn. Service is also decent. But the downside is the ambience..but you can't expect a very nice ambience at such low prices..If you are not a dog lover like me, then beware because you may find a fat dog sitting under your table while you are having your food..It's annoying.

This place is situated just outside  gate no. 4 of Jadavpur University. It serves Chinese dishes mainly. Being quite near to our department we often visit this place. 
I have tried chicken & veg chowmein,chicken pasta in red and white sauce, fried rice and chilly chicken and American chopseuy(chicken).. It costs ₹90. The veg dishes cost ₹60 and chicken ₹80. One plate is enough for two! So it's quite paisa vasool.
Apart from these usual dishes we also get special seasonal dishes like koraisutir kochuri in late winters. They too are just yum! And are far better in quality than the ones available elsewhere.
There are many tables, under a shade. Oh yes, and there's a lovely dog too ;) 
Ambience- 3.5/5
Food- 4/5
Service-4/5

I just had to review this place being a true blue 'যাদবপুর' material! This is a cosy shack located beside the celebrated 'chaar nawmbor gate' of JU. This place hosts a riotous crowd and if you are a pet lover, do pay a visit to moni da's because of that adorable dog! He is the cynosure of all eyes!

Coming to the food, momo, pasta in white and red sauce, dry chilli chicken, crispy chilli baby corn and fried rice are clear winners! Food is dirt cheap for one plate is enough for two. How could I forget Chicken Manchurian! Personally, I stick to these in Moni da's and I especially recommend pasta in red sauce.

So far as the ambience is concerned, it's an added bonus! Jukti-torko-adda fill the air. If you are expecting a prim and propah set up, well this will disappoint you! But if you want to taste life, this place is yours! And how! Well, I am heavily biased towards this place for reasons not unknown! Every Jadobourian is, actually. :D do pay our dear Moni Da's cafe a visit. This place will remain etched in your heart for long, truly!

Moni da's food cafe is located with NCE Bengal and IBM,Jadavpur University.This is a popular place among university students.They used to serve decent pastas and momo.Prices are little high in comparison of the quality of the food.It's an open place,not air conditioned.Good place to hang out.Food can be better.

Brilliant Chinese food. Especially, what makes it special is the JU nostalgia and its pocket friendly price. Saucy toss and Garlic chowmin are some of its exquisite dishes. Not a place if you are looking for a cozy, air conditioned date but the ideal one if the food is prime priority.

This place is next to JU's 4no. Gate. This spot has been my hangout place for like 3years now. Absolutely pocket friendly for some lip smacking chinese food.
Must try here: schezwan noodles, momo and crispy chilli baby corn .
