Ordered Mango cheesecake via Zomato online on 1st January. Took more than 3 hours to deliver. The cake was excellently packed, perfectly made. It was soft, succulent and extremely tasty. May be it needed little more freezing, but I understand the rush in new year's day. A little pricy... But taste compensates for that. Thoroughly recommended.

Post order, Got a call from them saying they would bake it fresh & deliver in 2 hours.

Post delivery, though it was nicely decorated. Taste wise it was okay. Was not at all spongy as i would love, on the dry side which is not expected from a freshly baked cake. For a half kg cake its way too expensive.

Ordered a sunflower gateaux for my father. It was delicious to taste and a feast for the eyes. The cream used was absolutely fresh and of excellent quality. Not just that, a candle and a knife to cut the cake came with the box. The product was delivered in very good time. I would recommend everyone to try Le vanilla, at least once.

Awesome cake ... So fresh... one of the best cakes I have ever had. Normally one gets such quality cake in a 5 star or 7 star for places.

Best Choco Truffle Cake ever had.

Far better than Flurry’s, French Loaf and Cakes.

Thanks to Le Vanilla for the quality of cake. Keep it up.

One of the best bakeries in Kolkata. I was introduced to this online bakery by one of any friends who surprised me with a yummy and nicely presented black forest cake on my birthday. Since then it has been my favourite and I have ordered cakes multiple times from them and always been studied with the taste and service.

Ordered the Multi Coloured Rosette (500gms) - Chocolate flavoured cake for my mother's birthday today. 

It arrived slightly later than the 12pm slot, but the wait was worth the while.

To start with, the cake looks absolutely beautiful - bright and charming and absolutely matching with the pictures online. Tastewise, I cannot remember the last time a cake in this price range was so delicious - the cream was light and fresh, the food colour used was obviously of great quality, and the base cake low on sugar and absolutely perfectly soft and delicious.

The reasonable price makes it even more attractive. If they continue with this quality of products, I will definitely not turn to any other alternative for ordering cakes in the future.

Can't wait to try out the other products.

Undoubtedly the best quality cake in Kolkata!Le Vanilla is an online cake store. We had ordered the chocolate plum gateaux for my birthday recently. Delivery was prompt, it came very well packaged. Ordering online is so easy and hassle free! I have previously even placed an order from USA for a photo cake to be delivered to my parents in Kolkata as a surprise, which was perfect.
The cake was large and had a beautiful glossy chocolate finishing with enormous chocolate-covered plums. Even better, the roses on the cake were made of actual solid white chocolate instead of the usual cream frosting! :-D The cake was soft, moist and airy, with a melt in your mouth texture, exactly as they claim to be. You can taste the difference immediately - it is rich in chocolate, just the right amount of sweet. The cream is light. Most importantly, it is completely non-greasy - not a trace of oil was left on our hands. They also claim to be low cholesterol and healthy, which they certainly live up to. So you can eat your way through the cakes, guilt free! :-) When I bit into the cake, I found that it had a surprise filling of chocolate chips and plum pieces, which added a crunchy, rich texture and a wonderful burst of flavour to the soft cake! 
Everyone who tasted the cake loved it and was eager to know where it was from! There is no comparison with birthday cakes from other shops in Kolkata, even the high-end ones in terms of quality - all other cakes I have tried tend to be extremely greasy and quite dense.  The price is very reasonable considering the superior quality and quantity, and delivery is free! I would highly recommend this place for all your cake needs. The best part - even if you're not in the city, you can send cakes to your loved ones in Kolkata, from anywhere in the world! I cannot wait for the next occasion to get cake from here. ^_^

Firstly, their online payment is slow & dated. When I made the mistake of paying them online, I thought the service would cover up for it. But it was worse than that. On getting the message regarding the details of the delivery boy & his number, I kept on calling him from 12:30pm (as the delivery time chosen by me was between 12-3pm), but his phone was switched off. When till 3pm there was no information from him, I called up their office number. The concerned people kept on telling me that it would get delivered in sometime. It was 4:30pm but there was no sign of the cake! My patience was being tested, I asked the office people to connect me to the manager. The manager too didn't show any respect & commitment & kept on asking for more time. How much more time??!! 
Finally, the cake got delivered at around 5:30pm, and what a sight it was. The cake was totally squashed, as you can see in the pictures, & it was not worth gifting it to anyone. It was so embarrassing for me to present the cake in front of the guests.

My boyfriend had ordered a sunflower gateaux cake for my birthday. The cake was very colourful and was good in taste. The cake was very soft and fresh. It melts in the mouth. Ut was moist, chocolatey and not over sweet. It was perfect in taste and I loved the cake. It is a online store. They delivered my cake at my doorstep free of cost and on time.

Disgusting service. Planned for a party and ordered some quiches. They did not turn up in time. Moreover they explained us that they had to buy chicken from some shop, which was closed, and then there was some power cut in the kitchen. Next, they switched their phone off. So, whoever orders needs to take care of their supply chain as well. And don't forget to ensure them with a steady supply of electricity. This is thoroughly unprofessional. I would recommend everyone to stay away from this institute.

I am editing this review to add in a few more information, otherwise my review would be biased. The food, when it ultimately arrived was indeed delicious. We had a delectable experience. The quiche was well made, the wraps were perfect. I would edit my review points the next time if they don't screw up next time from the delivery perspective.

My faith in Le Vanilla  has been restored not once but twice. This hasn't been my first experience in ordering the cake and I believe that because my first order was extremely satisfactory became the reason for me to place my second order for my parents anniversary. I have ordered web truffle and triple chocolate and I must  say that I was very pleased with both the cakes. It was moist and had a very delectable taste of chocolate. Not too bitter not too sweet, just the perfect quality of chocolate that everybody would love. The guests and relatives have all asked about this outlet, so Le vanilla be prepared to serve more and more customers and win their hearts too! I will definitely keep placing my order here again and again because I know that this place wont let me down.

Le Vanilla has been the usual supplier for our office birthday party cakes. Recently, I have ordered from Le Vanilla for my wife's birthday too. What I like about Le Vanilla is their consistent quality and the timely delivery.

As I have already mentioned that we usually order cakes from Le Vanilla for our office parties I have already sampled quite a wide variety of cakes that they offer. My personal favorite has been Choco Web Truffle, Choco Load, Choco Truffle Drum and the wide variety of cheese cakes that they offer.

Price wise a bit on the higher side, however I would recommend the cakes to any one due to the sheer quality. I will even vouch that the cakes are at par with the best cake shops available in Kolkata, sometimes even better. I wish them luck and hope they will soon come up with a shop in the city which we can visit sometimes. Till then you are doing absolutely fine in the online market.

From the sweetness to the consistency and from the to the presentation to the packaging , I had no complaints. I just wish next time they add some more of blueberry into the cheesecake itself apart from the curd.

I used to order cakes from Le Vanilla for more than two years. The number wouldn't be less than 15, different sizes and different flavors. They are ok for smaller cakes, a pound or two max. But for any important occasion I would suggest to avoid Le Vanilla at any cost.

Their cakes look delightful and bright. Always fresh but in most cases soggy. Feels like its filled with water. Taste is very ordinary compared to the price they charge. In one instance they replaced the cake because the first one they delivered was unbaked. Delivery, in most cases, was on time.

On my daughter's 2nd birthday, I ordered a 2.5 kg (5 lb) cake. They delivered a cake, so small that we could hardly make 24 pieces from it, each 1cm thick at its widest part. It was an embarrassment in front of the guests as I couldn't serve them all with a piece. 24 thin slices from a Rs.3,500 cakes sounds exorbitant. Apprehension was, they cheated us on the cake size/weight. No refund or replacement would ever give me back the birthday of my daughter. Never.

When I called up and complained the owner argued that I was wrong and apparently I didn't know how to cut a cake properly. Upon further verbal review he told me that he would check with the Chef and call me up the next day to inform exactly what went wrong. It was August 28th, 2016 and I am still waiting for that call. I presume that he is still "checking with the Chef".

Very ordinary, overpriced, unreliable and untrustworthy - Not at all recommended if you are planning something significant or a once in a lifetime event.

Superb collection of boutique cakes be it your birthday or anniversary or any occasion apt to order a cake. They provide the best and I have never been dissatisfied or disappointed with their cakes. They mix the right amount of sweetness and flavour and gives our sweet tooth the perfect blend of everything required for that cake of your choice. To experience it, order and enjoy.

Well, a friend of ours had invited us over for his B’day celebrations, and it was fellow Zoman Krishanu Das (no intros required for him ……. I guess) who suggested this bakery to me. I went ahead and ordered their Choco Glaze cake for office delivery – priced at Rs. 650 – free delivery mind it! They did call me up asking for a few specifications and baked the cake accordingly. It is noteworthy that they bake half kg cakes instead of single pound ones.

Cake was delivered a few minutes beyond the stipulated deadline, which is ok. Full marks for presentation, also the taste was good. All their cakes are made to order, hence, always expect them to be fresh and soft. Yes, cream content was definitely high as well as the amount of choco chips was so much, that at times, I felt like having plain choco chips only.

One can however, try out this place, but please place the order 4 hours prior to the required-by-time.

Le Vanilla - Still the best bakery shop and my favourite of all till now.I can blindly trust the cakes and other desserts of Le Vanilla and the quality.Awesome experience.

First time I ordered a chocolate web truffle cake online and the delivery time is also excellent done within promised time.The cake was freshly baked and the flavour was so soothing and delightful.A big 👍..Would recommend everyone to order cake from here once..

Again a superb experience! No words.. The Easter cake cake was Just awesome, fresh, tasty and properly baked.A big 👍 from ours side. Keep it up.The service was also too good.

Ordered chocolate triple rose cake on the birthday occasion of my Dad.I ordered also their almond cookies, non veg crepes and veg quiche for the first time, trust me the taste and quality were too good and they gifted a small choclate box.A treat to the taste buds.All my family members loved the items.May be this is the 6th or 7th time I am ordering bakeries from Le Vanilla and in future i would continue to. !!

Le Vanilla cakes are by far my favourites now! I was looking for something exceptionally nice, considering the fact that all cakes are quite generic in nature when I found this place a few months ago. Fluffy and light, this is exactly what cakes should be. Thankfully they don't need to hide their mastery at baking with an overdose of sweetness, so they are perfect for a calorie conscious person. Their end product is of international standards. It's like, they make the stuff you see on MasterChef! And they are a delight for the taste buds. Yummm....

Good to see the presence of Le Vanilla on Zomato, finally. I had ordered a chocolate cheesecake for my boyfriend's birthday. The delivery was a bit delayed, yet the product was worth a buy. Very subtle on the palette, not overly sugary or overpowering flavours; a perfect balance of cream cheese and chocolate. Not a fan of biscuity base with cheesecakes, however this one came with a thinner base which was decently tolerable.

Since the time I had placed the order, I am receiving promotional pictures, videos and messages from Le Vanilla over WhatsApp. I won't mind receiving texts via SMS, however, WhatsApp is a bit too personal space. Plus as I have turned on the option for media auto download when the WiFi is on, for my convenience, I would not like to download promotional videos all the time, especially when I am not planning to get a cake for a particular occasion. Why don't you people upload the videos on your website and forward the link over SMS. Those who are interested to avail a particular offer, would go ahead and watch.

Received a surprise cake from my brother for the occasion of my birthday at midnight.Needless to say receiving a cake at midnight with such promptness is by itself going to make one feel special.The chocolatty taste and a little bit of crunch inside due to the choco chips was an absolute delight.The authentic swiss taste and the correct amount of sweetness is enough to satisfy your sweet tooth...the taste that lingers on for a while !
Loved Le Vanilla.. recommended for all !

I got Sunflower Gateau from Le Vanilla for my mother's birthday. The cake looks ravishing, too good to be cut.
However, one Huge drawback is their delivery time. I got my cake delivered 2hours late, that also after threatening to refuse to take the cake beyond a certain limit!!. If you're particular about receiving cake on time then please keep loads of extra time in hand before choosing a delivery slot.

Well thats the only word that comes to my mind right now. Absolutely overjoyed with the service from Le Vanilla. Everything about them, the service, the product is just too good. The cake turned out really nice and made our homely celebration just perfect. Keep it up and thanks a ton !!!

It is horrible place for online shopping!!!! icing is synthetic, artificial smell, and flimsy. Packaging is not strong or durable. Our cake broke & the fault was apparently not theirs (it was the soft box's fault!!!!!!!!! )
No guarantee on what you see in the website!!!! (your cake will neither look the same or taste the same). IT will be a bad investment.

You have been warned!

I have ordered a Mango Kiwi Gateaux in The month of January. The delivery time was as promised and the cake was so fresh and light. Everyone loved it. But I think in some cases price is a bit higher. All over a good experience. Thank you.

Just because the cake was exactly like the picture and was delicious in taste I can give le vanilla as a confectioner a 5/5 and I must say,  I am impressed with their customer care executives but I was extremely disappointed with their delivery person.At an age where other e-commerce portals take and deliver orders at exact time and place with the help of a gps enabled phone this guy bluntly told us he cant deliver the same at doorstep(which is 20 steps from golpark bus stop- a prime location) and ordered us to quickly come at a point he us standing to take our order..It was already late so we obeyed but this whole episode is very disappointed and its my request to le vanilla to not to recruit  such unprofessional people like them

Had ordered one black forest cake for my friend. Had interaction with staff on phone. They were very polite. baked a fresh cake and delivered it on time. 
The cake was tasty and beautiful. Price is justified for what they delivered.

Clearly one of the best things to have happened to Kolkata's bakery scene. I came across Le Vanilla as I desperately looked for options to send a cake to my 10-year old nephew in Kolkata (I stay in Delhi), given that my faith in Flury's and Cookie Jar has been shaky since I last ate there. Instantly, I was sold to the concept of Le Vanilla. And there were so many options to choose from. The online ordering process was smooth and they use Pay U Money which gives buyers protection from fraud.

After scanning the whole menu, we chose the Melon D'Lite, which frankly is a novelty you won't even come across in Gurgaon...The cake was fantastic - delightful to see, and delightful to taste. And sufficient for a kid's party!!

And after some confusion around delivery time (turns out residential deliveries are made only after 5 pm, which was not clarified to me earlier), the team took extra effort to get the cake to my cousin's house. And when they couldn't locate the house, they first called me to take permission to call my cousin in case the cake was meant as a surprise. How thoughtful....My cousin and my nephew were really happy with it all, including the two slices of real watermelon on top of the cake.

I am so glad I found this place, and look forward to eating their cakes myself when I visit Kolkata.

Note to owner: There will always be haters. But it is rare to find establishments with a vision, and your vision to produce perfectly balanced taste cakes instead of pounding the palate with sweetness is a worthy one. Please stick to this level of confectionery and service!

Ordered one lucid crunch for a friend's anniversary. The website says "the original product may not resemble completely with the pictorial representation." Got a cake which looks nothing like 900 rs worthy! I think it is high time to stop experimenting with bakeries in Kolkata!
Edit: They have done an amazing job with the second cake, in such hostile phase of election. Thank you team. At least you did something good!

My friends from Bangalore wanted to send a cake for my birthday and since Kolkata has limited options for this and to top it I stay in an area where delivery is nearly impossible thanks to the one way traffic.
Le Vanilla saved them by delivering the cake alright. But the shops policy is to deliver no matter what! Since the number given by friend was unreachable,the delivery guys took it upon them to open our gate and knock on the bedroom door to deliver. What creeps! They didn't bother to ring the bell or knock on the main door. On calling upon the number given the person spoke very rudely and justified his delivery boy's action since the phone was unavailable. Even though the bell was there and clearly working!

Coming to the cake. The cake had a soggy taste. Felt as if it was dipped in water and brought. Sweetness level zero.

Ordered from this place multiple times for office celebrations. Elated with the idea of cheese cakes delivered to office,we ended up ordering all variants of cheese & was heavily satisfied. Special mention goes to the blueberry cheese cake & the Irish cream cheese cake.Though,the mango cheese cake was not as good as other variants of cheese cake. Riding high on the expectation set by the cheese cakes,I ended up ordering my anniversary cake, which was a triple chocolate rose cake. This was highly disappointing. The chocolate base was soggy & pretty tasteless,much to my disappointment. The "chocolate roses" were equally disappointing. It practically wasnt worth 1/3rd the money I spent on it. Learned to stick to an outlets best,will order only cheese cakes from this place going forward. The best part is the ease of ordering through their online portal & their delivery services.

Sitting a 1700kms away from your parents on their special day is not ideal! I wasn't keen on sending flowers...they die! I searched and scanned many a websites... all the cakes and flowers and gifts seemed so mass produced! I wanted something really special for my very very special Ma and Baba. Le Vanilla was the best choice ever!!! Their website is very impressive and user friendly... The customer service could not be more personalised and polite. Now coming to the cake - though I could not taste it, since I live in Chennai, the way my parents and grandparents took turn to call me and rave and rant about its taste was enough to put a smile on my face! In their words "exquisite", "could beat any 5 star kitchen" , "just divine"!! So thank you Le Vanilla for bringing so much joy and creating lingering memories through your divine treats!!!

I ordered one Marble Ring. The test is horrible. It is hard and the preparation is much below the standard. I will never come back to this Cake shop. Online payment system is also not good. Totally disappointed and the experience is far below from the initial expectations. Not recommended.

You know how at birthday parties, you ask the host to cut out the cream before handing you your piece of cake? That has stopped happening ever since my friends and I discovered Le Vanilla. 

The cream, the sweetness, the entire cake is so mild that it leaves you licking your fingers. 

In fact Le Vanilla has become my default gift for every party. The hosts love it, the guests love it and I get a piece too ;)  

Their cakes are real fresh; you can make out they’re just out of the oven and they’re never dry like in other bakeries. My favourite is the Blueberry Cheesecake, Chocolate Cheesecake and Fruit Gatauex. But I want to try all their flavours, one birthday at a time. 

Keep it up, Le Vanilla and thank you!

To begin with I really want to thank Le Vanilla for making my birthday so special. My friend had ordered a Triple Chocolate cake and a few Decorative Muffins online.. The cake and the muffins taste fabulous. Even though the  delivery was a little late the taste made up for it. Overall it was a good experience..

Worst ever experience-
I order a Tiramisu Cake egg less cake after going through the long discussion with a lady from Levanilla
She registered the order with number 100000196. The She call me after 15 mins saying that the Cake will cost me 60 Rs more.
I said no problem pls deliver the order on time. Then again I got a call in which I learn the above cake is not available in egg less option. I said pls cancel the order, saying I'll not place any order to them again. Very un professional.

A favourite among my friends and me, Le Vanilla cakes are always a part of all our celebrations. Birthdays, anniversaries, bachelorette, these cakes  make our evenings so special. Since the time we tasted our first cake, Fruit Gateau, there has been no other brand for us.

The cakes are very tasty, soft, moist, airy and extremely light. It doesn't make you feel heavy as very less butter is used. And the fresh cream is also light and fluffy. The sweetness is just right, not sickly sweet like the ones we generally find. 

A must try for all, Le Vanilla cakes are a class by itself. Taste and health, they are a perfect combination of just the right ingredients mixed with love and care.

Some of their classics are the gateaus (fruit, strawberry, etc. : made with fresh fruits, no synthetic flavour) and cheesecakes. Make sure you order a little extra because it's not possible to stop at just one or two pieces.

Hope to try a new flavour soon

I always preferred cakes from Flurys, Kookie Jar, and Cakes. Apart from that I loved California Pizza Kitchen desserts, Tiramisu and Red Velvet Cake. Given them am never impressed with any bakery. But The Vanilla changed that!! And they delivered to my home. Service is the key, they are courteous, on time, and always is open for feedback. Even the snacks are awesome, Crepes and Quiche I had tried they were generously filled with fillings. Cheesecake gosh what can I say immaculate, superb, tried both Blueberry and Strawberry, though the later was a less cheesy but that could be coz of 25th Dec rush. Also had the Pineapple Upside down cake which and the Fruit Cake were awesome. You must try them, you have my word!!

The Mango Cheesecake of 28th was also quite good with authentic Alphonso pulp.
The service is very personalised, which really helped.
Definitely worth ordering from, on a regular basis.

Finally a place in the city that will serve you cheesecake!! That in itself sounds promising. Christmas morning saw a delectable one pound blueberry cheesecake delivered at our doorstep. Awesome service. Cheesecake was eggless, fluffy, airy, with delicious blueberry topping and beatiful sturdy base. Loved it. The fact that they will deliver anywhere in kolkata is also a plus. Looking forward to tasting all other delicacies from here. Yum!
