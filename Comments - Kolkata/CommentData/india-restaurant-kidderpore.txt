India has become my most favorite place ever since I visited it on Thursday afternoon for a wholesome lunch with my friends. If Biriyani is the love of your life, and if you feel that you get the best of the lot in your Arsalans, it's time you give it a second thought. India's Dariabadi Biriyani which is one of their signature items is one of the best things I tasted this new year. Awadhi Biriyani on the other hand, isn't too rich, and is a perfect choice for those who want their Biriyani to be light. Talking about their Kebabs, the utterly delicious Galauti Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha is simply out of the world, making it the most desirable starter you could think of. Cheese Chicken Kebab is outstanding as well- big juicy pieces of chicken being wrapped in cheese this ensures that you are delighted and satisfied to the core. We also tried their Honey Fish, which was unexpectedly one of the best dishes I ever tried as a part of the Awadhi Menu. The use of honey and sesame seeds in an Indian kebab starter is quite unique and we all loved the way the whole dish tasted. Chicken Butter Masala and Chicken Masala were the unsung heroes, giving perfect company to our Dariabadi and Awadhi Biriyanis. Lastly, came in the desserts, Firni and Shahi Tukda- both were extremely well made and it was the perfect way to end such an elaborate and delicious spread. Next time I crave Biriyani or Kebabs, I am surely heading towards India, and you should too for all the right reasons. The ambience and service were really pleasant and we were served with a warm smile, which was the best part of our luncheon. Keep up the good work guys!!

This place was in my wish list for long, fortunately I visited this place yesterday. Locating this was not difficult at all as it's just beside fancy market in khidirpore, the entrance is not that big but after you enter it's huge dining space will definitely amaze you. I just loved their theme, decor and the seating arrangement. The decor is aesthetic, with beautiful lights having mughal design, architecture is also reflecting the authenticity of the place.

The menu is pretty extensive it was difficult to choose from but I went with the suggestion, few trademark dishes of this place I chose to Hogg on. 

Galouti kebab- The kebab was so delicate that it was breaking while I took it to my plate, no doubt it had a melt in mouth consistency. Very rich with the umami and Mughal spices. It was served wIth Lucknowy parantha, again very soft and flaky.

Chicken cheese kebab- Chicken kebabs wrapped with layers of cheese served with pudina chutney and salad, the chicken pieces were moist and cheese was complimenting the chicken well.

Honey fish- Another delicacy, as I'm an ardent fan of seafood this dish was my most favorite one. The taste was very new for me, sweet and savory both and so delicious. 

Chicken Butter masala- Very rich consistency of gravy, soft and succulent pieces of chicken along with garlic naan was pretty good start to my main course. This is a must try for chicken lovers.

Chicken masala- This was fine tasted good enough, nothing special to mention about it, went well with the naan.

Mutton dariabadi biryani- This is a bit similar to hyderabadi style of biryani, very spicy and the quantity was huge, it suffices two person. 

Mutton awadhi Biryani- This dish is a signature of India restaurant, it comes in a sealed clay handi. When the lid opens the aroma of the spices makes your appetite rise to 100 then and there. I loved the rice texture and the fried onions were just adding a great flavor to the entire preparation. Mutton pieces were very soft and were intact with the juices, as it got the flavors from the Biryani. This should be enough to make me go visit this place again and again.

Firni- So balanced with the sweetness, taste was very good as it is made very traditionally, you can literally get the taste of kheer and rich milk cream. 

Shahi tukda- This was a great ending to my food hogging session and tasted just about right. 

The service was excellent and the staff were very courteous, they suggested quite well and I rejoiced my entire lunch scene at this restaurant. If you have time and think of having Indian food then India restaurant is a place you must not miss on.
Ps- Don't forget to order your glass of coke while ordering, it helps a lot.

Just one word.. Perfect!
1) Starters - Honey fish (310 bucks) A bit to the sweeter side since it has honey..comes in 6 pieces with a few veggies and it's a dry preparation.

2) Main course - i) Awadhi Biriyani (350 bucks) Prepared in a clay pot and sealed with maida..when the lid is opened the aroma that comes out will fill the air..more than suffice for 2 persons..4 medium sized pieces o mutton lots of rice and a piece of aloo..a small bowl of raita is served with it.

ii) Mutton Rara Punjabi (270 bucks) Very delicious..it was recommended by the one who was serving us..and it completely complemented the Awadi Biriyani..4 medium sized pieces of mutton..and a baby potato..

3) Dessert - Shahi Tukda (80 bucks) Very yummy but till the dessert arrived we were so full to judge it's taste..

4) Drinks - One lime soda (60 bucks) and mohito slush (110 bucks)..the lime soda is just too common we always have..latter is strongly recommended..has a sweet sour taste..

Overall..India has crossed my level of expectations..each and every dish starting from the Chinese starter to the mughlai cuisine..everything was pitch perfect..
And they would add gst to the bill..that would be all..

India Restaurant is indeed the legendary outlet of Kolkata which serves brilliant mughal delicacies. Their transformation is quite prominent with luxurious decor. The ambience is outstanding and it is a paradise for all biryani and kabab lovers! The restaurant is located just beside fancy market at Kidderpore. 
Coming to the food we had, 

üéÜ Honey Fish : Boneless fish pieces cooked with honey, onion, savoury sauces and chinese spices was the star of the evening. The fish was of best quality, soft , sweet as well as it had little heat in it. Honey fish was served with sated bell peppers and onion which gave the dish a different texture and taste.  

üéÜ Cheese Chicken Kabab : Chicken kabab coated with cheese and served hot. This dish should be eaten when hot. The cheesy affair with juicy chicken pieces is a big hit on their menu. The chicken pieces are sumptuous and worth every penny.

üéÜ Mutton Galawti Kabab : Minced mutton mixed with Mughal spices and fried to give a crisp exterior. The kabab was very delicious and rich in taste. The kabab was accompanied with hot Lucknowi parathas.

üéÜ Chicken Masala : Big chicken pieces with rich and creamy gravy and indian spices and garnished with coriander leaves gave it a hint of different favous. It was accompanied with Hot Garlic butter naan.

üéÜ Chicken Butter Masala : Boneless chicken made along with makhani gravy and lots of butter. This dish was served with garlic butter naan. The chicken was juicy and tender and the spices was right on point.

üéÜ Daryabadi biryani : Aromatic basmati rice cooked with two pieces of mutton, dry fruits, egg, and mixed with special spices. This biryani can only be found in this restaurant. This biryani us heavy, rich spices and dry fruits makes the luxury quotient higher. The mutton was very tender and tasty, melted in the mouth, the potato was soft and well spiced. 

üéÜ Mutton Awadhi Biryani : Aromatic basmati rice with four pieces of mutton, mixed with special spices and served in clay pot with raita. This biryani is light yet tastes like heaves. If you are a biryani lover then you will find this dish amazing and will want more.

üéÜ Shahi tukda : Soft bread soaked in kesar milk with perfect amount of sweetness. 

üéÜ Firni : My favourite kind of rice pudding. Great dish for all the sweet tooths of kolkata. 

I had a great experience with India Restaurant and will be going back these any time soon! ‚ù§

As far as Mughlai is concerned Indian Restaurant is numero uno. There can be no comparison with the food quality that they serve. This is one place who have consistently maintained their food quality...rather I would say they have improved with time. You order anything from the menu and it lives upto the standard.

Delicious and very tasty foods are available here. Also, their service is very good. The following items are must try here:

1. Mutton Kacchi Biryani, which comes with one large piece of mutton, dry fruits, one potato and one egg.

2. Mutton Awadhi Biryani, which comes with four pieces of mutton and served in clay pot. Quantity is too high. One biryani can be ordered for two people.

3. Mutton Galawti Kebab, which comes with four pieces of kebabs and four slices of bread. This is one of the most delicious items available here.

4. Shahi Tukra, which can be ordered for dessert. Really delicious.

The side dishes were so yummy. We had ordered Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Peshawari Butter Masala and Chicken Hariyali Butter Masala. Everything in this place is just perfect. Great place for a family dinner.

India restaurant in Khidhirpur totally has the best biriyani ever. I went with a couple of colleagues few days back and it was such a delightful experience altogether!! üòá
Speaking about the decor and ambiance, it‚Äôs very good and gives a grand feel. We had the cheese kababs in starters and other varieties of kababs but the cheeze kababs are definitely worth the mention. They melted as soon as they were in the mouth. So very yummy üòç
Also the place is pretty inexpensive and quite a good shot if you‚Äôre looking for good Indian food.

This restaurant has two section. One is the main section which is downstates which is great at services. And the other is the Newley opened on top. Guys it a superbly made place specially in an area like khidderpor. Know for its netourious behaviour and goons. 

I would have given 5 * but the staff upstate‚Äôs are very rude and they make u feel they are doing a favour by serving you food. The staff is a typical khidderpor guys. Absolute rude and ready to fight. Special the Christian guy who speakers English and thinks the sun shines from his ass. Jonhitan is heirs name. A typical khidderpor guy. Plz do not go with ladies or friends. And if you go. Please visit the one below. 

Food is good at both the section since its the same kitchen. Nothing to complain about food. But beware of the staff in the upstate‚Äôs section.

In love with this place. Food and ambiance make this place unique from others. It is located near fancy market. It serves legendary biriyani. I went there 2 times. Each time it mesmerises me. We tried there signature dishes, chicken cheese kebabs, kachchi biriyani. Both of them are mouthwatering. In addition we tried daryabadi biriyani, galawti kebab, dum chicken, firni, shahi tukda and choco cocoa as mocktail. One plate of kachchi biriyani is more than enough for two. Biriyani tastes really good and the mutton pieces would melt in your mouth. I would like to visit this place again.

Listend so much about this restaurant from zomato and friends. So decided to visit the place with friends when returning from holiday trip on 25th December, 2017. Let's jump to the review -
1. Order - Chicken biriyani, special chicken biriyani, Mutton biriyani, chicken reshmi kabab. There were so many quantities so skiped that part,just mentioned the dishes.
2. Location - This is the point where it lacks behind the other famous restaurants. Personally being a south kolkata resident khidderpore is pretty much far for dining to me.
3. Ambience - What an ambience. Just 2 stars for the interior itself. Just eye catching.
4. Staff courtesy - They were good to us. Even fulfilled our request to take a picture. Service was pretty fast. Just had a small rift regarding payments. We had told them to bill the delivery items separately, but we received the bill after paying the main bill so that lead to some confussion on both side.
5. Food - The kabab was lip smacking. I took the mutton biriyani and that was good but i had better biriyanis. The speciality of the biriyani is less oily and quantity. But what i liked most about the biriyani was the mutton piece. It was tender and well cooked, the best i have tested in recent years. The chicken biriyani was also very good as per my friends.
6. Pricing - This is not a place where you can expect damn cheap price but taking the ambience and food quality the pricing is value for money as per me.
Hope to visit again the place, there are so much left to try. Thank you for serving us.

This place was on my bucket list for a long time. So, went there on 20th December with two friends to celebrate the end of our exams. It was not at all difficult to find. From the moment we stepped inside, we had good vibes. The 1st and 2nd floor has an air conditioned set up and the ambience is mind blowing. We were seated at 1st floor but the 2nd floor is even better in terms of ambience I believe. So coming to the food:-
‚ö´Ô∏èChicken tandoori- This item failed to impress us. Being a tandoori lover I was expecting it to be better. The pieces of chicken were too small. And the taste was ordinary. The green mint chutney provided with it was sweet whereas I prefer it to be sour. So, it was a bit of a letdown.
‚ö´Ô∏èChicken biryani- Me and one of my friends took chicken biriyani. It was really delicious. The rice was well cooked and light with the perfect blend of spices. It was neither oily nor dry. The chicken too was very well cooked and juicy. Quantity of rice was more than enough. I could not finish it myself and my friend had to help me with it in the end.
‚ö´Ô∏èMutton biryani- According to my friend who had mutton biryani, it was awesome. She said that the piece of mutton was so well cooked that she did not have to struggle to cut the pieces with the spoon itself.
‚ö´Ô∏èFirni- We are not exactly fond of sweets after biriyani but I wanted to try the firni as I had seen people praise it in their reviews. So, though we were full, we ordered one firni and had a few spoonfuls. It was good but nothing extraordinary.
The service was prompt. The staff were cordial.
But, the tandoori chicken disappointed me. But I am willing to overlook it because the biriyani was superb. The prices are justified given the beautiful ambience. They charge 5% GST.
Overall, nice experience. Would love to visit again.
P.S.- They have a non-ac section on the ground floor for eating as well as takeaway. The menu is the same but the prices are about ‚Çπ20-30 less than in the AC section. Plus, there is no GST or any other tax whatsoever.

Out of all chicken chatpata was the best.. It was moist tender n flavoursome.. Reshmi kebab was good too.. Coming to biryani.. It was a major disappointment..will never have biryani here again.. 
Final verdict; chicken chatpata is a must try ..but biryani disappointing..

Previously this used to be a small outlet with a little air conditioned area serving great biriyani....well now its a 3storied biriyani mall... not as overrated as arsalan aminia etc... biriyani tastes really good... the mutton and chicken pieces would melt in your mouth..If you wanna try something different i suggest their laccha paratha and chicken bharta... the laccha paratha does have a nice taste of its own.. and the bharta is different look as well as taste wise from the ones that are served at other places. In the end don't leave without trying their firini

Heard a lot of it. A difficult place to drive own car. (Not to be too scared, parking in Kol is always a prob) But it is worth the effort. Other biriyani outlets in Kol are good. This one special coz they put honest effort in every dish we had. AT least I felt that way. Hence it takes time. But They inform the same.  Fish Achari Kebab üëçüèº, Awadhi Biriyani üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº, Chicken chap üëçüèºüëçüèº, shahi tukra üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº. All good.

For our Christmas dinner we chose this restaurant. And it didn't fail us. A spacious restaurant near Khidirpur fancy market. The interior was amazingly decorated with a 5 star vibe. We ordered for India special cheese kebab, special mutton biriyani, onion salad, laccha paratha,nan and mutton stew. Cheese kebab was loaded with cheese and tasted very good. Mutton biriyani was perfect,not too much greasy not too much dry and with succulent mutton pieces.Mutton stew had succulent well seasoned meat chunks and the gravy tasted soo good. For biriyani lovers, it is highly recommended.

Always wanted to taste your recipes for a long time now. Planning to visit in recent times. It would be immensely helpful if you can suggest some your famous dishes that we can order when we visit. We prefer biriyani and other dishes. Thank you.

By seeing 4.6 rating in zomato i decide to visit this place with my friend....

So we had our Christmas dinner here....

Located near the fancy market khidirpur it was crowded...

Luckily we got a 2 seated table without waiting....

Food : available menus are very much common like other mughlai restaurants.
We order chicken afgani half for starter, 2 tandoori roti, 1 special mutton biriany and 1 chicken do payaza for main...

Chicken afgani(half) : 2 piece of roasted chicken with green chatni served hot and tastes good...rating: 3.5

Mutton special biriany : having 2 medium size of mutton, 1 aloo , 1 egg and flavorful rice which is tastes very nice but not sufficient for two.... 4.0

Very much disgusted. Found a fly and some hairs in my biryani. The worst restaurant. They have no idea whether they are serving flies and hairs or biryani.

Located near the fancy market, one of the most legendary restaurant that has been serving Biryani since ages. What amazed me is their ambience, lavish decor equivalent to 5 star dinning experience and service as well. Went there for lunch with my friends. Tried mutton biryani, chicken Haryali kebab, Galouti kebab, special chicken curry, phirni and sahitukra. Kebabs were amazing. Rates are reasonable too. However, missed to taste their signature dish -¬† kacchi biryani as it was out of stock.

Biryani is the best here!!!
Being near to my place, it's just a constant place when food is needed. Guests coming over specially request India's biryani... The other food items can be improved. But if you're just a biryani fan, nothing to complain. üòÅ

Located near Karl Marx Sarani, Kidderpore, this place serves truly legendary biriyani this town has to offer. The ambiance is undoubtedly wonderful, with a royal touch. It is grand and very spacious. Seating on the third floor is stunning. The feel of the place complements the food immensely well.  Service was prompt and very well-behaved. Extra points for such a courteous staff. Now comes the best part, FOOD. Dishes ordered -
1) Chicken tandoori - It was well marinated and just the right amount of char marks on it. The smokey flavor was not too strong. The meat was tender. (Rating - 4.5)
2) Chicken tikka butter masala (6 pcs) - The kebab pieces were tender and moist. Very well cooked and gravy was so so flavorful. The best chicken tikka I ever tried! Absolutely mouthwatering. Highly recommended! (Rating - 5.0)
3) Tandoori roti - It had a light sweet taste. Believe it or not, I could eat it as it is without a complementary gravy. Nonetheless, it went really well with the chicken dish mentioned above. It could be a bit more soft tho. (Rating - 4.0) 
4) Dariyabadi biriyani - THE biriyani is here. The taste was just spot on. Not too dry, not too moist. The flavors just explode in your mouth. It had some dry fruits which went really well, not like your regular biriyani. Indeed, one of the best biriyanis in town. Recommended! (Rating - 5.0)
5) Fresh lime soda - Very refreshing and sweet. This is the need of the hour after such a rich lunch! (Rating - 4.0)
       Going back for the Awadhi biriyani and firni and more, absolutely! If you're looking for ambiance and great food at a reasonable price, this is the place to go.

We went to this restaurant after hearing some great reviews of the biriyani served here. We order the kachchi biriyani and we were amazed by the dish. By far I would say I have had the best biriyani here in Kolkata from this place. It surpasses the taste of the biriyani from  alibaba , arsalan, Nizam , aminia, kabuliwala and Shiraz with ease. 


We also ordered some other dishes like peshawari kabab , mutton duckbanglow... These dishes were okay. The taste that will still remain in your heart is the biriyani.

So , do not think just go for it. The ambience is good. Do not expect much apart from good food

This place never disappoints me. It's when I want to dine out and be safe and sure about the food and not looking forward to experiment , I normally head to India Restaurant or Arsalan. Whatever dish you order , it will give you maximum bangs for your bucks. 

Yesterday , I had chicken malai Tikka and Kakori kabab. Both were nice but the Kakori kabab was sumptuous melt in your mouth kind with a balanced taste and flavours. This was followed by the regular chicken Tikka butter masala and Mutton Kadhai - comfort food in this restaurant. And lastly Kachi Biryani . I have never found any other restaurant serving this good kachi biryani. Beautiful aromatic grains of rice mixed with juicy tender succulent pieces of mutton. It tasted heavenly !! Ohhh n yes the garlic naan was awesome too. 

Tried their new ice cream offerings but they are average.

This place needs no introduction serving legendary biriyani since ages. You will get a royal feel as soon as you enter. Making us comfortable in the huge sofas we ordered 

Chicken cheese kabab - This is their signature dish and very different from Arsalan's kabab. This had a tandoori coating of cheese all over the tender chicken. This instantly melts in your mouth and the taste is beyond amazing. The chutney served with it was a very different version of pudina chutney , slightly sweeter and amazingly complementing the dish. 

Mutton biriyani - The biriyani is not very rich in spices and the quantity is good enough for one person with good appetite. The mutton piece was well marinated and beautifully cooked. Though the 'aloo' in it seemed a bit bland. 

Tawa chicken - The gravy was too creamy and tasty with 6 big chunks of chicken. Though had to mention it was too oily and spicy but tasted heavenly. 

The best part was indeed the kabab. The service was pretty fast. The stuffs are well mannered. 
Definitely recommended.

One of the best places I have been to.. However you go just get down at fancy market.. It is just 2steps ahead of fancy market.. The decoration is amazing so is the food. 
We had 2 plates of kachchi biriyani, chicken butter masala and shadi tukra..
The total bill for 4 people was 819/-.
The kachchi biriyani was unique and I never had something like this before. 
I just loved the food.. 
Looking forward to visit soon.

As a Big Time Food lover, I always wanted to visit this restaurant, though I had tasted their biriyani, but that time it was take away type order.

So finally I made my visit, to this awesome and new generation BIRIYANI joint in Kolkata.

Location : It is the heart of Kidderpore, Just beside the Fancy Market. So location wise people should not face any hard time to find it out.

Interior: Generally the difference what we are observing recent days, popular and generation old BIRIYANI joints are focusing on interior, so as INDIA. Well decorated stairs, spacious interior, vibrant color make the interior eye catching and smart.

Waiter:

All the waiters are well behaved, having decent knowledge about food.

Food:

We ordered below mentioned dishes

Peshwari Chicken Kebab:

Well cooked, soft, tendered, juicy and succulent six pieces of Boneless chicken with some Green Parsley Chatni and Salad.  Recommendable

Paneer Tikka :

Six pieces Paneer marinated with some grind spices, but this dish needs some improvement, I found the taste of Paneer a bit blunt. Something is missing, which i found. Not Recommendable

Mutton Galwati Kebab:

This is one of the dish which I was looking for, and I can say they did not disappoint me. 4 Medium sized Kebabs with Lucknow paratha is the perfect combination they had provided. The Kebabs are really soft, tendered and juicy with the feast of flavors. They are really melting in our mouth, so they did proper Justice to the Dish name as well. Highly Recommendable 

Mutton Awadhi Biriyani:

one of the signature dish of INDIA. This is a special order. People have to wait for 30 mins minimum. One Handi with 3-4 big pieces of Mutton, 3 Potatoes and Rice which is enough of Big Foodie like us. The Rice was well mixed with masala, not too spicy (Which way I Liked most), flavorful. 

Mutton pieces are well marinated and very very well cooked. Served with Raita (Which is refreshing)

So overall, Highly recommendable.

Price:

Overall price wise this is one the best cost effective BIRIYANI joint as well as perfect destination to taste some Afghan and Awadhian delicacy.

So Dear Kolkata and India Food Lovers, go and give a try in INDIA, (I Mean India Restaurant)

Hi friends lets talk about India Restaurant üëçüëå
really it was awesome , I was there fr birthday treat and really i enjoyed that place ...

Lets talk about Items what I have placed in my tummy ‚ò∫üòÇ

Starter
-----------

1. Malai Kabab - it was good 6pieces¬† in a plate and tasty like other kabas ...

2. Cheese Kabab - it was also good bt expectation-wise not that good , as I expected melted cheese bt may be it was my fault as I was late to taste that .so cheese became hard ..

Main Course
----------------------
3. Awadhi Biriyani - Its special in the way of its representation .. Taste-wise also better than other much popular restaurant .. and main thing is that in some other restaurant when they serve only that point of time its smell awesome bt after few mins its use to become tasteless or become dry , bt in case of Awadi Biriyani it's taste was same as it is served ...

* quantity-wise it is enough fr 2 to 3 people .. sorry , we have wasted some .. bt if you want they will pack the leftover ..
** if you want to take way den for pot it is charged 50rs extra for the pot ..

Mock Tale
-----------------
4. Mojito slash - didn't like or it was not up to the mark as per expectation .. my flavor was green apple

5. Shirley Temple - It was just awesome . i just loved it 15 on 10. üëçüëçüëçüëåüëå

Really its a too good place for party and to spacious and not congested like arsenal ..

I had ordered for home delivery twice. Enjoyed thoroughly. 
I'm not sure whether I can get a proper parking in the evening, that's why not ventured in the evening with my family. 
They can improve their home delivery service.

Me and my wife visited this restaurant yesterday with very high excitement as because we heard a lot about this place from our friends & colleagues. About there biryani, sahi tukra, kabab & firni. We ordered kaachi mutton biryani, awadhi mutton biryani, mutton pasinda kebab & sahi tukra. Unfortunately they informed us sahi tukra was finished and awadhi biryani would take extra 30mins. We was in bit of hurry so changed the order, an ordered mutton biryani, firni & gajar ka halwa. They served within 10-15mins. We was a bit of disappointed as didn't get the chance to taste the sahi tukra which is here's one of the speciality. Now come to the food part , both  biryanies was really good. Specially the kaachi biryani was awesome. Rice cooked perfectly, enough juicy and mutton was soft and well cooked. We taste most of famous biryanies in kolkata but this kaachi was the best we have so far.  Mutton pasinda kebab was moderate but the pudina chatni served with it was awesome. Combination of both was nice. Specially most of chatni serve with tandoori and kebab by other food chains in kolkata is very normal and monotonous. Firni was too good. Main good part with that firni was they didn't add any extra flavors or color. Taste was awesome too. Halwa was full of ghee and they served a bit of over heated but the taste was awesome. Ambiance was very impressive, stuff was polite and well behaved. Two things that disappointed us, that was the toilet that was very dirty. Second was the bike parking just in front of the restaurant is chargeable. That should be free. Except these overall was very good experience.

We drove 50km to try their food. I am pretty happy they didn't disappoint. The ambience is great. Perfectly lit, staffs are honest and courteous and food timings are appropriate. We ordered virgin mojito (green apple flavour), chicken cheese kebab(6), chicken chatpata kebab (10pcs), mutton boti kebab (6), daryabadi biryani (they said kachchi mutton biryani and daryabadi biryani is the same except the later has 2 mutton pieces instead of 1...umm okay!? ü§î Why change the name for an additional piece of boti?), Chicken chap, mutton kadhai, and to fill the dessert cravings we had shahi tukra and firni.

Review: Virgin mojito was impeccable and refreshing and delicious. The green apple and lime and mint packed a very refreshing punch! Do try it.
The cheese chicken kebabs were delicious, they do melt in your mouth. And the mint-coriander chutney provided was incredibly delicious. It's tart and sweet.
Chicken chatpata kebabs was just chicken wings in a partly spicy and tangy tandoori sauce. I wouldn't recommend this one. KFC is better if you want wings!
Mutton boti kebab was a bit tough and dry in itself but with the chutney, it went well.

Daryabadi (or kachchi biryani with an extra boti as they say,) was partly tangy and a little sweet to the palate. The acidity of the plums, the smokiness of the spices and sweetness of the cashews did overpower the meaty savoury flavour. If you like biryani just plain subtle and savoury, order the Awadhi one. And I must mention that the mutton was falling off the bone to the touch. Literally to the touch. That's how perfectly cooked it was!

Chicken chap and mutton boti (does have 5pcs in gravy) was nothing extraordinary. The gravy minus the thick oil/fat floating film was tasteful.

Shahi tukra did disappoint. It was just a boring piece of bread ( Heck! It lacked that aroma of ghee as a traditional shahi tukra should have!) Lying in a pool of mildly thickened milk with no garnish. This is the only disappointing item.
And finally firni soothed the disappointment. But I believe the quantity was less compared to others at same price. So -0.5 for the disappointing shahi tukra.
Overall, it does have the best brilliant biryanis and kebabs in town. Price is OK and is perfect for great group feasts. Do give this place a try!

Update on 9.12.2017:-
Received service at it's very best. This was pinnacle of customer service. I was called by the management of India restaurant. They apologized for the honest mistake. Sounded the same as well. Offered me another packet of the same Awadhi biryani for free. Taste wise nothing changed. It is still as good as it was. Couldn't resist to order some more apart from the freebie. Thumbs up for their responsible attitude towards customers.


Just for taste I would have rated at least 4. Their awadhi biryani really tasted good. So did the cheese coated chicken cheese kebab. But the simple reason for such a poor rating would be for the sheer cheating/negligence they inflicted upon me. I visited their counter in ecospace during the ongoing biryani festival there. As per their menu, it said 4 pcs of mutton would be there in the special Awadhi biryani. I noticed only after reaching home that 2 pcs were simply missing. It was a takeaway for my family. For a price of Rs 320, I felt terribly cheated. Not just for the money I paid to get something less in return, but the lack of morality was disgusting. Otherwise the taste was quite good and they infused some "mewa" into the biryani.

ne of the legendary Biryani outlets in the city. I have been here umpteenth number of times and have almost always had a good meal. They have revamped their shop a couple of times in the last decade and improved the ambiance and dine in experience.¬†

For me this is one of the go to place for devouring mughlai food.

Once we tasted cheese kebab and chicken65.Chicken 65 was very spicy but tasted good..cheese kebab was exotic literally coated with thick layer of cheese.Mutton biryani and chicken chap was very tasty. We even tasted afghani chicken. The quantity which they serve is good.But the best of the lot was the phirni..loved it

This biriyani place in Kolkata has grown to be quite the mammoth and rightly so! The dariyabadi biriyani and the hyderabadi biriyani are like nowhere else. The kababs are spicy and flavorful. And the new, redecorated restaurant is quite comfortable and good to spend a decent time with hearty food.

The moment you enter the restaurant the ambience sets your mood for a Royal meal waiting ahead. Yes India Restaurant did justice to the amazing cuisines Mughals left for us to savour upon.
Us the #MunchingMonks were privileged to mark the launch of their #AapKiPasand dish Lucknowi Mutton Nihari.
The dish consists of fairly large 5-6pieces of mutton, which will melt in your mouth the moment you grab a bite. The gravy is made with the perfect combination of spices and goes best with Tandoor Roti dipped in it. This dish is only available in this restaurant in the town.
Beside this the Cheese Kebab is heavenly, you got to taste it to know why and definitely won't disappoint you.
The Chicken biryani was well made and one plate of it will suffice two people properly.
And this place makes the best Phirni in town and I can vouch for it as I took parcels along with me as I just couldn't have enough of it.
If you want to celebrate the new year with new cuisines then definitely go for Mutton Nihari at India Restaurant.

This is an ideal place for mughlai dishes. They serve the best biriyani in kolkata undoubtedly. Their mutton awadhi biriyani tastes amazing. Been there a number of times. Whenever we wish to have mughlai dishes, this is the only place we hit. Their kababs and tandoori also taste brilliant. Their ambience is also beautiful.

After a long debate finally we picked India restaurant. It is just located at the most busiest place of kidderpore i.e fancy market. Ambiance was perfect, looks like 5 star dine. We ordered -

1. Chicken kebab (So Juicy and soft) 

2. Chicken briyani ( Best biryani in kolkata..It was smell like real aroma of biryani )

3. Finni (just lip smacking)

My recommendation for this place is 10 out of 10..

One of the best biriyanis and kababs destination is this restro.  One of the finest chicken biriyani in kolkata. Hariyali and reshmi kababs too were mouth watering.  Loved it.  Would be pleased if the minimum order limit for online ordering could be reduced to 500 from 700 as for a family of 2 members food worth 700 is too much in quantity and is wasted..

So today for dinner I placed an order from India Restaurant considering it's great food quality as I have had from this place on many previous occasions. I had ordered for tandoori chicken , chicken hariyali kabab, chicken reshmi butter masala and roomali roti. However , I was highly disappointed with the quality of food they served. The pudina chutney they had given with the kababs had a foul smell and was spoilt, the roomali rotis were very tough and had too much of salt , and a strand of hair was found in the chicken reshmi butter masala. The kababs were good , apart from that I had a horrible dining experience. I would urge the management of the restaurant to look into this matter and improve it's food quality.

Recommended for Biriyani. But I don't like the Kacchi biriyani, the simple biriyani is far more better taste they made I think. What one must have taste at least once is @Fish üê† Sarsonwali kebab & Firni. Well decor, nice ambience & enough spacious.

So today is that super lucky day that ticked off two of my major wishes at once - 1.Long Due Biryani Craving 2.The wish to treat my tastebuds by delicasies from INDIA RESTAURANT.Coming to the point,
üå†Location : Really convenient locationwise as one can easily spot this eatery standing tall where the fancy market ends.
üå†Food : Can't comment on the ambience 'cause we took our food packed from the takeaway counter which is on the ground floor.So coming to the food straight,
1.Mutton Special Biryani : The perfect kolkata biryani - non oily,super flavourful,light and it contained a huge piece of soft aaloo,an egg and 2 pieces of succulent (if you are a bengali,read 'tultuley' and if you are not,then try to imagine the superlative of 'melts-in-mouth') mutton pieces with rice that can totally feed two bellies.A 10/10,hands down.
2.Mutton Kachchi Biryani : If you're a game for unique taste,then this is gonna ace your dining experience at India Restaurant.Here,the rice is layered along with mutton marinated in yogurt-dry fruits (well,and some more dry fruits plus aloo bukhara üòç ) and assorted spices and cooked in dheemi aanch which leads to a burst of flavours as the spoon goes in mouth.A bit more oily than the normal one,but the taste is downright HEAVENLY.A 10/10,again.
3.Firni : Trust me,this eatery is not paying me to write this review,but I just can't cut short on my reaction.This is probably the least sweet and most amazing firni I have had so far - rich in mewa and really less sugary,just how the authentic firni is supposed to be ! ‚ù§ P.S - I'm not a dessert person,but totally couldn't resist gobbling up the whole katora,in a few seconds.
|| Pros||
1.Pocket friendly
2.Huge quantity
3.Super yum
4.Well behaved staffs
5.Aaaandd..no cons ! üòÇ
Going back to try their Awadhi biryani super soon üòá

Located at the most busiest place of kidderpore i.e fancy market, this restaurant will simply give you the feel of royalty and splendour with it's ambience...

The dining space covers a large area and is divided into an upper and a lower dining area...

Mughal cuisine being the speciality of this restaurant, we didn't hesitate to order most of their special Mughal delicacies...

The starter consisted of Indian special cheese kebab which was basically roasted chicken pieces covered with cheese slices and then fried as a whole... It was simply wow, being crispy outside and juicy inside along with the aroma of burnt coal...

For the main course, it was all about biriyani... Mutton biriyani , Kachhi biriyani and Awadhi biriyani...
The mutton biriyani was normal as in any other restaurant, with a large piece of mutton and potato which was sufficient for a person..

What was extraordinary about them was their Kachhi biriyani and Awadhi biriyani...
The Kachhi biriyani consisted of a large piece of mutton with potato and a boiled egg, made with perfect blend of aromatic spices and served with dry fruits...
The Awadhi biriyani was cooked and served in an earthen clay pot along with raeta... The ample amount of aromatic basmati rice with four pieces of mutton and potato will easily suffice 2 people...

For the side dish, the waiter suggested us Chicken tikka butter masala which consisted of 6 pieces of chicken tikka cooked with rich mix of spices and butter(you will have forget your dieting for a day)... The creamy texture of the dish along with the aroma of earthen oven made it perfect for accompaniment...

The dessert included Shahi tukra(which was also one of their special items) and Firni...

The service was pretty good, with a quick refill time... The waiters were very friendly and explained us each and every dish...
Pocket pinch is moderate..

Must try dishes are the Kachhi biriyani, Awadhi biriyani and Shahi tukra...

If you are in kidderpore, don't forget to drop by this restaurant... You won't be let down for sure...

Last weekend, my friends and I went to India Restaurant for dinner. The place is divided into three sections. Downstairs there is an AC section and a non AC section and upstairs there is very nicely decorated kind of a fine dining section. Prices vary according to which place you choose to sit but ultimately the menu and the food remains the same.For starter, we ordered Mutton Boti Kebab which was very tender and flavourful. Next, we opted for Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chap and Mutton Tikia as our main course. All of them were extremely good. Coming to desserts, we had the Firni which can simply be described as perfection. It was the creamiest Firni I ever had. It was so good we all ended up packing up some more of those for takeaway. Overall, we loved the food and the service was also very good.

4.7 rating lured me into this restaurant but frankly I felt it's overrated. 
Hits : Ambiance : spacious and grand, interiors are well lit and restaurant can be easily spotted. 
Service : prompt and dedicated staff. Food arrives on time and waiters have  good knowledge of the menu.

What can be improved : food is fine. It's not worth 4+ though. Maybe it's one good restaurants in that area but overall I have had better in Kolkata. 
Kebabs were good but mutton quality wasn't top notch. 
 Dariyabadi biriyani was 3.5/5. It was good and freshly prepared. 
Overall a reliable and good restaurant, slightly overhyped .

Despite being on a Sunday Evening, we easily got our seat at the restaurant. The waiters were very courteous. Coming to the food, the taste was simply awesome.. Biriyani was heavenly.. But what turned out to be a disaster was the chicken and the mutton pieces which were not very tender. Chicken Awadhi was delicious. Firni tasted good as well..
Experience was good and is highly recommended.

This was my first visit to the much talked about India Restaurant.
Located just besides Fancy Market, the joint stands tall with takeaway counter at ground floor.
We went upstairs for the AC section.Exquisite ambience .Certainly one of the best - I have ever came across.Courteous and helpful staff.Now coming to the food- we ordered the following :
Fish Tikka kebab -> Delightfully yummy.
Chicken Cheese Kebab -> Very good. Some of the chicken pieces could have been softer.
Mutton Awadhi Biryani > Superb packaging.Great taste. Homestyle light preparation comes with Raita.
Mutton Biryani -> Delicious.
Chicken Tawa -> Unique Indo-Chinese flavoured delicacy. Very good taste. Some of the chicken pieces could have been softer.
Firni -> A sweet dish which is must have after such awesome dishes.

Overall- I would give a full 5 Star Rating overlooking the hardness of the Chicken pieces purely because of the combination of ambience,staff,Biryanis and Fish Tikka Kebab.

Keep up the great taste - guys. Looking forward to visit more often now.

This place is purely sensational.. This place was in my bucket list for a long time.. Finally visited this place on 12/11/2017.. It was a family outing and trust me we had a smile on our face as we came out after having our dinner.. A truly Gastronomic foodgasmic experience.. everything about this place is top notch.. starting from the courtesy of the staffs and security guards to their mesmerizing ambience ans their heavenly lipsmacking foods.. they wont let you down in any prospects... 

Location :- This place is very near to kidderpore fancy market.. just get down at fancy market stop and walk a few steps and this place is on you left to take you dining to some other level.. :-)¬† you can also come by train..its located 10mins away from the kidderpore station.. so wont be a problem either way..

Ambience :- As we entered the place we were simply awestruck.. it was just WOW.. it's a two storeyed building.. the 2nd floor has been a recent addition.. the beautiful comfy cushions.. the vibrant lightings.. the glamourous wall decor will truly make u come over to this place again and again.. 

Food :- 
1) Chicken Chatpata Kebab :- 10 pieces of chicken wings marinated in some special spices which gives you a tangy yet tandoori flavour.. quite similar to tandoori chicken yet quite different.. a MUST TRY dish over here to get a different taste from the original tandoori items.. an yes the Green chutney accompanying it was truly yummy.. (5/5)

2) Mutton Biriyani :- It was a complete kolkata style biriyani with the perfect blend of spices.. the mutton was soft and the aloo was also good.. ( in most of the places i find the aloo a bit hard or of inferior quality but here its completely different).. what i felt was the biriyani lacked salt.. (4.5/5)

3) Chicken Tangdi Kebab :- the smoky chicken tangdi in a spicy gravy.. ahhh.. the best in town.. it was a perfect side dish to have.. (5/5)

4) Chicken chaap :- another great dish to accompany your main course (Roti/Biriyani).. the gravy was lipsmacking..it was made of pure ghee.. the smell will persisit till the next day.. :-p (4.5/5)

5) Butter Naan and Plain Naan :- Soft and tasty.. 

6) Firni :- to end off our sumptuous meal a dessert is necessary.. and the firni was real good.. but what i lacked was the taste oudh offers.. :-( but yes the price difference was¬† also a lot..

SO if you want to have some good food this place is your destination.. and if you are short of you dp for your social networking sites go get some real cool dp's from here.. its really a photoesque place..

A place for Fine family Dinner or a hangout with your pals or¬† a romantic dinner date.. this serves the purpose for all..

happy dining foodies :-)

This was my second visit to this heavenly place. This time we were there in a group of 7. 

This place has a majestic ambience with a beautiful interior, specially the staircase! There are many mirrors on the walls which give it a very nice and attractive look.

The staffs are always humble. As we enter, the guard welcomes us with his smile and also greets goodbye as we leave the place.

We had some noteworthy dishes... and here they are..
üëå Flavoured Mojito
üëå Chicken cheese kabab
üëå Mutton barra kabab
üëå Daryabadi biryani
üëå Lucknowi laccha paratha 
üëå Tawa chicken
üëå Fish tikka butter masala
üëå Firni

Mojito ~~ this is a refreshing drink of many flavours with mint leaves and ice, sliced lemon and cherry on it which gives a catchy look when served.

Chicken cheese kabab ~~ this is a speciality of this restaurant. The kababs are rolled in cheese layers and they taste just yummy. Tha kababs are also soft. they serve this with a green chutney and salad. 

Mutton barra kabab ~~ i have not tried mutton starters before. But this changed my taste. It tasted much like tandoori with mutton. Pieces are medium size and are with bone. This platter also comes with a green chutney and some salad.

Daryabadi biryani ~~ i love biryani and this is a special biryani with a unique taste. Unlike normal biryani this dish have some hidden secrets in it. The biryani had 2 mutton pieces, 1 egg and a potato. Also it is a bit spicy but well garnished.

Lucknowi laccha paratha ~~ it was soft and big size paratha. Tasted nice on served hot.

Tawa chicken ~~ very yummy, mouth watering dish. Pieces were medium size and the gravy is spicy with an authentic taste. It goes best with lucknowi laccha paratha.

Fish tikka butter masala ~~ tried fish item after a very long time. This Indian item of fish is a wow wow for me. Fish pieces are very soft and tasty. The gravy tasted awesome. Its a must try for everyone.

Firni ~~ aww... i am a desert lover and firni is my love. But i have tasted the best firni here. It tasted like kheer and seems like it almost melts in our tongue. Heavenly feeling. Happy ending with sweet tongues..

I am overwhelmed by the services as well as the food. We all enjoyed the grand lunch. It was an honour for me to be a part of this gathering. Will surely visit this place again...

India Restaurant is a humble joint on Khidderpore that serves some delicious variety of North Indian cuisine. The ambience is having a Mughlai feeling at it. From the very entrance it provides you a whole new experience of Dining in Khidderpore. It has gone through a huge transformation. Very spacious, clean and live like king size interior.

India Restaurant is the paradise for North Indian food that every food lover should visit once in their lifetime.They have always been my go to place for biriyani but this time India Restaurant hosted us for a taste of their popular delicacies.

The decor has been revamped -- the brand new place now is a three storeyed place with magnificent interiors.From the time we stepped ,we were awestruck with the new look.Vibrant and colorful with mirrors all across the wall is what would attract attention.
Coming straight to our menu for the day

üò∫Mojito--Refreshing with lemon and mint leaves and served with a cherry on top as garnish.
üò∫Chicken cheese kebab- An all time delicacy ,coated with a thick layer of cheese and grilled to perfection.liquid cheese oozing out of the golden colored outer coating and boy oh boy that soft    
piece just melted away in my mouth.
üò∫Mutton barra kebab-Charred juicy chunks with a strong smoky flavour this one made me switch from spoon to hand.Well i think that more than justified to say you got to get your hands dirty for these
üò∫Dariyabadi biriyani-This is their signature dish and you have to enquire beforehand for availablity.This was quite rich with dry fruits,caramelised onions mixed with the rice.Served in a plate with two eggs,Two soft boiled Aloo and two juicy mutton pieces ,this one will just change your view about biriyanis
üò∫Tawa chicken--Tender pieces in creamy makhni kind of gravy.Had a tinge of kasoor methi flavour.Relish with a lucknowi paratha on side.
üò∫Fish tikka butter masala-I am not a fan of fish dishes when it comes to north indian but you could just give this one a try for that distinct flavour of the fish coming through.Garnished with cream and coriander leaves on top this was a surprise entry to my list of favourites
üò∫Lucknowi paratha-Crispy and paper thin layers comprised of this one.Pair it with any creamy non veg item and you are good to go
üò∫Firni--A perfect finish to an awsome meal ,yummy smooth as silk bowl of goodness.

Thanks team India Restaurant for the warm hospitality and for a tout into the world of lip-smacking delicacies.

I have always wanted to visit this place but due to a hectic schedule and this place being a little far from my workplace, it wasn't¬†possible for me. But when finally yesterday I had the chance to come here I was so much happy.¬†

LOCATION- This place is far indeed but it isn't¬†very difficult to locate. Once you reach Khidirpore market, you are halfway there. Once you reach the market it is hardly 2-3 mins walking distance.¬†

AMBIENCE- This place is lavishly decorated. my god, we were awestruck on seeing little decorations in every corner of the place. Seems like whoever decorated this place out very much thought into it and did not leave any corner of the place alone. Seriously we were heavily impressed. Loved it.

STAFF- The staff here is very much courteous and well mannered. from people who are guarding the door to people who are serving us food here with the biggest smile on their faces and even the management too, everyone deserves a standing¬†ovation for what work they do.¬† everyone greets you welcome and bids you goodbye with the biggest smile on their faces and truly everything about this place makes having here lunch worthwhile.

FOOD- Now coming to the best part of the¬†day. This is hands down the best lunch I have ever had to date.
We had so many things to eat.
Starting with the starters we had CHICKEN CHEESE KEBAB AND MUTTON BARRA KEBAB.
The Cheese kebabs were amazing and delicious in taste. it had mozzarella in the stuffing and the outer portion was covered in cheddar.¬†
The Mutton Barra kebab was also good in taste. It was a typical mixture of tandoor and its spices. Personally, I thought it was a little burnt on the edges. Other than that it was very good.
For drinks, we had MOJITO SLUSH ( FLAVOURED). It comes in 5 assorted flavours.¬†We had it all.
I liked the green apple flavour the most.¬†
Up next for the main course we had TAWA CHICKEN, FISH TIKKA BUTTER MASALA, DARYABAADI BIRIYANI AND LUCKNOWI LACCHA PARATHA.
My favourite among the main course is the Daryabaadi biriyani. Wow. This is also hands down the best biriyani I¬† have ever tasted. Truly mind-blowing. this amazing biriyani is so rich in taste and is made with extravagant¬†spices and dry fruits. Seriously¬†mazaa aa gaya¬†<3.¬†¬†
The Tawa chicken and the Fish Tikka butter masala were both exquisite and amazing in taste.¬†
The Laccha paratha that we had is originally served with the Galawti kebabs, but we asked for it separately. The paratha was soft, crunchy and was served hot. <3¬†
And last but not the least we had this amazing firni¬†for dessert. My god this firni was so much delicious in taste. one of the best firnis¬†I have had to date.¬†

To conclude I have had a really good time there and would definitely want to visit again especially for this Daryabaadi briryani and Laccha paratha.

P.S.-¬† This is the perfect place for a date. ABHI TAK AISE AUR 3 MILE HAI. :P

An Amazing place with some amazing dishes. 

Yesterday, I with few of my friends visited this place, and we ate to our heart's content. We had a number of dishes and each one of them pleased us.

Here is a glimpse of what all we had.

Flavoured Mojito Slush - 3 different flavors were served, each one was super refreshing. 

Chicken Cheese Kebab - This was my very first time tasting cheese kebab, and it was cheesy enough to make me say cheesy things like, "This is the most delicious chicken kebab I have ever tasted." 

Mutton Barrar Kebab - Though it says mutton, it is basically 4 medium sized lamb pieces with some tandoori spices roasted in an oven. It has that typical tandoori taste to it, which makes your taste buds go gaga over it.

Daryabadi Biriyani - To be honest, I am not a biriyani fan, but this made me re-think my choices. Never have I ever tasted a biriyani as great as this. This is a must try one. The sweet aftertaste that it leaves on your tongue, is something that you are surely going to remember for a very long time. It is one of their special biriyanis and is available only on Thursdays. So, if you are visiting on a Thursday, do not forget to order this.

Lucknowi Lachcha Paratha - It is usually served with Galawati Kebab, and is not mentioned on the menu, but you can always ask them separately for it. This particular paratha, is a lot like the base roti of rolls( egg roll, chicken roll), but is a lot less oily and a lot tasty. Tasty to such extent that I kept eating it without any side dish. 

Tawa Chicken - It is a lovely dish for all those who don't like too spicy food. Yes, it does looks spicy, but when you taste it, you can actually feel the cashew gravy, which subdues the hotness of the dish.

Fish Tikka Butter Masala - Another amazing side dish. The Tikka smell prolongs and makes you eat it more and more. It was spicy and tasty. Also, the fish was cooked perfectly. 

Firni - Ending such a sumptuous lunch without a bowl of Firni sounds like a sin. So he had our share of Firni, and well, India Restuarant made me fall in love with Firni once again. The thick-set firni, wasn't too sweet and was the perfect ending to that amazing lunch that I had.

To sum it all, this is a worth visit and worth recommending place. The interior is beautiful, and the staff is courteous making you want to re-visit.

Needless to say,one the best place to have Indian,Moghlai & Tandoor cuisines in the City Of Joy.And they are one of those Legends in making kolkata style biryani.
#LEGENDARY
Well me and my fellow foodie partners had few neuclear visits previously during college days,but this time visited in a group in this lavishly spread.
Two of them are new to this Majestic DineHouse,so while they entered,they simply got dumbstruck in amazement.
Lets focus on the menu that we chose...
üëåFlavoured Mojito
üëåIndia Special Cheese Kebab
üëåMutton Barra Kebab
üëåLucknowi Paratha
üëåDaryabadi Mutton Biryani
üëåFish Tikka Butter Masala
üëåTawa Chicken
‚úåThumsUp
üëåFirni

Now some memorable thoughts right from a highly satisfied tummy....
The Mojito was super refreshing,topped with ice chunks,mint leaves,cherry and lemon slices.
Mutton Barra Kebab had 4peices of Mutton Chaap,cooked with tandoori masala and grilled in charcoal oven.Served with a tangy mint chutney and julien salad,it was Lipsmacking.
The Cheese Kebab just won the heart.It had six boneless chicken cubes,with a Thick Cheezy Layer cooked in charcoaled grill.The ShowStopper.No comments,and a must order.Highly Recommended.
Dariyabadi Biryani is one of their speciality.It had two eggs,two soft & perfectly cooked potatoes,two tender mutton pieces and a super fine with carely cooked rice.This biryani is heavy,a bit spicy and the AluBokharas in it gave a twisty taste.Not available everyday.So confirm beforehand about this Gem's availability.
Tawa Chicken just complimented the Lucknowi Paratha.The gravy was a treat to have,not at all overspicy,nicely garnished with coriander leaves and capsicum dices.
Fish Tikka Butter Masala on the other hand was mind blowing.Normally,in Indian Fish Platters the tender fish needs a careful attention to get cooked finely.They tend to loose its shape easily.Here,the Chefs did a brilliant job.One can easily count the pieces.The gravy was a bit on the spicier side and hot.
It is said,There is always a room for Deserts.Firni on this occassion is just fingerlickingly good.Yummy.You cant miss a Firni at India Restaurant.

With such lavish interiors and some soothing ambience,they also served us with full attention and with utter quality.Just when you enter,starting with the welcome from the DoorKeeper till he bids GoodBye at the end,the entire journey will be a memorable one.
Pocket Pinch is also Reasonable.
They are at their Best on any given day.

A must-must-must visit place if your belly urges for some exquisite mughlai dishes...had probably the best Awadhi Handi Biriyani till now, one plate of which is enough for two though price is less in comparison....Also ordered a plate of Cheese kebabs, that was just so yummy. Well decorated place and their stuffs are attentive.

Ever i think about this place Kacchi biryani is the only thing i end up with...and its the best biryani in the city...probably one of the best in the country....it is as shahi as Mughals....its worth for the staffs to spend 4 hours of dedication n hardwork to prepare it in limited quantity (2 deg)...n its even more worth for me to fear of loosing on it whenever i visit this place....it is that special....full marks only for Kacchi biryani!!!!  .5 less for too much of dry fruits in it.

An extremely decent place where you get quality food...¬†
Recommend the Kachhi Biryani, Cooked with curd, fried onions, dry fruits and apricot. Its very different from regular Kolkata biryani style.
Other items especially afghani kabab also is recommended. You get a choice of Shahi Tukda, Firni and Gajar Ka halwa. All of them are good. If going in group. Try 1 from each.
A quick lunch / dinner with any of the gravy main dish and naan is worth.

We went there after three p.m. and were disappointed to know that the famed dishes, viz. Daryabadi Biryani and Kacchi Biryani were no longer available. Only two handis are cooked per day, once at noon and the other before dinnertime‚Ä¶.when we reached they were already exhausted. I would urge potential visitors to bear in mind this timeframe if they wish to taste these two delicacies. Left with little option, we ordered the ordinary Mutton Biryani‚Ä¶which was exactly that‚Äìordinary!! As starter, we chose Mutton Barra Kebab‚Ä¶it redeemed the biryani experience somewhat. We had also ordered Raita separately, but later discovered that Mutton Awadi Biryani includes a plate of raita‚Ä¶do remember that!¬†¬†

I must make a mention of the d√©cor‚Ä¶it radiates elegance. The furniture, lighting and walls are done in an understated golden, yellow and cream‚Ä¶much to my taste :)

As a Kolkattan how can one devoid one self of biriyani for too long. Thus to quench the hunger for biriyani landed at one of the most renowned restaurant in Kolkata.
Without much rummaging through the menu, went straight for the Awadhi Biriyani as the Kolkata style Biriyani is a descendent of the same. And wah ! What a visual delight was served in front after half an hour of waiting, in a clay pot covered on top and served piping hot.After I broke open the dum seal there was a gust of aroma intermingled with the smell of ghee. The Biriyani was fluffy and extremely light on the stomach.The mutton pieces were cooked to the hilt and the flesh was breaking off the bone.I could smell the aroma of the rice in every morsel and had an absolute perfectly balanced taste of ghee in the Biriyani.Portion size is adequate for two hungry souls and for sure it had two pieces of alu well cooked in dum. Raita is served with this Biriyani which accompanies well with it.
Finished off the grand experience with firni.

I had always heard of this place but never visited before Puja 2017 along with friends. All the myths of the restaurant not taking care of the food during puja has been shattered by this place. 
The hariali kabab is totally wow worthy. The warm brewing biriyani too was light and really delicious. Totally up to the mark in terms of quantity. The plush, exorbitantly decorated interior is totally note worthy. Will surely recommend this place.

India Restaurant is one of the most highly rated Awadi restaurant in Kolkata. Mainly famous for their Biryani, this one is very easy to locate at Khidirpur near to fancy market.

Decorations :
==============
The ambience over here is none less than than a 5 star luxury hotel. The restaurant is very large divided their dines into 2 separated floors. Each of the dining is also very large & can handle a lot of people at once. Everything from lights to decorations, from cushions to tables all are premium. Their beautifully designed ceiling is eye catcher. Warm white lit ambience & their luxury cushions are very comfortable.

Staffs and Management :
=======================
India Restaurant has taken care of all the aspects to become a good restaurant. All their staffs are well known of this & maintain the professionalism. Their service was fast & great. We had the following in the foods...

Tandoori & Kebabs :
=================

Chicken Malai Kebab (4/5) :
-----------------------------------
Chicken Malai Kebab was garnished as beautifully as their ambience. In a plate only 6 pieces of chicken was present but that of big size. Unlike other places their Malai Kebab was not creamy rather it was dried. Kebab was grilled very well with the perfection in it. Kebab tasted very good that gave us the true awadi feelings. Green chutney served with it was lite & tasted more like curd.

Mutton Seekh Kebab (4/5) :
-----------------------------------
Visiting North Indian Restaurant and not having Mutton Kebabs isn't what foodies like to do. So, we didn't missed this dish. This dish looked delicious in a shape of sausage. Also it tasted kind of different than expected. This kebab was made by minced mutton in a shape of sausage and then grilling it. It was red, hot and spicy to taste with very lite smoky flavour.

Fish Tikka Kebab (4/5) :
-----------------------------------
6 pieces of Fish Tikka Kebab, red, spicy and juicy inside. Fish was extremely soft and well cooked and the mix spices made this kebabs so rich that fish didn‚Äôt smelt like it. Take it hot without any sauce and mind is blown with its flavour.

Mains :
========

Butter Naan :
-----------------------------------
It was traditional Butter Naan as per their standard, soft, well baked and tasty. Naan was also big in size and matched well with their side dishes.

Chicken Afghani (4/5) :
------------------------------
Julienne cut chicken with afghani rich hot red spices, Chicken Afghani is a great dish to have with Naan or rumali roti. Unlike other places their chicken afghani isn‚Äôt much hot, its flavour was little bit different and really enjoyable.

India Restaurant's Speciality :
======================

Murg Mussallam (5/5) :
-----------------------------------
Now comes the star dish of India Restaurant. Actually each and every dish over here is star but this one is beyond that and Murg Mussallam is nothing less than heaven for a foodie like me. Yes a whole big sized chicken is cooked in this dish and it needs to be ordered at least 2 hours before. In this 2 hours they made an incredible dish that also tasted incredible, looked incredible. When it was served, It was huge for a single person to finish. It was targeted for the mad foodies like us. A full chicken, full of spices inside it floating in ghee and colourful salad around it was just attracting us to come and eat it. Wow! It tasted incredible, it tasted awesome, it tasted great. Hands down no comparison, its the best ever Murg Mussallam I‚Äôve ever tried. Gravy was made of keema and its brilliant spices with their butter naan, no words can explain this experience.

King of Mughal Dishes The Biryani :
=========================

Mutton Biryani (4.5/5) :
-----------------------------------
Its their regular Biryani & it was made the best way possible. It also tastes one of the best among all the famous Biryani restaurants in Kolkata. 1 big Mutton piece and one potato nothing to expect more in this package. But this mutton piece and potato was perfectly cooked as expected. With its authentic flavour and smell, their is basically no comparison of it. Personally I like this biryani much more than their Awadi and Kacchi Biryani but one thing that dissatisfy me about this is its quantity. The quantity served in regular Mutton Biryani is excessive less, just a flat layer of rice on plate. Forgot about dividing it to 2 rather one needs at least 2 plate of it for feeding hunger. Whats this India Restaurant, you surely need to focus on it.

Mutton Awadhi Biryani (4.5/5) :
---------------------------------------
Served in a true Awadhi style, Aromic long grain basmati rice with four pieces of mutton in a clay pot it is for spice lovers. The special spices used in this made it really rich in taste. Same quality of mutton, soft and juicy but with added spices and its richness. The yellow and white mixed colour texture of this biryani inside of the clay handi looks beautiful and one of its kind. It is the true Royal biryani someone can wish over here. This biryani doesn't need any side dish, just the Raita they serve with it is enough.

Mutton Kacchi Biryani (4.5/5) :
---------------------------------------
Kacchi Biryani is one of their most famous dish & here is why. It was mixed with some rich dry fruits with some brilliant rich spices mixed in appropriate order. Not only that It tasted totally different than the regular Biryani, little on the tangier side I would say. The portion was average, the Mutton piece was big & very deeply cooked. It was soft just like it should be, potato was also well cooked. The balance of oil was also noticeable. I had coke in soft drink menu with it, that also was served very well making this combo perfect.

Sweet Tooth Desserts :
====================

Firni (4/5) :
----------------
Firni is what people love here after their wonderful Biryani and its their most famous and most selling according to Zomato. Undoubtedly I loved it too, and as its home made by them only, so its hard to find the same density elsewhere. Also its sweetness is remarkable, an absolute recommended.

Shahi Tukra (3/5) :
------------------------
Its one of their special and most selling dessert too. But personally I didn't liked this dish much. Well balanced Kesaria flavour and sweetness was nice but the bread in the middle wasn't matching the whole dish. Well that was my personal preference, you may try it.

Pricing :
========
Their pricing becomes bit expensive after added taxes for the quantity they serve. Where overall experience over here is worth every penny you spent.

Conclusion :
============
The best thing over here is their newly made beautiful decorations. The ambience is perfect for family dinner as well as a special date. Not just that their Biryani is also remarkable. I recommend this place to every Biryani lover out there.

Yesterday went for dinner at India Restaurant. Had food here few years back. The restaurant has come up with a new decor and finer taste. We ordered Galauti Kebab (which came with complementary thin parathas), Chicken Cheese Kebab, Fish Tikka Kebab, Mutton Awadhi Biriyani, Phirni and Mocktail. Need a special mention about the Galauti Kebab. Soft and juicy minced mutton just melted in mouth. The combination of Galauti, thin Paratha and green chutney was awesome. Loved their Chicken Cheese Kabab and Fish Tikka too. This Cheese wrapped Chicken Kebab is quite unique in taste. A must try. Fish Tikka Kebab was crunchy at outside but inside it had perfectly marinated soft and juicy fish pieces. Then came Mutton Awadhi Biriyani. Heard a lot about this Biriyani and was trying this for the first time. And It's really tasty. Completely different from typical Kolkata Biriyani. It has succulent Mutton pieces and slightly roasted Potatoes. Liked the spiciness and mild tanginess in the Biriyani. A Must try for Biriyani Lovers. The Mocktails were good too. Specially the Chocolate flavoured Mocktail. Finally Phirni for dessert. It was just mind blowing. We were full but still ordered more for its irresistible taste. Extremely satisfied with the food and service. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. Guided well in ordering food as my mom-in-law is having egg allergy. Had a nice family time last night with finger licking food. Wish to visit soon and want to try their other delicacies as well.

They are famous and recently came to know why are they? They just lived up to my expectations. We ordered a fish starter it was just awesome 6/5
Butter nuns and tandoori rotis were great too
1 mutton side dish 4/5
and 1 Awadhi biriyani 3.5/5
The reason is that we were so much in awe with the foods received before the biriyani that we felt it was nothing keeping the earlier dishes in mind.

No doubt! the best place for "Biriyani".The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn‚Äôt the only thing bringing folks to Lune. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and craving for food.

We had Special Mutton Biriyani, Tandoor half, Chicken Bharta and last but not the least "Firni".
Tandoor was juicy and perfectly grilled with full of taste... Best Chicken bharta I've ever had, same goes for Firni as well.¬†
and for Biriyani, Rating 4.7 says it all..... Go for it!!

We had planned to visit this place a year ago but could not make it.finally before durga puja, we have been there.it is located beside khidirpur fancy market.
Ambience was very attractive. Staffs were well mannered and courteous.decor was also very nice.now coming to food. We have ordered
1.chicken tandoori half
2.chicken malai kebab
3.mutton awadhi biryani
4.chicken chap
5.firni
6.cold drink
All item has its own taste.the chefs of this restaurent has awesome culinary skill.biryani was too good and kebab were soft and has their own flavours.chicken chap was also good.last but not the least, the special mention is FIRNI. According to my tastebuds,the best FIRNI I ever have. I have tried firni in almost every popular restaurent in kolkata.But this was like heaven. I will visit this place again and again for their firni and biryani too.

On this auspicious festival of lights and colors, we visited to Indian Restaurant, Khiderpore to celebrate the festive of sparkling lights Diwali with a Mesmerizing course of Menu !!

Indian cuisine is about as easy to explain as thermodynamics. India has welcomed a multitude of settlers with a variety of belief systems. In order to understand the evolution of the indigenous cuisine of India, one must realize this country is anything but homogeneous. Regions and religions make up a large portion of the cultural fabric of the food. ‚ÄúIndian food‚Äù has been coined a phrase by the diversity of it‚Äôs food is as diverse as it‚Äôs people.
It's ambiance perfectly denotes the Indian and Mughal style way. So, the staffs are courteous and impeccable to serve there customers.

We had,

‚Ä¢Fish Tikka Kabab - Tandoori fish tikka is a famous non-vegetarian snack and made in Indian style on BBQ or grill. The fish doesn't lose the tender taste from inside yet tastes crispy on the outside. The key is to marinate the fish well. 

‚Ä¢Mutton Seekh Kebab - Mutton seekh kebab is a delighting non-vegetarian starter popularly relished as side dish in India. You can find it across street stalls or dhabas but this place serves the best Kabab in all. Being a mutton delicacy, it is cooked slowly on a BBQ or grill so that the kebabs come out soft and perfect. The mutton is ground with spices mix and made into balls that go into the oven or on tandoor via skewers.¬†

‚Ä¢Chicken Afghani - Afghani Chicken Curry is a delicious chicken recipe from Afghanistan. Rich in spices, this recipe tastes best when served with rice or roti or Naan.

‚Ä¢Butter Naan - Butter Naan, a butter flavored flat bread is one of the most extremely delicious dish of Indian breads. This is usually made in¬†¬†tandoor,¬† can also be made on¬† stove¬† top¬† and¬† oven. ¬†
Mostly, we get the chance to relish them in restaurants or in parties. It came out absolutely YUMMYY¬† with that melt in the mouth flavor..:)

‚Ä¢Murg Masallam - Murgh Musallam¬†literally means whole chicken. The dish was popular among the royal Mughal families of Awadh, now the state of India.
And the India restaurant serves the best murg mhsallam, and make you feel the flavor of Awad.

‚Ä¢Mutton Awadhi Biryani - Biryani¬†‚Äì¬†even the word sounds so delicious and exotic, smells aromatic and promises a royal treat of highly fragrant¬†basmati¬†rice and richly spiced succulent meat, dish that is fit for kings and nobles. Though the word ‚Äúbiryani‚Äù which is derived from the word ‚Äúbiryan‚Äù has its root in Persia, the dish is known to origin in India during Mughal dyansty rules. As the saying goes that ‚Äúnecessity is the mother of all inventions‚Äù so does the biryani which is invented to feed the huge Mughal armies during the war times. And as the Emperors and their Kingsmen shifted, conquering regions as they go, the flavour of Biryani began to transform, incorporating the local flavours and and now we are blessed with so many regional versions of biryanis in India, each one with different taste profile. No matter from where or how it has originated, Biryani is one such dish that has able to unified our country in some sense and with its brimming aromatic flavours has touched the soul of every Indian.
Mughal biryani in Awadhi or Lucknowi style - a rice and meat dish that is known for its head aroma and fragnant of spices.

‚Ä¢Firni - It¬†is a¬†rice pudding¬†from the cuisine of the¬†Indian subcontinent, made by boiling rice, broken wheat,¬†tapioca, or¬†vermicelli¬†with milk and sugar; it is flavoured with¬†cardamon,¬†raisins,¬†saffron,¬†cashews,¬†pistachios¬†or¬†almonds. It is typically served during a meal or as a dessert. It is also known in some regions as¬†payesh,¬†payasam,¬†payasa,¬†phirni,¬†gil-e-firdaus¬†and¬†kheer.

The diversity of it's food is as diverse as it's people. We left very full! I‚Äôll definitely be back.

Top class decor state of the art ambience and lightning fast service have impressed me a lot. Kachchi biriyani is a must try here. It is not like traditional biriyani and have some sour masala in it. Mutton was well cooked and soft. Chicken cheese kabab was an another great dish though I personally felt that it was a bit salty.
Nonetheless if you are an Indian food lover you should visit here!

The place is near the Kidderpore a.c. market. The ambience and the behaviour of staff is very good. We ordered the followings:
Mutton galawti kabab:-(5/5) It was completely mouth-melting. Complementary 4 slices of paratha was given along with 4 Galawtis. This is one of the best Galawtis in town.
Chicken malai kabab:-(4/5) It was tasty but I could hardly feel the malai. 6 pieces were served along with pudina chatni.
We wanted to have the Awadi biriyani but we were informed that it takes more than 45 mins to get it ready as they cook it in a separate handi. So due to lack of time in our hand we ordered,
Mutton Dariyabadi biriyani:-(5/5) This is a bit spicy than our normal kolkata classic biriyanis. It is cooked in Lucknowy style and tastes just awesome. It contained 2 pieces of big chunks of meat, potato and an egg. The biriyani had lots of spices, cashews, raisins, fried onions,etc. Loved it.
Mixed raita:-(5/5) chat masala was sprinkled over it which enhanced it's taste.
Phirni:-(5/5) one of the best phirnis in town. The taste of sweet didn't overpower the dish and was well balanced.
I would definitely recommend this place. Will visit the place again for sure.

We had heard about this place since long but hadn't had the chance to visit it because of the distance issue. Finally got the chance last weekend, and I must say , it was totally worth the visit.

The decor is excellent , with a huge seating area. The service was prompt.

The food is absolutely amazing. We had ordered Chicken Malai Kabab for the starter. It was perfect and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth. In the main course, we ordered Butter Naan, Chicken Afghani and Daryabadi Biryani. Having had biryani from nearly all the major restaurants in Kolkata, I can safely say that the flavor and taste of this Biryani is something else entirely, completely out of this world. The Chicken Afghani was brilliant as well. For dessert, we had Gajar ka Halwa which was also very good.

My only regret is that since it was just my wife and I, we couldn't order more dishes. Hope to visit again soon to try out the other varieties of Biryani.

Had mutton goulati kebab (yummy) naan,mutton chap, special mutton and chicken biryani chicken tandoori, chicken hariyali kebab, chicken bharta. Bharta was good but not as delicious as other dishes. Decent ambience and quality food. The only issue we had to face was incorrect order served to us due to lack of communication within the waiters.

Among the top biriyani makers of Kolkata, India Restaurant at Kidderpore needs a special mention. In spite of located at a quite odd place, India Restaurant draws biriyani lovers from all over the city and beyond.¬†

They have three floors - ground floor is like a dhaba, eat and out. While upper two floors are lavishly decorated interiorly and have AC. However I don't mind whether they have AC floor or not, until they continue to make excellent Indian cuisines.¬†

What do they offer: Kachhi Biriyani is their top seller. Come after 3:30 pm and you will miss it. But they have some hidden gems which often people miss it like - Awadhi Biriyani, Daryabadi Biriyani. And I am telling you that both are awesome. Daryabadi is bit more spicy than Awadhi, but both come with tender mutton botis.¬†

They make excellent Murg Massallam, Fish tikka kebabs and Mutton Seekh kebabs. Murg Massallam, as the name says, is a entire chicken stuffed with masala, is baked and served as a royal dish. It takes around 4 hours to make and serve. Totally yummy!!! Kebabs are superb, tender and would make the perfect starter of your dine out.¬†

As I had Chicken Afgani and Naan too, I would mention that they are equally good, but being a biriyani lover, I can't put these rooti and side dishes at par with India's biriyani offerings.¬†

India has been offering several deserts - Firni, Sahi Tukra and Gajar Halua. But Firni is best, almost zero dalda/moida and super smooth texture.¬†

In case you missed India Restaurant, visit ASAP!

This is the apt place for all the people who call themselves food lovers.And even if you are not a food lover ,this place will make you one.It is one of the legendary outlets in kolkata that serve the best dishes you will ever have.It's actually a paradise for food enthusiast.Located very conveniently in khidderpore,this is a gem of a place and you will regret missing it.

The place is very thoughtfully created with a royal touch to the interiors and will make you feel like you are in a palace surrounded with soulful and lip smackingly delicious food.The ambiance and decor is the best in every sense.The creative 3D art work was mind blowing.Spread over ground + 2 floor, this place is spacious enough,the ground floor being their takeaway counter .The staff was extremely helpful and courteous.

Moving on to the¬† main aspect -FOOD

We started with,

1.Mutton seekh kebab-The kebab was extremely delicious and flavourful. Perfectly cooked with a balance of spices is my description for this delectable dish.Pudina dip and salad is also served with this starter.

2.Fish tikka-It was succulent ,juicy and totally melt in mouth.This one is made with delicate basa fish marinated with spices and cooked with love.Indeed the best fish tikka i have ever had.Highly recommended.

For the MAIN COURSE,

1.Mutton awadhi biryani-Served in clay pots and sealed with wheat flour dough,this is gonna be the best biryani you will ever have.The biryani had 4 juicy and tender mutton pieces and was a bit on the spicier side.The long rice grains had the perfect aroma of spices and each bite of it will¬† make you long for more.

2.Murgh Musollam-This one is a very special dish and requires to be cooked for 2 hrs on dum.The whole chicken is stuffed with egg and is cooked with lots of aromatic spices and that makes this dish amazing.The gravy is made with chicken keema and lots of cashews.

3.Chicken afghani-It had chicken juliennes cooked till perfection.The taste was simply amazing with balanced flavours .This gravy dish is the perfect side dish with the right consistency for any type of naan or roti.

4.Butter naan-Naan was very soft and not all chewy.The¬† naan was brushed with generous amount of butter to retain its softness.We enjoyed every bite of the naan with the delicious side dishes.

5.Phirni-Any meal is incomplete without desert.So for desert we opted for their popular phirni. Served in a petite clay dish,the phirni was totally different from the other places as it was more creamier and the texture was awesome.This one is totally recommended.Caution-Miss it at your own risk.

The pocket pinch was also reasonable for the delicious food they serve.If you haven't visited this place yet you are seriously missing out something big.So visit ASAP.

A big thanks to the whole team of India restaurant for their outstanding service.I would love to visit this place again and again and i am sure each time i will be back with another bunch of memorable experience.

In one word, serves the best biriyani in the entire city. If u r looking for authentic biriyani then this place is what u r looking for. Biriyani be it be chicken or mutton, tastes awesome, meat is perfectly cooked and melts in the mouth. The pieces are quite good. Halim is also delicious, I had it with Rumali Roti. Do not miss the Shahi Tukda which tastes like heaven - sweet along with rich smell of ghee... Can't get enough of the food from this restaurant. Keep it up India Restaurant.

On the occasion of Durga Puja(chaturthi) we went to taste their famous Kachchi Biryani. But unfortunately it was finished and then we had to try mutton biryani along with mocktail and kakori kabab. Taste was no doubt good as expected. But non availability of kachchi biryani put us a bit down.

I have been to Dastarkhan in Lucknow. But India Restaurant wins, hands down. We had the Galawti Kebabs and the Mutton Awadhi Biriyani. The kebabs come with thin parathas and are melt-in-the-mouth soft. The biriyani is the best I ever had- it came with sprinklings of khoa, the resultant taste was unique and divine. Truly a memorable meal.

One of the best restaurants I have ever tried. I just loved the ambience, decor, service and food. Ambience was calming, decor was elegant, service was courteous and food was soul soothing.
We ordered Fish tikka kebab and mutton awdhi Biryani. First let me tell you, I normally don't like those green kebab chutneys, I like kebab on it's own. But the kebab chutney of India restaurant was an exception, I thoroughly enjoyed it with mouth watering, soul soothing Fish kebabs. Just like kebab, Biryani was a bit too tasty to explain in words. My only disappointment, the server stirred steaming hot Biryani a bit much, right before serving. In result, rice grains got broken in process and started looking like overcooked. Buy apart from that, my whole experience was awesome. I started planning my next visit, even before I can leave the place.

This restaurant is a great place, has a great rating and I am only very happy to add to its laurels. It's situated in a neighbourhood not known as the food capital and this gem pleasantly surprised us.

Very tastefully decorated, with an overdose of opulence, but in a good way. The restaurant is spacious, with a roomy waiting area, upstairs. There's a takeout section downstairs that's buzzing with activity . The staff were very courteous and helpful.

Onto the food then, we ordered a Malai Kebab Chicken, Daryabadi Biryani, Chicken Butter Masala, butter naan and firni. The kebab was melt in the mouth. So good that my brain was rendered numb for a millisecond on the first bite. The Biryani was a new experience, pleasantly surprising me with the tangy, sweet taste and the goodness of dry fruits in it. The mutton piece was succulent and the definition of 'melt-in-the-mouth'. I could even write a para about the aloo but that would be too much I guess. üòÇ
The chicken side dish was also good, but probably the goodness of the mutton distracted me from enjoying the chicken as much as I would have liked.
The butter naan itself was so good, I could have eaten a few and then noticed I hadn't touched the chicken.
The firni was also very nice, the texture and the aroma just right.

The price pinch was reasonable, I'd even say cheap. Highly recommended!

Went to India restaurant yesterday, after ages.Today it is a 300 seater restaurant (possibly one of the biggest in capacity in Kolkata) with "semi fine dining" (if one can say that) ambience. The central A/C works very efficiently indeed. It has become multi-cuisine, with Chinese being a part of the menu.

It was pre-decided that we shall have the Indian cuisine & ordered a reasonably large menu.

Started off with Galawati Kabab (4 kababs of very decent size/plate) served with a complimentary "Lucknowi paratha" (thin paratha fried with very little oil). The kabab & paratha were absolutely divine. Almost took me to "Tundey" Lucknow. Almost, because the flavour quotient was lacking a wee bit. The portion served is good for 2 persons.

Followed it up by Chicken Afghani kabab & was floored. Soft, succelent, medium sized, 5 pieces of pure bliss. The flavour was subtle & tasted sublime with that signature smoky aroma.

Wanted a Shammi kabab (I am not aware if any outlet makes it any more) which was not listed in the menu. Was recommended Kakori instead. This was a let down, since it was the same "galawati mix" done up on a sheek. The taste of "grounded bengal grams" was completely missing.

Followed this up with Chicken Tangri kabab, which was a let down again. Too spiced up & cooked in very high heat. Thus the surface was burnt, crusted & bitter.

This was followed by Mutton burrra kabab. Yet again too spiced up, cooked in high heat, crusted & burnt exterior.

All the portions were large & good for 2 persons. An added advantage was the option of "half plate" for some kababs.

Then came the two biriyanis, we had ordered. The "Mutton Biriyani special", which is the regular biriyani, with two pieces of mutton. This is a lovely work of art, with a very fine balance between the aroma & spices.

The piece-de-resistance was the "mutton awadhi biriyani". It is only prepared upon order & has a half hour lead time. Served in a earthen sealed pot ...... ohhh!! the aroma when the seal was broken. Trust me, even the guests on the next table turned around. Light, fluffy basmati, cooked in dum with whole spices defines culinary bliss. The 4 pieces of mutton was soft, succelent & boneless. Also has an Alu.

The dessert was firni of course & without any doubt & hesistation, I would rate it the best firni I have had in Kolkata so far. So much so that we packed four firnis back home.

Overall, it is an outlet today, which is basically designed to serve a large number of guests at one time & hence some dishes maybe lacking in the taste quotient to the discerning tongue.

Ideally, one must instruct the steward to slow cook the kababs (especially mutton varieties) & I am sure the best can be obtained. I for sure would visit this outlet once again, to get the best results.

In the end, let me remember Chef Avatar Gill, of Astor Hotel ((Kabab-e-que), whom old timers like me may recall (alas he is not there any more). I am yet to taste a mutton burra kabab, like the way he made.

Located near fancy market on Karl Marx sarani this is perhaps one of the best places in the city of joy to have mughal and north indian food. We went there on choturthi afternoon and we were absolutely overwhelmed by everything. The restaurant has 3 floors, the ground floor being non a.c. and the first and second floors having a.c. accommodations. The 3d decor is absolutely brilliant with the yellow lights making it even more beautiful. The staff were pretty polite and served our food pretty fast.
We ordered chicken cheese kebab and special mutton biryani. The chicken cheese kebab were excellent. The chicken pieces melted in our mouth with the perfect amount of cheese on it. The biryani had 3 pieces mutton one piece egg and one piece potato. One plate was enough for two.
Food - 5/5
Decor- 5/5
Service- 4.5/5
The price is bit on the expensive side but it is worth every penny.
Looking forward to visiting again

This restaurant can easily be called a paradise for biriyani lovers. Located on Carl Marx Sarani , one will be surely mesmerized by the grandeur of this place. We were already impressed by the royal decor and obviously by the Zomato rating. We ordered chicken malai kebab, dariyabadi biriyani, tawa chicken, butter naan and phirni. Kebab was well cooked and perfectly spiced and malai could be felt in every bite. Dariyabadi biriyani was a bit different from our regular Kolkata biriyani. It had a sweet and spicy texture and had dry fruits in it. Biriyani's mutton was so soft that it surely deserves a special mention. Tawa chicken was a bit spicy but tasted perfect with butter naan. Phirni was a bit different from other places as it was dense and had a mouth melting taste. Their service was good and the bill made us even happier. Definitely going to come back here to taste their other items.
Overall experience-
Ambience- 4.5/5
Food- 5/5
Service- 5/5

Visited this place on the 14th of August. After going through so many reviews we ordered the following:
MUTTON KAKURI KEBAB: Holy cow! This was the best kebab I have ever tasted.Seriously I've tasted Lucknow's galawati kebabs and many other minced mutton kebabs throughout the country but the kakuri kebab of India restaurant is the ultimate showstopper, this dish is the best kebab in the country! Highly recommend.
KACHHI BIRIYANI: Well after hearing a lot about it and following the waiter's recommendation we ordered this item accordingly.This Biriyani is same as the DARYABADI BIRIYANI except the fact that the later comes with 2 pieces of mutton.This Biriyani had cashew nuts and raisins with the plum(aloobokhra) which gives it a very unique flavour.My expectation was a bit more about this Biriyani because it was highly recommend by the waiters and other people in the F and P department, however I did not like the sweetish and sour taste of rasins and nuts with Biriyani.Anyway it was a little okayish.I would have rated this place 5 but the Biriyani disappointed me.
GAJAR KA HALWA: Again this was really well cooked. The aroma of ghee with every spoon of the halwa was really mouth watering.
SHAHI TUKRA: This dessert was also very delicious.Again another peice of perfection.Highly recommended.

India Restaurant.

A bit lesser known name for normal people. But a sensational for foodies. I‚Äôve been in touch with them from a very long time because of having a home near port area and only commendable restaurant was this. I‚Äôve seen it growing and what they have now. Ok so being unbiased with them :p let‚Äôs see what we can get from here after it‚Äôs big renovation.

Food- Tasty would be under complement for them. They have the specialty in North Indian and Oudhy dishes. Biryani is superb. Tandoor items and their specific butter mussalas are at per. So satisfying.

Decor- Awesome renovations they have made. It‚Äôs cozy. Great family atmosphere. A fine place for hang out. Location might be far for some people. It‚Äôs like 15min max from esplanade and 10min from Princep Ghat.

The staffs are really friendly and well behaved. Will surely revisit. So a tasty 9/10 from me.

Located just near Fancy Market(Karl Marx Sarani),Kidderpore,This restaurant promises to deliver one of the best mughlai cuisines in the city of joy. ‚ÄúIndia Restaurant‚Äù believes in grandeur and thus offers a beautiful set up to the food lovers visiting the restora with it‚Äôs creative 3-D art work which is lighten up by warmth of yellow lights and the striking feature of the decor of this place is the glass engineering they have infused into their decoration procedure which creates reflections and a mirror effect which looks very classy,delicate and offers vibrant ambience.

In the hustle bustle of Khidirpur, India Restaurant stands tall like a renowned culinary wonder of kolkata. India restaurant needs no special introduction to the foodies of kolkata specially those who are fond of north indian cuisine. The location of this place is fairly easy since its just a 2 minutes walk from fancy market and also on the main road which makes it fairly simple to locate this place.

The outlet has 2 floors of AC sitting. We were seated in the first floor which has a huge sitting capacity and can easily pack loads of customers. But the what attracted me was the decor and ambience. Shiny furnishing along with usage of right kind of lights surely would make your dining experience a very royal one. The place has separate wash basins & toilets which makes this a very customer friendly place since many places lack these basic amenities.

Anyways cutting back to chase, I shall mention about the culinary treat we were experienced with:-

1. Virgin Mojito - A very refreshing basic virgin mojito served with with mint leaves & a dash of lime with a cherry to top it off. The dilution of the mojito was spot on since it had the perfect zing to go with our lunch. Loved every bit of it.

2. Macchi Sarsowali - 1 plate of this kebab comes in 4pcs. This was certainly the star of the kebab section. Made with delicate basa fish with absolutely gob smacking marination made us crave for more of this dish. Pudina chutney & chopped salad as accompaniments were given with the kebabs. Highly Recommended dish which one must not miss!!

3. Chicken chatpata kebab - 10 pcs of chicken wings marinated in spicy tikka masala were given 1 plate along with pudina chutney & chopped salad. Foodies having love for spicy tikka kebabs must try this dish. The taste was simply outstanding in terms of balance of flavours & the cooking of the kebab was absolute perfection. Another recommended dish!!

4. Chicken malai kebab - 6 pcs of kebab comes in 1 plate along with pudina chutney & chopped salad. This version of kebab was rather light & amicable in taste compared to the previous 2 kebabs but still won our hearts with its taste & delicateness. The taste of malai was felt in each biteful.

5. Paneer Tikka kebabs - This was consumed by our vegetarian group member. According to him he had one of the best paneer tikka kebabs ever in kolkata due to its sheer softness & marination of the masala.

6. Butter Naan - Our main course started off with naans along with non veg side dishes. The naans were fluffy with generous amount of butter being brushed over the naans to maintain the moisture. The naans were were too good to eat due to the soft nature of it which indicated the quality of its preparation. One fact which caught my attraction was that the naans remained soft even after some moment of time(like about 10-15mins) due us being taking snaps of it.

7. Garlic Naan - Same texture as the butter naan with only difference being the presence of garlic chops & herbs instead of butter. The garlics were in generous portions & certainly was enjoyable with our side dishes.

8. Chicken achari - The chicken side dish of our main course. The lovely smell of achar(pickle) tickled our nose buds before we dug into the dish. The dish had 4 pieces of medium sized chunks of chicken with a nice non spicy gravy. The gravy was absolutely delectable with right amount of consistency needed to compliment our naans. We were absolutely thrilled with the dish. Definitely recommended.

9. Mutton dakbanglow - A bengali's meal is just incomplete without the presence of a rich mutton dish. So mutton dakbanglow was there just to savour the whole moment of our lunch. Again 4 pcs of soft juicy chunky muttons were given in the dish along with a boiled egg. The rich gravy surely was contrasting to the chicken one. We kept on licking our fingers after having this dish. Surely a crowd pleaser this dish.

10. Mixed Vegetables - A traditional mixed veg which is an absolute favourite for any foodie.

11. Special mutton biryani - A north indian outlet's main challenge is always to pass the biryani test amongst its customers. A good/bad biryani can really make/break a place specially in kolkata where customers just swear by their love for biryani. The quantity of the biryani was certainly on the higher side which had 2 pcs of large mutton pieces,1 egg & 1 potato. The biryani was spicy and the rice had a beautiful aroma to it but the mutton deserves a special mention due to its sheer tenderness & taste. Although i felt the biryani was a tad too overly spiced.

12. Veg biryani - The presentation certainly caught our eyes & the quantity was also very generous. A bowl of raita was also provided along with it.

13. Firni - Now coming to the desserts we started off with the classical firni. The firni was certainly different as compared to other places since it was a bit dense but packed with lots of flavours as a firni should be. Loved every spoonful of it.

14. Shahi tukda - This dish was the only flaw i felt in whole of our meal. The texture of the dish was certainly too light which i think was due to the addition of rosewater. But no hard feelings.

After our hefty lunch we certainly left with a happy potbelly and a smile on our faces. Also a big thank you to Vicky Chen and the whole team of India restaurant for the warm hospitality & the service. A special mention to Tanmoy Basak for all the arrangement. So head down to india restaurant asap to enjoy some magnificent north indian cuisine.

It is really rare that you have a dining experience that truly blows your mind, that is a treat to your tastebuds as well as your eyes. Well, believe it or not, today it was just that. Located near Khidderpore more, just beside fancy market, this little place of heaven is serving the best mughal dishes in town. Team Munching Monks was invited to a Foodie's meet by and I, being a member of the group, was able to sample some of their best dishes.

On our menu was-

‚àöVirgin Mojito- Nice and fresh. Went real nice with all the heavy dishes that we tasted.

‚àöFish Sarsowali- This one was one of my favourite. The skin was perfectly caramelized. Really nice and crispy. And the inside was soft and moist and tender. It was delicious. Highly recommended.

‚àöChicken Chatpata Kebab- This dish was tasty as well. Chicken wings cooked in Tandoori style. Masaladar and spicy, I liked this dish. 

‚àöChicken Malai Kebab- Though this dish tasted a bit bland after the strong flavours of the Chatpata kabab, this dish was in no way lagging in taste. The kabab was tender and soft. I loved the subtle smoky flavour of this dish. 

‚àöPaneer tikka- Delicate and soft. The paneer was pretty great.

Main Course :
‚àöMutton Special Biryani- India Restaurant is rightly considered to be the forerunner of Kolkata Biriyani. Beautifully flavoured rice along with two pieces of perfectly cooked mutton. It's was shortcut to heaven. 

‚àöChicken Achari: Mildly spicy chicken dish with the Achari flavour soaked in thick gravy. I loved the taste of Achar in the chicken. This one is highly recommended. 

‚àöMutton Daakbangla- To be honest, I was surprised to find a traditionally Bengali dish on their menu. Infact I was sceptical. But boy, was I surprised. This is the best Mutton Daakbangla I have tasted till date. Tender juicy mutton pieces in a thick gravy full of Indian spices. Just loved it. This is one dish I will go back again for. Highly highly recommended.

‚àöMixed Veg- This is a pretty great dish as far as veg dishes are concerned. 

‚àöGarlic Naan- Even though we took a long time clicking pics, the naan was soft. The finely chopped onions were a nice addition to it. 

‚àöButter Naan- The naan was very soft and buttery. They were really great.

Desserts:
‚àöShahi Tukra- This dish lacked the creaminess and richness that I expected, but nevertheless tasted great.

‚àöFirni- This one was amazing. I loved this dessert. It was really tasty. 
 Thank you Mr. Vicky Chen for the hospitality. 
And thank you too

‚ÄúEast or West, INDIA is the best‚Äù

Being a 90‚Äôs kid, I used to love this song ‚Äì and today, I recalled this song after 2 decades, post my visit to the ‚ÄúINDIA‚Äù restaurant @ Khidderpore, near the Fancy Market!

Spread over G+2, the place provides awesome availability, great seating arrangements, perfect ambience, outstanding service and mind blowing fodder ‚Äì of course! Hygiene, cleanliness, variety, taste .... whatever the parameter, they withstand all to perfection, you name it ‚Äì they have it!

Inclined more towards North Indias, Mughlai as well as Awadhi cuisines, this place offers the ultimate tongue ticklers, and I sampled thefollowing:-

(i)	Veg Paneer tikka kebab ‚Äì Served with a few green capsicum and tomato as well as lachcha onion slices, this was just the most delicate paneer I have ever had in my life, an experience I would be relishing for decades to come and a taste I can recall all my life ‚Äì just the perfect start to our meal. Indeed, 1st impression is the last impression ‚Äì and they created the perfect 1st impression on all of us!

(ii)	Mixed vegetables ‚Äì The Bong styled Mixed veg cooked by the Muslim master chef could give the Bong chefs a run for their money. Pretty low oil content, decent chop of potatoes, paneer, raw tomoto slices, peas and what not, and definitely high on taste!

(iii)	Garlic Naan and Butter Naan ‚Äì Could not have asked for a better bread basket, those huge naans with onion toppings are sure to blow you away with their taste, presentation and size!

(iv)	Mixed salad ‚Äì Glad that the chef served some sliced cucumbers, tomatoes as well as onions ‚Äì they are the need of the hour along with these spicy delicacies!

(v)	Virgin Mojito ‚Äì Could not have asked for a better mocktail accompaniment, a sip every now and then after a bite or two kept us refreshed!

(vi)	Veg Biryani ‚Äì The best thing about this is that they prepare it so light and fine, that you need not burp even a single time after eating a plate or even two of this mesmerizing biryani!

(vii)	Raita ‚Äì The only item on the menu, which I disliked, the taste factor was missing (surpisingly). However, no points deducted for this!

(viii)	Shahi Tukda ‚Äì Mildly cold rabri poured over a fat and huge bread slice and fried ‚Äì a 5/5 for presentation, a 5/5 for quantity and a 6/5 for taste!

(ix)	Firni ‚Äì We all love happy endings and this was 1 of the best! Simply have a look at the pic, it itself says it all!
Last, but definitely not the least, hugs to The Foodinista (Tanmay Basak) for leading us to INDIA!

Believe me when I say that all they charge is peanuts for the above bundled experience!

Overall, a dining experience to cherish for long, a meet up which will stay with me till eternity and to conclude, I can only say:- ‚ÄúINDIA ‚Äì Aaha ! nothing official about it‚Äù

Hands down the best kebabs one can have in town. Compliments to the chef for not taking the beaten path and exploring the unknown and cooking food which is not only music to our taste buds but an epitome of culinary excillence. I mean I was so sure that I would love this place that I decided to give it 5star even before I took the first bite. We were offered a huge arsenal of dishes. Thanks to Tanmay Da and Jaydeep. Staff are indeed courteous and very helpful. Service is unbelievably quick.
Shout-out to chef Md. Ameen, you sir personify brilliance. It was indeed an honour for me to have lunch at your place. I would soon be back again. Till then all my best wishes

'India Restaurant ',located in Khidirpur is reagrded as the best restaurant when it comes to delicious Mughlai dishes. I would like to thank Mr. Vicky Chen  for the hospitality and Mr. Tanmay Bask for leading us.

The decor of this restaurant is as grand as it gets. From beautiful paintings to grand lightning everything hinted at the grand meal we were about to be served.

FOOD:- The food consisted of a wide array of items. The starters included Fish Sarsonwali kebab, Chicken Chatpata Kebab and Chicken Malai Kebab. The fish sarsonwali kebab was decadence. It was soft,juicy and absolutely delicious. The Chicken Chatpata Kebab was heavenly in every aspect .It was spicy and tasty. The Chicken Malai kebab was delectable. It was not so spicy as the Chicken Chatpata kebab but was delicious in every aspect.

The main course consisted of Chicken Achari,Mutton Dakbanglaw, Butter Nan, Garlic Nan and Special Mutton biryani. The Chicken achari was tangy yet delicious. The Chicken pieces were soft, juicy and delicious. The mutton dakbanglaw was delicious. It was spicy and delicious. The mutton was softer than a cotton and tasty as heaven. The butter and garlic nan went well with these two. The Mutton Special Biryani was heavenly . The aroma coming out of it made us mad. The rice was flavoured perfectly and the mutton was soft,tender and juicy. We were in biryani heaven.

The desserts consisted of Sahi Tukra and Firni. The firni was delicious, however the sahi tukra could have been better. It lacked the toughness of a sahi tukra.

The staff was very well-behaved and amiable. I will definitely visit agian.

It's a famous restaurant so I don't think anyone need any direction to reach there still if you need then it is situated just beside the Karl Marx Sarani near fancy market.

Very after when you will enter the restaurant, you will understand how beautiful the decoration is. It's prodigious, they have two floors for dine in & they also have a waiting lounge. We took our lunch in the 2nd floor. Every staff of the restaurant is appreciable from the gate keeper to the waiter, everyone.

We ordered #Fish_Pakora #Mutton_Awadhi_Biryani #Chicken_Biryani #Onion_Salad #Peshwari_Chicken_Butter_Masala #Tandoori_Butter_Masala #Butter_Naan #Firni
Each & every item was 10/10 in taste. Tandoori chicken masala was avg in taste.

Great ambience, nice dishes, caring staffs. Daryabadi biriyani was a blast of taste, so was dum chicken and firni. Shahi tukra didn't impress me as firni did. Kababs were good, I think marination were not done properly because they taste different from inside.

1 point reduced for slow serving and garnish.

Suggestion : While serving one biriyani in two plates, place two clean plates at the table, then divide it from the plate having biriyani.

A 4.5 rated restaurant which is widely popular for its Biryani on all over Zomato and other Social media. If it is a headline of any restaurant, then how a Biriyani lover like us, can ignore this place?

Location ‚Äì Situated just beside of Fancy Market at Kidderpore on Karl Marx Sarani. So it will be no problem to find this restaurant.

Ambiance and management ‚Äì If you ask about ambiance in one word, I will say, just wow. From the entrance to the dining place, you will get a premium touch at everything. Very well maintained, neat and clean each item, you get a 5star restaurant kind of feelings.

Team MunchingMonks was invited few days ago to try some of their most popular item. 

The dishes we tried were -

1. Virgin Mojito Slush ‚Äì Natural refresher with no additional preservatives. Mint lemon flavoured drinks.

2. Strawberry Signature Shake ‚Äì After e watery drinks, this drinks really give pleasures to the taste bud. Lite Strawberry flavour with foam texture. Love the item. 

3. Chocolate Signature Shake ‚Äì Another mild flavour drinks from kitchen. The chocolate flavour was not so strong in nature but has its own distinguishable flavour.

4. Mutton Galawati Kebab ‚Äì One of the India Restaurant‚Äôs finest. Kebab were crispy grilled and with cashew on top, it really looks delicious. The Kebab comes with complimentary parathas also. Taste wise awesome, just like its looks. Overall must try item here.¬†

5. Special Cheese Kebab ‚Äì Chicken kebab with thick cheesy layer on outside. The outer layer was little bit hard in nature but the chicken pieces inside were juicy.

6. Honey Fish ‚Äì Don‚Äôt love chicken of mutton starter item? No problem. The restaurant also has solution for it. One of the best Honey Fish I‚Äôve ever tried. The fish pieces will literally just melt in your mouth and the honey gravy was really finger licking. Another highly recommended item.

7. Pineapple Tandoori ‚Äì This was the first item I tried such dishes. Sliced Pineapples were grilled and served in beautifully manner with chutneys.

8. Daryabadi Biryani ‚Äì This item is the special item here. Probably the only restaurant in Kolkata, which serves Biryani with dry fruits, keeping that similar Biryani flavour. Two pieces of mutton, one-piece egg and aloo were there. Mutton pieces were so soft that it easily met in your mouth. Little bit spicy in nature but no oily at all, which is really surprising. Overall a must try item here.

9. Laccha Paratha ‚Äì Traditional paratha with crispy outer coating. But from inside it was soft. Goes well with any types of spicy side items.

10. Fish Tikka Butter Masala ‚Äì Fish butter masala cooked in traditional way. Fish pieces were soft and juicy. The gravy was rich in taste but goes well with any types of bread or roties.

11. Mutton Sahi Korma ‚Äì Two big pieces of mutton were served in a spicy thick gravy. Perfect accompanies with roti or nun.

12. Sahi Tukra ‚Äì This is one of my fav item. The juice was thick in nature and the kaser flvour will surely drag your attention.

13. Firni ‚Äì Traditional sweet served in a clap pot. Taste best when it was frozen. Overall good.

Thank you Mr. Joydeep Sen for inviting us.
 It was really an awesome time spent at India Restaurant.
Thank You Mr. Vicky Chen for having us over and hosting with such delectable dishes and special thank you

The legendary restaurant needs no introduction and had been on my wishlist since ages and finally few days back got the opportunity to visit this place and no need to say it did not disappoint me at all. Starting from ambience, interior decoration, food quality to staff service this restaurant amazed us in every aspect. There we ordered mouth watering chicken cheese kebab as a starter which was absolutely heavenly infact a must try one and mutton awadhi biryani which was equally good although plain mutton biryani is their fort√® (my personal opinion); and last but not the least we had firni without which the biryani is absolutely incomplete üòú

We went there to celebrate my friend's first job. The food was just heavenly. The beautiful decor, the soothing playlist and friendly staffs added to our experience. We had a grand "dawat". We had ordered fresh lime soda , galawati kabab and chicken cheese kabab. The galawati kabab was cooked to perfection. The awadhi biriyani just swept us off our feet. The desserts were also pretty decent. Hope to visit again.

If you are looking for most authentic Awadhi and Mughlai cuisine, then must visit this place because this restaurant is the best place for it. You will get the best biryani in the city till date (personal opinion).

Located just beside the famous Fancy Market at Khidirpore.

The interior is royal and it has three sections. Ground floor is a non ac section whereas the first and the second floor are ac sections. Well maintained I must say. Really good. Even the lightings are nice. So thumbs up to their d√©cor.

Now coming on the most important food part. We started with some welcome drinks followed by Starters, Main course and desserts.

It was my mommy's birthday and i had to make it spl. After a lot of research on zomato i finally zoomed in to Oudh 1590. Just when i fixed up my mind to treat my mom there i came across this hidden jewel in Zomato and after reading the reviews decided to give it a shot, considering this place is centrally located and closer to my home. And it was one of the best decisions till date since my mom loved every bit of it, the food, the ambience, the service...everything was perfect! 
Food- We ordered Chicken Cheese Kebab, Mutton Awadhi Biryani, Butter Naan, Mutton Kosha, Fresh Lime Sodas, Firni arnd Sundae. All items were fresh and yummy. Did not like the firni though. It was overtly sweet.
Ambience- The resturant is squeaky clean. Its beautifully lit and decorated. Love the decor.
Service- Service was quick and staffs are courteous. The doorman even clicked me a picture. A very sweet gesture i must say. üòä
Overall a beautiful experience and would visit again soon!! Highly recommended!!

Since 2006 Iam a big fan of India 's  biryani. Yesterday  I went here my family. We order galauti kebab ,paratha and mutton biryani.  My son love the taste galauti and paratha. Galauti melt in mouth so well. As usual  biryani was good. Biriyani's Mutton was cooked well . Apart from the food staffs  are well  behaved.  It is always pleasure to me visit here.

I have visited couple of time at IndianPlace of Great ambient ..... Good Hospitality & definitely good food with reasonable price.
My favorite dish is "Mutton Duck Banglo/ow" with plain Tandori Rooti. || Chicken Reshmi Kabab || Putton Rara Punjab.
They also prepare Chinese but please don't go for it.¬† ¬†
Some of few item I didn't like ie: Rezala, Sahi Tukra & Firni (Don't get me wrong these are also in test good but somehow to me it is not quite represent the name).

East or west,India is the best.Delicious food and sufficient quantity.Ambience is enjoyable.Staffs are humble.Biryani is too good.So are the kebabs and desserts.Price is reasonable and they give you the value for money.Parking lot is there,so those who are coming with their cars don't worry.

A place that is on every foodie's checklist.
Once we found it on Zomato, it took us a long time to visit this place due to it's awkward location. Located at Kidderpore, this place surely deserves more footfall and appreciation than it gets. 
After entering the restro, we were awestruck with the ambience and the interior decorations, surely no less than a 5 star restaurant, yet pocket friendly. Staffs were friendly and very well mannered.
Coming to food, we ordered one chelo kebab and daryabadi biryani. Chelo kebab was very nice, especially the kebabs. Biryani was equally good. It was an wonderful experience. Hoping to visit the place very soon. Since it is not centrally located, it is hard to visit the place, at will. Hopefully, they will come up another outlet in the city to fulfill our crave for good food.

We went there today for lunch with 7 of my friends. We tried mutton galawti kabab, chicken Afghani kabab, mutton awadhi biriyani and mutton kacchi biriyani.
Mutton galawti kabab was out of the world. It was actually melting while having it. It was served with thin parathas which were going so perfect with it that we ordered extra parathas.
Chicken Afghani kabab was recommended to us by the Waiter. It was really good. But I think it would have been better if it had been boneless. 
Mutton awadhi biriyani was really different from typical Kolkata biriyani. Quantity was good. 
Mutton kacchi biriyani was of slight disappointment. We had never tried it elsewhere so don't want to comment on this.
Otherwise the decor and service were very good.

Well...this is a place really close to my house but as it happens: nearest to the church farthest from god,I hadn't been here before long my cousin literally drag me here......there were 8 of us including 2naughty kiddos and we were given a very warm welcome...we were made to sit very near to the kebab counter,perhaps to increase our salivation....we ordered some kebabs, biriyani,firni and some drinks....the food came in huge portions and we had to pack it home,but the food was really good....I think foodaholics should give it a try,specially biriyani lovers and the best part is the restaurant is located at a few feet distance from the Fancy market...so if you are a gadget freak,u can dig in there too....try it some day...happy eating folks!!!

Situated just beside Fancy market, easily can b located. Interior is nice.. good place.. Biriyani lovers will love this place. Today I ordered for kachhi mutton biriyani, chiken reshmi butter masala, cheese chickn kabab and firni.
Kachhi biriyani- It was good, but a bit spicy for my taste bud, full of kaju and kishmis. Mutton was very soft and toooo tasty. I loved the mutton..
Chiken cheese kabab- great in taste must try it once.
Chiken reshmi butter masala- taste was good, but the chicken was not so soft, excepted to be a bit soft.
Now comes to the master piece thats the firni.. I die for this one.. great in taste.. one of the best firni in town..

The famous India Restaurant needs no new introduction, one of the top places servig best biriyani in Kolkata. Situated in Khidirpore Fancy Market, India Restaurant is creating magic from more than 2 decades. Went through renovation almost a year back, India Restaurant gives you a feel of palace once you enter. Royalty gives a smooth touch in their decor, ambience and food.

Had Galauti kebabs and paratha. They were extremely good. The parathas were so thin and soft and what should I say about the kebab? It just melted inside the mouth. 
We had mutton biriyani too after that. Decent taste and not so rich. Ambience was also good. 
But it was a bit expensive. Overall it was a good experience.

Even 'Phenomenal' would be an understatement for this Mughlai food heaven!
‚óè Location: Right at the heart of Khidirpore fancy market where the Khidirpore bridge ends.
‚óè Interiors: A three storeyed building. Ground floor comprises the billing counter and a non AC section, first floor has a family section and the second floor has a lounge like section. Squeaky clean, nicely lit and decorated. Very much spacious.
‚óè Food: Among other things, we had :
‚Ä¢ Special Cheese Kabab: chicken marinated in cheese, grilled in the tandoor.
‚Ä¢ Mutton Galawati Kabab : minced mutton given the shape of a patty, grilled in tandoor. Melts in the mouth! Comes with a complimentary Lucknowi paratha which has negligible amount of oil. Sooo good! MUST TRY!
‚Ä¢ Fish Honey: surprisingly not very sweet. Liked it!
‚Ä¢ Pineapple Tandoori : my fellow foodies liked it. Couldn't have it as i am allergic to pineapple.
‚Ä¢ Laccha Paratha: crunchy, flaky and not at all oily layered parathas.
‚Ä¢ Fish Tikka Butter Masala: rich in taste!
‚Ä¢ Mutton Sahi Korma: soft and succulent mutton cooked in cashew and yogurt gravy.
‚Ä¢ Daryabadi Biriyani: No sign of Dalda/vanaspati!!! Extremely light and fluffy basmati rice cooked in daryabadi style.
‚Ä¢ Firni : sooo good!
‚Ä¢ Shahi Tukra: extremely good as well. Must try!

Each one of these is highly recommended!
A must try!

Thanks to the owners for the invitation and hospitality.

' India Restaurant ' the name explains that the dishes are made with authentic indian spices which they serves.
The resturant is located exactly on the Kidderpore main crossing.
The interiors are decorated in such away that it gives you the Mughal jamana feeling. Our team Munching Monks were invited to the pre Durga Puja Special Lunch Menu leaded by Mr. Tanmay Basak.

Now moving forward to the food part we started with refreshment drniks, the kebabs, then with the main course and lastly finished off with Sweetooth desserts.
Here goes the menu in detailed

‚óè Virgin Mojito Slush
‚óè Strawberry Signature Shake
‚óè Chocolate Signature Shake
‚óè Special Cheese Kabab (3.5/5) - The kebabs were soft and tasty which were covered with a layer of cheese.
‚óè Mutton Galawati Kabab (5/5) - Such a delicious starter. Perfectly cooked. The outer part was crunchy with a Kaju topping. Lucknow paratha comes complimentry with this dish. Personal favourite.
‚óè Fish Honey (5/5) - This was one of the best item on the list. Got to try something new. Fish was really fresh and soft. I loved the dish. Strongly recommended.
‚óè Pineapple Tandoori (4/5) - This was something innovative on the menu. Fruits is just love. Pineaple slices were prepared like tandori with the tandori masala.
‚óè Laccha Paratha (4/5) - Laccha was soft and little sweet in taste. Any side dish is good combination with Laccha.
‚óè Fish Tikka Butter Masala (4/5) - A bong always loves fish. Perfectly cooked. The dish is perfect to be eaten with Hot Laccha paranthas.
‚óè Mutton Sahi Korma (4.5/5) - Theres nothing to explain the dish. I very much loved the dish. Mutton pieces were well cooked.
‚óè Daryabadi Biriyani (5/5) - Biryani is love, its an emotion. 1 plate is enough to be shared by 2 people. It comes with 1 sliced egg and 2 jumbo mutton pieces. The quantity is perfect. Value for money.
‚óè Firni
‚óè Shahi Tukra

A perfect lunch to treat yourself.
Please check into India Restaurant & try some awesome dishes they serve. :)

Being a foodie I waited long to taste Biriyani from India Restaurant and I was so excited that today is the day... We ordered 50 plates of biriyani for our office party at Newtown .... May be they have not made such a large quantity before. The biriyani was horrible. I doubt how ppl rate them 5??... All of us were really frustrated with the taste and quantity!... It was full of kaaju and kismis... like pulao... the alu was over cooked ... mutton piece was less than 50 grms including bone... 
The taste of roadside biriyani stalls are far better than this!!! 

I will never had and already shared my honest opinion with my other friends not to even try this sweet shit!!!

I'm reviewing the Biryani of India Restaurant, not the 'location', 'ambiance' or 'decoration' of the restaurant. Today, got a chance to taste one of their dishes which they call 'Biryani'. Ordered around 50 plates of Biryani for our team lunch at Ecospace, New Town. The only good part was, they agreed to deliver at New Town which is really far from their location.Believe me, I've had Biryanis in Tamil Nadu as well. But nothing was more horrible than what I eat in lunch today! Atleast I can't call it 'Biryani'. Atmost, I can call it a 'very bad Pulao' with strong sweet and ¬†sour taste, clutter of masala, a medium sized and not well boiled piece of mutton, pieces of potatos, an egg and a very unpleasant piece of Plum (Alu Bukhara). Sorry for my lack of experience, but I've never had cashew and kismis in Biryani, ever before this one!Quantity is much less compared to other Biryani specialists in Kolkata. And it tasted so horribly sour and sweet that none out of our 50 team members were able to complete even that small quantity of Biryani. NEVER EVER try mutton biryani from India Restaurant. We're not in late eighties. The city has already got wonderful Biryani specialists like Amenia, Arsalan, Haji, Ali Baba, Kabuliwa.la and even the local sellers in every other locality. I tested from all these named and unnamed sellers. Despite all their pros and cons, I can still undoubtedly confirm that none of their Biriyanis are as terrible as the India Restaurant's Biryani!!I would remain hungry for years but not try this shit ever again!

I visited this restaurant yesterday. It's a long route and totally in a different part of city. Restaurant is very spacious very well decorated and they even have a waiting room for people waiting in queue. All staffs are humble and well mannered.

In terms of food we took Chicken Cheese Kabab, Chicken tandoori, Mutton Biriyani, Mutton shahi stew & firni. Kabab & tandoori was delicious. Stew was good but very oily and less in quantity. Biriyani made me sad üòü because of my expectation level. Didn't find anything special to add this in wishlist. Firni was great no doubt.

Located in kidderpore, just beside the famous Fancy Market . This crowd in here is too much, due to which u won't be able to find parking spots easily. The restaurants is in the 1st floor. Interiors is too good. The staffs are polite and respond quickly. The food is very delicious, so order any food item from the menu, and you won't be disappointed. The price is also not much as compared to the interiors and food quality. One must try their biryani and phirni. Overall experience was very good. 0.5 deducted because there is no arrangement for parking vehicles.

To all Biryani lovers out there: If you haven't yet been to this place, you ain't no biryani lover! Easy to locate, this joint in kidderpore boasts of a beautiful decor and friendly staff. Coming to the food, we asked for Mutton Awadhi Biryani and Dum Chicken. The biryani took some time to arrive, but it was worth the wait. A handi full of steaming aromatic rice cooked in Ghee and bursting with flavors found its way to our table.@ The taste was extraordinary to say the least. Though the mutton pieces could have been a bit more tender. 
Though the biryani was the showstopper, the chicken side dish turned out to be great as well. They served four soft succulent chicken pieces(2 leg pieces.. Whoa!) in a mouth watering rich gravy. Loved everything about this place. Highly recommended!

The best biryani in Calcutta, undoubtedly. The mutton pieces are simply melt in your mouth. The biryani is not at all greasy like Arsalan. The galauti kebabs are a must try. Just the right amount of spice. The firni tastes very different. Different in a very good way. It tastes more like nolen Gur. And is superlative. Would highly recommend the firni.

We ordered mutton awadhi biriyani,mutton kacchi biriyani and chicken haryali butter masala. The ambiance is really good and enchanting. Food is also good both in terms of quality and quantity. Mutton awadhi biriyani was really a unique item I must say. The mixture of the spices and ghee particularly was really exquisite, adequate amount of everything so that you can enjoy every bite of it.In addition, the raita that they serve, as complimentary, was really smooth.I really loved its texture and the dominance of cucumber and tomato pieces over my tastebuds. In mutton kacchi biriyani I loved the minced mutton execution. I found it somewhat unique.The mutton had a Smokey taste which I personally loved a lot. Chicken haryali butter masala didn't disappoint either. Loved the gravy and the chicken pieces were juicy and tender. Overall a great experience.

Ordered in from this restaurant after having heard a lot about it's Biryani. Was utterly disappointed. The rice was undercooked and had a weird smell not even near to that of Biryani. The mutton pieces were chewy. The quantity was more than enough but that didn't impress since tastewise the biryani was pretty pathetic. Not visiting anytime soon.

Located near fancy market, India Restaurant is the most happening place on khidderpore .
From the ambiance to the staff to the decor to the food all were good.
There I ordered tandoori chicken (marinated in various spice and then roasted in a cylindrical clay oven) It costed just 220 inr.
The other was chicken tikka masala along with rumali roti and biryani which was very mild but the flavour came out really well .
And the last was cheese chicken kebab which costed just 165 inr
The overall experience was good.

Finally I ended up at Khidderpore to visit india restaurant. I used to think it's far away but it is not. Very easy to locate and just 5 minutes drive from decide crossing.

The decor is royal and subtle. The service was spot on right from the doorstep. We were seated on comfortable sofas at the top floor. We had ordered mocktails, three types of kebabs: galawti kebab, cheese kebab, sarso wali macchi, awadhi biryani for mains, and shahi tukra, and gazar ka halva for dessert. Each and every dish was one of it's kind. Probably one of the best Kolkata Biryanis amongst the popular biryani joints. Sarso wali macchi was out of the world. The Galawti kebab was melt in the mouth, served with paper thin paranthas. I have had cheese kebabs at other places which were more cheesy, but this one has it's own charm. Could have been cheesier though. Both the desserts were wholesome and not too sweet, reason why I loved them. The mocktails were very refreshing. 

This was indeed a brilliant food experience. Highly recommend.

I was invited to this place for dinner tonight and my experience  was indeed great. 
Firstly coming to the location it is very much easy to locate just beside fancy market , on the main road only.
Secondly the decor of the place is too classy and gorgeous.. I personally loved the decor a lot.
The behaviour of the staffs were really good and service was great indeed.
Now coming to the foods.
Fresh lime soda-Nothing new a regular relaxing drink to have in this hot and humid climate.
Yeah they recently had a special menu of mocktails with a good variety of choices.
Now coming to the starters..
Their speciality is
Mutton Galawti Kebab - A special kebab served with thin parathas as side.
A must try for all the kebab lovers trust me.
It was like heaven. I have tried this dish in other food hubs but i can assure it is the best in taste.
Then the Fish Sarsonwali Kebab is the must try for all fish lovers. A dish with awsome flavours mixed with it served with green chutney and salads.
Both these kebabs comprised of 4 pieces and the costing was moderate.
Now coming to the main course..
I tried
Mutton Awadhi Briyani- This briyani is a served in a handi which comprises of potatoes and mutton. It tastes completely different than usual biriyani we have. A mixture of spices the mutton melts in your mouth and to this biriyani a side raita is added to satisfy your taste buds.
Along with this we ordered
Chicken bharta and Tandoori roti
Coming to the chicken bharta it is really different fr the regular chicken bharta we have in different dhabas. All bharta lovers pls come and try up here.. Trst me u will not be dissapointed.
And we ended the dinner with the dessert named phirni it taste like the thick kheer. Indeed a great sweet to end your dinner.
Now summing up my whole experience. I will just sum up that.
It is a nice place.. A cosy environment to visit with family and friends. I m looking up to visit again.
Trust me the food is indeed great. The taste of foods are more of lucknow stlye. All cooks are hired from lucknow only. So here the dishes tastes slightly different than regular dishes we have. Costing wise the costs are moderate.
It is a must visit place and ofcourse value for money.

When it comes to Biryani & Mughlai food India Restaurant is one of the best places , if not the best , in Kolkata . In all my earlier visits I opted for the takeaway option &  today is my first visit to their dine in facility . Located just beside the Fancy Market in Khidderpore area the restaurant can be identified from a distance .Today being a Monday we did not face any problem with  parking as the area was less congested than other days . The ground floor has seen some facelift but the huge surprise was waiting for us upstairs . The beautifully decorated interiors , adequate lighting , comfortable seating caught our eyes . Whoever has designed the place deserves great accolades for keeping in mind even the minute details like having a separate entry for staffs . The staffs attending to us greeted us with warm smile & were attentive to our demands throughout . Having had  such a warm welcome we were eagerly waiting for our foods with high expectations & ordered the following taking advise from the ever smiling captain .
Gallowti Kabab : My all time favourite dish when it comes to Kababs. Here it is actually a combo of 4 pieces of Kabab with salad & Lucknowi Paratha . I had heard from a renowned Chef that it takes a combination of 32 spices to prepare Gallowti . I do not know how many spices they use but whatever they use the resultant product is simply mouthwatering . My eyes got closed as I enjoyed the beautiful smell & taste of Gallowti . The Paratha itself is very tasty & the synergy with Kabab is spellbinding . 
Mutton Awadhi Biryani : Having tasted their normal Biryani on a number of occasions ( they are equally good too ) this time opted for this variant . The captain politely informed us that it would take about 20 minutes to prepare & serve the dish . The Biryani came in a earthen pot & contained 4 pieces of mutton , 2 pieces of potato , Raita & beautifully aromated basmati rice . This is totally different from our very own Kolkata Biryani . The rice was nicely cooked , the mutton pieces were soft & our senses were filled with beautiful smell of spices - really an amazing experience . The quantity is sufficient for two persons .
Dum Chicken : The captain suggested this to us & we were glad that he did as this was the best of the lot . The dish contained 4 big pieces of chicken in a red gravy . The chicken had become tender & almost melted in our mouth . The spicy gravy was brilliant . My own feeling is that this dish will be stunning with Nun & I will surely come back to try it out again .
Firni : Good quality of Firni - a must for me after having a Mughlai meal .
Shahi Tukra : The Malai associated with  right dose of saffron was mouthwatering . A great dessert . 
Overall a greatly satisfying experience with definite pledge to come back & try their other delicacies . Highly recommended .

Amazing grand decor, especially of the second floor, took my breath away at first look. The laid back soothing ambience with a golden touch is worth all the wait. The service is really swift and the staff are amazingly pleasant and courteous. The mutton awadhi biryani is aromatic, the cheese kebab is foodgasmic, while the galauti kebab and paratha simply melts away in your mouth. The fruit punch enhanced my taste buds and nothing can end it better than the delicious shahi tukda and gajar ka halwa. I'd suggest the sarson machhi starter hands down, tender and juicy enough to make India restaurant a food lover's paradise. Would love to visit again!  :)

Zomato only allowed me to rate 5. The legendary restaurant at Khidirpur simply amazed us in all ways. First visit there. We ordered Butter Naan, Chicken Kadhai (BL), Chicken Reshmi Masala and Shahi Tukra. The kabab came first, and we sweared it is the best we have had. Next, the naans were soft really. Chicken kadhai gives you mouthful of chicken chunks in each bite and is brilliant. Shahi tukta was very nice too, just the perfect texture and taste. The service was excellent. There is an AC and a NON-AC section. Many more visits to here in future. Next aim, their legendary biriyani.

The food excels in both quality & quantity. We went there on a Monday night & it despite being a weekday the service was very slow. 
Coming to the food, for starters we had Mutton Seekh Kebab & Chicken Malai Kebab; the former was great however the latter was found to be dry. 
For main course we tried Mutton Chap, Awadhi Biryani & Butter Naan. Everything was absolutely delicious. Definitely recommended.

They have really renovated the place. It used to be restaurant where we would only order take-aways. Thankfully, they have not changed the quality of food served. One of the best biryani I have ever tasted. Have the chicken biryani, and you will not be disappointed. Chicken cheese kabab is another one of my favourites. It's pure heaven. Service is great and you will be left satisfied.

Located just few step ahead of Fancy Market which is the tech & fashion hub of khidderpore this mighty place will welcome you with all its glory. Hugely structured & charmingly decorated this place gets a thumbs up for ambience and space. Now, the reason for which we went there,
‚Ä¢Chicken Tandoori Kebab: very juicy very tender in one word lip-smacking, got our tastebuds running.
‚Ä¢Chicken Biriyani: comes first in zomato for 'brilliant biriyanis', I must say it was quite a hype. Tasted better biriyani elsewhere too. No such surprises.
‚Ä¢Chicken Tikka Butter Masala: cubes of chicken tikka cooked in thick red gravy went well with both biriyani & roti.
‚Ä¢Rumali Roti: its out of the menu order, yeah they serves bread. I must say haven't seen such big roti anywhere else. One was enough for me.
‚Ä¢Firni: mughlai cuisine can't get over without this. One of the best firni in town, even portion was good. Highly Recommended.
Had a cold drinks too which i think is not worth mentioning.
They don't serve you in a fancy or innovative way like other places but they will please you with the taste they offer, no doubt in that. Very reasonably priced for such a location. Points cut for limited chicken options in biriyani & courteousness in service which was highly disappointing. Still worthy a place to come & have typical mughlai cuisine to crackle the tastebuds.
P.S.: they serve breads like nun, roti etc which is not present in the menu, & chinese options are also available.

This restaurant had been on my wishlist for quite a long time. I finally visited with a few friends for giving them a treat on my birthday. The place is quite huge with comfortable seats and ample seaters. 

Things we ordered were :

1. Chicken cheese kebab - Yummy chunks of chicken covered in cheese coating. Loved it. 

2. Galawti Kebab - Having heard a lot about it, I was really excited to finally try it, but was disappointed. It was just average.

3. Chicken Tangri Kebab - Have had better

4. Awadhi Biryani - One pot could easily fill three people. Really liked it

5. Icecreams - The star of the show was the mr and mrs icecream. It tasted great.

Now, coming to why I am rating it so poorly, well the service waa disgusting to say the least. My friend's phone was really low on charge and he literally had tp beg them to allow him to put it on charge. Secondly, on asking them if they could place orders for takeaway, this particular waiter called  'pintu' was extremely rude and just refused. He asked us to go downstairs and order it ourselves. Very very disappointed with the service. 

Will not be revisiting this place unless due to some unforeseen circumstances.

Pethatic n uncooked piece of mutton given in take away. When called and complained the manager of home delivery had a least care attitude. On my insistence that I want to speak to the owner my number was taken along with my name but more than 48hours yet to receive any communication seems like success and praise has made them ignorant.

Walaaa, what a start of my new journey at zomato .. Its been ages wanted to write something about food and restaurants. 
Guess What , My first experience at zomato application started with this magnificent restaurant called INDIA RESTAURANT beside that famous fancy market in kidderpore.
This was my first visit at this restaurant and had heard a lot about it earlier ,so finally got an opportunity to try out today.
The entrance to their 1st and 2nd floor is welcoming and jaw dropping , as because the interior can really take you to the place where class meets tech with thematic lights¬† , and I bet you would not get this sight on any other restaurant in town.¬† 
Well next attraction of the restaurant is of course their biryani, the aroma and taste is so succulent and balanced. The chicken Chaap , The Cheese Kebab all this dishes which i had , is really awesome to taste. 
All in all the entire experience including services and price were more then at par with any restaurant in town.....¬† I have become a fan of India Restaurant.

Hope to visit again with my entire team ahead.

India Resturant located in Khidderpore is serving Kolkata  with some delicious north Indian cuisine and if you haven't visited this place yet it is your loss. The place is best known for serving some tasty Biriyani. If you have already visited the place then you will perhaps agree with me that there is a difference in taste in their Biriyani from the other resturants. I went there to celebrate my birthday over there and ordered a whole lot of things like - Reshmi kabab, Chicken Chatpata , Chicken biriyani, Firni. The Reshmi kabab was well cooked ,the meat was soft and tender. The Chicken biriyani was the best for me along with the firni.
The place is well decorated and is spacious. So I would recommend you to visit the place.

The India Restaurant is a Biriyani gem and the retained-through-time taste and quality are the reasons that this place still tops the chart. Their cheese chicken kebab and Kacchi biriyani is simply divine. I can die for cheese and when there's a thick layer of it around chicken pieces cooked to perfection in tandoor such that the cheese becomes a solid layer, it is sinful. The kacchi biriyani is moist, flavorful and spicy. I wanted to taste their Daryabadi biriyani but both these items left no place in my stomach, not even for dessert although I was sharing this stuff with my food partner. I just had the yummy pineapple raita to go with the biriyani.
**********************************************

Few months after this I went there again with the 
family. It was my parents' anniversary. We ordered Kacchi and Daryabadi but too bad for us...it was finished. The server informed these two special biriyanis are made in limited quantity. I was very disappointed as we drove all the way from Salt Lake and I hardly go outside this comfort zone of mine. They suggested to try their Awadhi Biriyani which comes along with a raita and that the quantity will be good for the three of us. I still additionally ordered for the pineapple raita whose taste was still their in my mouth. For the starters, the cheese kebabs were irreplaceable. We enjoyed the lunch and the initial disappointment quickly faded away. We finished it off with six shahi tukras and firnis (two desserts for each of us üòÉ) and that implies and I must say that the desserts are equally divine!

Elegant ambience and food quality is good.But not satisfied with the quantity and the mutton piece in biryani was just a bone with a little meat.We had Mutton kakuri kaabab,mutton biryani,mutton kachchi biryani,shahi tukda and choco-coca mocktail.Among these I personally didn't like their kachchi biryani.Previously the total price was included with all taxes but currently 18% gst has made it higher.

Went with my best friend to have dinner before i leave India. Wanted it to be a special one but it wasn't at all. We ordered the kabab platter which hand mutton, chicken and prawn kababs in it. Was not that exciting, the hari chutney was too sweet. For main course we ordered Awadhi biryani which came in a huge clay pot and was in massive quantity. The mutton pieces where fantastic which literally melted in the mouth. We ordered dum chicken which was nice and rich in flavours. Lastly we ordered firni which was pathetic, the sugar did not dissolve, was too sweet and we could taste the excess amount of atta in it.. Ambience and service was really good.

I had bookmarked this restaurant quite sometime back and planned to visit when my husband is in town so finally went there today. It's located just just beside fancy market in Khidderpore. Well to start off with I must say the d√©cor, architecture, ambience of this building is really good. Right from the gatekeeper at the entrance gate to the order taker to the serving staff everyone was very courteous, friendly yet professional. Coming to the food, we had Chicken sweet corn soup which was just perfect both in terms of quantity and taste..not thick..not sweet just the perfect consistency and flavour... we ordered for one and both is us shared and yes I have to say we were confused if they gave for one or two... yes it was that much in quantity and the soup bowl was very fancy which I really liked as they tried to do something different....then the starter ordered was Galauti kabab which is their speciality..it came with thin crisp but not oily paranthas which were four in number.. the kabab were melt in the mouth and had great burst of flavours in the mouth... then came the Awadhi Gosht Biryani which was the star...it came in a Handi and people I must say please for once try this one out ...the mutton was so soft, tender, juicy and flavourful...the rice has the fine taste of ghee..served pipping hot and fresh in the clay pot this Biryani is a must have...at last came the Firni which was a little disappointment for me because the rice component was absolutely mashed whereas in a good Firni you can feel the texture of the rice.. all this costed us around 1000 bucks...I am gonna visit it again.. Highly recommended :D

After undergoing a renovation India restaurant totally metamorphosed into no less than a 5 star. I'm still awestruck by its architecture,decor and a large sitting area.
It's one of the go-to place for biryani. I would like to mention the kebabs,they are absolutely delicious. Though they have Chinese dishes also, but one can't just be done with the biryanis and kebabs. Chicken Rezala,chicken afgani,chicken kashmiri are simply too good.

Though I have a little complain regarding the menu.
They offer more of mutton biryanis being authentic to the recipe than its renovated chicken version. It's disappointing for people like me for not being able to taste the biryani meat ,those who do not eat mutton.
This only being the downside India restaurant is a grand experience everytime.

The ambience is just awesome. Well lit and well decorated.
The food was delicious.
We ordered chicken peshwari keebab, mutton awadi biriyani which is served in a clay handi with raita, chicken tikka butter masala and firni.
All the items were 10/10 and very tasty.
The mutton awadi biriyani is more than enough for two people rather perfect for three.
And the chicken tikka butter masala was really above expections.
A must try place for all biriyani lovers.

The one word review will be just   " Over hyped" . But still want to explain few things . Being a resident of north kolkata , some of famous Mughlai resturant in and around park circus is more accessible to me than India Restaurant , but after reading some of mind blowing reviews in zomato i wanted to try this resturant so travelled almost 12 k.m to reach this congested place only to be slightly disappointed. Some of their famous item like gulauti kebab seems to be very ordinary  Nan was good and so were some of chicken items but so called so famous Awadhi Biryani was not only overly spiced but seemed over cooked too. Normal biryani was good but nowhere close to some of the famous biryani of kolkata, could not try shahi tukda as it was not available .By then Firni  was the only good option left which was just ok..To me Arsalan Biryani is still king of Biryani in kolkata.

And don't want to say anything regarding chicken tangri kabab and chatni,  if you don't have that you will miss the softness of this place.  Then also I deduct. 05 from the rating because of the guy who serve the food.

India restaurant is one of the places in Kolkata which serves great Biriyani and kebabs. It is located in khidderpore which is bit far from my place.
The restaurant has been renovated in recent times and the ambience is magnificent with gorgeous decor.
We took Cheese chicken kebab in starters which was soft and too cheese! In mains we had Awadhi Mutton Biriyani and Afghani chicken. Both dishes were too delicious. The biriyani was light and aromatic with soft pieces of mutton. In desserts we took Shahi tukra again very tasty.

The place needs to be visited by every Biriyani lovers of the city!!

Located near fancy market , Khidderpore , easy to locate from the road. Went there for a lunch as I was craving for some Awadhi and Moghlai food for a long time ! My sister suggested me to try their 'Galawti kebab' , so I ordered it in starter. A plate of 'Galawti kebab' serve 4 peice of kebab, salad and a paratha. So I took some paratha and some kebab , put it in my mouth..and it was heaven !! Paratha was so soft and goes perfectly well with the kebab. On maincourse we had Daryabadi biryani, rich flavours of spices and mutton pieces melting in your mouth , will give you a royal feeling. Shahi tukda was creamy and rich. Staffs were humble and friendly. Sevice is prompt. Royal dishes on reasonable price !! Definitely will visit again.

We ordered Kakori Kabab, Galauti Kabab, Mutton Awadhi Biriyani, and Mutton Biriyani. The food was good in taste, especially the kebabs were extremely soft and delicious. The ambience is perfect for a family get together or for friends with an appetite for mughlai food. There is enough space and the place is well decorated. However the reason why I rated it 3.5 is that there was a hair in the mutton from the Biriyani. Although the restaurant did apologize and requested to replace the dish but we were almost done so asked them not to.

India Restaurant is one of the most popular restaurants of Kolkata located beside The Fancy Market in Khiddirpur. I had bookmarked this place for a long time and it was time we decided to give this place a visit. The first thing which will strike you on entering India Restaurant is its golden decor. In addition to the decor, the place has a nice, homely feel to it. We ordered India Chicken Cheese Kebab for appetizer which is one of the recommended dishes of this restaurant. And one can surely understand the reason of that once he/she tastes it. With a layer of cheese on top of the large chicken kebab, this dish is one of the must have-s of this place. We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Mutton Kacchi Biriyani along with Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The Biriyani was a bit of a let down for me and did not meet my expectations which had developed from reading several reviews about it. The side dish was very tasty and I simply loved the gravy along with it. For deserts, we had the evergreen Firni which I absolutely loved it. I feel India Restaurant serves the best Firni in Kolkata among those that I have tasted. Overall, it was a great experience at India Restaurant and this will surely not be my last visit here.

what I could say more.. as so many reviews are already there..
but as I visited, clicked some pics.. so let share my experience..

Decor as like any 5 / 7 star restaurant, very rich and classy environment..
Ambiance good.. Service good, but doesn't meet the expectation creates by seeing the decor..

Food quality very good..¬†
we had 2 types of Kebabs.. regular Biryani, Kachhi Biryani.. and Chicken Butter Masala..
satisfied with the taste and quantity..¬†

Prices are a bit high.. but according to the environment and food, that is good..

Definetly a star in my north india and mughlai delights. 
Situated just beside 5star market in khidderpore.
Well the odd fact aganist this place , its kinda far. Never the less i end up to this place quite sometime around. 
Chicken biriyani , Peshwari kebab, Prawn kebab with malai. These 3 are the ones that i usually gorg on to here. 
The chicken is so tender and lovely. 
This place definetly gets a 'Must Try' tag. 
An Indian restaurant fan.

Disclaimer: typical South Indian ardent Hyderabadi and Madrasi foodie's review here.

We ordered the chicken cheese kebab and mutton kakuri kebab which was over-hyped on zomato.
The chicken was thickly wrapped in sweet cheese and the kakuri kebab left a bitter taste (though the male accomplices liked the dish, it was really not liked by my other girl friends too).
Moreover the mint chutney provided with these kebabs were too sweet. Not really pleasing.

Later we placed an order for the mutton biryani which was a typical Kolkata biryani and worth the try. Smooth subtle and flavoured. The mutton was also softly cooked.
The firni added the stars to this place. A must try dish.

Note: special mutton biryani means extra mutton piece.

Overall the ambience was good, the waiters were less attentive and the food was decent.

Amazing ambience, stands out among its surrounding locale. 
The staff seemed reasonably friendly and attentive. 
But most importantly, the food was amazing. 
Ordered chicken haryali kabab, chicken biryani and half tandoori chicken. 
That was the best kabab i ever had, succulent and exquisite. 
Biryani was also amazing, but expected some salad to be served alongside it. 
Tandoori was alright, soft and well cooked. 
Total bill came to about 700, including tax,which was very reasonable. 
Definitely recommended.

Well well well! This restaurant does not needs more description at all. Its known to everyone in Kolkata now. Thanks to zomato and social media. Situated at the heart of Khidirpore. One can locate is easily. Amazing ambiance. Quality food. Fast service. Friendly staff. Pocket friendly. What else does a foodie needs? There is only one way to define and that word is 'perfect'. Went here with one of my friend. Ordered 1 chicken reshmi kebab, 1 chicken roll, one chicken special biryani, one mutton special mutton biryani. Trust me this place is biryani heaven. Rice was soo fine and the chicken was so nicely cooked. We just loved it. Kebab just melted in our mouth. My mouth is still watering while am typing this review. This place is a must visit for every foodie, non foodie out there. Even a non foodie will fall in love with India's food. Best place for cheat day as there was almost no oil in the biryani. Not cooked with very rich ingredients. They keep it simple and light which makes it amazing. And the egg in the special biryani just makes it more better. Recommended!

India Restaurant, as "larger than life" the name suggests, has a "large than life" substance in it too, and we got to feel that when we decided to drop by for a sumptuous lunch on the last Thursday(27th July) afternoon. This is one such place which literally poked me from my wishlist for long. And that's the precise reason for which I was primarily up for it even when we had to change our route only for a lunch at this place.

LOCATION :
Located at the Khidderpore junction (Watgunj More) and beside the Fancy Market, India Restaurant is a landmark by itself in that area. It's a 2-storey building with the ground floor having a Non AC accommodation and shabbier like other normal biriyani joints. However, the game changes altogether when you climb up to the 2nd storey. Its as plush as you can get in a Mughlai and Awadhi restaurant and that too in Khidderpore area, is a never-seen-before phenomenon. They have a separate sophisticated lounge area to wait for your turn, as they are primarily filled up during pick hours.

FOOD :
Coming to the food, I always had benchmarks to beat in every cuisine and the one who surpasses the benchmark becomes a benchmark itself. Such a phenomenon happened that day. Below are the item-wise details along with the feedback :
1. Mugh Chatpata Kebab - One of the most simple yet brilliant kebabs I have ever had. Served with green mint and yoghurt chutney, this is a chicken wings' kebab with tandoori spices, which leaves a tangy aftertaste. Highly recommended.
2. Galawati Kebab - The legendary Galawati is served here with Lucknowi paratha on the house which make things even sinful. The Galawati reminded me of Aminabad (Lucknow) and its texture distinctly proclaims that it's creator is a pro in this genre. One of the most authentic version of the dish is found in this place in Kolkata and one is ought to try this to feel the real flavours of Lucknow. Highly recommended.
3. Mutton Awadhi Biriyani - The staff taking orders recommended us to have Kachchi Biriyani, but don't know what happened to my sixth sense that I went for this. Served in clay "handi", this may disappoint you if you are seeking a legendary Lucknowi version of biriyani. The mutton and potato is as soft as ever. However, I personally didn't like the taste and texture of the rice.
4. Fresh Lime Soda - Brilliant ! Had two glasses of it ! :)
5. Shahi Tukda - One of the best I ever had, and there is no second thought to it. The bread is the softest it can possibly be, and the sweet is not overpowering. It had generous amounts of almonds too.
The bill was about eleven hundred and something which was very justified compared to the quantity of food we had.

SERVICE :
Without a tinge of exaggeration, I would say that I have never seen such a cordial service in a restaurant serving Mughlai and Awadhi cuisine. There were 3 staffs attending us in tandem and all of them made us feel like home with their heart-warming smile. For an instance, we were keen on sitting at the window side table while we could see that the window side of the restaurant had stopped operation by that time of late afternoon. But on our request, we were instantly escorted to one of the tables of the window side and a staff had been appointed to that area. That's a big big learning for all other restaurants and these small things make your customers loyal.¬†

In all, there are still some uncharted corners left in the vast sea of offerings that India Restaurant has in its kitty, but the experience I had here is one worthing remembering and something which had already made me loyal to this place. To all Mughlai lovers of this city, try out this place at least once as this place is all set to make milestones in the Kolkata food scene.

P.S. Try out the Mutton Kachchi Biriyani and do let me know how it tastes, so that I can try out in my next visit ! :)

Well,this place has quite the hype.And to check it myself,I did travel the distance.And it really welcomed me well and filled me up with tasty dishes by the time I left.The place is one of its kind with the golden interior design and the ambiance was lit perfectly with the arrangements.My menu consisted of starters which just melted in my mouth.Next came the Masala Kulcha and Garlic Naan paired up with Mutton Kadai and Tawa Chicken.The naans were just as perfect like the mutton and chicken side dishes,which were tender and tasty.It was perfectly cooked and I want you guys to have it there.The Awadhi Biriyani along with the desserts are added to the list of my favourites as well.
I look forward to trying out the other dishes as well very soon.The staffs there are very courteous and friendly to make you do so.
Do follow India Restaurant via Zomato,Facebook,Instagram to stay updated.

In a chaotic place like Khiddirpore this is a classy restaurant with the best biriyani. The ambiance is very good the behaviour of the staffs were very good.
We started our lunch with some mocktails followed by, FISH SARSOONWALI KEBAB, CRISPY CHICKEN, garlic nan, masala kulcha, and 2side dishes. And then we ordered mouth watering Mutton Awadi Biriyani and for dessert we had Shahi Tukra and Firni.

Fish Sarsoonwali Kebab: it was in one word delicious. It jist melt away in my mouth. The fish they used to prepare the dish was really good. This dish is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Crispy Chicken : Another starter that we ordered, it was rich in taste! Perfectly fried! Also it was really really Crispy!

India Restaurant has been checked off my bucket list recently. I never offer any restaurant 5 stars, but they deserve it. The food was amazing. Ambience too. Very royal and fit for a biryani place. They have a wall where they hang framed certificates and the wall looked quite full. 
Coming on to the food menu- everything we ordered was bang on point. I would recommend the Awadhi mutton biryani. It is the best I have had ever. Soft, succulent mutton pieces, they literally melt in your mouth! Ordered a couple of mocktails too.  Loved their kiwi and green apple mojito, mango shake and pineapple shake. The taste is still lingering in my mouth. Service is very prompt. Not too many tables per server, so every guest gets equal importance. Would definitely visit it again.

Today six of us went to India restaurant in Kidderpore for lunch. I had previously heard great praises for all of their Mughlai items and all of us finally decided to try it. 

Ambience: First of all, the ambience and interior of the place is amazing. Lights  and the decor both are beautiful. It completely enhanced the experience of the food. 

Service: Service of the staff was very courteous and prompt. We were impressed with their service.

Food: We had a huge spread today. There were Mocktails in the beginning. Mango and Pineapple blossom and a Strawberry and Kiwi mint cooler. I was quite surprised at how well the mocktails were made. Now for starters we had Fish Sarsonwali and Chicken Kurkure. Both were very well prepared. Next the Garlic Naan, Masala Kulcha, Tawa Chicken and Mutton Kadhai. After this their specialty which is Awadhi Biriyani. We were so full after the main course that we were almost skipping dessert but I am totally a dessert person, so we ordered a Firni and Shahi Tukra for all of us to share. I was completely blown away by the desserts. I've had both these preparations at other places, but here at India they are so well prepared I would definitely recommend them to everyone. The firni was perfect in consistency, taste and sweetness. The Shahi Tukra was rich in taste and even though we were really full, all of us loved the desserts. 
Pictures of food are attached. 
I had a great time today and would definitely keep going back for more.

India Restaurant has been in my wish list for a long time now. So finally me and my friends decided to visit this place. It is situated just next to the Fancy Market of Kidderpore. The ambience is amazing with well lit lights and golden glossy decor. The staff were courteous and helped us with the menu. We had ordered Fish Sarsonwali Kebab, Garlic Nun, Masala Kulcha, Tawa Chicken, Mutton Kadai and Awadhi Biriyani. Out of all that we had the biriyani was my favourite. It came in a traditional earthenware pot and was very flavourful. To top it all, Shahi Tukda is a must to end your meal on a sweet note. It was absolutely delicious. 

I had an amazing experience today. Will definitely visit this place again. Highly recommended. :)

Have heard so much about this place that I had all decided in my mind to definitely visit this place before leaving Kolkata. Located at the heart of Khidderpore, this place is famous for its biryani. My sister had brought me for a treat over here. Earlier this place was a shabby one and how they have revamped this place! A royal classy decor extending over two floors with a huge waiting area, India Restaurant is surely going to catch your eyes. 
Service was very warm by all the staffs and it was quite efficient and prompt. 
For food, we had ordered - 
Mutton Galawati Kebabs - A Lucknow classic. This  was really good when being served with parathas. I loved it! 
Prawn Malai Kebabs - Very tender prawns marinated in a yogurt served with a mint chutney was extremely good. Recommended to try. 
Kachchi Biryani - Every single person I met who suggested me to try this restaurant also suggested me to try this out. I heard that this dish gets over by 7pm. But really? Is this biryani worth so much hype? It was so oily, so spicy, came with too many dry fruits (who uses that in an Indian Biryani?) and none of us in my family or me liked it. Disgusted with this, we had taken a normal plate of Mutton Biryani and it was amazing! I would suggest to try this plain Biryani at India Restaurant and not the Kachchi one. Oh please, not at all worth it. 
Firni - At the end of a huge disappointment, came little platters of happiness. Made out of jaggery and retaining the perfect grainy texture, it's truly one of the best I have had in a while. 
My overall experience at India Restaurant was good. I would like to come back here again for the firni and definitely not the overhyped Kachchi Biryani. That's it! Happy Dining! :)

An amazing place to be if you are a Biryani lover.

Calcutta is a city where biryani is a very popular dish and with time biryani in Calcutta style has become a genre. Like Hyderabadi, Lucknowi and other types of biryanis, Calcutta style is one of a kind. The Pakistani legend, Wasim Akram, has tasted the best biryani in his life at Calcutta. ¬†

The ambience, service and food has no complaints. Tried a few things -

‚Ä¢ Chicken Biryani - I usually avoid red meat in a tropical country like India hence Chicken biryani. The taste is amazing. Nothing much to describe. You have to try it.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Reshmi Kebab - Juicy, tender and perfectly baked kebabs.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Chaap - The aroma, the colour and the flavour is lovely.¬†

‚Ä¢ Firni - The texture, the temperature and the composition of the porridge in its entirety is beautiful.¬†

Widen your horizon and try more than what I have put down here and you will surely love each one of them.

This place serves the best biriyani and chaanp in town. 
But the last time I visited this place I was quite disappointed with the biriyani served. It was not served warm. And the chicken chaanp had a hilarious taste.
But the staff there are very hospitable, they immediately offered us another dish but we denied.
I have been visiting this place since 3 years now and had never faced such an issue.
This place is one of my personal favourite and will definitely visit again.

The interiors and ambience of the restaurant is nothing less than a fine dining restaurant. Located right next to fancy market, this is the place for biriyani and kebabs. 

Very hospitable and considerate staff, makes you feel welcome.. 
We ordered 
Chicken malai kebab, because chicken cheese kebab was not available! But those were soft, succulent, juicy pieces of gently spiced boneless chicken that came with a very nice pudina chutney! 

The Awadhi biriyani, was flavorful but was not greasy and easy on stomack! 

Their tawa chicken goes well with both the biriyani and tandoori roti/naan/ lachha paratha! 

The close winner, is however, the firni..  Creamy condensed milk that melts in your mouth! Amazing! 

Would go back for cheese kebab and daryabadi biriyani,  and of course, the firni! 

NOTE:Unlike previously, they have now began to take tax, so the listed prices are exclusive of tax! They charge the usual 9%CGST and  9% SGST. With the tax,  cost for two would easily go over 1000!

Their biryani, is the best biryani I've had in a while. And being a Biryani loyalist, who prefers her biryani in the popular Kolkata style, with a humongous  aloo, the plate of Biryani was a treat for the eyes. The mutton Biryani was delicious, so were the chicken tikka kebabs.

Visiting India Restaurant was another step closer to ticking off some of the best restaurants in town, from my bucket list.
Situated right next to Fancy Market (Kidderpore), the area is congested enough to drive you crazy when it comes to park your car.üòè
The place remains full even on weekdays! We went on a Thursday night and the two floors were already jam packed with people still waiting for their turn. Since we had already booked a table earlier, it wasn't much of a deal to grab a table for 9.
The ambience is really good with well lit lights and white and golden glossy decor.

Coming to what we ordered and how we felt about the food:

1) Mutton Kakori Kebab @Rs.270.00 (4.5/5) :
We couldn't just dine-in in India Restaurant and miss the famous 'Kakuri Kebab' here. A plate consisted of 4 cylindrical long, soft, melt-in-the-mouth portions of well made kakori kebabs. The meat was so damn delicate with brilliant depth of flavours which would keep you thinking about what spices have been used to actually make it that delicious. Each bite was a stupendous journey of aromatic spices and distinct flavours in the mouth. Definitely recommended. üòç

2) India Restaurant Special Chicken cheese kebab @Rs.320.00 (3.9/5) :
Again a very well made portion of chicken reshmi kebabs topped and baked with generous amount of gooey cheese.üòã
The kebabs were well charred and the cheesy layer was baked to perfection.
It was fantastic but I prefer the cheese kebabs at Arsalan, a tad bit more. üòÑ

3) Chicken Chaap @Rs.180.00 (3.25/5) :
The chicken chaap failed to impress us..üòè Everything about the chaap was good but it lacked the tang or pungency that is required to illuminate a well made Chaap. The meat was very soft and well cooked, though.

4) Laccha Paratha @Rs.35.00 (4/5) :
To be very honest, no matter how unhealthy it sounds but I prefer the deep fried old-school Laccha paratha over the modern layered tawa grilled laccha paratha üòè and, the paratha here was exactly the deep fried version that I love.üòÑüòÉ
Thoroughly took pleasure in the process of wrapping the thick fried doughy goodness around kebabs and dunking them in green chutney before eating it.üòã

5) Chelo Kebab @Rs.370.00 (3.5/5) :
Chelo kebab happens to be an Iranian dish which has been indianised and served here. 3 delicate pieces of chicken tikka kebab, 2 pieces of chicken kakori kebabs, stuffed tomato, grilled onion and a fried egg served with buttered rice. üòç
While the chicken tikka kebabs were too good, the chicken seekh kebabs were a let down because they were more or less pretty tough to be called a proper seekh kebab.

6) Mutton Awadhi Biryani @Rs.350.00 (4.95/5):
The briyani came in a traditional earthenware sealed with dough. On opening the seal and top of the pot, the ghee laden aromatic smell made us sniff till the spoonfuls of biryani were in our mouth. Oh! What an amazing biryani it was! Words cannot describe how beautiful it was in terms of flavour. Eat it, to believe and experience what it like to taste heaven.

7) Special Mutton Biryani @Rs.310.00 (4/5):
We did not want to restrict ourselves only to Awadhi Biryani, hence we ordered two more varieties - one being a normal biryani to just know the difference between their version and the other big biryani making houses of Kolkata. The biryani here was pretty darn good with soft beautifully cooked mutton, an egg and obviously the delicate potato.üòç
The rice grains were independent and the biryani wasn't very oily as well. Super liked it.üòö

8) Daryabadi Biryani @Rs.330.00 (4.25/5) :
Daryabadi biryani was mentioned as a must-try on Zomato so we just ordered a plate of this, to be on the safe side and not get gifted with curses from around because this biryani was supposed to have a sweetish masaledar tinge to it with cashews, nuts and raisins. We were a bit apprehensive when we received a plateful of Daryabadi Biryani garnished with tomatoes (üò´üòíüò≤) but soon after our tastebuds started dancing to the harmony of different flavours! I would ask Kolkata Biryani loyalists to stay away from Daryabadi Biryani because this was so much different than what a biryani usually is like but nonetheless, my father and I totally relished it till the last morsel of rice.üòç

9)Firni @Rs.60.00 (3.85/5):
We wanted Shahi Tukda but ofcourse, given to my sad luck, it wasn't available. With a heavy heart we ordered Firnis. The firnis were great, with a strong taste of rabdi but the firni which my aunt received tasted pretty different from the ones we had. The one my aunt had, tasted more like the ones from Lazeez, Arsalan, Shiraz. Otherwise, the firni was pretty good.

10) Fresh Lime Soda @Rs.60.00 (3.5/5) :
Tasted normal.üòÑ

The total bill was Rs.4310.00 for 9 people which is around 478.00INR/person which is quite reasonable given to the amazing food taste and quality.

Final Conclusions:-
‚óèFood Taste Rate = 4.25/5.
‚óèAmbience = 4/5
‚óèStaff Behaviour = 4.5/5
‚óèValue for money = 4.5/5

Definitely recommended!üòÑü§ó
Happy eating.
Stay beautiful. ‚ù§

In the busy & chaotic Khiddirpore area this is a classy & sprawling multi cuisine restaurant but mostly known for its A-grade biriyani.We started with the refreshing Green apple mojito & Mango blossom.Then we feasted upon the delicious Galauti kabab & Chicken tangri kabab.Then came the star,Mutton awadhi biriyani in a large earthen pot with four pieces of mutton,two pieces of aloo & a large quantity of rice with raita.Man it was something!Along with Mutton rara punjabi & Chichen achari masala it an amazing gastronomic journey.We signed off with lovely Shahi tukda & Firni.Come to the India Restaurant & experience a memorable meal.From decor to service to promptness to tidiness it is a clear winner.

The place serves the best Biriyani in Kolkata for sure. Their chicken Bharta is also awesome. But the best is yet to come. The best is indeed the chicken cheese kebab with sumptuous amount of cheese which you can't miss out on. And the gajar ka halwa also was awesome prepared with immense amount of ghee.

Ordered assorted kabab platter where they servetwo portions of each: two types of chicken kabab a mutton kabab and a prawn kabab.... the kababs werw quite tasty.... though the prawn kabab wasn't very juicy as expected.... 
Then we had mutton awadhi biriyani as suggestedby them but didn't quite like the the taste... too spicy... had to pack away most of it....
And finally having a sweet tooth √≤rdered shahi tukra and that was nice....

I always wanted to visit ¬†this restaurant and heard about its famed biriyani. Yesterday I got the opportunity and I was not disappointed. The ambience and the decor is nice and the service was quick. The Biriyani is one of the best in the city. The mutton was tender and the ingredients were in correct proportion. The chicken chaap was equally good. ¬†Surely gonna come again.

‚ÄåThis place is in must visit list of mine since long. I stepped inside to this place yesterday for dinner along with my friend. This place is near carl macs sararani and it will take 10-15 mins from esplanade. I called the reception for table booking but they told they won't receive any table reservation and if it is occupied on your arrival, you have to wait for your turn. We reached around 9. 10 pm. Then immediately move to the first floor of the restaurant. It has 3 floors for dine in facility. Ground floor is non AC the old one and the other two have AC and renovated. The ambience is par with arsalan and aminia. The staffs know how to behave. We ordered their special kachi biriyani and peshawari kebab. This order was placed purely up on the waiter's suggestion. He told that in kacchi biriyani they provide 1pc of mutton but if you opt for dariyabadi biriyani you will get 2pcs of mutton portion.  As we have to travel for a long distance on our return,i asked him to serve soon. It took 10mins and the peshawari kebab is on our table. This is with bone. The size is perfect and the taste also. But I found it is bit tight. The taste was good. Then the biriyani came. When I took the first spoon of rice in to my mouth ,I found this is quite unique as it has different aroma of spices. When I found my mutton portion is attached with fat portion I reported to the waiter. He told that at this moment it is impossible to change the order but then he  bought a nee mutton portion and asked me to keep aside the older one. GREAT!!! The  taste of the biriyani is excellent. The service is quite fast.  The bill was 580 which included the tax. I will go for awadhi biriyani if I am able to visit this place.

No matter how many times I go back to this place, I can not stop admiring it. 
India Restaurant is just beside Fancy Market, Kidderpore. 
The interior has well lit lights and a very exotic decor. The ambience is perfect for enjoying a peaceful lunch with loved ones. 
Both the chinese and Indian cuisine in the menu has ravishing taste and quality. 
I had ordered for Crispy Chicken & Fish Sarsonwali for starters. 
For maincourse we had ordered Mutton Awadhi Biryani, Garlic Naan, Masala Kulcha, Mutton Kadai & Tawa Chicken. Each of the items were finger licking good. 
The service was quick. 
I will surely visit again. Highly Recommended.

Whenever we get a biriyani craving at work India Restaurant is our go-to,and we mostly take home delivery. Yesterday I went there to dine out with my friend and I was absolutely stunned by the makeover! It used to be a little shabby before but now the interiors are pretty stunning and has this authentic Mughal feel to it. Coming to the food we had deep-blue-sea mocktail. It didn't quite work for me though my friend liked it, but then the kebabs balanced it out and how! We had chicken malai kebabs. Thick crust of cheese covering soft melt-in-your-mouth kind of chicken! üíØ ‚ù§. Then came the mutton awadhi biriyani, served in this clay pot with raita. Looks really authentic,and it did taste brilliant! Tastes a little different from the usual biriyani, very light, not that tacky greasy type at all. And one pot will be sufficient for 3 people!We finished our meal with Shahi tukra! Absolutely delicious!!!
And I have to mention the great hospitality. Very courteous and friendly staff. 
Basically my visit turned out to be a 10/10!  Definitely coming back again.
Thank you India Restaurant and thanks Joy :)

The best Mughlai Joint in the city for me.
Beats Arsalan and the likes of other more known joints in taste,ambi and behaviour.
Tried their most recommended Mutton Kachhi Biriyani.
The best flavours in the sentinel rice prep of India so far..
Had Chicken Afghani for sided which was sumptuous and tasted excellent...
Were out of Shahi Tukra..
So order firni...and then had to add another for it was the best I have ever laid my tongue on.

Its going to be a legend in another decade.

Beautiful ambience. Food quality commendable. Quantity sufficient. Had ordered chicken lollypop for starters, chicken butter masala and butter naan for main course. Lollypop was crispy and yummy, cooked perfectly. Although the pieces could have been bigger. Butter chicken was delicious, as usual. Naan was good too. Hence overall food was good but forgettable. Nice hospitality and decor though. A plus was that food price was inclusive of tax. Would love to visit again.

It's located just beside the fancy market in khiderpore on the road moving towards the dock. Previously it was a bit shabby but after it was remodeled, the interior design and the ambience of the place is one of the best in the city. The ambience of the place is truly Mughal and it complements the dishes that are served in the restaurant. The staff behavioral is very polite and good. They help you to order and will never mislead you. Coming to food, in starters I tasted chicken malai kabab and mutton Boti kabab. The malai kabab was very well cooked and drained was awesome. The Boti kabab was also well prepared but I felt a bit over cooked and was a bit stiff. On the main course, the place is known for the iconic biriyani they serve. I have  tasted chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, mutton kacchi biriyani and daryabadi biriyani. Chicken and the mutton biriyani does not contain egg where the other two variant contains one each. The meat is very well cooked. The kacchi biriyani and the daryabadi biriyani contains dried fruits. I felt the daryabadi to be the spicy counterpart of the kacchi biriyani. As a side dish, the kadai chicken was also well cooked and a bit spicy, perfect to be had with nun and not biriyani. Whereas the tawa chicken was perfect for biriyani. As a desert, the firni was also good. The quantity of all the dishes are good for an adult with moderate appetit. Definitely visiting the place again.

Went to India Restaurant for the first time for my mother's birthday‚Äã on the 5th of July. Our order was:
Chicken Malai kebab, Mutton Seekh kebab, Galawti kebab, Mutton kadhai with tandoori rotis, Mutton Biryani and Shahi Tukda.
The kebabs were awesome and getting to taste them straight out of the Tandoor just elevated the flavours. Galawti and Seekh kebabs just melted in the mouth. The Galawti kebab comes with a complimentary paratha which was soft and light. Then came the Mutton kadhai which was a bit spicy along with hot tandoori rotis. The biryani was spicy but nice and if you want the mutton piece to be changed, they will do that without any hesitation. In our case the waiter sir changed the piece on his own while serving. Then came the Shahi Tukda which everyone recommends is a must have. The bread was soft and juicy after sucking on the milky broth and the plate was greased with the reduced broth. I know many would love to hang me for this......but the Shahi Tukda which my mother makes tastes much better.
All in all, the food was top class, the waiters were well behaved and the interiors are royally done ( great place to click photos). We enjoyed the evening laced with beautiful memories......and we look forward to be back there soon.

Since last few years, I am planning to visit India Resturant, but only succeeded on 3rd July, 2017 to celebrate my own birthday dinner.

We had reached at 9:30 and witnessed a massive crowd waiting for their chance. So I had enlisted my name in waiting list and the receptionist had asked me to wait for another 20 mins. Luckily didn‚Äôt need to wait so long and sent to 2nd floor. I had pretty amazed with the decor and interior on that floor. We had ordered the following food which also served us before the expected time:

1. Mutton Biriyani: Since we were 4, I had asked for 2 special biriyani. The waiter informed that there were no extra 'Boti' so the special biriyani not available. So, ordered 4 mutton biriyani, and it was really awesome. I would say, it was better than any other Biriyani house I ever tried. Mutton piece was small in size, but very soft and tasty. My rating 4.7 out of 5.
2. Mutton Duckbunglow: Mutton gravy item with a full egg, really nice taste but the 4 pieces were little stiff, so not impressed. My rating 4 out of 5.
3. Mutton Stew: I have asked for Mutton fry, but the waiter told me it was out of stock, and suggested me to try Mutton Stew. Really nice suggestion, my baba loved the taste more than Duckbunglow. 4 pieces of mutton not so soft but better than the other one. My rating 4.2 out of 5.
4. Firni: Don't forget to try this at the end. Best firny I had ever tried. My rating 4.8 out of 5.

In near future, Indian Restaurant should remain on my list.

Ordered through Zomato Online - after repeatedly trying every time i found that Online Ordering was coming as deactivated - then i called up and they immediately opened the online facility. The Mutton Biriyani was excellent ( both the normal and the special ones ), the special one being really generous in terms of the quantity.....Mutton Stew was very tastelful as well. The prices are very reasonable, lower than the rates charged by similar outlest of Arsalan, Alia, Shiraz¬† and the like...overall, highly recommended for all.

I would certainly give em 5 pts for sure on any other day..but I do not know y M cutting .5 marks..may be because we expected way too much from this vintage north indian biriyani house.
Very easy to locate even with a huge congestion..this restaurant stands out in khidderpur area
Decent decor..staffs are decent too
Service is really fast..in any other junction u will have to wait atleast for 15 mins ( if not more) for any kababs or tandoors to be served,but not in India restaurant..they served us galauti kabab in a flash..& boy it tasted heavenly..absolutely delightful..which pulls out the giant eater inside uüòÅüòÅ
We were little upset to hear kachchi biriyani is not available..orderd normal dum mutton biriyani..n it was above average but not outstanding
Then came Sikh kabab..almost perfect but something was missing which I couldn't detect..a more than ok dish
Then came the best part-vat & tax less bill payment 
We were satisfied..looking forward for a revisitüòÜ

If you love Indian Mughlai and awadhi food, then it's one of best foodies' huts in Kolkata.
A well decorated family restaurant with friendly staffs.
A good varieties of Biryani.
Why I have cut 1 mark is for three reasons:
1. We expected to have their best kachhi Biryani, but it wasn't available.
2. I have tasted little better mutton galawati kebab in Oudh 1590.
3.The pieces of mutton in Biryani was too small.

We ordered mutton sikh kebab, mutton galawati kebab and mutton Biryani.. it was a day to move my tongue over mutton üòú

Mutton Sikh kebab was good.
Galawati was very good.
Mutton Biryani was also good.

Definitely I will come again.

This restaurant situated near the Fancy Market in Khidirpore has undergone a serious makeover and now the seating arrangement upstairs have a real up-market feel. The food is pretty decent as well. The mutton galawti kebab, which comes with a complementary paratha is one of the best that I ever had. The mutton fry was quite good as well. Although I must say that I had better Dal Makhani and Naans elsewhere. The service can get a bit slow during busy hours. The prices are very reasonable considering the overall experience. All in all, a good place to experience Mughlai cuisine without breaking the bank.

This is a wonderful place to fill up your tummies. The ambience is top notch coupled with their awesome delicacies. Ordered their Special Kebab Platter and Mutton Awadhi Biriyani,both of which were worth a try. To top it all, Shahi Tukda is a must, to end your meal on a sweet note. A meal for two would cost around 700-800. Overall, worth for many a more visits.

One of the legendary Biryani outlets in the city. I have been here umpteenth number of times and have almost always had a good meal. They have revamped their shop a couple of times in the last decade and improved the ambiance and dine in experience.¬†

For me this is one of the go to place for devouring mughlai food. The biryani, tikia, chicken chap and firni are my personal favourites. Their Chicken Cheese kebab is also worth the mention but not as good as Arsalan.¬†

Service is very quick and food is served piping hot. Having said all this I must mention that they are sometimes inconsistent with the flavour of the biryani which is disappointing. Oh and they serve Chinese as well but I have not tried it

Pricing is average and a meal for two should set you back around Rs 650.

Been there on an afternoon. Was searching for biriyani and a friend suggested this place. The decor was pretty good, very spacious. We ordered some kebabs and biriyani. The oudh biriyani was beautiful, the meat melted just as u put it into your mouth. Not too spicy. If you are searching for biriyani i would recommend this place. Staffs are well behaved and decent. Prices are reasonable.

I have been here for like more than 20 times now and this place has never disappointed me. They have a huge menu which includes both mughlai and Chinese cuisine üòç.. 

Past experiences with family and friends were always amazing , the service is always prompt , interiors are attractive. 

Last weekend I was invited by them for a lunch and my happiness knew no bounds ..

I was served Shahi Mutton Haleem firstly which was the best Haleem I have ever had . This was the only dish I didnt have here before and I was blown away with the richness of it. The boneless chunks of mutton in thick gravy made me crave for more. 

Next , mutton biryani was served and I being a Biryani lover can guarantee you that if not the best , you will always rate India's biryani one of the best in the city of Joy. Medium sized tender pieces of mutton with perfectly cooked basmati is all you want . üíì

Lastly I had the Choco-Cocoa Shake which was possibly the best end to a delightful lunch . Chocolate is the weakness of every foodie and this shake takes you to a heavenly state üòÇüòç. 

Yes there is always room for improvement but here I couldn't resist but give them a 5 star . 

Keep up the good work :)

After a lot of planning and debate, two of my best foodie friends and I made our way to this joint after walking all the way from Rabindra Sadan. We took our seat in the first floor and the first thing that strikes is the ambience. Feels like you're in a different world altogether. The order was simple: Mutton Boti Kebab, Mutton Kakori Kebab, Mutton Awadhi Biryani (they had run out of the Kachchhi Biryani which was our target) and Shahi Tukda.
The Boti Kebab had great flavours. The meat was so delicious and the chutney they served with it was just absolutely sensational. Top marks for this.
The Kakori Kebab was something like I've never had. It just melted in my mouth. It was just too good to be true. Oh! What a beauty!
The steaming hot biryani in the handi was just a festival of flavours and it was so rich. It literally felt like what the Nawabs would've had. The added fried onions was the bonus.
Now, I had never had Shahi Tukda before so it was a new experience for me. I dug in and what I was greeted with was probably one if the best tates that exists in the world. The texture of the tukda with the flvour of ghee and the gravy packed with milk, condensed milk, kheer and saffron was something beyond extraordinary. Sheer brilliance! I licked my plate absolutely clean so that they need not wash it again.
And one of the best and weirdest things was that they didn't charge any tax but we didn't mind leaving behind a tip as a token of appreciation. Thank you India Restaurant. Please open more branches everywhere!

Less famous than their more popular counterparts like Arsalan or Shiraz this place packs a punch when it comes to the food they serve. Located in kidderpore it will be a pleasant surprise to see the tastefully done interiors. Ambiance is top notch like the food. Must tries would be the peshawari kebabs, afghani kebabs and of course  the biriyani. The phirni too is quite good. All this at very reasonable rates. My go to place when it comes to mughlai cuisine.

Today I visited here along with special one for lunch. Situated just beside fancy market Kidderpore. A huge rush was there today for eid. Ambience was awesome there. Service was very prompt. We ordered India cheese kebab, fresh lime soda, soft drinks, kachhi biryani, tandoori chicken butter masala.  Aloo was just awesome. I took an extra aloo but they took charge for it. Slightly disappointed. Everything was perfect in respect of quality and quantity.

This legendary restaurant is located in khidderpore, beside fancy market. They serve amazing biriyani and mouth watering kebabs. I have tried their chicken Reshmi kebab,chicken cheese kebab,mutton galawati kebab,mutton sheek kebab.. The chicken cheese kebab needs a special mention. The tender juicy chicken just melts in your mouth and has a perfect balance of cheese in it. The biriyani's are delicious. I have tried their dariyabadi biriyani,awadhi biriyani and the normal biriyani. They serve amazing mutton rolls as well. This is the ideal place for all biriyani lovers.

The only drawback is that the restaurant is located in a very clumsy area of Khiddirpore, the ambience inside is amazing! The food they serve, the quality and the hygiene is excellent. Kacchi biryani¬† is undoubtedly one of the unique and among the best ones, I have tasted in Kolkata. Starters are almost served within a few minutes after ordering are mouth. Would recommend this place to all..

This is one of my prime restaurant, Only 500 meters from my home, Located beside Fancy market, The decors is very nice, Specially 3rd floor, I have already visited this place 50 times & Ordered more than 100 times, To be honest, there is no competitor who can beat ¬†this restaurant wrt to competitive pricing and the quality of food offered, I know them since 5 yrs years and they have grown from a small scale restaurant to one of the giants in this area. And each year they have only improved, But i will give 1 point less since they have reduced the food quantity and increased the price a bit, Rest is all Ok !

One of the best biryanis I have ever had. It offers some mouth watering and sumptuous biriyanis. I personally feel, at times, it is even better than arsalan or zeeshan. The Kebabs are awesome, do try the rashmi kebab.

Located out of the main city hub, but the footfall won't make you feel like the restaurant is not in Park Street or Gariahat. As we reached late, we missed out on the Daryabadi biryani, but their Mutton biryani was also quite good. The Galauti kebab with Lucknow Paratha was nothing less than a piece of art. Mutton stew would be another item to recommend. Firni and Shahi tukda is perfect to finish a wholesome meal here. The restaurant is very spacious, 4 storeys with AC as well as Non AC facility. The staff were very courteous and fooding here was a very good experience.

We took a long weekend evening ride to the India Restaurant just to taste the Kachchi Biriyani. However, it was out of stock. We ordered Reshmi Kabab,  Tandoori Roti,  Chicken Chap and Mutton Biriyani. Had to parcel the Firni. Taste was awesome! We were full to the brim. Since location is a bit far off,  would recommend a few branches in key locations so that many people are not deprived of the tasty dishes and wholesome experience!

This restaurant is my favourite. You know why it has 4.6 stars on zomato... because they deserve it fully. Each and every dish you order here from kababs to chicken chaap chicken bharta chicken rezala chello kabab biryani etc etc each and every dish will taste sooo good that it will take you alot of time to discover another restaurant which offers the dish with a better taste. The service is awesome. The place (the 1st and 2nd floor) provides you an illusion of the high class hotels in the arab. The service is fast and awesome. Try this place once and i gurrantee you will return here again and again.

This has long been in my wish list and quiet glad to visit the eatery. It is located just beside the 5 Star Market of Khidirpur and easy to locate. The entrance at the 1st floor is quiet impressive, overall decor is quiet catchy and the ambience is decent enough. 

Coming to food, it's undoubtedly praiseworthy. The kababs are soft and succulent, the Chicken Chatpata is nothing but Chicken wings, cooked in a spicy sauce. The Awadhi Biriyani is sumptuous which comes in a handi and prepared in combination of various spices with a dash of coriander. The choco cocoa mocktail is not that good. 
Price is commensurate with the quality and quantity and the prices are inclusive of tax. Overall, recommended.

Tried Mutton Halim! The coriander infested gravy reminds me of of the way my grand mom used to prepare mutton. It has a very earthy and authentic effect on the taste buds. The mutton was succulent and well cooked. The coriander dominates the flavour and yet leaves one craving for more. It is nutritious and the soupy lentils linger longer than expected. The mutton is slightly bland but the flavours of the lentils more than make up for it. I'd definitely recommend it to you. It is a protein rich diet minus the carbs!

I m not a mughlai food lover. So I hadnt any high expectation when, I visited this place!! Me with four of my friends visited this place on a sudden planning. We didnt have any booking, still we dint v to wait, as this place is so spacious with so many sitting accommodations!! First coming to the decor n ambiance, I would rate them 5/5. You ll v a royal feeling as soon as u enter. Now coming to food, I ll rate them 5/5 again. The kebabs r awesome. They just melt in your mouth. I loved the gauloti kebab most. The biriyani was a pleasure to the taste buds!! It will be a crime, if I dont mention their Phirni n Shahi tukda!! They were perfect!!!
The only thing, I didnt like about the place, z the behaviour of the staffs!! I ll rate them 3/5.
Firstly, many of them dont have the idea about the dishes. They seem to get irritated if they r asked to serve the food!! Their duty doesnt end with bringing the food to the table, serving should be done by them too.. The staffs there were having gossips on loud voice through out the time, we were there. It seemed odd too..
This is overall an excellent place. I hope it ll rectify these small faults over time!!

Visited this restaurant for dinner tonight. I pre-booked a table here. We entered around 9 pm and even on a Monday it was quite crowded. The restaurant is situated just beside the fancy market. The place near the entrance is very crowded. 
From reading the reviews and the rating, I felt its ambience would be great. I didn't like the crowd and atmosphere quite well. Waiters were not courteous at all.
My rating is entirely based on the food. We went for vegetarian dinner today. We ordered hot and sour and sweet corn soup first. Then we took paneer pakoda for starters. Pakodas were really awesome. Very fresh and tasty. For Chinese main course we ordered veg noodles and Manchurian and for Indian main course we ordered dal fry, kadhai paneer, plain nan and jeera rice. Manchurian was very tasty. All dishes were good and decent in taste. No complaints from food.
Service was slow and waiters were not courteous at all. They need to improvise on their service. Food has value for money as well. No complaints on that part.

Excellent food, great chinese as well. The food is reasonably priced and the Choco Cocoa mocktail is very good. Ambience is great, lots of space between tables for privacy. The restaurant is very clean and also offers free home delivery. However parking should be made available in front of the restaurant as locals are charging hefty price to park in front of restaurant.

Highest rated Biriyani Restaurant in Kolkata. So we decided to go for it and taste their famous Kacchi Biriyani. We choose a Ramadan day to taste their Haleem too. But we were not so lucky, both haleem and Kacchi Biriyani were finished by the time we reach. Atmosphere was really cool. We ordered their mutton biriyani along with mutton chaap. Biriyani was mildly spicy and consist of a well cooked mutton(medium size) and potato piece. Mutton chaap was just awesome. Yes, it should be really above 4.5 rated restaurant and they serve one of the best biriyani of Kolkata. A must try restaurant.

So I had heard a lot about this one from my friends at college but didn't really end up going up until a few weeks earlier when one of my friends won a lucky draw contest organised by them which gave away a few dishes for free. Ofcourse We were excited but it was our first visit. Not knowing what to expect we went there and the first thing that struck us was the interior decorations. It was simply marvelous and totally royal. The first conclusion we came to was that it's going to be a bit expensive for us students. So, after entering we were greeted by the staff members and seated. The menu made us realise how wrong we were about the cost. It was extremely reasonable considering the dishes were amazing, the fact about which we were still oblivious. That day we were served a mixed Hakka noodles and a plate of tengri kebab as the prize and we ordered kacchi biriyani and chicken chatpata kebab. Kebabs were the best I've ever had. And the kacchi biriyani had a spicy twist to it which was delectable. A place this good was obviously worth coming back so I did go back and also on the same week but this time I had won the contest and they were giving away a plate of chicken Afghani kebab. So I went with my friend and introduced him to the restaurant, my friend had the same reaction as I did. We had chicken Afghani kebab, chicken sizzler, India restaurant special chicken biryani. All of them lip-smacking‚Äã and mouth watering. A very fulfilling experience. I would suggest each and everyone to go there, gobble up and gorge upon everything that they serve.

Ambience
The interiors is awesome some soft music would just add the missing tarka to it.

1. Though not at all satisfied with the staff and service as serving of food was not done timely and had to wait or call the waiters for serving the food.¬†

2. ¬†Regular or mineral water was asked individually by atleast 4 different waiters guess for unknown reasons .

3. ¬†Moreover the waiters and cleaning staff were too loud in joking among themselves fully in oblivion to customers privacy ¬†and comfort level.

Coming to the food

The food we selected was not the speciality of this restaurant. Went for Tawa chicken as it suggested by the waiter it was good but nothing exceptional. Breads in form of ¬†Butter Naan n lacha paratha both were of very good qaulity , soft well prepared and tasty. Phirni was quite good.

From outside it feels like a great place but it isin't much in the inside. Here i am talking about the ground level ac dining place. 

The ambience is quite ordinary with no music. Only the sounds of the fan and ac beaming over your head. The walls are decorated but in such a fashion as if in a mosque. It gives quite an ethnic look but again spoiled by the staff who don't even know how to behave and appear in front of the guests. One guy took our order and it was mutton rezala and paratha with a salad. Will say about the food later. 

When the food arrived it was good and we took some pictures a d started having it when i noticed that a guy,probably a waiter was seating on the chairs of a table meant for the customers. It was really unprofessional. Then the staff was talking in their native language very loudly and it felt more like a road side restaurant than a proper dinning one. 

The food- Well it was quite good but they dont have any new menu downstairs. If you want one u have to go to the upper floors for a different menu with increased pricing that our service guy confirmed. The mutton piece was cooked throughly but the gravy lacked any density. It was a pure mixture of water and lots of spices with lots of fat and mixed oil of real low quality. But the paratha was well prepared with much care.

The service is very poor from my point of view becuse first time they give u water without even asking for regular or mineral. Then when your glass is finished they tell you to pour the water kept on your table all by yourself. Its a rude way of giving pleasure to a guest visiting a restaurant for a proper satisfying meal, from my point of view. 

The bill was quite average as the prices were not so high. 

All over its a nice place if you visit the upper floors but the ground floor lacks discipline from both staff and management because even the guy on the cash counter was busy all the time with his ph talking to someone and noticing nothing on the ongoing services over the tables. 

Will visit again for a better experience to the newly built upper tiers.

Given that my college is round the corner, I've visited this place multiple times and every time it amazes me. The food is just great. The staff is courteous and they are always so welcoming. The galwati kebab is a must try and comes with a free paratha which is big enough for two.¬† The mutton rezala is just great. It touches you warmly in all the right places. The shahi tukda in the desserts is brilliant as well. The best part is, the quantity is really nice and prices are inclusive of taxes too. So it never burns a hole in your pocket. A must visit for every food lover ever.

Last week we visted it .. The ambience was good.. Will give you the royal feeling .. Coming to food, we bought a combo coupon from nearbuy which includes a kabab platter, 2 biriyani, and 2 soft drinks at only 499 bucks :)
We took malai kabab but it made me dissapointed because there was almost no malai neither the moist, juicy thing, it was dry like the normal kabebs ..
But the Biriyani was Bang On üòç
Looking forward to visit again ;)

Hello Kolkatans, you need to graduate yourself from Arsalan ,Zeeshan and Aminia. Please come down to this legendary place you will be amazed by the taste of Biriyani here. I am a 22 yeared old person living in Kidderpore & whenever we have any occasions or simply just in a mood to have Mughlai we drop in to the place. They have a very good home delivery service too. And the restaurant is beautifully decorated. The ambience is very sober and rich. Staffs are extremely good. But the thing that surpasses everything is the food. Kacchi Biriyani, Daryabadi Biriyani , Chicken Cheese Kebab, Hariyali Kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab ,Firni and Shahi Tukda are items to die for. Having Biriyani here is a lifetime experience. A die hard obsessed India Restaurant foodie fan.
Be it the home delivery or the take away or the leisured dining experience India Restaurant has never disappointed with food. Biriyani crafted with love, art and passion presented from heart to win hearts.@

First the starters: Galauti kabab and Kakuri kababs are the best. I tried the kakuri kabab. It was super soft. It just melts as soon as it goes inside the mouth... Yummmm!!!
Main course: of course Byriani ( no doubt in that )... The mutton served here is pretty soft to touch the heart of mutton lovers.
Desert : I tried the Firni. It tastes a bit different and that's quite lovable for the tongue.
The staffs here are very humble.
The deco is quite soothing.
Overall i loved the place... And the food too... So i will suggest all the byriani and kabab lovers that if you haven't yet been here then its time for you to go... üòÄ

The place is really a perfect blend of beautiful deco, refreshing mocktails and delicious food...a very friendly outlet with most decent & courteous staffs.

Coming to the menu we had:¬†

Chicken cheese kebab, Mutton Galawti kebab and pineapple Tandoori for Starters....they were amazing, specially the Mutton Galawti Kebab...it was soo yummy and mouth melting!!! A must try. ¬†

For Mocktails we had Mango Shake, Kiwi Shake and Choco-Cocoa. My favourite was the kiwi shake...it was quite different from the normal mocktails we get and quite refreshing too.¬†

From the main course I loved the Kacchi Biryani...it was a bit spicy, outstanding and delicious.
Also the Kesari roti, Murg Mussallam, and ¬†Mutton Kadai were brilliant.¬†
¬†

The Shahi Tukra in the end was a perfect ending to this fabulous lunch.

The experience was stupendous. I would definitely love to come back again & again & would try rest of the menu.

A greatly recommended place !! Everybody must try out at least once !!

A place which opens pretty early in the morning and is perpetually packed. Many told me try it's biryani. Visited this place just for that. Went, ordered a biryani, came out content with the lingering flavours of the fabulous preparation. Needn't say more.

So after the first failed attempt, we finally made it to India Restaurant for lunch and it was totally worth it! Its a very beautiful restaurant and gives you the royal feeling which is a perfect match for the food here. The staff is very prompt and friendly.
Coming to the food, I had the Choco-cocoa for mocktail. It was heavenly! It had the perfect blend of chocolates with a tinge of coffee and had brownies as toppings! I could not have asked for more!
For starters I had the Pineapple Tandoori. Its sweet and salty with spices and something not easily forgettable. I have had bad experiences with pineapple tandooris before in other places, but here it is perfect! A must order!
For mains, I had Kesari Roti, Murgh Mussallam and Awadhi Biryani. The awadhi biryani here is best in the city, I never had better awadhi biryani anywhere else! Again, its a must try! The kesari roti was a new thing for me, and it was delicious and a perfect accompaniment with the Murgh mussallam(a speciality here). The Murgh mussallam is served whole, and you have to pre-order it since it takes time for preparation. 
For desserts we had phirni and shahi tukra. Phirni is again the best in the city here! The shahi tukra is something which will make you want more. 
Overall, a very memorable experience and will definitely go back again to try other dishes!

A cheap place with fairly good food.. loved the starter.. chicken cheese kebab first of its kind i had.. thn had ordered Reshmi kebab it was fairly good... Then in main course we had chicken Nd mutton biryani... Both were average nothing very special.. though we had planned to order kachi biryani but they didn't hv it... Side dish we took was tawa chicken it was also too average... Desert .. we ended up ordering shahi tukra and tutti fruity and chocolate ice creams... Loved the shahi tukra first of its kind i had.. all in all i would say a cheap place... If u visit this place chicken cheese biryani is a must order starter and shahi tukra a new dessert for me... Biryani's didn't attract me much...

This place was on my list from long. Finally made a visit there. The 1st thing that will strike you is the beautiful and royal ambiance. The place is beautiful with good view. The interiors looks royal.
Coming to the food. The food is no doubt one of the best in town. And their Biriyani is reason why people come here. All the dishes that I tried were good. But here are few which beats all other.
‚Ä¢Starters
* Chicken Cheese Kebab
* Mutton Galawti Kebab
* Pineaaple Kebab - if anyone has doubt ordering this, don't be in and just order it. I bet you haven't tasted pineaaple so good before.
.
‚Ä¢Mocktails
* Mango Shake
* Choco Cocoa
.
‚Ä¢ Main Course
* Kesari Roti
* Murg Mussallam
* Mutton Kadai
* Awadhi Biryani - one of their signature dish and also the best biriyani as recommend by many.
* Kacchi Biriyani - another version of Biriyani with mutton. Excellent taste.
.
‚Ä¢ Desserts
* Shahi Tukra
* Firni - very good.
.
Service was good enough. The price seems bit high but its 100% reasonable when it comes to the quality they serve. Highly satisfied.

The service staff attending us was probably not in a mood to work. I liked the food. But I think it would have been better had the biryani not been so cold given the AC was right above us, and after making a request to turn it off, we were ignored. Ambience is rich. I would want to go there again, maybe not anytime soon, hoping for a better service. I wasn't quite fond of the biryani. It could have been better. Kabab platter was really good.

India Restaurant is probably the only place which can challenge the likes of Shiraz and Arsalaan in terms of loyalists in this Biryani-crazy city. India's Biryani is delicious, and is competitively priced too. Their restaurant is classic, and hardly ever do you find it empty. I love their food, and I feel that their Biryani isn't given as much kudos as it should. Definitely worth visiting.

Calcuttans are very fussy about the biryani served to them. So when you are at India Restaurant, both your appetite and tastebuds for biryani are in safe hands. The Daryabadi biryani was so very well prepared that such an elaborate affair went down our tummy without any hassle. The gorgeous and evergreen mutton rezala was an expert's culinary craft.¬†

Apart from the grand delicacies, I always thrive on kebabs. The galawti kebab deserves a standing ovation from foodies like us! Chicken Reshmi Kebab, a regular affair at mughlai restaurants has been given a royal treat here.¬†

The ambience is grand with everything starting from the decor to the seating arrangement being aesthetically done. ¬†We were really happy to be there, pamper ourselves with the best mughlai food in town and last but not the least felt proud to dine at a place which speaks immense of Calcutta's glorious culinary past.

I heard of this restaurant from one of my friends but never got the chance to visit the place as it is very far from my place. But today I went to Nandan and didn't want to lose this opportunity to at least check in once this restaurant! The decor is superb. You really feel a serenity there. So calm and serene! Nicely decorated! Now let me tell you about the food. This restaurant is famous for its kababs and biryani. And really it is. Awesome taste of biryani with the nice aroma of Indian spices. Desserts and mocktails are also worth having. Now come to the service and price. Price is moderate. And good service.

It was an awesome experience with India restaurant. Ohhhh what restaurent it is. Full marks for decoration, ambience, food everything. The ambience is very nice. The restaurent is very well decorated.I have tasted Chicken cheese kabab,daryabadi mutton biryani, mutton rara punjabi, shahi tukra. All the items were very very tasty. Kabab was exceptional and very hevy. Daryabadi biryani was extraordinary in taste. If you take any starter then 1 plate biryani is enough for 2. I have heard kachhi biryani is one of the special item of india restaurent. So Love to go there to taste kachhi biryani.

Visited kolkata for a short food trip, After reading so many positive response and blogger's recommendation decided to give it a try and trust me it is worth it. Easily one of the BEST restaurant in Kolkata. Coming to food we ordered, :-

1- Kachi biryani - It was different from other regular biryani. Mutton pieces were properly cooked and dry fruits like cashews you can find in the rice, overall you can't afford to miss this biryani preparation. (5*/5)

2- Dum chicken - 4 Big leg pieces of chicken, you'll have hard time to finish it if you are alone . Bit spicy and semi gravy. Best to have it with naan or Lucknowi Paratha. ( 4.5*/5)

3- Mutton kadai - Bit on oily side but thick flavourful spicy gravy with boneless mutton pieces makes it worth it. ( 4/5)

4- Mutton biryani - Regular mutton biryani With one big mutton piece. Quantity was more than enough for 1 person and taste was awesome. ( 4*/5)

5- Chicken bharta -  Shreaded pieces of chicken with white gravy made up of cashews n other dry fruits and boiled egg mixed together . Definitely must try. ( 4*/5)

6- Mutton Galawati Kebab - The most famous dish of this resraurant, 4 pieces of minced mutton kebab served with Parathas is a must try. You can't afford to miss this dish if you are visiting this restaurant. ( 5*/5)

7- Phirni - Desert dish , It is available in most of the resraurants in Kolkata but India restaurant makes it the best ( 5*/5)

8- Shahi ka tukra - Desert dish, A must try . Make sure you arrive early to have this. (5*/5)

Negative remarks -
-.5* Mutton kadai was bit on oily side , can be improved.
Overall verdict - ( 4.5*/5)

This place is located nearby the FANCY MARKET of Khidderpore . The ambience is very homely . The sitting places are very cozy just to make you to feel relax while you wait for the order , and have a great time . Coming to food , this is one of the heaven for kebabs and biryani for me. They are juicy and delicious . We tried to taste all the kebabs in a go .. but we have to keep our spaces for biryani too. Taste the daryabaadi biryaani .. its the best . Go and enjoy urself !

After a blissful rain, we headed towards Khidirpur, to find out why people gave 4.6 rating to the India Restaurant, what specialty they have?

I thought it was a nice small food joint serving good biriyani but I was wrong actually when entered into the restaurant felt like entering in a palace.

A big, well decorated,neat and clean place. We ordered special mutton biriyani, with mixed raita and fresh lime soda. After just 5 minutes a plate full of biriyani served with raita. Ahhhh. What pleasure I felt I can't express in words.. The taste of biriyani was finger licking good. A plate biriyani with two mutton, one egg and one Potato not enough for two people if you are hungry, if not then okey.. I demanded an extra Alu, because I couldn't share it with any one, and they served an extra Alu too..
After that gastronomical fulfillment, we ordered sweet tooth sin ~ Gajar ka halwa, full of ghee, full of calories still the taste of halwa win over the calories.

After the dinner I thought the rating of 4.6 was wrong it should be 5.0 as I just rated it so..

India restaurant can safely say that 'all that glitters is indeed gold'. ¬†Once inside, the gleaming interiors induce a cheerful feeling. Placing the order was hassle-free. Service was impressive. ¬†Starting from lime-soda to firni, each item was delectable. You could feel the care that was taken while preparing the chicken tandoori and the biriyani. Icing on the cake was, there was no service tax. Overall, an amazing experience.

The place is located near Fancy market and is conveniently visible. The build and decor of this place are very good considering its location in the midst of Khidderpore. The biryanis and kebabs are most popular like in the case of any mughlai restaurant. Tried their Awadhi biryani which was served in a sealed earthen pot. Taste wise it was OK. Nothing extra ordinary. There are better Biryani options available.

Very rarely we come across a place that gets all the parameters of ambience, service and food spot on. We tried the tandoori and biriyani and wrapped it up with phirni. Each item was delicious. The service was quick even on a Sunday. And the ambience is just the right amount of glitz. Nothing gets better than this experience if you're in a mood to try Mughlai dishes in Kolkata.

The place is very well decorated and the service was really good. The food was no less ,especially the Chicken cheese kebab. I personally love cheese, hence a little biased towards that.
It was legendary as for the kebab was concerned.
And coming to the biryani ,it's not far behind the greats like Arsalan, Nizams and Royal but it has it's unique taste, I liked it. we ordered the Kachi Biriyani (Chicken) , Naan breads and Chicken tikka butter masala which was also pretty good but again it was the cheese kebab that i think everyone should try and is definitely recommended

The biriyani was awesome n the achari chicken was also great, the veg items and the roti was not that good. However the firni was amazing.
The service was really bad, we got the food but didnt get any spoon or a side plate, the achari chicken came after 20 minutes of getting the intial order.

Visited this place fot the second time yesterday on a special invitation from team India Restaurant and I just fell in love with the place. The restaurant looks beautiful and it is very spacious as well.
Coming to the food, I had ordered for Chicken Cheese Kebab, Awadhi Biryani and Shahi Tukda all of which I wanted to eat from this place for a really long time. And also had a tall glass of Fresh lime soda which was very refreshing.
The Chicken Cheese kebab had chicken along with the goodness of cheese. It had 6 large pieces. The kebab tasted amazing. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the cheese added amazing flavours to the entire dish. The kebabs were served with salad and the mint dip. The mint dip was really good. It was not too tangy neither too bland. It had a perfect balance of everything and went really well with the kebabs. The kebabs had the perfect taste and I would recommend everyone visiting there to try this one out. I am sure this wouldn't disappoint any foodie who loves to eat kebabs.
Then came the Awadhi Biryani in a handi along with raita. The awadhi biryani has 4 pieces of mutton and 2 pieces of potatoes though I am not sure about the number of potatoes, it may be more in number. Anyway, the biryani is well enough to serve 3 people it is that great in quantity. The biryani was made with finest quality of rice and it was lip-smacking. I had tasted awadhi biryani previously in another popular place in kolkata but after yesterday I can tell undoubtedly that the awadhi biryani of India was way better. It had perfect royal taste. Perfect blend of spices and the ghee added to the flavour of the biryani. The mutton in the biryani was tender and cooked to perfection. I didn't have to struggle to tear the meat off the bones, it was that well cooked.
Coming to the dessert I chose Shahi tukda because I am not much into firni. And boy I made the correct choice. The shahi tukda came with a large piece of bread and amazing malai. It was just perfect. It wasn't overly sweet or had too much essence. It was an amazing ending to the meal.
Now talking about hospitality, I think it has one of the most courteous team I have ever come across. After I reached I was greeted so warmly by their floor manager Waseem. He made sure I was comfortable and was very attentive. Other service persons were also very well trained.
I would like to mention here that there are very few restaurants who actually care about the kind of experience their customers had. I had a rough experience on my previous visit and their management is so effective that they took note of the experience and did not hesitate to apologies and show how much they care for their customer's culinary experience. They made up with the food and service this time and I had an amazing experience.
And a big thank you to Joydeep Sen (of marketing department) for being present there and making my experience in India Restaurant more amazing.
I would recommend everyone to visit this restaurant and go through an amazing culinary and hospitality experience. üòä

We went here for my birthday celebration.As this place is quite odd so we took a uber to reach there. It is in khidderpore near fancy market. The ambience was awesome and the decor is very classy. Now coming to the food. We ordered galawti kabab for starters. Its taste was out of the world. They served the galwati kabab with parathas. Then in main course we had ordered mutton biriyani and mutton kadai. The mutton biriyani was very light and it was so good in taste. The mutton in the biriyani was succulent. This is one of the best biriyani i had till date.Mutton kadai was also good. We ordered 2 sweet lime soda. It was normal. Then we were craving for some sweet tooth so we ordered sahi tukda. It was nice. I was so busy for having those food i forgot to take pics. The staff was also very friendly and courteous. This place is a must visit for north indian lovers.

First of all, ambience is great. Biriyani (ordinary) and daryabadi biriyani both are good. Kacchi biriyani is different kind, a little bit sweet with cashews and raisins(not like Kolkata biriyani).My preference is first two mentioned biriyani. In kebabs, chicken cheese kebab, peshwari and chatpata are good. But mutton kakori and galawti are d show stealers(must try). Chaap and and pasinda are good in gravies. Firni is a good treat to end with.

Located in Kidderpore, near Fancy Market. 
This place is one of the most renowned places to have good food. The place has two floors, the ground floor is non AC and the first floor is AC(the charge is considerably high)
Now coming on to the food, we ordered Mutton Biryani, Dum Murgh and Masala Kulcha. This was my secind or third visit, but the first one to be a dine in.
Th biryani tasted really good ,the fragrance was nice, the mutyon was also very soft. The flavours were very  appealing.
The dum murgh was also no less splendid. And having 4 pieces of chicken, it did make a tedious job to finish it.
Lastly the Kulchaz which was disappointing. The kulcha was small snd fat. The stuffings were not so nice either, and i felt a little bit more of ghee should've been added on it since it was becoming quite dry. 
However having said that, this place is totally worth it to have biryani and will surely come back.

good food and ambience.service is also good.taste of kachhi biriyani is awsome!firni is mindblowing! but the taste of shahi tukra is not up to the mark.a smell of egg is coming out from shahi tukda.but overall experience is very satisfying.

I have visited the place many times.
It has not very decent atmosphere mosly if you choose the non ac part. But if you want good food you must visit.

Yes good and fast service.. and value for money.üëçüëç

Being used to the Shiraz, Arsalan and Zeeshan brand of mughlai food (esp. Biryani), this place came as a pleasant, much needed change. The biggest positive according to me was that, inspite of Zomato or Swiggy not delivering food at our home from here, the hotel management decided to do so. Now, IR is quite far away from our place and the very fact that they did deliver the food home was a big, big positive on their part. It was delivered on time, too.
And now... The food. It was exceptionally good. They have really raised the bar for restaurants serving Mughlai food. Tasting the Galouti kebab was simply an out of world experience. The Cheese kebab, too gave a similar feeling. The Daryabadi Biryani was a new experience altogether and it was an intriguing dish.... exquisite aroma emanated from this dish and the flavours were par excellence. The other Biryanis were also pretty good. The Chaap was a bit different to that served at other places and the flavours of cashew nut in the gravy was distinct. Different as it may have been, yet it tasted pretty good. But the dish that stood out in the crowd was the Firni. I can say, with absolute conviction, that the Firni they serve is the best that anyone can avail in Kolkata. Never before have I tasted such a good rendition of this age old dessert. To all the foodies... Do definitely try the firni here.
It was definitely a great experience ordering food from here... My next target is to be here, in person, and experience the ambience.

A very good place with nice ambience where you will enjoy the "feel good" environment. Located near the Fancy market in kidderpore this restaurant will never disappoint you. The staff members were very good although they were a bit late in the start. We visited there in the eve of poila boisakh. We had some drinks along with biriyani and mutton item. We had heard a lot about the galawti kabab but it was not as expected. Would love to visit again.

One the best places in Kolkata to treat your taste buds with good mughlai dishes. Have never been disappointed with their food. This place has still maintained it's quality for biryani. It offers "Kachchi biryani" my dad's favourite and the famous "Peshawari kabab" my personal favourite. I would always come to this place to treat myslef whenever I have that craving for some amazing Mutton biryani and the peshawari kabab.

The best part about this restaraunt is that, it has extended its family section and the decor is quite exqusite.

According to me, they serve the best biriyani in kolkata. Or its just, i am too much fond of this place. I can relate my childhood memories with this place, as i have seen this place grow!!
So, i come here often, and this is one of our favorite family dine out region.
Things i like here are
Biriyani üíõ
Kachhi biriyani üíú
Reshmi malai kabab üíõ
Pineapple kabab üíú
Mutton stew üíõ
And last but not the least FIRNI ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Nobody in town makes firni as good as this place.
Besides all dese. Other mutton nd chicken side dishes are equally good.
Its a must visit for every biriyani lover!!

Visited this place on a sweltering monday afternoon with,craving for some good kebabs.
This place doesnt disappoint its customers staying true to their promise of providing lipsmacking delicacies at a moderately reasonable price..excellent decor of the restaurant and pleasant behaviour of the staff adds a feather to its cap.
We ordered:-
1. Mutton kakori kebabs (very soft and melts in the mouth)
2. Mutton galawati kebabs with breads ( the accompaniment and presentation made me a fan kf this and the taste..heavenly, it gives a serious competition to oudh1590)
3. Chicken cheese kebab ( speciality of this place, Well hands down the best i have tried till now)
4. Biryani laccha paratha and chaap and raita  wre ordered for main course which wre quite good too but not extraordinary chaap was a bit too oily but the raita was cool and refreshing and went well with the parathas..though daryabadi biryani is still left unatasted..
Definitely calls for a second visit to try their biryanjs and make this review a bit longer.
Keep up the good work guys!!

One of the very few restaurants in Kolkata where I can go blindly for that perfection in Food, Service and  Ambience .! 
It looks amazing and gives you a royal feel..the service time is not too long ..the prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes ( unlike other restaurants which loot you in the name of taxes ).! 
Food : 
Kachhi Biryani ( Signature Dish here ) 
Chicken Afghani 
Chicken Hariyali Kebab
Mutton Galawti Kebab 
Mutton Dakbanglow 
Chicken Chaanp 
Mutton RoganJosh
Egg Fried Rice 
Each and every delicacy was yummy and mouthwatering...
And the " Shahi Tukda " at the end was the perfect dessert one could ask for...! 
Do visit guys :)

India restaurant  is synonymous with Kachi Biryani.  Been here multiple  times and have been disappointed  plentiful times since the famous Kachi Biriyani gets exhausted very fast. The Biriyani is juicy and is packed full of flavours.  The mutton is soft and breaks off from the bones very easily. Acommpanied with the Biriyani is Galawti kebab with Paratha. Even the normal Biriyani is very succulent. Located bang besides the famous Fancy Market, the restaurant has a wonderful ambience which adds to the  dining experience.

Biryani is the worst and very overpriced. My friend found a small feather in the food. Too bad I didn't think of taking a photo as we were in a hurry. The staff too is very unprofessional. First of all the no. of staff was perhaps more than the no. of customers (I was in the new A.C restaurant) and all of them were having a gala time there chit chatting and giggling in the corners. The decoration and furnishings is the only thing worth appreciating. Wonder how it has a high rating. Maybe we came at a bad time and perhaps the other dishes are the saving grace for this place because the biryani will certainly disappoint you. Finding the chicken in the biryani was like finding a needle in a haystack for my friend and I got this huge piece which felt dry and bland below the upper layer of the flesh. I could go on but you get the idea...

Outstanding is the word that can match this place because from food to service everything is commendable. The quality and variety of food definitely is impressive and the highly recommended.
The place is nicely decorated and very spacious as well. Now jumping to the food section. 
Chicken Cheese Kebab
The dish is very much appealing. Cooked to perfection with tandoori spices and ample amount of cheese. One bite of the chicken, and you can feel the masala blending beautifully with the cheese.

Mutton Galawti Kebab
Wow, just wow. There is something so tasty about this dish, delicious and kind of addictive. Served with parantha, it melts in the mouth and the taste is impeccable. Must try.
Mutton Awadhi Biriyani
This was a show stealer. Perfectly prepared and full of flavor. Each spoon contented our stomach and heart fully. Overall a package of flavors and a must have. If not for anything else, try it for the sheer love of food and fusion in general, and I can bet you won‚Äôt regret it! 
Firni & Shahi Tukda
You can‚Äôt finish your meal without having these two. Simply superb!

Situated in the heart of Kidderpore, this place has been a nice catch for quite a long time. 
We used to visit this place almost everyday during Durga Puja. Despite the crowd they used to offer great service with great food all at the same time. 
After few years this will be one of the most well reputed restaurants in the city.
If you have'nt been there atleast once, you missed out a great deal.

Still cherish the satisfaction and delightful experience we had here. To be honest heard a lot about this restaurant, but never put it in the wish list as it far far away from my locality. But as it says , sometime a successful plan happen when you don't plan. Same goes here, decided just in the morning we just started our trip, keeping in mind that we have to reach by 12. Otherwise, u may not get their famous kacchi biriyani, as it finishes early due to high demand and also it took a great time to prepare.

Location:
______________
That is in khidirpore, just beside the fancy market. If you are not aware of the place, just trust your Google map. You will be there. But yes transport is a problem here, so we went by uber.

Decoration:
_________________
They reinnovate it recently. So, it's full AC now,decor is pretty good. So, while entering you will have a pleasant experience.

Now coming to food
_________________________

‚úì Gawlauti Kebab : mutton Gawlauti Kebab server with Lucknowi paratha. This taste owssum. Paratha is just thin and superb.

‚úì Chicken Malai Kebab : another owssum. Just loved it.

‚úì kacchi biriyani: now comes their signature dish. The main significance of this one is- marinated mutton and rice cooked in dum style, it is not that cooked mutton place in layer with biriyani rice. So, it takes a long time to cook. And yes the taste is just owssum. It comes with a piece potato, egg and mutton. And trust me the mutton is that soft and well cooked. Very light biriyani, just just mind blowing.

‚úì Daryabadi Biriyani: it is same of kacchi biriyani. Only the thing is it has two pieces of mutton.

‚úì chicken kadai : taste owssum. Though biriyani is that good, side dishes was not at all required, which i required always. This one taste superb.

Beverages:
______________

‚úì litchi slush mojito: very good one. Refreshing.
‚úì kiwi slush mojito: just superb. Just perfect in the heat of summer.

Dessert:
____________
‚úì sahi tukra : owssum one. Just loved it.
‚úì Firni : very good one. Must try.


Now the overall experience is superb in terms of food. The service and hospitality is bang one.

A small clitch : disappointed not getting chicken cheese kebab and Chicken afgani kebab. They took the order later they came to intimate us it is not available, but yes they have suggested always a alternative. So, 0.5 deduction only for that.

Now we were stomach full, and all it cost 1680 INR of there people.

Just owssum experience. One of the best biriyani experience for sure. So, must visit :)

Located just near to the Fancy market in Kidderpore. This place has always been on the top of my go-to lists. So finally I visited this place with my friends last week. I heard they transformed  from a normal dining restaurant to luxury dining restaurant. We were astounded by the decor of this place. 

Now coming to the food we ordered the Chicken Cheese Kebab and Mutton Galawati Kebab for starters. The chicken kebabs came in 6 pieces with a layer of cheese coating on the top. The pieces were very softy and luscious. The Galawati kebab came in 4 pieces and was served with very thin paranthas. Honestly I'm in love with this dish. You'll be simply blown away. Highly recommended. ¬†

For the mains we wanted to order the Awadhi biriyani but sadly it was unavailable on that day. So we had to settle for Kacchi biriyani. The Kacchi biriyani is a lot different from our Kolkata biriyani. There were dry fruits along with the rice which makes the aroma quite different from our traditional biriyani. The mutton pieces were quite soft and succulent. We also ordered some plain nans and one chicken tikka butter masala. The bread was soft and the chicken pieces were quite tender but the gravy disappointed me a lot. I had better in my previous encounters. ¬†

All in all, this place is hugely recommended for the biriyani lovers. Surprisingly the VAT and service tax is included in the menu which is great. I would definitely visit this place for their Awadhi biriyani. ¬†

Cheers.  :)

To me, the nearest competitor to Arsalan can be India Restaurant. Their Biryanis are extremely light and one can consume a good amount. They don't give any heart burn or stomach problem however you eat. But having said that, the taste is never compromised. It is a highly recommended place though, a bit off route....

Visited this old favourite of mine at Kolkata. Wow what a makeover! Air-conditioned and redecorated this iconic restaurant still has it ethos intact.

They specialise in tandoors and biriyani. Their "Kachhi" biriyani wherein th meat and rice is co.oked together is incredible.

Don't miss out on their "Chaanp" either. Exotic spices combined with poppy seeds and cashew powder makes this exquisite

I have been longing to visit this restaurant for a long time but couldn't since its in a odd part of town. But we finally did, this Holi and although it was a bit painstaking to reach, it sure was worth it. To begin with, this is perhaps one of the finest restaurants in that part of town. From the point of entry to exit, everything was way better than we expected. The interior decoration and the ambience was exquisite. Very spacious, well lit yet not too much, just enough to create a pleasant ambience. We ordered "Chicken Hariyali Kabab" for the starters, the renowned dish "Mutton Kachchi Biryani", Mutton Chap & Firni. The Kabab was brilliantly barbecued and tasted awesome with the sauce. The Biryani was really good and spicy but not as legendary as I had expected, I have tasted better in Arsalan but maybe because‚Äã of my over expectations I disappointed myself. The meat was perfect & the Biryani was really good but didn't have the punch that Arsalan carried. The staffs are very professional and mentioned to cancel the Mutton chap as it might be too much and boy were they right. By the time we finished the Biryani, we were full. We ended our dinner with Firni which was really good. Had a really great time and sure will be back regardless of the constraints related to transportation.

After two months of eagerness and conspiracy, finally Checked in here last week.¬†
My visit only concentrated on the availability of beef, ¬†unfortunately when plan A fails you must have a back up plan.¬†
First thing comes first. location is in the heart of kidderpore. Dont just forget to observe the entire place. keen eyes will do that. Decoration coupled with the royal aura is captivating. Distinctly vivid and soothing to the eyes, you might not find all the even factors in any other place. Delivery counter is separately placed. Also an waiting space is attached to the first floor.
They dont serve beef and we were too reluctant to check the menu card earlier in zomato. so we ordered mutton kadai, wretched and anguished. A part of our plan remained unaltered, the paratha. I felt that the menu card ¬†is a bit restricted.¬†
somehow that rainy day seized the lust of biryani. Wanted to have some hot smoky tender kebabs though the wish never brought to completion. They served the chicken seekh kebab after the main course, yes, by some means tastebuds were confused. ¬†
¬†Prices are unbelievably cheap, so it'd be completely normal if you encounter some random despicable crowd. ¬†
¬†Overall experience over there is worth every penny spent. Top- notch service , no complains as such.

have tried kebab in many places but no doubt its the best.chicken was juicy and well smoked and magic happened when taken into mouth... its melted.can't forget the superb taste of the chutney along with...biriyani was just fabulous enriched with all spices,flavours and equally well cooked and flavoured piece of mutton is super pleasing..ordered the Firni afterwards and they served us best Firni ever tested...the texture,taste,flavour was just mindblowing..i was compelled to literally cherish every spoon i took from the clay pot..last but not the least superb quick and polite service of the waiters...

To those mughlai food lovers to whom Arsalan and Aminia are benchmark of good biryani destinations , you need to magnify your search and come here and get bowled over by the awesome quality and ambience of a "Good Mughlai Restaurant " . India restaurant has really come a long way their basic outlet to a luxury fine dining one just on their top floor . It's not my first time here but I could not open down my last awesome experience here so finally came here and doing it . 

¬∞ Location :-  Located exactly on the heart of kidderpore . Beside fancy market . If you are coming from ola/Uber then the destination won't be an issue . But if you are not then look for fancy market in kidderpore .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- A fine looking interior for a classic fine dining mughlai restaurant . The ambience is top notch and something you will immediately notice on entering .The staff is well-dressed, polite and very helpful . The serving time for the kabaabs was around 7 minutes , the biryani came after 10 minutes and the desert took another 7 minutes .

------------------------------------------
¬∞ Food :- No mughlai restaurant is complete without it's splendid array of kabaabs and although we were spoilt for choice we still managed to select 2 mind blowing kabaab starters .

1. Chicken cheese kabaab. ( 5 / 5 ) :- Simply mind blowing . One of their specialties and a must ordered item . Generous portions of  boneless chicken covered with tandoori spices and grilled after topped in a cheesy coating . This is as good as it gets . If you someone who really loves a spoonfull of cheese with your chicken then you must have this please . 
6 cheesy chicken kabaab pieces for 320 rupees is a steal deal .

2. Mutton galawti kabaab ( 5 / 5 ) :-  Just stunning . Minced mutton lovers or more specifically galawti kabaab lovers this is the real thing for you . For once move over oudh and have a bite from here . 4 generous pieces of minced mutton delight served with 4 crispy and light paratha . A statutory advise is to taste it with you eyes closed because you will be simply blown away . A must must order .

After getting blown over by the kabaabs , we were really hungry for some biryani . And here we made a mistake . We were 3 guys and all of us ordered the same dish instead of going for variations . We went for the much celebrated kacchi Biryani as neither of us were ready to miss out on the much famed dish from this place . And here is my take on it .

3. Kacchi Biryani ( 3 / 5 ) :- Okay so a low rating . Let's just start the discussion on what kind of biryani I like . I am a big fan of Kolkata biryani or those who are very much close to it . I am not saying that the other biryani should try to replicate that but I am.also saying that the whole appearance of biryani in my head is fixed on the Kolkata biryani so anything close to it will be appreciated by me but anything deviating far from it is a tough thing for my appetite . And the most important turning off for me was the over indulgence of ALU bokhra in the kacchi Biryani which made it tangy . It may be welcome for other biryani lovers but for me it is not really welcome . The potato , rice and mutton everything was tangy and I could not continue with the dish and gave up half way.  I know this dish is carrying a lot of sentiments and good regards from a whole lot of lovers of this dish but frankly this biryani is not for me and those who are an avid lover of the Kolkata version and have a hard time experimenting, please don't go for it . I would not stress much in the quantity much , the rice was of good quality and quantity and the meat was succulent but everything was tangy . Go for kacchi and dariyabadi biryani only if you fond of tangy spices in your biryani .

4. Firni ( 4 / 5 ) :- A perfect firni to end a mixed mughlai food experience . The texture was fine and the taste spot on .

5. Gajar ka halwa ( 3 / 5 ) :- Not the best halwa I have had . Poor in quantity and the taste was okayish .

----------------------------------------------

¬∞ Verdict :-. A must must visit for the mughlai lovers . A word of advice for the Kolkata biryani lovers that they should only go for the normal special mutton biryani and not experiment much . Other than that the kabaabs are simply out of the world and the place is suited for a fine dining mughlai experience .

What a food... I was absolutely stunned with the quality and their services.. I made my tastebuds fully engrossed.. I took many kababs and tandoori and biriyani... Most importantly the ambience is superb... But price is pocket friendly.

Being a Biriyani lover in its truest meaning, I am always apprehensive about trying new places that promise good biriyani. But India Restaurant surpassed all my expectations to the fullest and beyond. First I would like to speak about the ambience. It has well lit interiors with picturesque wall hangings that immediately lifts your mood. Comfortable lighting and spacious seating arrangements. And now the obvious. Food. We started with "Chicken Cheese Kebabs" which turned out to be mouth wateringly delicious. Then we ordered Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Kacchi Biriyani, which was a new type of dish we tried. And we weren't disappointed at all. Everything was well cooked, not more not less, and the quantity was sufficient to satiate our immense love for biriyani. And finally we finished off with "Phirni" which was like no other I have tasted so far (and trust me, I have had this particular delicacy everywhere!). The service was pretty quick and the staff was amiable. Overall a great experience. A must visit for all true biriyani lovers!

I am a very big fan of biryani. I consider myself a gourmet (personal opinion :P)!
I can assure you guys, INDIA RESUTRANT is one of the very few places which serve biryani, how it should be!
The service and the ambience is also upto the mark! I am very much satisfied.

Their Biriyani is the ultimate... whether it is Kachchi or Dariyabadi or the normal one. Taste of Chap/ Mutton Tikka and firni / Shahi tukda will bring you back here again and again.

Its located on a very busy street of Khidderpore. Inside decoration is without a doubt top class. I basically visited this place to taste much famed 'kacchi mutton biryani' which I was lucky to get a plate on a busy sunday night. Biryani was without a doubt excellent. Apart from that everything else was more or less normal or below normal. Quantity provided for chicken curry (cant recall the name) was smaller. Rumali Roti was not hot. Tandoori roti was stiff. And one of the mocktail ordered was horrible (though cheap). Service was again normal given the heavy rush at the restaurant.The menu price include the VAT and service tax amount. So you pay only what is mentioned on the menu.¬† May be I would like to visit this place again on a quite weekday evening but definitely not on a sunday eve.¬† So in short India Restaurant is a place with Decor of a Hotel The Park but with food, service, etc of Arsalan/Aminia Restaurant.

My love for biriyani goes back a long time. But I have not really been able to properly visit all the great biriyani places in Calcutta. So I started my biriyani quest with Indian restaurant and what a great experience it has been! Their kacchi biriyani is very famous and I have now realised why! It tastes absolutely different from all the other biriyanis I have tasted so far. It tastes so heavenly. But my complain is about the chicken butter masala. I didn't quite enjoy it as much as I did the biriyani. The ambience of the place is also nice. A must try for all biriyani lovers!

Tried their chicken chaap and mutton boti kebab for the first time. Chicken chaap was good and the mutton boti was excellent.The firni was also good. Just the way you expect from an authentic mughlai restaurant. The Kebab had 6 big size boneless pieces and it was marinated to perfection which made it really soft and juicy. Coudnt upload photos since I was really hungry after coming home. Took a parcel from them and the packing was good enough. Sure to visit again and try their mutton biryani and other delicacies.Highly recommended if you are a mughlai enthusiast.

Cheers to one of the finest Biryanis I have had in my life.

The kachi mutton biryani of India Restaurant is perhaps the epitome of the classic Kolkata Biryani.

Along with the amazing decor and ambience with the oh so awesome aroma and flavour....I think I have had the biggest foodgasm of my life today!!!

First of all it's very easy to locate,  just beside the Fancy market on the main road side.  It has large seating capacity with multiple floors.  The decoration and ambience is very royal with the food price and quantity.  The quality and the quantity with this reasonable price is very much appreciable.  Top suggestions : Reshami Kebabs,  Chicken Reshmi Butter masala,  Crispy chilli baby corn,  and firni. Also had Awadhi biriyani which lacks in the league race of all other tasty foods.  Overall satisfying, must visit place with friends or famaily.  Lastly very courteous staffs. Thank you.

I had visited this restaurant a few days ago with my mother and aunt. The interiors were really grand, one would experience a royal feeling immediately on entering the place. For starters we ordered Chicken Cheese Kabab and a Mutton Galawati Kabab. The delicacies were so well prepared that they simply melted in the mouth. Next we ordered two plates of Special Mutton Biryani and a Chicken Biryani, along with a side dish of Chicken Kasturi Butter Masala. The meat was so tender and finely marinated. The staff was very disciplined and courteous. They rendered wonderful service. It is a marvellous place. I shall certainly visit this place again.

The first thing you notice about this place after sitting down is the bright ambiance of the place which did not fail to cheer me up in my first visit here. The hospitability of the staff added to that.
The best part of it is definitely the FOOD...¬†
The chicken cheese kebab(an Indian speciality), ¬†alongwith Afghani chicken and biriyani and achari chicken was a brilliant combination. Last but not the least, was phirni..
Located very near to Fancy Market in Kidderpore (and very easy to locate), India Restaurant is definitely a MUST-VISIT if Mughlai cuisine excites u.

2.Galawati kabab: minced mutton with diff spiced shallow fried on a patila,served with lakhnowi paratha.. The kabab just melt in your mouth.

3.Mutton biriyani : Usual Calcutta biriyani but little mild in spicy meter compared to other famous Calcutta biriyanis.
4.Mutton Kacchi Biriyani : This one is special Biriyani with tender pieces of mutton And exotic dry fruits and spiced perfectly.

Overall service is really good, 
Proportions are good.
Overall a must try Restuarent in Kolkata.

I went there for an office lunch with my team. Located very near to Fancy Market in Kidderpore, India Restaurant is definitely the crowning jewel among all the Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata. The interior will give you a very royal feeling. The place is almost crowded due to its immense popularity most of the time. We were a large group, so it took some time to get the seats. The food ordered by us was eclectic: chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, galoti kebabs, chicken reshmi kebabs, chicken malai kebabs, tandoori roti, parantha, rumali roti and mutton. The biriyani was like ambrosia, amazingly fragrant with no trace of excess oil and greatly cooked meat. The kebabs were succulent and brilliant. The tandoori roti was soft and hot. The mutton gravy was spicy and perfectly cooked. The rumali rotis were excellent. For desserts we had firni: just amazing!! This place is highly recommended for all the epicures!!!

Sayz...situated near the famous Fancy Market. This restaurant has been renovated some time back. It looks so much better now with great food and awesome staff. The ambiance is a little bright, I would say a little dim light would make it perfect. Lets come to the main stuff which is 'Food'. Frankly speaking the food is really very good. I am a regular visitor here and have tried most of the dishes here. India restaurant is famous for its Kacchi Biryani. Gulauti Kebab is another mouth watering dish. Kebabs and other chicken dishes are all very good. Tandoori, peshwari, haryali afghani are some great kebabs to try on. Nan is another great item here. You would not get this type of quality Nan everywhere, soft and delicious. In dessert part part don't miss Gajar ka Halwa, Firni and Shahi Tukra. The best part is its very pocket friendly. Another great thing here which I xperiancd was last time I ordered Kacchi Biryani. The mutton was little over cooked and was burnt. I told the staff about it and they changed it then and there. This is just an extraordinary add on which they have shown. The staff is also very good and polite. I just love this place..

Come to food, we have ordered chicken tikka kebab, it was good, mutton galwati kebab, more authentic, fish achari kebab, awesome. We have ordered awadhi and daryabadi biriyani trust me guys daryabadi biriyani was just heaven, I think best place to have biriyani in Kolkata. Also firni was awesome. Definitely visiting ¬†ASAP.

I heard a lot of good stuffs about this place so finally decided to visit it to celebrate home coming of my brother.It was very easy to locate.The first impression I had after entering the place was "wow! what a wonder",felt like a modern mughal palace.There are two floors.We preferred the top floor.I felt it had a better ambience.The lighting,the decor everything was like a fine dine restaurant.Coming to the food,the kebabs are finger licking good,perfect flavour,cooked to perfection.We ordered the malai kebabs,mutton biriyani and a chicken side dish.The biriyani was not tremendously good but not bad either.The chicken in the curry was great,juicy-soft-well flavoured.The most important part -money.Its all worth the money,infact I feel they are charging less than what they deserve.The place looks expensive but its pretty cheap.The amount served by them is quite good too.Its a must try for all.I am sure nobody would regret going to this place!!!

Situated in the heart of khiddirpore just beside the 5 star market. In one word it is good. I visited the groud floor normal sitting area. Till now I did not have a chance to visit the 1st and 2nd floor luxury area.  The ground floor is ordinary as a restaurant would be in a crowded place. But the dishes are good to taste. Specially biriyani. Just wow. The perfect touch of Mughal dishes. As expected found in khiddirpore. No doubt good food. Value for money.

We went to India Restaurant hoping that we would be able to have their famous Kacchi Biryani. Little did we know that we were headed for big disappointment. As luck would have it, they had run out of the biryani. Anyhow, we refused to get disheartened and do all in our might to make it worth the visit. We were successful. We were a group of eight and we ordered a lot of food ranging from chicken Malai tikka to galauti kebabs to Awadhi biryani to rezala and Julian chicken. Would like to write on each item individually. The malai tikka, while not having a lot of malai proved to be a hit. It was soft and succulent and the right amount of spicy. They served the galauti kebab next with which they also gave us a few parathas. Now we being stupid, we thought they were supposed to be a part of the main course. After having the galauti kebab one of us picked up a little piece of the paratha to taste it, only to realise it was an accompaniment. And the paratha was one of the best things about the restaurant. It was crispy and soft at the same time and the taste was amazing. Our only regret was we didn't have it with the kebab as we were supposed to. While I have had better galauti kebabs in the past, the ones at India Restaurant came pretty close too. They had that melt-in-the-mouth texture as all such kebabs are supposed to have. Next came our main course, we loved even the naans and butter naans that were served. Very soft. We ordered both chicken and mutton rezala and it was very light and cooked the perfect amount. The only catch was it only had one piece. I wish they would have more pieces. We also ordered Julian chicken which tasted more like Kadhai chicken. This was the only dish, other than the Awadhi biryani that I found a little underwhelming. The biryani according to me was a bit too wet and I didn't much like the spices. We ended the feast with firnis. I wish they had the shahi Tukda. The firnis were quite good too. I would recommend IR and please do eat the galautis with those magical parathas.

I've been looking forward to visit this place since ever. But didn't know how it changed after renovation. Tried my all time favourite Galauti kebabs which is a signature speciality of India restaurant. Have tried galautis in many places but mostly been disappointed. Not in India restaurant! The outer coat of the kebab is crisp and inner part is succulent and soft! Melt in mouth instantly! Served with crisp and thin parathas, it makes a perfect starter!

Never actually been to the restaurant, I've always had their food at the food festivals. I remember having had their biriyani at Khaibar Pass last year - it's aromatic and decadent and nothing like you've had before, with dry fruits and beautiful rice. This year, I chose to have the chicken cheese kebab. Covered by a thick layer of cheese that's holding its shape, the chicken pieces were soft and moist and flavoursome. The cheese sealed it all in. Absolutely lovely, highly recommended.

Now this is a place worth at least one visit by kolkata biryani lovers. Their biryani is neither subtle nor very strong, aromatic. Its extremely balanced and full-bodied. The portion is pretty huge and very much likable. They make a surprisingly good fish tikka- spicy but very, very good. Recently, they have introduced their Awadhi Biryani. Preparation for this dish takes around 30 min and you should take that into consideration. One portion is sufficient for 2 heavy eaters and it's served in a sealed clay pot. Basically, fragrant rice and succulent meat is what we can describe about this item. Also, I've tried the mutton Kakori Kebab. The taste was impecce and portion size wise pretty decent. Rarha meat was rather okay-ish (please remember not bad, but nothing heavenly). The burhani served with biryani was decent though.

I visited this place after a year and I was pleasantly surprised with the decor change. The new decor looks really amazing and certainly uplifts the restaurant. I've tried Biriyani quite a few times here and I must say it's at pat with other restaurants like Arsalaan and Aminia. I have also tried chicken Peshawari here and the food was quite oily but you kinda expect that from typically rich Indian food. The ambience is really good but the price is little on the steeper side.

Legendary Resturant in Kidderpore near Fancy Market, Kolkata. Ambience wise one of best. We had orderd Chicken Afghani ( starter) & Daryabadi Biryani. In Daryabadi Biryani the mutton and also the rice was soo tasty and delicious. Some dry fruits are also sprinkled to make the dish more mouth-watering. Everything is just marvellous. Recommend to everyone. A very pocket friendly resturant. Gone here after visting Fancy Market.

I tried out their Daryabadi Biryani, had to pack it to go as I was running late. To be described by me, it is midway between Hyderabadi & Awadhi biryani, in terms of taste and texture. The meat was harder than expected, which I didn't like. There are dry fruit bits here and there which add some zing and crunch in your bite occasionally. Worth a try.

Visited India Restaurant a couple of times.
But the decor of the revamped and reincarnated restaurant is a thing to look out for.

The biriyani of this place is just too good.
One cam also try the chicken chap which is also delicious.
I have heard that the Shahi tukra served here is too good.But my bad luck..whenever I order,it is finished.
So,I generally order Firni in desserts and this is also tasty.
Overall..its a good ambience coupled with good food.

The first thing you notice about this place after sitting down is the bright ambiance of the place which did not fail to cheer me up in my first visit here. So the biriyani is famous and I had to give it a try.Honestly I wasn't that impressed and I felt I have had better elsewhere. The flavours just didnt blend well enough for me, it neither was light lnor spicy and was somewhere in between. Putting together it was above average. Now when I come to the kebabs section, I must say I was bowled over. Outstanding is the word that comes to my mind. Tried four different types-peshawari, reshmi, malai and hariyali and all better than the other in a way. Literally melt in the mouth kebabs that are so hard to find these days. Having been there only once I dont really know about the other dishes. The proportions, the quick service all impressed me. But what made me decide that I have to go there again was the Shahi Tukda. I will end it at this,without spoiling any more. Just head over there and try the Shahi Tukda if nothing else. You will feel you have made the right choices after waking up that day. Atleast I did

Heard a lot about this place from food frenzy friends, so decided to visit today. Actually I brought a nearbuy voucher worth 550 rs giving us 2 mutton kacchi biriyani, one reshmi/hariyali/tikka/malai kabab and two soft drinks... We opted for chicken reshmi kabab.. The sitting arrangement was spacious and service was prompt.. Kebab was out of this world....the biriyani was proper in quantity and mutton was soft, with less bony parts.. Definitely worth revisiting.

One would feel like a nawab delving into their mutton biryani, with the faint aroma of rosewater emanating from the fragrant rice. The mutton pieces were good too. 
The firni was regal, light, and smooth.

Typical Mughlai fare. Went for lunch. Ambience was great with dim lighting and soft music. Service was equally good. For starters, ordered Malai Kabab, Galawti Kabab and Chatpata Chicken. The Malai Kabab was soft and succulent but the Galawti and Chatpata let us down. The Galawti was too mild and bordered on being tasteless while the Chatpata tried hard to be a tandoori item. Next up, were the biriyani, an Awadhi one and a normal one. The Awadhi has never been a favorite of mine and even now it failed to impress me. Same goes for the normal biriyani.

This resturant is situated nearby my place and i visited this place everyday for more than one year just for its biriyani. If you ask for an extra potato..they wont include it in your bill. Great service!

Have ordered food from here a few times but have never been there. The delivery was always good. The biryani is not dry. It is the opposite of dry. Too much vanaspati. But it tastes good and is different from places like shiraz, rahmania, arsalan, aminia, royal. The firni is also very good.

I think that India restaurant serves one of the best Biriyani in town

Exquisite ambience is the first thing one notices.the ambience inside is just mind blowing! The food they serve, the quality, quantity and the hygiene is excellent. The staffs and their service is awesome.

I went there on behalf of PanchPhoron team on the occasion of Iftar special Food Festival @ ¬†The India Restaurant .

We were served the following -

Mocktails ‚Äì¬†

1)Deep Blue Sea

2)Pineapple Blossom

3)Strawberry Blossom

4)Mango Blossom

5)Choco Cocoa-

6) Virgin Mojito¬†

My picks -
All mocktails looked presentable and were well made & refreshing. But I found Strawberry Blossom the best. Highly recommended......!!

Foods ‚Äì

1. Paneer kurkure

2. Beguni

3. Peyaji

4. Galaouti kebabs with lucknawi Paratha

5. Special mutton haleem

6. Chicken reshmi kebab

7. Fresh fruit platter included watermelon, banana, pineapple , papaya & mango.

8. Egg chilli tossed with peppers

My picks - Though all the items were well cooked and yummy but I preferred the following the most -

1) Egg Chilli tossed with peppers- It was lipsmacking, flavourful . A perfect high protein juicy snack.

2)Paneer Kurkure - It looked like spring rolls, it was crispy outside & soft inside and was palatable. I couldn't resist myself from having more of it.

3) Chicken Reshmi kebab - It was succulent, flavourful and very tempting.

4) Special Mutton Haleem- A very important dish made of meat, lentils, spices etc cooked for a long time and is a protein packed food. It was well cooked and yummy.

5) Peyaji- A popular telebhaja, it was less oily and crispy .

Enjoy the pious Iftaar with your friends and family here or come here on any other day and relish. It would be definately worth it.

Thanks to the management for hosting us and their hospitality.

Exquisite ambience is the first thing one notices.   Friendly,  relaxed staff.   Comfortable and spacious seating.   Hungry after trip to the bustling Kolkata zoo we fired up zomato and this one popped up in nearby.  Really happy with the food, service and vfm.  Mutton sheek kebab could have been made a little less drier  but it tasted good.  Unlike hyderabad no salan here with biryani.  But that's just Kolkata - nothing to do with this place.  I really feel Kolkata biryani scene is ripe for disruption by hyderabadi biryani as its... ahem.... tasteless in comparison :) 

We even tried to get home delivery next day but they only take min rs. 700 order which was a bit of a let down.

Ordered malai kebab, chicken biryani and kacchi mutton biryani. Personally liked the taste of chicken biryani more than the kacchi mutton biryani. The kacchi biryani was quite full of masala but didn't have any kewra water which the chicken biryani had. The chicken biryani was also quite moist and flavourful. Overall the taste was good but failed to blow me off. Will definitely go back to taste the daryabaad biryani.

Stuffs were courteous and service was very good. Ambience was lovely. We had ordered chicken reshmi kebab in starter, Awadhi biryani and Chicken butter masala in main course and Firni and shahi tukra in dessert.
Kebabs were so good in taste, soft and juicy. Biriyani was one of the best I have had in my life. Loved it. We wanted to try their Galouti Kebabs but we were so full that we could not. Firni was very good one of the best in kolkata. Shahi tukra was tasty but I loved the firni more. :)

On last Saturday evening, we decided to visit this place. The zomato score of 4.4/5 was inviting us for quite some time !¬†I had called to book table and I was¬†politely told that booking¬†is not needed and¬†we will get a seat even without booking.¬†We found paid¬†parking¬†space close by.The air conditioned dining place is in second floor but for aged people there is a lift. Interior is beautifully done. We started with gilawati Kabab which was served with a complementary parantha. Good, very close to the north indian standards but taste is bit hot and spicy. So those who donot like spicy and hot stuff should avoid this.¬†Next we¬†ordered a plate of chicken malai kabab for the child in the group and a kabab platter for rest of us. The kakab platter had 5/6 variety of kababs , two pieces of each item. It included prawn tandoori and mutton tikka as well. Once done we reordered the platter. At around 9.15 pm we wanted to order another plate of malai tikka but it was over. Being Saturday evening, which I felt is too soon a time for items getting exhausted. We settled down for Reshmi Kabab. But any day the malai tikka is juicier and softer than its counter part. Kababs were good, rather I must say very good. Now you may be wondering why 3.5 then ? Well we were disappointed with the main course. We ordered Awadhi Biriyani which was served in a earthen pot, having 4 medium sized mutton pieces and two medium sized potatoes. The mutton was uncooked. It was pretty hard. We reported the manager and he took back the 4th piece and replaced it . But the replacement was equally hard. Given the score of 4.4 I am not sure if it is always the same or the day we visited it happened. We had also ordered afgani chicken and laccha parantha. Parantha was layered and crisp but afgani chicken was disappointing, The¬†chicken was hard and fibrous, nowhere near the mouth melting experience of kababs. The salt in the dish was also high. Therefore I would advise to concentrate on kababs when you visit this place. By the time we reached desserts Sahi Tukra was¬†not available. We settled for Gajar Ka Halwa, which was average.¬†They serve mocktails¬†but ice-cream is not available now. ¬†For five adults and one kid the pocket pinch was around Rs.2,700.

Dear All 

I am writing  this while still sitting in the restaurant with the Firni in front of me!  It's a relaxed Sunday afternoon. So I being a Biriyani buff thought to give this " Highly recommend " restaurant a try. Now the important points! 

1. If you are one of those for whom " the glossy ambience" matters more than the authenticity of the food, you won't be disappointed! 

2. The staff is extremely courteous and the service is prompt. 

3. But sorry to disappoint you all guys the  "Biriyani" doesn't come any near to the old Calcutta charms namely Aminia, Shiraz,Arsalan,Rahmania! 

Their food is in between Okay and Good. But glossy or not Old is Gold!  I won't say today was a waste of money but definitely waste of enthusiasm and energy following the reviews of many!  Of course the food is a matter of personal taste.... But cummon guys!  The real Biriyani lovers would surely partly agree to what I wrote!  

N.B. I also have a recommendation for some real Biriyani lovers. Try Bedouin and Sher-E- Bengal at Gariahat more!  Not so glossy but real good food and price! The gloss lovers can yet try Oudh 1590 to somewhat get satisfied either way! Ciao!

Cheese Kebab was really a good start to our experience. It was nice and cheesy , a delight for cheese lovers. Chicken Biryani consisted of good quality rice and a nice piece of chicken with one piece potato as well. Shahi Tukra and Firni was the perfect icing on the top. Shahi Tukra is a must try , its awesome. Ambiance was one of the best in Kolkata and you can definitely have a nice evening here with your friends and family.

Service and ambience was also good, but as it's just beside the fancy market you might have to face some car parking problem.

This place is located in kidderpore near fancy market. This place is famous for its biryani. The ambience is good and the service is very prompt. The staffs are very courteous. Ordered Chicken Dopyaza, Daryabadi biryani, laccha paratha and firni. But unfortunately Daryabadi biryani was out of stock. So we ordered Special Mutton biryani. 
Now coming to the food, everything was so perfect. The biryani was perfectly cooked and the chicken dopyaza was just awesome. Last but not the least the best thing was Firni, it was so tasty.

Decent place had gone there for their famous kacchi biryani which I had heard a lot about but honestly found it to be horrible  and complete waste of money. I had even asked the guy whether it will be good or not and he insisted that it would be great.

This restaurant is located near the Fancy market in khidderpore. The restaurant has a good ambience and also serves good quality biriyani. The famous dish of this restaurant is Kachi biriyani which is a must try. The price is also very reasonable.

Finally had a wonderful lunch today at long time bookmarked India Restaurant. Its located just opposite Fancy market. The area is too much congested and it's a real pain if you have a car. Parking is a major issue. Apart from this rest are just perfect.  We went there to try their famous Kachhi biriyani. But such a poor luck that it got finished just a few minutes earlier. Another set back. But rest of the dishes are good enough to lift our mood.
Food Journey :
Tandoori Chicken : We started the journey with old schooled Tanduri chicken. It's juicy served with mind n curd chutney. Decent one.
Mutton boti kabab : Soft and tender 6 pcs of mutton chunks. Perfectly cooked.
Mutton Galawati Kabab with 1 complementary Luchnowi Paratha : It will give a strong fight to Oudhs one. We really liked the flavour. 
Mutton starters better than the chicken one.
Main courses:
Mutton awadhi biriyani: superb taste and aroma of spices with 4 small chunks of juicy mutton and potato. Dish is enough for 2 people. One of the best biriyani. 
Lachha Paratha and Chicken chap : Hardly this combination  can go wrong. 
Mutton fry : A rich gravy with 4 pcs of mutton. It's delicious.
All this with fresh lime soda and the journey ended with one of the best firni in town.
We are group of 10 people and all this costs us 4900 bucks. 
In a nutshell great ambience delicious food and pocket friendly restaurant. I would love to visit it again and again. But it would be great if management   do something about the parking!!!
Happy fooding!!

Good service. Awesome ambiance. Well mannered staffs. We had a nearbuy coupon. They served us galawti kebab, lucknowi paratha, special mutton biriyani, cold drinks. We ordered dal makhani, firni. And had gajar ka halwa from their ground floor counter. I liked all the food except the dal makhani. It was bland. Biriyani, galawti kebab and firni were really good to taste. Good experience.

Undoubtedly the best Biryani of Kolkata

India servers most delicious and huge range of Biryani in Kolkata. Galawati kabab is super succulent which comes with fine soft parathas. Special kacchi Biryani also known as Daryabadi Biryani is a show stopper. Perfectly cooked rice with giant portions of juicy mutton are unmatched with any other restro. But the potato was little bit hard which wasn't expected at all. Firni is okayish.
Elegant ambiance with majestic decor of India will definitely make your time n food more special. Coming back very soon and as always hungry for more.

Gone are the days when Aminia and Arsalan made the best biriyanis. Time does change and so does change the Don of biriyani-raj.
India restaurant might be that one kingpin in this Biriyani business.
They serve the best biriyanis in town hands down.
The ambience is royal, the servers courteous and the food excellent.
The biriyani is aromatic, with the right blend of spices and meat so tender you'll fall in love .
The kebab is melt-in-your mouth soft, delicious with perfect charring.
The darshan is one of the best I've had in Kolkata.
And the best thing of all, the prices on the dine-in menu is all inclusive of taxes.
So it doesn't rob you and gives you one of the best VFM mughal dining experiences.
Kudos to India Restaurant for keeping this stature and if they keep this excellent service going on, they'll be a name to be remembered.

I have been meaning to take my family here since a very long time. I found an opportunity to pick up food from there tonight. I tried the Daryabadi Biriyani, which is actually Kachhi Biriyani, but in larger portions (huge piece of potato and two fabulous pieces of mutton along with an egg). I have always believed that you need the ability and more importantly the inclination for acquiring new tastes if you are a real foodie and aspire to be a connoisseur. I found the taste to be stunning. It is different to your standard Kolkata Biriyani and very similar in taste to Hyderabadi Biriyani. The ambience is absolutely classy, even though I got to visit the non ac, non family section, since I was taking food away. It is an absolute must-not-miss for my food loving friends. Recommended strongly! They also make very tasty rolls. No nonsense menu; only chicken , mutton and paneer rolls, but very soft paratha and very tender meat.

Prime location. Courteous staff, well lit and well decorated interior and one of best biriyani makers in Kolkata ..that sum up what we call India restaurant. Went there for dinner tonight. And we ordered chicken hariyali kebabs and their famous awadhi biriyani...the kebabs were succulent meat chunks that melted in our mouth within seconds and then there came d show stopper ..the awadhi biriyani. The biriyani was served in a clay pot (handi) with two pieces of alu and 4 medium sized mutton pieces along with raita . When the biriyani was served ,all I could smell was d smell of ghee which had a tantalizing sensation on my taste buds. D biriyani was well cooked and it's d most richest biriyani I ever tasted in Kolkata till date.we ordered 2 thumbs up to gulp down d delicacies as well.

P.s. d biriyani is so rich and aromatic that if u prefer to hv light biriyani like Shiraz ,it's advisable not to go there and do injustice to their biriyani.coz biriyani hv feelings too....üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ

I remember my dad bringing 4 chicken biryani from this restaurant on some particular occasion. That had to be one of the best biryanis I have tasted.. There's a perfect blend of the spices..not too sweet nor too spicy. The potato was well boiled. All the packets had leg pieces. Which was a bonus. The chicken tasted good as well.

This place serves some of the best Mughlai food in Kolkata. We went on a Friday night. The decor and ambience of the place is very pleasing. We ordered Mutton biryani , chicken tikka kebab and Mutton galoti kebab. The Galoti kebab was simply amazing. It's definitely a must have. The biryani and chicken kebab were great as well. All these in a very considerate expense. 10/10 would visit again.

India Restaurant, Kidderpore

If you really want to know the meaning of transformation, you need to have visited India Restaurant in its early years and at the current time. What started out as a small outlet serving biryani and kababs has now turned into a plush, two storied fine dine restaurant. They have done up the place beautifully, and thankfully, the quality of the food has not dipped, in fact it felt that it had improved quite a bit from what my memories of childhood brought back. Maybe it was just the ambiance, cannot be completely sure!

Well, cutting back to the story, or rather the food, we started with the Mutton Gilawati Kabab and Chicken Peshawari Kabab. It must be mentioned that I consider Gilawati to be the best kabab in the country, and I am very apprehensive to have it outside Lucknow, lest it destroys my untarnished love for it. My experiences in Kolkata i.e. Oudh 1590 and Naushijaan had been average, but having read so much about the version at India Restaurant, I did go for it. We paired the kababs with a couple of Lucknowi Parathas. The Peshawari Kababs were the first to arrive ‚Äì chicken lollypops done in the tandoor with a white marinade, with malai and a hint of garlic. They were quite good, and helped fill up waiting space for the Gilawati. The parathas were very well-done, and were appropriately saved for their soulmate, which arrived in due time. The Gilawatis looked quite bigger than their Lucknowi counterparts, and my first bite was tentative and expectant. As it turned out, India Restaurant does know how to make these! The outer layer was crisp and caramelized, while the inside was a mash of mutton and lentils and papaya juice that just melts in your palette and creates magic. The taste was superb and it actually came very close to what I am used to having in/from Lucknow, even if the outer texture is a little different.

Recovering from the bliss, we ordered a Mutton Dariyabadi Biryani and Chicken Rezala for the mains. The Dariyabadi Biryani is nothing but Kachhi Biryani ‚Äì a version of the rice preparation made with raw mutton from the start. The biryani was excellent ‚Äì a little different from the usual Kolkata biryani, a little richer and the spice blend was not the usual one ‚Äì nonetheless it tasted superb. The mutton was the best part of it ‚Äì tender and falling from the bones on a little probe. The Rezala was awesome as well ‚Äì the gravy was rich and slightly sweet ‚Äì just the way I like it, and I drank some of the gravy like a soup, meting out the treatment a great Rezala gravy deserves. Of course, it was a little too rich to finish, and about half a bowl of gravy was whisked away on request before I could sip it all, and I daresay that meant a little less stress for my arteries. Anyways, it was a great great meal and I insist all folks in Kolkata travel to the port side of the city to give these guys a visit. Highly recommended.

Food: 
1. Galauti Kebab: probably the best in the city. Must have.
2. Lucknowi Paratha: paired with the galouti kebab this is a treat, although the paratha would be better thinner.
3. Mutton Awdhi Biryani: Served in a clay pot sealed with maida, this is a must try as well. The mutton pieces were soft, juicy and full of flavour.
4. India special chicken cheese kebab: Much much better than the cheese kebabs at arsalan. 
5. Mutton Chaap: Nothing that great, in hindsight I think the chicken chaap would have tasted better.
6. Garlic naan: The thick layer of chopped garlic on the surface is a little too much. Would be better if little bit was sprinkled on the naan instead of the thing layer.
7. Shahi Tukda: Not a fan of sweet things this dessert pleasantly surprised me. Less sweet and more creamy. Will always grab one whenever I visit.
Food: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5

After lot of persuasion visited this place last weekend.Very well decorated, well lit and clean dining hall on the 1st floor. Courteous staffs. Well groomed waiters.We ordered Chicken Hariyali Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Mutton Handi Biryani and Shahi Tukra.The Kebabs were juicy, succulent and perfectly cooked.The biryani was moist with ghee and perfectly spiced with 4 pieces of tender mutton and 2 aloo. Though I found the rose or kewra water to be a tad bit on the higher side.Shahi Tukra was perfectly moist and creamy with the right amount of sweetness.Highly Recommended!

If I have to chose the best in town galawat kebab I would say come to this place without any doubt. They serve one of the best kebabs in town and we got proven on the same. Today we hopped in for a casual lunch and to hover on the same we ordered The Mutton Galawat kebabs. The Galawats were completely mesmerizing as every piece is cotton soft melting in mouth but that's apart every meltdown was providing an aromatic flavor of grounded spices along with grounded meat and the best what I like is the portion of Luvknawi warqi paranthas served with the same is huge in size as compared to the same served in  Delhi NCR mughlai restos. Next on reviews we tried the Daryabadi biryani which is equally good and its a bridge between Pulao and Biryani with a pinch of sweetness and dry fruit spread. Mutton Peices were succulent and was cooked in yogurt spread with tenderness.Rice was OK types not to be compared with Shiraz and Arsalan. But overall its a good experience.

Ambience 4/4
Food          3/4 just due to oil part in biryani it was a little greasy.
Hospitality 4/4
Accessibility 4/4

Its really nice experience overall.

Mutton galoti : The best in the town. It is a very soft , juicy and comes with lucknowi paratha which enhances it's taste.

Daryabadi biryani : 1 daryabadi biryani is enough for 2 person. The biryani rice is perfect with 2 decent mutton pieces cooked to perfection but only negative  is it is sweet flavored and I personally love biryani to be spicy. 

Sahi tukra : Good decent piece and awesome taste. 

Chicken tandoori butter masala : delicious and tastes best with nan.

I Dont know why there is such a hype about this place.. Went over there during puja.. Ordered biriyani.. Got a big ugly HAIR in their food.. Then ordered chicken and mutton dish. In the chicken dish we got a feather.. And when we complained the waiter about this incident he told " OH SIR, MURGI KA BAAL HOGA ", gave  a sinister smile and went away.. He didn't even bothered to change the dish.. This is the food standard you maintain.. Such is the food you serve.. Who will take the responsibility if we get ill ? Totally unexpected and disgusting..
My request... DONT go over there.. There are many restaurants who serve far better food than them in terms of both quality and quantity...

What more do you want?And to that, very warm behaviour from the staff, I had to wait for close to 2 hours for a friend, and while I was seating outside in the waiting room, they insisted that i take a table inside without any order.This kind of hospitality is what drives them perfectly in a different zone. And yes, this was during the durga puja.Amazing is the word. Tawa chicken was good, but not great, so 4.5, but for a biryani, it would be a 5

Really this restaurant demands a visit only for its majestic ambience. Truly heck of a grandeur.
Food is good but not among the best. The kebab items were good but still price is bit too high, biryani is if not mediocre also not the best in the competition. Other gravy items which we tasted were just fine. So according to pricing they serve just fine but nothing extravagant in food.
Staff & service was also fine.
I would recommend to go with your family and have the majestic feel for once. Nothing special for college students, not value for money.

We just wait ....... 
When in Bill time one person came he tell he is a captains and asking for sorry for what happen but I follow that he was in restaurant when we placeing the order when we waite he still there but nothing...
Although good was alway delicious üòã .
You open a restaurant like five stars but still keep the service like dhaba..people not only come for food but also for service and service part was pathetic, your manager only sale but did bother about guest service..
So others I recommend go their only for food not for any thing.

Went to this highly recommended restaurant in the kidderpore area. The ambience was nice and the d√©cor was chic. Ordered the famous galawti kebab and chicken chatpata for the starters. We also ordered mojito slush and blue paradise. The kebabs were succulent. They also serve lucknawi paranthas alongside to make the dish even better. Chicken chatpata was average but the mint chutney was outstanding. With our expectations soaring, we went with the tawa chicken and kadai prawn for the main course. They have a wide range of breads and we chose kabuli nan, garlic nan and the evergreen tandoori roti. The main course was interesting and I found the flavours pleasantly different from the other tawa chickens I have had. The prawn dish was ordinary though and didn't like it. The breads were excellent. We finally topped this gastronomic experience with phirni and gajar halwa.
The experience was great. The portions they serve are good, especially the breads. A great place for mughlai cuisine 
Ambience - 4/5
Taste-4/5 ( galawti kebab is 10/5)
Service -3/5 ( the main course took 25 mins to arrive, though the waiter told this at the time of taking order)
Value for money -5/5 ( all this came out to be 400 per head)

My rating goes out only and only for their absolutely amazing gelawati kebabs. The best I've had in town. It is served with a big lachcha parantha which is good for two people. The minced marinated meat will simply melt in your mouth. We tried the biryani and mutton chaap after that and didn't find it to be up to the mark. 
Special mention about the decor, the entrance, the staircase and waiting area. Beautifully made.

Though I couldn't be there myself, but was fortunate to taste their biryani through an office order on the auspicious occasion of mahalaya. 
We ordered mutton biryani, chicken biryani, chicken tikka butter masala and firni. 
Taste: All of them were superb. Biryani tasted great and the chicken in the tikka masala was super soft. Last but not the least,  the firni was the best I ever had. 
Quantity : One biryani is sufficient for one person and one tikka masala is good enough for two people. 
Overall it was a great experience and I would love to taste more of their palatable dishes again. 
Highly recommended for biryani lovers. If you are bored with arsalan and aminia,this is the place for you!

Zomato recommendation for a marvellous North Indian experience landed me here...Don't let the chaos outside mislead you..once you step inside this place...the subtle tranquillity will relax you right away...quaintly sophisticated... With beautiful cheerful chrome  decor...i loved the decor...coming to the food,we went for the most celebrated preparation this eatery boasts of..The Daryabadi Biriyani...and also..The Galawti Kebab which came with two complimentary Lucknowi Parathas.The kebab is something which i will remember for the rest of my life...i never knew mutton can be prepared and had,in this fashion..The smokey flavor is something that will linger in your palate,long after...The Daryabadi is indeed a unique preparation..comes with a boiled egg,two generous pieces of mutton and cashew raisin studded aromatic rice..its simply a beauty...the portions are generous..and pocket pinch is unbelievably affordable...a must try...

A place quite easy to find and added with hospitality of its people is worthy to be appreciated. The food no doubt is highly praiseworthy. Mutton galawti kebab which comes along with freshly made paratha is too good to start with . The Daryabadi Biriyani is a speciality here and hence a must try. To top it up the prices are pocket friendly so worth having a reasonable luncheon out here.

One of the best places in Kolkata to have amazing biryani and kebabs. However, I have never eaten at the restaurant, and hence shall not be in a position to talk about the ambiance. Have ordered delivery/take outs on a number of occasions. Have sampled the chicken reshmi kabab, peshawari kababs, kasturi kabab, mutton galawti kabab, chicken bharta and mutton pasanda, apart from the special chicken biryani, mutton kachhi biryani and daryabadi biryani. Let me tell you, all the kababs are succulent, tasty and to die for. The gravy dishes are thick and yumm. But the biryanis absolutely steal the show. Succulent juicy pieces of meat, well done potato, and full bodied rice wonderfully spiced, the smell engulfing your senses every time. India Restaurant shall continue to be one of the best ones in terms of biryani for all times to come.

Located on the city outskirts, India restaurant takes pride in serving some mouth watering Mughlai Dishes. I chanced to taste their food in a delivered order at office and so couldn't enjoy their hospitality or ambience. The Mutton Biriyani was awsome and it was accompanied with a delicious Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. To round things off we had Firni and this was good too. I am ardent fan of ARSALAN but INDIA resturant has made its place by its side. I look forward to visit their restaurant and taste some more delicacies

Excellent biryani, probably the best in Kolkata today far surpassing those of older and more established restaurants. The chatpata kebabs are a delightful accompaniment either as snacks or with the biryani. The chicken chaamp is worth having. Waiting to try out the Galawti kebabs today and the Murg Mussallam one of these days.

If you want a taste of authentic Mughlai dishes of Lucknow this place must be on your list. The gelawti kebab just melts once you take a bite infusing all its flavours in your mouth. The dish to look out for is the Daryabadhi Biriyani. It is simply out of the world. 
The ambience and service is very good as well. All kolkatans must try out this place.

Few days back somebody commented on a facebook post of mine that the Biriyani from India Restaurant has lost its charm and I was like "excuse me! are you out of your mind or what"... however then I decided to revisit the place ( though I was there probably 2 months back and countless time before) ¬†and I am saying the same thing again without any doubt India Restaurant,Khiderpore is one of the best Biriyani joints in Kolkata for sure! Rest for those who think it is not worth having Biriyani there.... kuch toh log kange logo ka kaam hain kehna... choro bekar ki baton main..... Dariyabadi Biriyani at its best...Apart from the Kacchi Biriyani ¬†we had Chicken cheese Kebab, Tawa Chicken, Firni and Sahi Tukda ( one of the best item of their menu) there and their the Kebab apart from the Biriyani is worth tying for sure..

If you are looking for heavenly experience look no further. Their kucchi biriyani and gelawti kebab with laccha paratha is probably the only option you have in Kolkata. Ambience and decor is probably the best in mughlai. Staff behavior is very courteous and nice. The only off thing about the place is the location which no everybody will be comfortable with. This place is must visit for biriyani lovers.

Their biriyani smell and flavors are mouth watering. you will feel like eating on n on. And when it comes to kebab I haven't such suicy and flavored Tikka kebab and Tandoori ever in Kolkata at such affordable rates. I wish they come up with more branches like this.

I never eat biriyani without any side dish but here biriyani is sooo pleasant and satisfying you won't need any side dish.. We had cheese kabab and chicken pakoras as starter . Cheese was nothing out of ordinary but pakora was excellent .. Price is reasonable

I have no idea, why I had not stepped foot into India Restaurant sooner. It was my very first date with it and I could already find myself swooning at the smell of freshly made Biriyani right when I entered the main seating area. Location and Ambience:. Situated right beside Khidderpore, Fancy Market, the restaurant is beautifully set up and is an absolute contrast to the hot and sweltering condition outside. Blocking the traffic, the horns and the heat away, India restaurant has managed to pull together a beautiful ambience for its diners.

India Restaurant is like a lotus in a pond. Area isn't too great but the India Restaurant stands out. A excellent exterior and Great use of Light. Cool Entrance with a flight of Stairs. A swanky Waiting room on the 1st Floor. Can't tell you about the Ambience of the first floor Restaurant as we were guided to the 2nd Floor.
Tastefully done D√©cor when soft light. Now about the food We had ordered Galawati Kebab which came in 4 PC in a portion. Soft and Full of Flavors melts into the mouth. Then we were served Chicken Cheese Kebab. Awesome it's their Signature Dish. Tandoori Aloo was great. Heading to main Course. We had Ordered Chicken Biryani and Mutton Biryani. Served Hot and Portion meant for 2People. Love aroma and We'll blended Spices. We also Ordered Kali dal which was ok. Paneer Butter Masala  good. Indian Bread Nan and Tandoori Roti. Dessert Shahi Tukra was over so we opted for Phirni. Excellent and not too sweet. If I had to rate it on food and Ambience. I would give it a 7/10. Service they have to pick up. They Lack there. Overall beautiful Experience. Must Try.

If you are a Bengali, you must have heard the term ‚Äògobor-e padmaful‚Äô, I won‚Äôt take the pain to elaborate the meaning which is pretty clear to every Bengali, but if you are not a Bengali then let‚Äôs put it pretty bluntly for you ‚Äì this place called ‚ÄòIndia Restaurant‚Äô somewhat stands in debris, in a pretty unruly environment filled in with chaos and in a not-so-clean locality of Fancy Market, Khidirpore. In the last few months it has undergone some civil ‚Äòplastic surgery‚Äô work which has made it look like the ‚ÄòShilpa Shetty‚Äô of Biriyani Houses in the town :) So, you can‚Äôt really ignore her!

Jokes apart, the interiors of India Restaurant are now simply stunning. It feels as if you are at some mansion in Dubai and you are at some party or dawat maybe, hosted by some super wealthy Sheikh! From the moment you enter this place you notice super clean marble flooring with embedded motifs and walls with lining of glowing signature tiles. The strategically lighted circular false ceiling designs have become quite a trademark of this place by now. If you climb up the stairs and reach second floor, you get to see more of the building and you‚Äôll discover it being immensely well-maintained, clean, brightly lit with an ultimate glittery finish that leaves you overwhelmed. From Interior decoration point of view, the place gets full marks for all that royal finish, no doubt about that. Seating arrangements are well spaced out and the chairs and couches are very comfortable as well.

But this multi-storied glittery pot of gastronomical gems is quite hard to commute, and it is really tricky to find a proper place to park your car at this place. So the only saving grace is the abundant availability of Uber or Ola, but then I am not sure if I will take that pain to take a cab and come down all the way, traveling the entire breadth of the city just to have a plate of biriyani! Well, I used to think like this unless I learnt about the range of biriyanis they serve and their characteristic flavors. And after I saw some latest pics of this place, I decided to pay them a visit sometime very soon. But still it got delayed, due to the odd location of this place and the poor parking facility. Finally, the day came when I had to make it to India Restaurant since some of the food bloggers from Panchphoron (including me) were invited to this place by their management. So as pre-decided, I took a cab and reached the place on a super-gloomy day for lunch. I was quite astonished to discover the volume of crowd dining at this place on that weekday late-afternoon in such an unpleasant weather outside. The footfall surely indicates the quality of food being served at this place, so I became more hopeful about the food and expectations kept on building!

Now without wasting any further precious words of mine, let‚Äôs delve deep into the food talk where the crux of the matter lies! So, here are the items which I had tried at this place -

MOCKTAIL

a) Virgin Mojito ‚Äì I had heard the mocktails served at this place are amazing, but sadly most of the mocktails were not available that day. Apart from the North Indian or Mughlai fare they also put equal amount of importance on mocktails and infact on every dish which they serve. In fact the simple Virgin Mojito was too refreshing to be true! The sweet balance was perfect, just a bit lemony with a dash of mint, packed with crushed ice and heavily refreshing! And yes, the presentation was simple yet appetizing with slices of lemon and cherry on top. Surely you can try this out here.

STARTERS

a) Chicken Cheese Kababs ‚Äì These are deep brown colored kebabs with a smooth outer texture and were quite fragrant to elevate your appetite. The chicken pieces in there were very soft and it clearly shows how well they were marinated. As the name goes, it was quite cheesy and had a mild spiciness to it; also it was cooked in tandoor to perfection thus locking all the juices inside.

b) Mutton Galawati kababs ‚Äì Well, if you have already tasted Oudh‚Äôs Galawati kebabs then you might be tad disappointed here, but still I must say these are close competitors to Oudh‚Äôs Galawati. Here at India, the texture of the meat paste (which is really creamy and having a dash of zafran in it) was perfect. It looked nice with those flattened meat ball structures. It tasted nice with those thin layered paranthas which were served along with it. But the stuff was tad overdone with the outer skin showing evidences of it, having few hardened or rather burnt spots.

c) Pineapple Tandoori ‚Äì The stuff tasted awesome, to start with. The large slices of pineapple were very well cooked in tandoor after it was marinated with lemon juice and spices for hours. The final product had all the juices of the pineapple locked inside it, that was fresh and succulent as it should be and tasted awesome with that sweetness of pineapple, tanginess of the spices and that smokiness coming after it got tandoor-ed. Awesomeness redefined!

MAINS¬†

a) Daryabaadi Biriyani ‚Äì The main course had five variants of biriyani, and Daryabaadi Biriyani was the one we tasted first. This Daryabaadi biriyani has a very typical taste which you can‚Äôt judge or comment without tasting it, it is unlike all other variants. The aroma was so unique and pleasant. Daryabadi Biriyani is surely the signature dish of India Restaurant and it has got fragrant mildly spicy flaky rice, sweet potato and super soft juicy piece of meat! Together they taste awesome! Must try!

b) Kachhi Biriyani ‚Äì Again a gem of a dish served with all its honesty and subtle flavors in one amazing plate. Here they put layer of raw marinated meat on a layer of raw basmati rice before they are cooked together. The also have the spices and the a yogurt based marinade layer at the bottom, here they also add the sweet potatoes, these layered structure is now left to cook in slow pace in its own steam. The kachhi biriyani overall has a yellowish color and a very subtle flavor, nothing too aromatic or flavorful, the subtle aroma which it has got is beautiful and majestic. The mutton pieces are extremely well cooked and literally melt in your mouth!

c) Awadhi Biriyani ‚Äì The Awadhi biriyani was served in the earthen handi in which it was cooked. It tasted just amazing to be honest. We were almost lost in that strong aroma of ghee and zafran. This method of slow cooking in the dum pukht style where you seal the handi with wheat dough always locks the awesome flavors and drives the biriyani enthusiasts and foodies crazy when the dough is removed and the lid is opened, the same thing happened with us as well! And somehow we ended overeating this gem of a dish for its rich yet subtle flavors and insanely good aroma! Must try!

d) Chicken and Mutton Biriyani ‚Äì There were separate plates of Chicken Biriyani and Mutton biriyani which were so called cooked in ‚Äònormal‚Äô style and these are the ones that we have most of the times from all the biriyani shops or houses. These were nice as well, nice aroma, not too oily and the meat pieces were well cooked.

Overall, I will rate India Restaurant close to 8.5 out of 10 for its authentic, amazing flavorful biriyanis and the variants which are available under one roof; not to forget the awesome ambiance and friendly service. Only the location and the communication is bit of a headache which I guess can‚Äôt be cured so easily. So, to sum it up if you haven‚Äôt yet tried India and you are a Biriyani lover then you are surely doing something wrong, this is a place you should never ever miss if you are in Kolkata. If possible try their Daryabaadi, Awadhi and Kachhi Biriyanis which you won‚Äôt get at every Biriyani shop, they are really well prepared and are amazing. Hopefully you will enjoy your meal here, it has got loads of potential to satiate your taste buds, so make sure you reach the place before the wheat dough is removed and the lid gets opened :)

Cheers!
                                          ...

If there is any food paradise it has to be this. Awadhi food at its best with Kolkata touch. This review I know doesn't mean anything to the people who have already tasted their food and know how awesome it is. So I would quickly list my preference whenever I visit which I do quite regularly as I stay nearby a) Biryani b) Kachi Biryani c) Cheese Kebab. One more important thing with the 2 new floors they have added it takes the ambience and service to a higher level.

India Restaurant is one of the oldest Mughali eateries in Kolkata, famous for their biryani and kababs. It‚Äôs around six months back that the place has been renovated and the present decor is absolutely stunning. In a crowded place close to Khidderpore fancy markert, India restaurant is like an oasis in a desert. One won‚Äôt even think of a place as classy and elegant as India over there. The main disadvantage is the transportation and improper location of India restaurant. But, I can actually assure you, that once you reach this place, the food, the ambience and everything else would make it worth and you would definitely curse yourself for not being here before and would plan all your upcoming visits here.

If you‚Äôre a biryani and kebab lover then you have to visit this joint. the word biryani is an Urdu word which derived from Persian language.different places different types biryanis like mughlai cuisine,awadhi cuisine. basically there are two types of biryani one is pakki means cooked another one is kacchi known as raw.both of them have their own specialities.in pakki biryani cooked meat and cooked rice both are layered but in kacchi biryani raw marinated meat is layered with raw rice before being cooked together. apart from non-vegetarian biryanis now vegetable biryanis also very popular like dum biryani or paneer biryani. recently i was invited by the india restaurant management with my fellow foodies to try some lovely lip-smacking biryani‚Äôs and kebabs. located in khiderpore area.where the flyover ends follow that road and you will find that place in the left hand side. ambience was lovely and the interior just extremely well maintainted. very much spacious and lovely seating arrangement along with sofas and chairs.decorated with awesome lighting effects which i really liked.come to food part we had varities of kebabs and biryanis.we started our lunch session with a lovely glass of mocktail,after that we had some lovely dishes started with,

One of the most reputed biriyani makers in town.
The prices are too low to be true and yes they are indeed very cheap compared to the food quality.

Does not have much of an ambience but you should go to this place only for the food frankly speaking.
The kebabs are a treat. I would recommend not to go for the Shahi Tukda if you are not a fan.

The special and exclusive attraction here is their Kachchi Biriyani which is a must try out.

For quite a long time now, I was itching to try out the new renovated India restaurant, having heard rave reviews from fellow foodies and friends alike. After a few failed attempts, I finally managed to visit this place a couple of days back and had a gastronomic experience to savor.¬†

Located right beside the kidderpore fancy market this place has been serving up decent Biryani and North Inidan food for a long long time. This was my first visit to this place after it has undergone what seemed like a major makeover. The place has a non ac section downstairs and an ac one in the first floor. The moment you enter the stairs it seemed like a world far far away from the busy,crowded and not-so-sophisticated locality. The majestic interiors with comfortable seating arrangements almost seemed to recreate the grandeur the Mughals were known for.¬†

Coming to the food, we ordered a chicken malai kebab, galouti kebab, daryabadi biryani and mutton chap. The chicken malai kebab arrived first. The chicken was nice, tender and very well marinated. The ¬†cheese and curd used to marinate the chicken balanced the spices beautifully. The galouti kebab was up next and it was simply mind blowing. One of the best I have had in quite a while. They were wonderfully succulent and rich and full of flavors. It was served properly with a side of very well done thin and crisp parathas. I liked the fact that they served the galoutis with the parathas and did not make one order the parathas separately as many places tend to do. The Daryabadi biryani which is one of their signatures was again beautifully done. It was not very rich yet had a brilliant blend of flavorful spices. The mutton and also the rice were cooked to perfection. The mutton chap was also one of the better versions of the very popular dish that i have tasted in a while. We finished off our meal with a shahi tukra and a firni. The shahi tukra was nice with the flavor and color of the saffron coming to the fore.¬†

The service was swift and the staff nice and courteous. The price tag was quite reasonable considering the quality of the food.

Overall we had a delightful experience here and would surely go back for more. Great authentic food, lovely glamorous ambiance and with a reasonable pocket pinch- I mean what more can one ask for?
Enjoy!¬†
Cheers! :)

AWESOME - to describe in one word. India restaurant serves one of the best biriyani in Kolkata.
The ambience is elegant with nice decor. We ordered Chicken cheese kabab , chicken chatpata kabab as starter..Their cheese kabab is a revelation. Chatpata kabab was ¬†tasty as well.
For main course , we had mutton biriyani with chicken reshmi butter mashala. Biriyani was mindblowing but reshmi butter mashala was okayish.¬†
Finished our lunch with Shahi tukda and Firni..Both were descent but nothing exceptional.

Food : 4.5/5¬†

This is one place that serves amazing mutton biryanis. Their Daryabadi Biryani is of course the star of the show. I like their Mutton Kachchi Biryani too. I am yet to try their Awadhi Biryani, though. The biryanis have melt in the mouth mutton, sublime spices and are quite good in quantity for the price charged.

Their kebabs are good too - I have only tried mutton gilawati and mutton burra.

I don't think I have tried any other chicken dishes - with such good mutton preparations, who needs chicken? :)

I am also a diehard fan of their firni and shahi tukda. Both the desserts are great, and after a biryani, it is a pity that I can only eat any one of them.

I tried their haleem during the season, and it was the best that I have had in Kolkata.

I haven't tried their ¬†Chinese dishes yet. I guess whenever I go to this place, I cannot think beyond the biryanis.

The service at the restaurant is top notch.

The only reason I have dunked half a star is because of their mutton curries - they are good, but not as lipsmacking as the biryanis, and hence they pull the rating down a notch.

My first experience of this restaurant was the mutton  haleem  some time back .. I got it parcelled and it was delicious .. The consistency was just right with a perfect blend of the spices, meat and lentil..
   So I wasn't disappointed when I went to eat there.. I had mutton biryani, some chicken stew and firni and all under 1000 rupees which I thought was a good deal..
If you go through their menu, you'll see that there are many options ..the interior is nice and welcoming though the drive to that area can be maddening ...

My 4 points go out to the biryani which was amazingly flavoured and well blended. Chicken was tender and good too. Firni and the parathas were also good. However butter masala was little disappointing. Will be reordering Biryani from there soonüëçüëå

casual general dining restaurant. unexpectedly gorgeous and clean interiors. food is no doubt always great here. service however is bit casual and hugely lacks professionalism. needs a lot of work on this.

I was eager to hv a Kachhi biryani. I took an appointment over phone to redeem a Nearbuy voucher. reached the restaurant and inquired if Kachhi biryani was available, so that I could buy and redeem the Nearbuy voucher. the waiter confirmed that it's available, but told me that I cannot purchase the voucher in the restaurant. it had to be purchased at least an hour before redemption. I argued on that since no such condition is applicable. the waiters should be given clear instructions by the management regarding promotions and offers. anyways, the waiter finally agreed and redeemed the Nearbuy voucher.

After few minutes, he comes and tells me that Kachhi biryani is not available and he can serve me normal mutton biryani. since the voucher was already redeemed, I had no option but to agree. they should have checked before redeeming the voucher. utterly unprofessional and huge disappointment. bad luck with Kachhi biryani.

It is the best biriyani i have ever tasted.. The rice is so soft.. The mutton is so tender.. And just when you think it can not get any better you will find a cashew nut to make you feel like heaven..... Wow.. I usually prefer biriyani with some gravy but with this one i never felt like having a gravy... And yes we also had kababs which were also great... And almost forgot the ambience is very very very elegant.. With Niladri Ghosh and Laxmikanta Baskey..

I have no idea, why I had not stepped foot into India Restaurant sooner. It was my very first date with it and I could already find myself swooning at the smell of freshly made Biriyani right when I entered the main seating area. 

Location and Ambience:

Situated right beside Khidderpore, Fancy Market, the restaurant is beautifully set up and is an absolute contrast to the hot and sweltering condition outside. Blocking the traffic, the horns and the heat away, India restaurant has managed to pull together a beautiful ambience for its diners. 

The Food:

While the ambience is beautiful, the service will make you happy, the main thing that pulls you back to this restaurant again and again is definitely the food. We ordered a whole bunch of things and were highly pleased with Almost everything. 

For the first course, we ordred-
- Chicken Chatpata Kebab and
- Mutton galawati kebab

While both the kebabs were exceptionally made, the Galawati had to be the favourite. It came with a huge Lucknawi Paratha on the side and was a sheer delight to eat. I could not have been more pleased. The chicken kebabs were on wings and lived up to their name.

For the main course, we moved onto-
-¬†¬† ¬†Kachi biriyani,
-¬†¬† ¬†Awadhi biryani,
-¬†¬† ¬†Dum ka Murgh
-¬†¬† ¬†Fresh Lime Sodas

The only point of disappointment in the main course was the fresh lime soda, but that was hardly the concern. While the kacchi biriyani was excellent, I have hardly any words to describe the Awadhi. It came out of a freshly dum bhara hua, earthen pot and was the sealed top was released right in front of us. The steam escaping the pot was enough to make me go weak in my knees and my stomach. With renewed energy, we tucked into the second batch of biriyani, accompanied by the beautifully luscious Dum ka Murgh, which could go equally well with a bread.

Yes, we moved onto desserts to. For desserts we ordered-
-¬†¬† ¬†The shahi Tukra and
-¬†¬† ¬†The Firni

The shahi tukra was an absolute disappointment for me. I hardly had more than a spoon of it and quickly settled for the Firni. Oh My God, nothing could have managed to end the meal on a better note than the firni itself.

In case that you are planning to visit this legendary eatery soon, make sure you order the Awadhi biryani, the Galawati kebab and of course the Firni.

Khidderpore area is famour for briyani. INDIAN RESTAURANT, in khidderpore is conveniently located.
The interior design of this place is inexplicable. Persion decoration, Persian art will give you a feel of Mughal days. 

We ordered Chicken chatpata, Halim, Butternun, Daryabadi briyani and Shahi tukda.

Halim is better in Aliah than this place but we ordered as it was Ramzan month special dish. 

But Daryabadi briyani will makefoodies die for it...it has dry fruits and two large mutton pieces to fill your stomach. Just plunge into it. As for desserts, Shahi tukda was a good one. Price is a bit on the higher side but it will satisfy your pocket after the food and interiors.

I always think Kolkata biryani places work like sine curves. Sometimes, this one's better. Sometimes, that one's better. But, if you want really awesome Biryani everytime, head towards this place!
The upstairs is refurbished and is fully decked up now. We got mutton and chicken Biryani (divine!) and a mutton galauti kebab (which came with paratha). 
We were too full to order dessert, as these places have rich food usually. Prices were inclusive of tax and we left as happy people.

This place was in my bucket list for a long time. Finally I made it. Yes, this place truly makes your day. Started with Galawati Kabab, complemented with lukhnowi paratha, cooked till ultimate perfection has literally taken me to the heritage of Lukhnow. Then we had Fish tikka kabab. The basa fish was fresh. Nothing to complain about. Then we had Daryawadi Biriyani. The Biriyani was on sweeter side, but good. We had tandoori rotis with mutton stew and chanp. The rotis were fluffy and fresh. Didn't like the gravy of mutton stew but the muttons were very tender and juicy. Mutton chanp was not up to the expectations. None could really ever beat Royal's special mutton chanp. Anyway, ended the trip with firni as usual. Overall a decent experience. Would definitely try from their kababs and biriyanis next time.

I have only one word for this restaurant : FABULOUS!!

There are numerous restaurants in Kolkata serving various biryanis and India restaurant, Khidderpore surely stands tall amidst them.

Visited this restaurant few days back and was instantly stumped by its decor and ambience...the staffs were courteous and guided us as soon we entered the magnificent 1st floor food court...we ordered the highly recommended chicken cheese kebab, chicken and mutton biryani, shahi tukra and firni...service was lightning fast...the break up of my rating is as follows:

chicken cheese kebab: 5/5

biryani: 3.5/5

firni: 4. 5/5

shahi tukra: 5/5

service: 4.5/5

ambience and decor: 5/5

The final surprise came when we saw that prices were inclusive of taxes...

It was certainly a royal experience...cant wait to visit again!!!

Warm welcome by guards and staffs. Ambiance is good.
We ordered:
* 2 plates of mutton biriyani
* chicken archari
* green salad
* 2 tandoori roti
* 2 phirni
Chicken Archari with big 4 pieces and masala gravy was good in quantity and quality..After a long time My taste buds met one of gr8 MUTTON BIRYANI in kolkata...uff kya swad kya taste..yummilicious

India Restaurant is an epitome of fine tasting Biriyani and other Mughlai dishes. It had been in my bucket-list for long and though I savored their Biriyani and Firni through home/office deliveries, but I took the journey to the Kidderpore outlet sometime ago. The best way to go is to look for Fancy Market and then cross it while staying in the opposite side and reach the next traffic signal. And India is on your left side.

The sit-in options have been hugely revamped. Earlier it was in a small room towards the end of the ground floor. But now they have taken up the entire building and remodeled the 1st/2nd and 3rd Floors (I sat on the 2nd floor, so wont know a lot about the ambiance and decor of the other floors). The ambiance is new and fresh, the waiters courteous, the sitting is spacious and soothing.

Once you settle down, you read through the Menu Card which has taken up a makeover as well. Inadvertently, the order had Daryabadi Biriyani (they hail from Daryagunj in Lucknow and hence the name Daryabadi), Galauti Kabab, Kakori Kabab and Firni. The kebabs were perhaps the best I have had in Kolkata. I mean after tasting kababs at Peshawri (ITC Sonar Kolkata) and Oudh 1590 (Deshapriya Park), the ones from India were smooth and the best in a long long time. The unmistakable biriyani was next and its taste was the most impressive of its contemporaries (the Arsalans, Shirazs and the Aminias). Last but not the least the Firni was mind blowing too and it was a perfect ending to a sumptuous meal.

Overall a big thumbs up to the owners for exposing Kolkatans to this paradise of Mughlai cuisine - India Restaurant.

India Restaurant ‚Äì Refurbished as 300 seater royal restaurant.
=====
Intro + Location:

India Restaurant is located in Kidderpore near the shahi mahal or say, fancy market. It was quite small earlier but now they have reconstructed the whole place and made it a 300 seater restaurant. This restaurant has been famous for its mughlai delicacy such as mutton daryabadi biriyani since quite a long time. I had been here with one of my friend and I was quite mesmerised by the ambiance. It felt quite royal and exquisite. The staffs were quite courteous and friendly and provided us with the menu when we took our seats. I really liked the interiors as well as the hospitality offered by the staff/steward of India Restaurant. It had been on my wishlist since a long time and I am quite glad to finally visit this place when it‚Äôs well furnished.
=====

What we ordered:

‚Ä¢ Two Chicken Biriyani ‚Äì The biriyani was fine and tasted nice. It costed 180 bucks per plate and I found it reasonable if we take into consideration all the factors inclusive of the ambiance. The aloo was perfectly boiled and the rice was flavourful. The chicken‚Äôs marination can be improved but it was cooked to perfection. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Coke with Lemon ‚Äì It was just ordinary coke with lemon wedge to present. The restaurant can still work on improving the presentation.
=====
Meal for two: 450-700 approximate
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Ambiance

‚Ä¢ Hospitality

‚Ä¢ Cleanliness and hygiene is well maintained in this restaurant.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ The chicken biriyani was not the best I have had. There still lies scope of improvement.
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation 3.6/5

Food Quality 3.7/5

Food Quantity 3.7/5

Taste 3.8/5

Hospitality 3.9/5

Ambiance 4.3/5

Hygiene 4/5

Value for money 3.9/5
=====
Expert Suggestions:

‚Ä¢ The chicken marination can be improved. Rest all is well.
=====
Conclusion:

I would love to revisit it again to try their mutton dishes and biriyani as it‚Äôs their unique selling point. The best part about this place is that it has a waiting area specially designed for their customers so that they can sit and have a gala time rather than stand and keep waiting and get annoyed and paranoid.

Went there with a colligue for their famous Kacchi Biriyani. Along with biriyani we had Reshmi Chicken Kabab and Cold Drinks. The kababs were superb. Kacchi biriyani was too spicy and heavy for my liking. The ambiance was really great and the service was also very very good. Will visit more to try out their normal biriyani and other dishes.

My maiden visit to this joint was motivated by outstanding reviews on Zomato by my fellow foodies.And truth be told, i was floored by the ambience,staff behaviour,decor,hygiene and the food of course.
Visited the joint yesterday in the early afternoon . The first floor dining area was almost empty with just a couple of diners at a faraway corner.Was attended to immediately by the courteous staff.
Ordered the mutton kacchi biryani,chicken biryani and chicken tawa.Firstly the mutton kacchi biryani was quite different as compared to the traditional biryani that we have ¬†in Kolkata.The difference is that in kacchi biryani raw(kacchi) meat is cooked together with the rice. Thus the name kacchi biryani.In case of traditional(pakki) biryani the meat is cooked separately and then mixed in the rice.This birynai is more famous in Dhaka and is slightly more wet and spicier as compared to pakki biryani. I liked it immensely.Quantity is huge with a large fleshy piece ¬†of mutton,gigantic piece of potato and boiled egg.The chicken biryani was also very good with right amount of moistness and spices.Quality of rice used was also top-notch.
The tawa chicken comprised of six medium sized cubes of boneless chicken in a thick yellowish gravy garnished with slices of onion,tomato an capsicum.Slightly on the oilier side as expected in a Mughlai joint.
Prices are reasonable and inclusive of all taxes.Thus no complex calculations and brainstorming on the rationale of various taxes levied on dining out.:) Cheers!!!! H

This restaurant is located just beside the Fancy Market. The restaurant is too good. The ambience is just perfect (not of the non-ac paet definitely). I had biriyani and chicken reshmi kababs. The kababs were really vey good. The biriyani was great too but a bit oily. But it's a must visit. ‚ù§

India restaurant, khidderpore
Was in my wish list for a long time.. so went there on a rainy day. Warm welcome by guards and staffs. Ambiance I must say it is like 3 star hotel with clean and tidy washroom. 
We ordered:
* 2 fresh lime soda
* 2 plates of chicken biriyani
* mutton rara punjab
* green salad 
      Lime soda was absolutely refreshing but the biriyanis were too hot I didn't find it tasty. But the mutton rara Punjab was good with big 4 pieces and masalas.. good in quantity and quality.. service is good and fast..

Hands down to this legendary outlet. This was a six months planned visit to this restaurant along with my friends. Ambiance is classy and elegant. The way they staffs welcomed us to towards our seat was very much courteous. We ordered Chicken Cheese Kebab for starters, Chicken and Mutton Biriyani for main course, Firni and Shahi Tukda for desserts. The food arrived within 5 mins, which proves their complete prompt service. Kebab was the best I have had till now and the Biriyani tasted good and quantity was good too specially the mutton piece was amazing and Firni and Shahi Tukda was awesome. Then the most shocking and surprising thing was the bill, we are amazed to see that the prices on the menu were all inclusive of tax. Such less priced food from such a classy place is quite unexpected.

I have been to this place few times. First went with a friend who stays in khidirpur. As we entered this place it was like entering a 5 star hotel and after getting impressed by the ambience was left speechless with the the awesome folding served by the restaurant. That biryani , muttonchaap , laccha paratha was awesome. The staffs were very good at behavior and the service is also fast. I try not to miss a chance to go there. One should go to try the food served by them and review it yourself.

It was rainy sunday we headed out for having kacchi biriyani and we did feast our taste buds with this amazing biriyani. Staying at kolkata everybody should try this out. Its flavour and aroma was too good and i loved it. Cons- by mistake our waiter gave us chicken biriyani instead of kacchi biriyani.But it was okay and all well at last.

What to say about this place, the biggest restaurant I have ever visited in my life. A four stored building with a five star hotel ambience and with near around 300 seating capacity. For the ambience five out of five. India Restaurant who is known for his North Indian Cuisines didn't disappoint me at all. The Service was outstanding, within 10 minutes the food was served. Now coming to the food, we ordered 2 chicken biryanis and 2 mutton biryanis, chicken cheese kebab, firni and shahi tukra. The biryani was one of the tastiest biryanis I ever tasted. The chicken was juicy and soft, on the other hand the potato was well cooked. Now coming to the kebabs, this cheese kebabs was probably the best kebabs I ever had. Now coming to the deserts the firni and the shahi tukra both were quite similar in taste but honestly they snatched more 0.5 ratings from me otherwise I was thinking to settle at 4. So for me its 4.5 Stars and they deserve this. And a big thank you to Zomato for their valuable food menu suggestions.

dead fly in Chicken Special Biryani from India restaurant¬†

yesterday i had Chicken Special Biryani from here as they are Featured in Legendary Outlets, Ramzan Specials - Haleem and Brilliant Biryanis Collections but to my bad luck , surprise or what should i say? :/ i found a dead fly in my biryani :/ ( check the image where i marked with red circle )¬†

no doubt the biryani was good but was not awesome also! the quantity was pretty less compared, as it was a special one!! there were hardly any chicken on the chicken pieces but the chicken was melting in my mouth... the egg and alu was good too... and the biryani was bit spicy..¬†

service was awesome within 1 minute we got the order means in total it took 2mins for all...¬†

it's a very popular restaurant it was full crowded but health and hygiene is my first priority!!! ¬†could rate 3.5 but as health and hygiene comes first i will rate India restaurant 1 out of 5 !!¬†

was so hungry that i eventually ate the whole biryani just by throwing the fly :3¬†

PS dont know if its for biryani or not my stomach is still aching!!!

One of the best biriyani and mughlai food outlet of kolkata... Be it their mutton galauti kebab, kabuli naan or mutton awadhi biriyani.. All just melts in your mouth... Food is extraordinarily tasty, authentic and not overpriced at all... Situated within the chaotic fancy market, this place definitely surprises you once you get in. The royal decor may make u feel u r having ur meal in some grand palace of mughal era.. The staffs are cordial and courteous.. A visit to this place will definitely make a pleasant experience for you.

This is my first review on Zomato only based on a home delivery, because the food was that good! Placed an order for lunch and they delivered well before the estimated 50 minutes, being approx. 5 Km away from my home. Food was amazing, I was blown away by the price and quality of the food. Its hard to find restaurants like this that offer such good value for money. Their Biriyani, Butter Chicken and Finni are now among my new favourites and I would definitely suggest others to try it.

As halim special ws going on we ordered chicken chatpata,¬† butter nan, halim, daryabadi biriyani, shahi tukda, firni. except for halim every other thing was damn awesome to taste. i have had biriyanis in delhi ,bhubaneshwar and lots of other places in kolkata also. but this daryabadi was out of the world.i would have rated 5 stars but the halim was a bit dissapointed. but otherwise thumbs up india restaurant team for the service and the quality of food. hoping to visit again.

I have heard A LOT of good things about this place and had the chance to taste food from here today. 
We got mutton haleem delivered here today from a offer on nearbuy. The quantity per box is way too much for 2 people. Loved the look of the dish. This was the first time I had haleem. The mutton pieces were chunky and a lot of small pieces were there. 
Seasoning was a bit less but that can be adjusted.
Waiting to visit this place and gorge on the kebabs and biryani.

My review is based on zillion take aways from this place. They specialize in mughlai cuisine and my suggestion is if you stick with that you will have a delightful experience. Their mutton biryani is my favourite, though not a fan of their signature kachi biryani. They are also a house of authentic awadhi kababs. The kakori and galawti kabab are completely melt in your mouth kind of experience. N one last tip don't miss their firni.

Initially I used to hear a lot about this place,  especially the praise for their biryani was unequivocal!
So I went to give it a try and trust me I can easily say that it's one of the best biryani that I ever had.
The cheese kebab served just blew me off, the thick layer of tender cheese covering the juicy chicken is something you should never miss. We also ordered Mutton Rezala which was also very good.

so after many recommendations from friends, decided to give this place a try. drive all the way from salt lake to khidderpore. took about 45 mins. getting a spot for parking is abit of hassle but not impossible. ambience is nice tad noisy as its a busy place. reached @ 9.30pm and had to wait another 20 mins for a spot.all is good till now. in comes the waiter and no matter what we think of ordering, he keeps suggesting that it would take a while.
inspite of that we ordered a kebab platter which was not dissapointing but not that great as well. next we thot of diving into aome biriyanis, but all special biriyani and kacchi biriyani were out of stock. on asking the waiter why so, got a somewhat rude reply that if u have to eat those stuff u better come early like 7 or 8 pm. well then we decided to have some bread and chicken delicacies. we ordered some butter roti,tandoori roti, butter naan , chicken bharta, chichken afghani. food looked nice but tasted tasteless. bharta is usually cooked with shredded chicken but this one is cooked with chicken pieces and the afghani was horrible. chicken was so rigid and rubbery. god knows how i ate those. next comes in firni which was ok...not the best not bad as well.thats about it. wont visit there again thats for sure. and i recommend arsalan/royal rather than this guy.

I have never been there. But i had their mutton kacchi biriyani and chicken cheese kababs from a biriyani food festival. I never had kacchi biriyani before. And i heard india restaurant is famous for its kacchi biriyani. May b i am wrong but the kacchi that i got was very sweet with full of cashew nuts and rasin. But the chicken cheese kababs were delicious. May be i got the wrong biriyani due to food festival rush. Anyways i am looking forward to have more from this resto.

I always boasted of Arsalan having the best biryani in Kolkata until I visited this place today. My brother had the mutton biryani while I had the chicken special biryani. We also had chicken chaanp. The portion sizes were great and price was reasonable. The biryani was as good (if not better) than the one in Arsalan or other more famous places that boast of serving the "best Kolkata biryani"....The one thing that stood out about this place is the ambience. The staff is courteous...the restaurants are well-lit, spacious...service is great. We were served on-time and we enjoyed our food!

The only trouble one may have is finding parking in that area...but other than that, it is going to be a lovely experience! A good place to go visit with family and friends!

a biryani lover like me can do nything to explore some good places. so bunking my gate forum class with my friends i went KIDDERPORE to taste the biryani of this place. it took 50 minutes to reach that place from belgachia(my home palce) so at 12 o clock in a winter noon we entered this place. not very classy ambiance but who needs that for a quality biryani. We ordered¬† mutton biryani, special chicken biryani and the most attractive biryani of that palce: KACCHI BIRYANI. believe me the taste is awsm. the quantity is good too. will recommend¬† the biryani lovers to taste the birayni and tandoor items of this place at least once. its worth of that

VISITED ON 11 MAY.: We ordered Kacchi Biriyani, Special Mutton Biriyani, galawati kabaa, fish pakora, tawa murgh. On an average, food tastes good,but the galawati kabab was a little too hot. the galawati kabab was served with a biiig paratha, which is quite exclusive. Kacchi biriyani was a new thing to me, and it tasted a bit sweet, but heavenly. The special biriyani and tawa murgh were okay. Ambiance good enough, thanks to the recent renovation. Staff extremely cordial and friendly. But car parking is a bit difficult, needs to be looked up by the restaurant authorities. Overall,a recommendable restaurant.

I had been trying to get to this place since quite sometime owing to its reputation of serving one of the best biryanis in town..being a biryani addict i finally got there..located on the bustling kidderpore market area this place truly shines out both on the outside and on the inside..the building is well decorated and u get a sense of royality once u enter the place..evrything is taken care of..there is both a non air conditioned section on the ground floor and an air conditioned on the first floor..the seating is nice and the decor is mesmerising..coming to the food..we ordered chicken reshmi kababs for starters..the meat was tender and it tasted as it should..DELICIOUS!!!..the daryabadi biryani that followed was sumptuous and mouthwatering..u get two tender pieces of mutton and mixed with dry fruits..its out of the world..we ended our meal with phirni..overall a great destination for all biryani food lovers..the place is always packed mostly so a table reservationis recommended..hop on!

And when the mind gets numbed by the allure of the Hooghly, quench your soul with the aroma of the Awadhi Biriyani. And possibly eat it too. Let your pilgrimage end at India restaurant. A byword for ecstacy, India like it's namesake, is a microcosm of the social fabric, it so proudly exists in. And boy, what joy to be a part of its culinary experience. The India biriyani, as I have fondly been calling it for years now, is a dry preparation. The hint of oil is minimal and the spice is markedly higher. So if one is looking for solace, simply tuck into their range of biriyanis. It would be a blasphemy on my part to even rate and compare them. Gluttony is a ritual for me and I would rather stick to it. Do not forget to add a rezala or a korma to the meal, though puritans prefer to have their biriyani separately. For me the concept of 'bhaat-dal' extends here too. The tandoori murg is another delicacy, one should never miss. They come in two and four pieces for half and full plates, respectively. And is a killer. End your meal with the ethereal firni or shahi tukda. Happy, go back to the Hooghly. The river will look alluring. More so now. With India in your guts.
They make Chinese too, but have never been able to go beyond the tandoori and the biriyani.
If you are still waiting to be amazed, hop on to a conveyance and travel over to Khiderpore. Come back a satisfied soul.

Visited the place 2 weeks ago....it is been great .Interior is bit classic and gives u a sort of royal feeling .We had mutton kacchi biriyani along with a chicken kadai. The biriyani was really good and it gives u the ultimate flavour of spices which they used and the chicken was complementing the richness of biriyani.If u r a kebab freak u can tease ur tongue with variety of kebab too.The price mentioned in menu card are inclusive of taxes. I highly recommend biriyani lovers to visit this awesome place....

This place is centrally located in khidderpore near famous fancy market. This place offers both ac and no ac seating. The no ac place might seem a bit too shabby but the food is amazing, specially mughlai and north indian dishes. The biryani here is too good. Now, speaking of the counter part as soon as you enter the ac accommodation on the first floor you will be transferred to a swanky five star restaurant. The interior decoration is out of the world. The best part is, it won't hurt your pocket too much.

The place is known for Mughlai delicacies and their biryani seems to be the local favourite as almost every table had biryani served. The place has a AC section inside. Tried chicken korma with paratha. The chicken was tasty and soft, just that it was very oily to my discomfort. Average taste and average service.

Heard a lot about this place from friends who reside nearby. So while in the locality we made it a point to visit this place!! First thing first, loved the decor & the ambiance!! Everything was so shiny & bright!! Heard they renovated it some time soon & they did a marvelous job!! About the food,we ordered Mutton sikh kebab, Galouti Kebab, Mutton special biriyani,Chicken biriyani,Masala Khulcha & Dum chicken. The mutton sikh kebab & Galouti kebab's were good but nothing extraordinary. Having heard much about the biriyani, we dint think twice before ordering but was highly dissappointed. The rice of the biriyani was not a good quality of basmati. The mutton was on the hard side & was difficult to chew off. Both the mutton & chicken biriyani tasted pretty blunt. The masala khulche though was very good & I pretty much loved it. But the dum chicken was again on the harder side. I specially dont like when Mutton or chicken is so overcooked that it becomes hard & more so in a mughalai specialty restaurant! They dint have much in deserts so we skipped it. The service was good enough. But apart from the decot they really need to focus on the quality of food & they will soon become a legacy restaurant where people visit just for nostalgia & not for good food!! That will be very sad for a place like this!!

A couple of years back on a winter afternoon few of our friends in office decided to explore this restaurant. We had been hearing a lot about this place from a friend who stayed in Khiderpore.

Initially I did not have much expectation as it appeared to be a small restaurant without impressive interiors. The place was overcrowded and the hustle and bustle was a bit annoying.(During that time they were yet to come up with the new flashy dinning area upstairs.)

When I finally tasted the food everything else seemed insignificant.

We had ordered for chicken chatpata. This spicy version of starter was a delight for my palate. Though some of my friends found it too hot.

The Biriyani was one of the best in the city. We wrapped our meal with Firni and Shahi Tukra. Both were prepared with high expertise.
It was undoubtedly a perfect lunch with authentic Mughlai food at a very reasonable price

I am an ardent biriyani lover. So wanted to visit this restaurant for a long time as I have heard a lot about this place. I went there with a friend to have lunch. The restaurant was quite easy to find, it is located near the fancy market. I quite liked the grand entrance. A gatekeeper opened the gate and greeted us very politely. The dining area is on the first floor. It had a proper reception as well as a waiting area and guess what all centrally air conditioned. As it was around 3:30pm so did not find much of a crowd, only few people sitting here and there. The dining area is quite large with sitting capacity of around 100 people. The place was well decorated with ample lights and beautiful decor. We were escorted to our table and they brought water instantly. We ordered mutton biriyani and Indian special chicken. We had to wait only around 10mins and the food was served hot. There is an open kebab and tandoori section with see through glass. You could actually get a live view of them preparing kebabs. The biriyani was quite tasty but a bit on the sweeter side. The mutton was really soft and well cooked but I found the potato raw at the centre. The chicken was really nice. It was kind of a mixture between a curry and stew. The quantity of biriyani as quite good. I would definitely visit again and try their delicious kebabs.

This place is my all time favourite in khidderpore. Was quite often when j lived in khidderpore. They make authentic mughlai cuisine. Their biryani is legendry.  Chicken and mutton pieces in the biryani are large and fleshy. The quantity is good. Also had chicken tandoori, hariyali kebab, mixed fried rice, chilly chicken and firni. They make awesome mixed fried rice too. It was full of chicken, paneer, prawns and egg pieces. The quantity was too much for one. The service is good. The staff are friendly and well behaved. The ambience is not less than a multicuisine restaurant. Their chinese cuisine is also awesome.

Situated in a not so posh area of kolkata amidst the husty busty of fancy market is this heaven for foodies. From the kebabs to their special kachi biriyani made of raisins and cashew to the desserts everything is just mouth watering. The kachi biriyani is well listed in one of the best biriyanis in town and it does have a unique taste to it , never have i ever had sweet biriyani before. Their kebab platter is something to try, gives you 5different varieties all cooked to perfection and for dessert dont look beyound the "shahi tukra"..trust me and try it ull be thanking me latter. One of the best desserts i have had in town despite being cooked from the simplest ingredients. The interiors are well worked and gives you the feeling of walking into a 5star restuarant only on a affordable budget.

This is indeed a legendary restaurant located at the heart of fancy market( kidderpore).I just love their Mutton Biryani. Used to visit this place quite often during my college and university days.¬† You can also try the kebabs esp the chicken tikka and tandoori chicken. The mutton tikia is also very delicious( and big) and goes well with the Biryani. Coming to the desert part.... If you want to have one of the best phirnis (if not the best) of the town.. then this is definitely the place. I would suggest everyone out there that whenever you visit India don't miss the phirni. The prices are affordable and the service is good. I will be visiting this place again very soon.

I visited the resturant after reading too much positive review about their foods, specialy Dariyabadi Mutton Biryani and Cheese Chicken Kebab. I tried both along with Chicken Chanp. But what a disappointing experience I got. By the oversweetened biryani, i was totaly confused that what i have ate, was it a biryani or a kashmiri pulao. The whole biryani was filled with chunks of dry fruits and also contain some fruit juice type things that made the item too much sweet. The biryani contained too much Dalda also, which is very bad for health. Chanp tasted very bad. The Cheese Chicken Kebab tasted so-so. The kebab was a special one, one stick kebab was rolled in thick cheese and fried, so that the whole stick of kebab gets a evenly spread thick layer of creemy cheese. This resturant is very old, I heard its age is near 100 yrs... But such a bad experience

If you are looking for one of the best biryani in town, this is the place to be. The restaurant is 5 min walking from my place. It was renovated and reopened when I was in school long back. Cant really remember the exact year. Its now a 2 floor restaurant which happened a few months back i guess. I have been visiting the place like always. Once in my office i ordered the famous Kachi and till this day my teammates tell me that its the best biryani they8 had in kolkata. And I agree to that 100%. When you visit this place dont give Kachi a miss. Yesterday we tried Awadhi biryani which is also awesome. Few of my favourite kebabs in here are
Chicken Cheese
Kakori
Hariyali
Afghani chicken

After the latest expansion the seating space and ambience is no longer an issue.

If you are looking for lip smacking mughlai cuisine then my friend your search stops here. Chinese food in here is also good but mughlai is hands down one of the best.

I been wanting to visit the restaurant for a while now. I'v had their food at parties and I have to say killer kababs. I'm told they also take great pain in delivering food. For example all the way from khidderpore to saltlake. 

I recently got a chance to visit the restaurant, the much talked about dariabadi Biryani and its a flavour might not be for everyone. But the galauti kabab in my view is the best in town. The reshmi kababs was also soft, moist and had a hint of lime which made it rather interesting to taste. The mutton sheek kababs is also a must try

This must be the tenth time that I have called for a home delivery and have been refused by some gentleman who identified himself as Vikash . What is most surprising is that he was absolutely unapologetic about his behaviour when I questioned him why does the restaurant claim to make deliveries then ? In fact he questioned me that why do I always call for food around 10 pm . 
Good food but pathetic service .

It deserves to get a 5. The most decorated, well designed, nicely maintained restaurant of south Calcutta. Very easy to locate. It is at khiderpore, near the popular fancy market. There is a parking area in front of the restaurant. Staffs are very well behaved. We ordered daryabadi biriyani. It was heaven. Less oily. Very good in taste. Paneer pakoda was awesome. Chicken butter masala was again yumm. Tandoori roti was delicious and very soft. At last we took mojito slush strawberry flavour and see blue sea. Both was very good in taste. Prices Are reasonable as the prices written in the menu are including all tax. I would recommend to provide some welcome snacks if possible. Overall very very satisfying visit it was. Keep it up.

This place was mentioned under the biryani collection of Kolkata... I ordered mutton kacchi biryani and mutton stew... Biryani was OK... To be honest, I don't prefer biryani which has sweetness associated with it and that was the case here...the mutton was soft and properly cooked... 
Coming to mutton stew, it was the best stew I have ever had... Awesome... It was oily yet very flavorful... The spiciness coming from black peppers was also beautiful... I would simply rate this restaurant 4 bcos of the stew... Otherwise it's max 3 for me...

Service is very fast and the restaurant has a nice ambience...

KEBAB. I don't think i need to write anything else. The food is so good which explains the crowd and the wait outside. 
 
The Biryani as always, okayish, as i m not that much of a biryani lover. Other than that, the mouth watering kebabs are something worth visiting this place. Very affordable and the quantity is nice too. The only thing is the hygiene because the starters plate was a little dirty. If that is handled well, no doubt a great food experience.

Firstly, the hospitality and the ambience is great with the gold and black combination. 
We had ordered the mutton galouti kebab which was just wonderful and melted in the mouth. This was also accompanied by a non - greasy parantha. The dum chicken was good but not outstanding. Coming to the biryani, the main plus was that the biryani was non - greasy and not heavy. It had a distinct taste and the mutton was cooked really well.
Overall, the place is a good option for biryani lovers.

India Australi WT20 match so can't go out and was looking out for options and here it was India restaurant where I can simply order some great biryani's. I had been to this place for a couple of times a few years back in khidderpore but this review is based on the mix of delivery and my early experience.

The sad part, minimum order for deliver 700 bucks, now how can one make it 700 with just a couple of biryanis and phirni, so added up the murg musallam to the order. They take 2 hours to prepare this dish and I was wondering what kind a dish it would be that it takes 2 hours to prepare only.

They took more than 2 orders to deliver the biryani, murg musallam and firnis.¬†

During my earlier visits to this place I clearly remember the taste of their biryani was distinct and nice. But this time a little disappointed. The chicken piece was good but the taste factor had gone down a little bit. Coming to the murg musallam it was a whole chicken cooked in rich spies and oil really nice, the chicken being soft full of juices and went well with the biryani. I am big lover of phirni but I must admit it was so so nothing special about it. Space for improvements I think and specially the minimum order value a big disappointment.

One of the legendary biryani houses in kolkata,I went here for the first time.The restaurant on the first floor is newly built with many staffs welcoming you to the place courtaseously. We had two starters- one chicken tikka kebab and one mutton boti kebab. As expected both were delicious.Then we ordered their mutton biryani which had one piece of mutton and a big 'aloo'. The rice was light and not oily and greasy. Also the chicken chap which i couldn even touch.Loved the biryani.I couldn finish though after i hogged on the kebabs. Never mind i parceled it.i always leave my stomach empty for some good dessert and here among the kulfi,firni and shahi tukda we went for firni. This was average.Not that great. Overall quite good.

Visited this place quite a long time back, for my friend's family function. Though the restaurant is located in a very clumsy area of Khiddirpore, the ambience inside is just mindblowing! The food they serve, the quality, quantity and the hygiene is excellent. Mutton Biryani is undoubtedly one of the best ones, I have tasted in Kolkata. Kababs and firni are mouth watering. Would recommend this place to all..

Lunch time and hungry souls. Ordered roomali roti, laccha paratha,chicken chap,chicken rezala,chicken biryani and firni to end it all. Laccha paratha fluffy and delicious,roomali roti was good so was chicken chap. Chicken rezala was pure bliss and biriyani was yummy. Leaving this place without having firni is a sin.Food quality awesome.Right place to treat urself

This is a very nice place at khidderpore close to the fancy market. The biryani was very good with the rice properly moist and the mutton well cooked.. We also took tandoori roti and chicken chap both of which I liked.. Sometimes the AC section upstairs can be crowded, so getting a place there might be troublesome

This was my second visit.
Details of the first visit can be found in the blog section.
The meal was a complimentary one.
Ordered
Daroyabadi biryani
Chicken peshawari
Pineapple raita
Fresh lime soda.
The biryani as usual was brilliant. The rice was moist & the mutton juicy & well cooked.
The chicken peshawari was also good. Though a bit on the sour side but tasty nonetheless.
The pineapple in the raita was a bit much too ripe.
The ambience once again awed me. Much like in a royal setting. The staff again were very courteous.
Will visit again soon when they introduce the mocktails.

They are now a swank building a few paces next to the fancy market. Felt nice to be there after a long time. The upper floor ac section was full and had a long waiting so we opted for the ground floor non -  ac section which was also fairly crowded. We were a group of four and ordered mutton biriyani, chaap, tandoori rotis and firni. The waiter suggested a cheese - chicken kebab and we included that too. The food was really good and quite liberal portions. The biriyani was typical Awadhi- Kolkatan genre and above average as it was fresh and warm. The chaap was typically oily but delicious. The meat seemed well seasoned and garnished. The rotis good and the firni average. The cheese chicken reshmi kebab was a revelation and we are happy we tried it. Last bit not the least, the service was pretty attentive and prompt. Feels good that the old place I knew years back has actually improved and innovated.

There is some strange romance between a Old Muslim Bawarchi and Biriyani. Like always. This particular restaurant being one of the oldest and best to serve the saffron coloured heaven on plate is a place where your biriyani experience can never go wrong. I have tried their biriyani both as a takeaway and consuming almost 4 hours after as well as being there and i have failed to find out any flaws about it. 
Long Grains of rice - Check
Succulent Meat - Check
Mild Aroma - Check
Saffron and White colour - Check

Apart from the biriyani do try the Shahi Tukra. Another gem of a dish they serve. Keep delighting as always. Cheers!!

Had my first visit in this restaurant and the experience turned out to be great. It's a two storey restaurant. Very nicely decorated. The interiors seem to look quite good. So does the ambience , the waiters were very polite and mannered. The food was terrifically awesome.
We had ordered for :
‚Ä¢ Murg Malai Kebab - Perfectly grilled in the Tandoor with balanced spices. It was mouthwatering. The quality of chicken was very good.
‚Ä¢ Mutton Kakori Kebab - Well this dish was a mutton preparation. Minced mutton with spices grilled in seekh. The kebabs were brushed with coconut oil. Though I do not like the smell of coconut at all, but yet the overall disk was great.
‚Ä¢ Mutton Biriyani - One of the best biriyani I have ever had in Kolkata. It was just perfect, without the essence they put in all other biriyani in this city. It was light, it was perfect. The mutton was super soft. The Biriyani was just perfect.
* Pahadi Chicken - This preparation was made up with boneless chicken and bell peppers. Had a balanced taste. Non spicy, best to have it with rumali or butter naan.
‚Ä¢Shahi Tukda - Well, it just kept its name. Superb taste, great flavours. A great dessert to end the meal with. The shahi Tukda was really toothsome.

Overall the food was just great, lacked a bit in presentation. But I would surely make a visit again for the biriyani and shahi Tukda. A must try. üòÑ

Went there today, The Decoration is quite good. Staffs are well behaved. Ambience is excellent. Coming to the food, We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Chicken Tikka kebab, Both the kebabs were excellent. For main course We ordered Mutton Awadhi Biryani, which was really very tasty and it was served with Raita, which was also good.                So, the food is good. Worth of visiting. But only one thing that, we went there today (Sunday) at around 1 PM and the seats were almost empty, Only few tables were occupied.              Highly recommended for Biryani lovers.

Being a great foodie I too have craving for different types of Biriyanis... So one day we made a plan for supper to go somewhere new to have Biriyani... While searching in zomato I have come to know about India Restaurant... This restaurant is the oldest biriyani house in Kolkata and has a history worth sharing... It is located just few steps from Khidirpur More towards Dock... Among three floors, Ground floor is non AC but 1st and 2nd floors have Ac...
The Ambience was quite nice... The seating arrangements and Decor give a luxury feeling here...
Coming to the Food, We had
India Special Cheese Kebab
Green Salad
Mutton Biriyani
Mutton Kacchi Biriyani
Mutton Daryabadi Biriyani
Mutton Awadhi Biriyani
Raita
Mutton Dakbangla
Firni
Shahi Tukra
Gajar Ka Halwa
Cold Drinks

Cheese kebab was their speciality and really scrumptious...
Among all Biriyanis, Awadhi was the best and the taste, the aroma made us crave for more...
Daryabadi and Kacchi was more or less same and also good in taste... difference was only in the no of pieces of mutton...
Mutton Biriyani was ok...
Mutton Dakbangla was the best dish there for me ... the gravy was too delicious...
Firni and Shahi tukra was good but Gajar ka halwa was better...

Service was excellent... they do know how to impress their customers with politeness...
The old age heritage about biriyani makes this place special...
#A Must try for Biriyani connoisseurs

Biryani-craving? Hop in to India Restaurant if you are nearby to this place. Chicken Bharta is my personal favourite alongside Mutton Biryani. It is so yummy. Mutton Biryani tickles your taste buds and the flavour melts in your mouth. Chicken cheese kebab is another liked dishes among others. Biryani lovers will definitely love this place for their amazing food. Cheers!

After hearing from my sister I thought to pay a visit on dis saraswati puja. We choose to seat at the top floor area. Firstly the ambience can give complex to 5 star resturants. Ambience is awesome so the interior. Staffs are well mannered and well behaved. Food quality is awesome. And quantity also. Would love to pay it a visit again.

Great mughlai food, specially love their kachhi biryani. The authentic mughlai taste of the kebabs and the gravy dishes are simply amazing. But obviously the biryani beats everything here, one of my favourite biryanis of Kolkata. Oh, special mention for the delicious chicken cheese kebab as well.
Even ambience wise this place has become better over the years and now you won't mind dining there.

At first I went there 5years back that time food was amazing it was small but the ambience was not so good...now went to give my mom her birthday treat...and  now it has turned out to be one of my favorite place according to the ambience too... The quality of food is as fresh as required by a foodie, firni is awesome and 10on10 for the kebabs... The ambience is similar to a 5star restaurant especially the top floor... The behaviour of the staffs Even the security staffs are superb...

It was hubby's birthday and he loves Biriyani , this was on my wishlist for ages after reading rave reviews. The place is done up lavishly to match the fine dining tag. So a plus there as most Biriyani special joints look ordinarily overcrowded and rustic. We went to the second floor which looked regal with the jazzy decor. We were seated in comfortable couch and greeted warmly. The special placard read some kebabs.We zeroed on galawati, chicken Peshawari and Tangri.Food arrived in 15 minutes. It was such a relief for the famished soul. The Peshawari and Tangri were excellent. The galawati which came with a thin n soft paratha was good but I've tasted the best before. We wanted to try the kacchi or the daryabadi Biriyani but both were sold out. A little heartbroken as that was my "mission" India restaurant. We ordered a special mutton Biriyani, a regular chicken Biriyani, chicken afghani and a chicken chaap. The biriyanis tasted excellent with huge tender meat. The chicken chaap was nice but ordinary. The chicken afghani gave a twist to the palate. It's awesome. The gravy had a zing and immediately u want more.Dessert we ordered Phirni and it was yummilicious. Creamy textured as good as rabri. All prices on their menu are inclusive of taxes.It's easy on the pocket.The food soars high in taste. Service is customer centric. Foodies go ahead and dive into a plethora of Mughal ecstasy.

Note: The meal was a complimentary one from the restaurant for the Zomato meetup.

India Restaurant, Khidderpore had been on my bookmarks for quite a long time. Having heard numerous praises from zomans about its biryanis it was only a matter of time that I would pay a visit.However it came as a pleasant surprise when one fine morning I found a mail from zomato about a meetup whose venue was to be India restaurant! yay!Wow, I'd be meeting fellow foodies too! Next was what to expect from India Restaurant. They serve awesome biryanis. But then again I found out that they had recently renovated their upper floors & looking forward to introduce new menu.
So upon visiting the place you find this restaurant which resembles most other eateries of yesteryears of kolkata. Seating arrangement is cramped & it feels you are in yet another cabin-styled eating house.Then you notice the entrance to the upper floors.
The doorman opens the gate & voila! Its a completely different scenario from what you were seeing until now!The gold- yellow colour & lighting scheme along with the carefully chosen chairs & sofas give you that royal mughal feeling. They even use golden mats on the table in place of boring laminated papers.Of course I was impressed. This definitely was different from those regular outlets decorated with glass top tables or coffee coloured sofas!
The first floor also has a nice waiting lounge for about 12-15 people. Great place to take selfies & checking in on zomato.
I got introduced to Mr. Vicky Chen, the manager who would be our host for the lunch.
Now to the food.
From the mocktails menu I ordered Virgin Mary, Shirley temple & Grappa. Let me be honest Bloody Mary without alcohol is just tomato juice & very disappointing.The second one was citrus & apple based & tasted good. But the grappa was mind blowing. Of course a tall glass filled with grape juice, syrup & topped up with vanila ice cream can hardly go wrong. But still all of us had liked it very much & each had ordered at least one of it. However note that the mocktails weren't part of the standard menu, & you may not find them right now. However they plan to introduce the new menu shortly.
Coming to the starters, we had Thai sashlik, Paneer kurkure, Pineapple tandoori in the veg. offering & Chicken cheese kebab, Chicken malai kebab & Fish Sarsonwali in the non-veg.
The Thai sashlik was good, nothing extra ordinary, the paneer kurkure was good, but the pineapple tandoori was definitely the best in the lot. It was chicken tandoori without the chicken. So all the vegetarians out there can find out what they are missing out by not having chicken tandoori ;).
Now of course it was the time for the stars of the day, biryanis India Restaurant is known for. We had Daryabadi kacchhi Biryani, Awadhi biryani along with regular Chicken & Mutton Biryani in the menu while the vegetarian people had the choice of veg. biryani or Peas Pulao in the rice. Once we jumped into the biryanis we knew why they are known as among the best in Kolkata. The rice was well cooked & flavoured. The Daryabadi biryani is served in a sealed clay handi. As the rice is cooked along with raw pieces of meat, the flavour is infused in the rice as well. The Awadhi biryani is cooked with vegetables and is spicier than the regular biryani, but taste is in a different league altogether. The chicken & mutton pieces were adequately marinated, soft & juicy. Overall the Biryanis were surely among the finest in Kolkata.
Also in the menu was choice of various naans & rotis of which I tried the kesaria & butter ones. The butter naan was of regular taste, but this is the first time I tried Kesariya Naan. It has a much sweet note to it, which may not appeal to everyones' tastebuds. but matched with the right spicy side-dish, it can win hands down.
From the side dish I tried Mutton Dakbangla, Mutton Ra-Ra Punjabi & Chicken Afghani. The mutton dishes seemed fine, while I found the Chicken one better. The dal fry & Aloo dum too were rightly cooked as I heard from the others.
I also tasted their various raitas which were as accompaniments. The boondi & mix raitas were of standard taste, while I found the pineapple raita to stand out. definitely this restaurant knows how to prepare their pineapples :D
In the dessert menu they had Firni, Shahi Tukda & Gajar ka halwa, of which I tried all. No points for guessing I am a sweet loving bengali :P. The Firni was a bit tad sweeter than one would expect, while the shahi tukda was a bit grainy from inside. The gajar ka halwa was a bit overcooked & smelled a bit burnt. On asking they served a second plate which was better.
Overall the experience was memorable. The staff were courteous, the dishes much decorated & prepared with care. However I am not sure how much this was due to the 'Zomato meetup' tag. Hope to find their service as good when I visit them the next time.
Thanks Zomato & India Restaurant for having us. Will wait for the next time ;)
Till then, happy eating.
                                          ...

When I ate here last, during my college days, it was a small, single floor restaurant. On my last visit to Kidderpore, I noticed they have expanded and have added two floors above the old one. I made a note then to come back soon to check out the new section. So, when I received an invitation from Zomato last week for a food meet-up here, I was more than happy.

Ambiance

I was expecting great interiors, bit nothing like what I saw. It was grand. I was not expecting something like this here in Kidderpore. Perfect place for a family dine out or a date. Selection of music was good and so was the volume. Not too loud, nor too soft. I would personally suggest them to play Arabic string instrumental tracks. Will go perfectly with the decor and their specialty food.

Service

Excellent. Quick, attentive and friendly. Mr. Vicky Chen, the manager, and his team, made their best efforts and I must say I was impressed.

Food

Now the main thing. Food. Most of the items we tried were not from their regular menu. We were told they are trying to incorporate these in the regular menu by the end of February.

The mocktails were refreshing. I tried Deep Blue Sea and Grappa. While Grappa (grape based with ice cream topping) had the best look, Deep Blue Sea was better taste-wise.

Among the starters, the veg ones, surprisingly, won hearts. While the Paneer Kurkure had a great texture and tasted good too, it was the Pineapple Tandoori that unanimously was voted the queen among the starters.

The Mixed Shashlik didn't score for me. I didn't like the fried covering. For me the best among non-veg starters was Fish Sarsonwali. Fat fish fillet and spicy. The Chicken Malai Kebab was good too with soft pieces of chicken. The Chicken Cheese Kebab was a bit dry and hard when they first served it. Once complained they cooked a second batch, which was far better. But I personally am not a fan of Cheese Kebabs as I like my kebabs more spicy. If you are a cheese kebab fan, you would like it.

For breads they served a variety of naans. Butter naan, Kesaria naan and Kabuli naan. I loved them all. Soft and delicious. Perfect to wrap around the variety of gravies they served. I tried the Mutton Ra-Ra-Punjabi, Mutton Dakbangla and Chicken Afghani. The gravies were rich and tasty. The mutton was soft and juicy and the julienned chicken was well cooked and not dry.

Among the veg dishes, the Kashmiri Aloo Dum looked the best, but the meat dishes were so good, I didn't have room for it. The naans were excellent, and I wanted to have another helping, but restrained myself as we were still waiting for the biryanis to be served, which is the USP of this place.

The Kachchi biryani had alubookhara in it, which gave it an unique taste. A bit on the sweeter side, I think this is a must try for Biryani lovers, as the taste is different from the regular ones. But I found the Awadhi Biryani, served in a handi, the best. The mutton pieces again were excellent. If you are a biryani lover, you just can't miss visiting this place.

For desserts there were Gajar Ka Halwa, Sahi Tukra and Firni. Going by the ambiance of the new section, they have ample scope of improvement as far as plating of the desserts are concerned. It will only add feathers to their cap. Taste-wise I liked the gajar ka halwa and the sahi tukra. But the firni was a tad sweet for me. Personally I like a less sweet firni. But if you like yours sweeter, you will love it.

The overall experience was great and I am looking forward to coming back here once the new items are added to their regular menu.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Well, It was a Zomato meet up at this venue Named India Restaurant located at khidirpore market. All thanks to our CM for choosing this place and letting us know that there is something like this place still exists in Kolkata. A very old and renowned place Known for their Brilliant biriyani for years. If you want to see a mini Dubai this is the place for you. From the classy ambiance to Waiters to the entire hospitality. As i heard about this place was something else and i get a shocker when i entered the place.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: The ambiance is huge. Divided in three parts starting from the ground floor which is open moving towards 1st floor which is made of Silver interiors and very classy indeed following the best part of the building the second floor. Which was of Golden, yellow with eye warming interiors and simply made me felt like i am at dubai for a moment. Dining in here gives you a royal feel with the glitters of the place. Resto is quite huge with lots of tables up for grabs in forms of tables as well as sofas. Its clean and run in full A.c.. Staff here simply the nicest, attends to you properly, listens to you with ears open and are very polite. Till the best group of staff i have met till now.
Everything was very well managed by the floor manager Mr. Vikki Chen, a special thanks to him for taking care of everything with such calm way.

FOOD: So here we are finally for the main part. Basically when we visit a resto we often don't have a chance to taste everything. But this place offered almost everything of their specialty all thanks to Team Zomato for such a huge list.

We Dined in and began with the Mocktails in forms of Shirley Temple as a beginner followed by Deep blue sea and Grappa.

Shirley Temple tasted a mix of Orange and flavours of other fruits which i couldn't guess. thou it contained more a tangy taste which was simply nice.

Deep blue Sea was also very good, It looked proper with the decoration and the taste was even better.

Grappa was a huge one. The taste of grapes in a drink, what more you need. Filled with ice cream on the top and the look of the drink was pleasant as well.

Next we went down to the Starters which contained both Veg and Non Veg.

Beginning with Pineapple Tandoori, Paneer Kurkure followed with Chicken Malai Kebab, Chicken Cheese Kebab and Fish Sarsowali.

Pineapple Tandoori is a must try here even if you are a diehard N-V. I think it should be their trademark starter. A fruit turned and reflected into a tandoor was a surprise for me. Smelling and eating it out gave me the feeling of eating like Tandoori chicken with flavour of Pineapple.

Paneer Kurkure was also on a satisfactory note.

Chicken Malai Kebab was very nice. It was contained in a stick with different vegetable. Fried well and was equally hot when served.

Chicken Cheese Kebab was good. Chicken marinated and roasted with cheese stuffing in it. thou few of my fellow friends found it difficult to break thou i didn't find one. And when they served it again it was even softer to me.

Fish Sarsonwali Looked like Reshmi Kebab, but when broken you find good amount of fish in it. Thou a bit dry inside still i believe kebab has to get dry after being fried in such a heat. taste was very spicy and according to me it was the best in N-V starters.

We dropped down to the main course where lots of things were in queue. To be honest i had tried the entire N-V section but didn't tried the Veg at all as was bit ill :-p. Served on the table were Chicken and Mutton Biriyani, Kacchi Biriyani and Awadhi Biriyani followed by Chicken Afgani, Mutton Ra-Ra Punjabi and Mutton Dakbangla for the side dish. Lastly we had the Butter Nan, Kesariya Nan with three forms of Raita and three forms of Desserts in form of Firni, Shahi Tukra and Gajar Halwa.

Both the Mutton and Chicken Biriyani were excellent. Simply what we call a biriyani. Pieces were also satisfactory, the potato was done justice and was soft indeed.

Kacchi Biriyani was tasting different from the normal ones. It has other form of spices which kept me reminding of Hyderabadi biriyani.

Awadhi Biriyani was even better. It came in a Handi decorated pretty well.¬†

Chicken Afgani seemed very ordinary to me. it looked eating like Reshmi butter masala.

Mutton Ra-Ra Punjabi was a good pick. Taste was brilliant. the mutton was breaking easily and was very juicy inside.

Mutton Dakbangla was just different like its name. It contained taste of Mutton chaap and Mutton Masala together. A combined taste i felt, don't know about others. Again mutton was made well and breaking easily.

Butter nan was good so was the Kesariya nan. It was thick and breaking easily and was equally soft.

Coming to the end of the table so i must say i was bit disappointed with the Desserts.¬†

Firni was pretty ordinary, Shahi tukra was not upto the mark and gajar halwa could have been much better than this. A huge improvement is required in this section, specially to the decoration section of the desserts.

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of all the food served were no doubt very good. Impressed with the quality and the quantity as well. Prices are fine and reasonable.

CONCLUSION: All thanks to Team zomato and our CM for such a nice lunch and selection of place. And later a return gift as well to the same place made it even better. Will be surely moving to this place again in some time to try the left outs.
Well i wish all the luck to them. Cheers

NOTE: the review is based on my personal visit and Experience to this place.

Amazing biriyani and chicken chap. A must visit for biriyani lovers. Though the special chicken biriyani had little quantity which is not the same with other famous biriyani eateries. The phirni was too good and overall a very very good experience.

If you are a fan of mughal cuisines or you love that Royal feeling while eating or else lets put it this way that you always want to visit a new place totally different from the regular restaurant's , then I must tell you my friend that my recommendation and choice is
INDIA RESTAURANT as you won't be dissapointed with the fine experience .

Let me give every crisp bit of detail about my thorough experience about this place , so at first let me disclose the main part that on 30/1/2016 a group of foodies from Kolkata were invited for a Zomato meet up at this luxurious and royal ambiance based restaurant to taste and indulge in a wide table spread of mughal cuisines as well as other varieties that their restaurant offers .

AMBIANCE & HOSPITALITY --

The restaurant is divided in two floors which are non ac that is in the ground floor and the ac one which is on the 1 st floor so we headed to the ac seating area and as we were a group of 10 to 12 people so slowly we settled down in our royal tables with fine cutleries on our table welcoming us and within a few minutes servers came and helped us with serving water in our glasses and while all this was happening i took some time to get into the mood of eating as the whole set up and decoration of the place just got me mesmerised and without any delay I ended up clicking a lot pictures of the lights around the whole area , then i captured a few shots of the ceilings which were beautifully done and then had my eyes on the chairs and tables which were crafted very much like the feel of some mughal emperor's time which is highly commendable to see in a restaurant in Kolkata .
The whole section is fully done up nice and bright with colours of gold ,yellow ,white ,chocolate brown and black combination for sofas and also the marbles floors all were designer which added a heavy vivid experience setting the mood just so right .

Now let me tell you about the hospitality and service of the waiters, servers and in charge head of our table, that they were absolutely so ready to help you and make you feel comfortable really is a very positive thing in this restaurant making you eat with comfort and care is a rare thing these days.
Then i visited the washroom in between and noticed a house keeping staff is employed outside the washroom who was pretty alert with his job so that's a good thing and for sure coming to the main man behind all this as well as responsible for the whole restaurant of both the floors was the manager Mr Vicky Chen who is really a wonderful and cooperative person as he took great care and gave instructions to the staff in such a manner that it was commendable seeing how the whole unit works with so much passion and hard work .

FOOD & BEVERAGES --

I had started my day with a few mocktails which were SHIRLEYS TEMPLE ,DEEP BLUE and GRAPPA ,now all three drinks differ from each other as in from taste to the presentation as well as colour .
Shirleys temple has a strong taste of orange flavour in it and looks peach in colour then the deep blue sea tastes very much lemon and has blue colour look and finally grappa tastes likes grapes and the colour is also purple and has a ice cream to the topping of it .
All of them are good in their own way however for me deep blue sea and Shirley's temple stood out .

Then we shifted to the starters which were from the veg kitchen first and they were PINEAPPLE TANDOORI ,PANEER STARTERS.
Now the pineapple tandoori was really very nice and the flavour of tandoor was nicely enriched giving my taste buds a good feel as compared to the other paneer and veggie starters listed in the menu that I tried.
Then for non veg starters I had CHICKEN CHEESE KEBAB ,CHICKEN MALAI KEBAB AND FISH SARSONWALI of which let me tell you the best I found was Chicken malai kebab as it was tasting very juicy and the spice was set nicely ,also the meat was soft and easy to chew whereas chicken cheese kebab wasn't bad but little improvement can be done in terms of the meat to be a bit soften and finally the fish sarsonwali was tasting very yummy however a bit dryness was not letting me complete my satisfaction on that one .

So after the end of starters ,now let's come in for the big ones which is the main course ones first veg selection like NAAN,KESARIA NAAN,DAL FRY,KASHMIRI ALOO DAM,SABR-E-BAHAR
and non veg selection like CHICKEN BIRYANI ,MUTTON BIRYANI,KACCHI BIRYANI , AWADHI BIRYANI,MUTTON RA-RA PUNJABI ,MUTTON DAKBANGLA AND CHICKEN AFGHANI .
The veg based dal fry was made very tasty and thick which really goes well with naan and other Roti's ,then the kashmiri aloo was soft as possible and flavoured very nice probably little sweetness was added as the aloo tasted sweet too and the Sabr e bahar was a mix of a lot of vegatables in green curry including paneer too .
The naan ,kesaria naan both were made very soft and not burnt as well as sufficient enough for a proper meal ,coming to the non veg part the Chicken Afghani was a real delight to taste with the meat perfectly made with a lovely aroma of spices and so tender to eat , then the mutton ra ra was a dark colour mutton gravy curry high on taste and some big pieces are in it making it taste yum ,moving on to mutton dakbangla it was pretty much similar however the colour of the gravy was slightly different and the meat was softer in every bite I took .
Now about the biryanis well the mutton and chicken biryani were very good with proper pieces of meat ,egg and aloo spiced up ingredients and the quantity was very much likeable , then the kacchi biryani has a Hyderabadi taste to it and tastes a bit different from the rest but the biryani which stole my heart from this restaurant was the AWADHI HANDI BIRYANI which is like the hallmark of INDIAN CUISINE AND BRINGS A MUGHAL LEGACY in your table when you eat this lovely handi biryani you won't like to eat any other biryani then after as its full in quantity with special top most fine basmati rice,eggs ,mutton and aloos made fully with a total different set of ingredients as its a special dish and surely it does justice in the menu card 100 percent .

Finally after eating this delightful meal with a huge spread we ended our day with some desserts like firni ,shahi tukra and halwa out of which only the firni was rocking but the presentation can be improved ,same goes for the shahi tukra but it was made a little better than the halwa as the halwa did not taste up to the mark however eatable .

Hence a beautiful meet organised by

ZOMATO ( complementary) at INDIA RESTAURANT came to an end as it was very memorable and a beautiful experience altogether .

Till now the best Biryani I ever had is from this restaurant only. It is famous for the delicious Kachchi biryani which is a Bangladeshi dish. It is similar to the Hyderabadi Biryani but far better than the same. In deserts you can go for Firni or Shahi Tukda. Both are equally tempting. It's a worth & must visit for non-veg. lovers.

Till the time I tasted Hanglaatherium Kamalgazi, this was my favourite Biryani joint. What impressed me definitely is the consistency. My only suggestion is to reduce the amount of Dalda. These days, people do not like Dalda in food. It is unhealthy also.¬†

But you will remain as one of my favourite Biryani joints.

The best biriyani in town is in this place (India is one of the oldest btw). I STRONGLY recommend India's KACCHI BIRIYANI (comes with mutton only..the boti gets cooked with the rice..little spicy...and way tastier than the regular biriyani) EXTRA BOTI to all biriyani lovers out there. This outlet is one of those very few one that serves Kacchi. The other biriyanis are good but this one tops the chart.  Be careful with the spicy punch it has got. 
The "other jewels" include Daryabadi biriyani (the big biriyani..hyderabadi style) peshwari kebab..Afghani tandoori and the FIRNI. 
India makes the thickest and the richest and the most appropriately sweetened firnis. And they dont hav that smell.

The AC section has limited seating arrangements, so I prefer the non AC section... nothing to mention about the deco since they are not interested in deco... staffs are good and service was very fast... I had there tandoori chicken, both chicken and mutton biriyanis, chicken chap and do pyaza and tandoori rotis... whenever I got a chance to visit this area... quantity and quality was good enough... also pocket pinch was very reasonable...

Delightful Chicken Special Biryani with the chicken cooked to perfection and the rice just right! Tender and delicious Chicken Reshmi Kebabs which were perfect with the Biryani and a Chicken Chaap which did them credit (though the chicken could be a bit softer).

My first impression of India restaurant was very very positive hence the 4.0 rating!

I have been here a number of times and the food is good as always.
But recently I have seen that the service here is not as good as it was. ThoughI personally didnot face any issues but yet the way of serving the food has changed. The waiters are always looking at you when you eat or standing too close by as to overhear conversations.
They plus point of politeness is becoming a big turn off.

India restaurant is an authentic place to have Mughlai cuisines. I went along with a friend on the 31st and had Mutton special biryani and Chicken reshmi kabab. We enjoyed both dishes considerably. The overall ambience is fine and the service by staff is satisfactory. Price is okay. I would rate it as 4/5.

Must visit for all those who are looking for affordable pricing but fine dining experience. Only no-no is the handbill. Should be computerized.

India restaurant which is situated in Khidirpore, is one of the best restaurants. 

Ordered :-
‚Ä¢Kakori Kebab- 5/5
‚Ä¢Butter Naan- 5/5
‚Ä¢Dal Makhni- 5/5
‚Ä¢Mixed Vegetables- 5/5
‚Ä¢Tawa Chicken- 4.5/5
‚Ä¢Shahi Tukda- 4/5

Shahi Tukda could have been better, Tawa chicken was a bit extra oily. 
Naan, kebab, dal makhni and mixed vegetables were out of the world. Beautiful ambience and decor, well served by them, very nice and cordial staffs. Amazing experience.

P.S. Try their biryani too, that is also amazing.

Made an Online order yesterday around 8:30 PM. Menu consisted of Daryabadi Biryani,Chiken Chap,Mutton Kadai, Chicken Kadai and Firni.
Biryani was mild blowing.....i have tasted biryani at almost all places in Kolkata and i can say that this was the best i had the mutton pieces were cooked really well and they were just about the right texture and taste... just to melt in your mouth. Chicken chap was excellent as well. Chicken ¬†Kadai was something very different but no doubt it was excellent as well. Mutton Kadai was too good....very very tasty....And to top it off the firni was just too good to be true.¬†

All the items were excellent. And delivery was prompt. I mean i placed an online order at 8:30 PM and it was delivered at my place at Triangular Park,Gariahat at 9:20. Could'nt hv asked for more :)

Looking forward to having more of good food from this great outlet. You have won my heart. And here on wards for me Muglai means India Restraunt :)

Had heard a lot about this place and thought of visiting it while i had gone to fancy market for some work. Like all my other overhyped restaurants this was the same, biryani was terrible and so was the chaap. 
But i must admit the restaurant ambience and the interiors were superb like literally out of the world, it was like i have stepped into a four star hotel. They have like the entire building and the exterior facade ws also quite appealing. So i rate it two that too only for the interiors but i am never coming back again. Price point is reasonable though.

This restaurant was always in my wishlist for long, am glad that we visited here to start off the new year grandly with a mouth warming tasty treat. For the starters we took Galawti Kabab and Chicken Peshwari Kabab. The Galawti Kabab just melted as soon as it touched the tongue. The Chicken Peshwari Kabab triggered our taste buds and made us more hungry for the main course. The Daryabadi Biriyani is a must for the main course along with the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, and Shahi Tukra for the deserts. This Restaurant serves the perfect blends and dishes of Awadhi and Lucknow cuisine. The ambience and hospitality from the waiters should also be rated very high.

This place is another hidden treasure discovery from Zomato.
I dont know why this place is less known to people.This place is one of the best mughlai food places i have visited.If you visit Alipur zoo this place would be best otion for you for lunch or dinner with your family.It is just @ km away from alipur zoo.
Now lets come to my experience.I visited there on 1st january.
Ambiance:it's a beautiful ¬†two storied place.The glass decoration,cosy sofas and lots of open space have made it comfortable.And specilly the view of hanging various kinds of kebabs in kitchen is an eye soothing view.
Food:We took chicken malai kebab in starter.It was nice.For main course we ¬†tried butter tandoori,chicken butter masala and their special mutton biryani.Butter tandoori was moderate and soft enough.but the chicken butter masala was brilliant.And the biryani,it was amazing.Special mutton biryani comes with two pieces of mutton and one egg.Mutton was very tender and tasty.Their biryani is even better then Arsalan and aminiya Biryani.But i took away their plain mutton biryani for home,it was not upto the mark.So its better to try their special biryani.

Service: The only part that this place needs to be improved.They did not ask for us any assistance for serving the food.We had to ask the waiters for serving the food. And they did not offer us mouri and mishri too.Otherwise it was fine.service was prompt.The security guards were very cordial and they were suggesting us better places in the restaurant for taking selfies.

Price:A little bit overpriced than usual biryani place.But the place is worth of it.For three people cost was approxly 900.
But the overall dining experience was satisfactory and demand a revisit.Thank you zomato for suggesting such a nice place.

Writing this review in the middle of the night as I couldn't sleep due to digestion problems. Although IMO I have a quite good system (for last 20 days cont. I am eating out without any problem). This is to blame the food quality in this place which we thought would be better at least after the first glance of the restaurant. In general I won't visit again but the 1.5 star is for afghani chicken kabab.

Want to have Daryabadi and Hyderabadi biryani.. This is the one stop shop for anything mughlai. The peshawari murgh tangri is just finger licking. The chicken haryali kebabs are also good. But anyone having a sweet tooth please do not leave this restaurant without having their phirni and Shahi tukda. They are just out of this world.

Even the Chinese is good there. 
Staff is courteous and well mannered. 
The new building with the new decor makes it look no less than any leading restaurants in Kolkata, hygienic and clean. Make sure you visit the new building.

Visited India restaurant on 22/12/2015 for a dinner with friends. Went in at 9.30 pm it was almost full. We sat in the first floor, when we entered the place the first thing to be noticed was the nice decor (nicely done interiors) thumbs up for that.
We ordered chicken special biriyani, Galouti kabab (winter special) , Chicken Bharta ,lucknowi paratha, sweet fresh lime sodas.
Biriyani was very nice and i would admit that it was better than arsalan's in terms of quality it had two pieces of chicken one boiled egg and our famous boiled "aalu" :)
Galouti Kabab was also very good it melts in the mouth, i've had better galouti kababs in the past but still it was good.
The paratha was very big in size it was ok.
The only complain is with the Chicken Bharta, The chicken pieces were very hard as if frozen chicken was used in cooking & the pieces were tasting like either not fresh or not properly washed before cooking, also there was supposed to be more gravy but instead it was floating in oil.
Service was super fast and nice no complaints with that.
Management please look into this and make sure whatever you cook the chicken pieces are soft.

Overall the food quality was good and light or rather i would say better than Arsalan, a very nice experience. Although this place is far away from where i stay but would try to visit more often.
Cheers

Visited last week for a family dinner for the first and probably the last time!
The food is tasteless, roadside biryani is better than theirs!
The service is extraordinarily pathetic, seemed like the staff is untrained!
The gravy items and the starters too were a little uncooked and very dry respectively!
A big thumbs down!

Sorry I can't cut even a single point of this  restaurant as this is one of my favourite restaurants for biryani actually  the unbeatable  Kachi biryani and it's unmatchable ever. Though I personally love Royal Indian Hotel for its mutton biryani but Kachi Biryani here does it all. 
Chicken Hariyali butter masala here it's so delicious you will not bother to look at the decor or ambience, the breads are good,  chicken Bharta is good and mostly everything  is good. You would not like  phirni here but if you are a biryani lover you've got to visit this restaurant.

My brother told me about the Cheese kebab of this restaurant. After eating it I found it a fusion of continental and mughal , the flavors of cheese and the chicken was distinguishable yet fused together in your mouth to produce a different level of taste. I must recommend it to all the Cheese lovers and experimental foodies.
Also tried the famous 'Kacchi Biryani', wasn't much impressed by that,rather Simple chicken biryani tasted better. Looking forward for Dariyabadi Biryani in next visit.

situated near fancy market in kidderpore, this restaurant is widely known for being one of the oldest biryani makers in Kolkata. have been to this restaurant just 4 times. it's really well decorated. but the staff isn't trained at all. I've had just a few dishes here, like, chicken hariyali kabab, chicken afgani, and chicken biryani. food is pretty decent, but the biryani here is seriously over hyped. best thing on their menu is their chicken roll. definitely worth a shot. :)

Tried lucknowi, hyderabadi and other types of biryani but DARYABADI biryani from this place really gives my taste buds a tingle!!!!
Definitely a Recommended visit............

Im big fan of India Restaurant for over 10 years. This week from 2nd of December, ¬†there was a Biriyani festival held in Ecospace. I must say Humdaan & his team were superb. The way they took care of me & my colleagues it's fantastic.¬†
I always recommend India to my friends & family for Biriyani. It's just out of the World. Apart from the obvious quality Humdaan & team were excellent with their service. Kudos to them as it is very difficult to achieve both quality food & service. They achieved both.

Heard about this famous biriyani joint for a long time and finally I got a chance to visit here. They really make some delicious mutton biriyani here. I jst loved it. And the price is very much reasonable. As a side dish I had mutton fry and I have to mention about its gravy. It was soooo beautiful, kinda like mutton kasha but lighter dan that. But the thing that really made my day was their Firni. I advice evryone to try it along with the biriyani. If u don't, you will be missing one of the best prepared desserts ever.

Update : so 1st time i came here this place was rater around 3.7-4 ,now its 4.5 which is not really justified.
Its bit far frm my home or office so I'm not a regular here,i came back after a year, i ordered kacchi biriani, which tasted v.gd,had an aloo and egg,the muttn pc was a bit small but decent in size but it was not very soft, hard strands which were unable to provide any flvr of the mutton, last time i also hand kind of a similar experience,next was chicken afgani,which i had many at places before,but this the the quantity was very good,big chunks of ckn but not at all soft ,hard ckn,from old meat.gravy was tatsy.soda was good.

Last time also the meat in kababs were hard.im very disappointed,i may no com back bcz arsalan is close to my home has btr everything so. All depends on the meat if its not properly cooked or not of good Quality tye dish is bad.pls look into it.

Just had lunch today after so many recommendations from various friends... The decor is very nice..staff were very friendly, we have chicken chesse kabab,the chicken were a bit hard,mutton biriani was fantastic as well as chicken biriani,we had rara mutton which was very tasty and firni and lime soda.the soda was kind of a disappointment because it was to help us gulp down the food but that did not helped at all..its bit far from my home..will visit from office i guess to try some others dishes.

Have been hearing about India Restaurant for quite some time and finally had the pleasure of tasting their delicacies in this Kolkata trip. My review would be limited to their food as it was home delivery. It was in one word - superb! The Dum Biryani was fantastic and the chicken rezala and masala were both very nice. The Biryani smelt of Desi ghee and was exceptional and arguably one of Kolkata's best. Understood why it is fast becoming a household name. Next time would like to visit for a more detailed deep-dive into their menu!

Came here with a lot of expectations to try the kachchi biriyani. So we ordered Mutton kachchi biriyani along with Mutton India special. But unfortunately the kachchi biriyani tasted very bad to me. Mutton India special was nothing special..there were two pieces of mutton and plain mutton gravy with an egg . I don't know why they named this dish as 'special' . Overall a bad experience

Went there last time in the winters, had to find it out as i was new to the place. But this time you can make out the new three stored lighted building from the Khidderpore bus stand. Order Dariyabaadi Biryani, Peshwari Kebab, Laccha paratha and chicken Bharta along with cold drinks... a bliss!!!! Hope to visit soon.... Just a request please upload the new menu as the prices have been raised by almost a 100 bucks for few items.

Was surprised to visit. The restaurant is revamped, two more floors being added, interior designed.
But the food disappointed me today. The extra capacity has led to the compromise in quality.
The biryani tasted all garam masala and very spicy, the chicken starter was good but the mutton was bad(was easily returned). Mutton stew and butter nan was decent.
Important- if you visit the above floors, becareful with the stairs. The turns are weird and dangerous, you may fall.. Just for your safety..

First time experience was not that much good. So won't say much about it. The next time we went there we ordered some kebabs, normal mutton biriyani, paratha(lachha n normal) and mutton fry. It was mind-blowing. Each n every item was worth payable for. Though the order of the food was quite not right. We got the kebabs later after we finished the parathas. So lost the appetite for it. For desserts we ordered shahi tukra which is always great. So I look forward to visit again. Must visit for the first timers.

Forget the biryani. It's good. The mutton could be slightly more tender, but that's not the focus here. If you haven't come here and tried the mutton stew, your life is a lie. I landed up at India Restaurant after 12am and I could not believe what I ate. So rich, so good that it's difficult to describe the experience of stuffing yourself with some tandoori roti and the stew that late at night.

Perhaps the best mutton biryani I have ever had. It was not dry and the mutton piece was melting in the mouth! And the phirni was beautifully smooth. The place has been revamped recently so even if the traditional non-AC seating space is still present, you can opt for the first floor seating, the decor of which is at par with the high-end restaurants of Kolkata. Good experience.

Located in the busy streets of Khidderpore beside the oh-so-famous Fancy Market, this is the hub of biryani in the port area of Kolkata. The taste of every item in the menu is fabulous. Special mention to Biryani, firni and the Mutton chap. The owners are very friendly and staff too. It has an Ac room and a big non-Ac room. The space is an issue but now they are expanding to a much bigger area as they are about add three storeys to the place where they are currently located. The pricing is fair and the service prompt. My favorite place to have biryani in Kolkata and Mumbai combined. A must visit for all the biryani lovers.

The 3.5 rating is purely based on their food. The place is very crampy amidst the busy market area. Takeaway is always preferable. Their chicken chap and mutton biriyani is a must try. Amidst the biriyani giants like Arsalan, Oudh, Nizam's it has made a substantial name for itself in it's corner of the city.

India Restaurant, located near fancy market, Kidderpore, it serves one of the best Biriyani in town. First I went there in 2013 at the time of Durga Pooja with college friends. I've visited this place few more times after 2013 for just to have it's Biriyani and Kebab. Apart from Biriyani and Kebab they serve very good chicken roll. The service is really quick and price is also reasonable.

Yesterday 18th September was viswakarma puja.when I was a girl of 13 or 14 years used to fly kites whole day with my brothers. Place was north kolkata, bag bazaar area. The whole sky approximately cover by kites. That were the days, they are now "bho- katta" ,means went in the history. Now a days even boys don't fly kites; they have their computer games. We had invitations at our father's friend's puja. Mainly luchi- alurdam & mangsho-bhat, that is mutton curry& rice. Now I feel very sorry when in this day I don't see kites in the sky. Yesterday two of my husband's childhood friend came to dinner. One of them is living in Mumbai for 20 years. When he was asked what will he like , he promptly answered biryani. My husband was thinking which restaurant he will try. Then another friend came & suggested--- India restaurant. We never had food from there before, but he told us" you can buy from there closing your eyes. Quality is extraordinary." So my husband brought some kababs & mutton biryani from there. The three friends were busy with their reminiscences; kites, football, school days. I went to ready the table for dinner. At first I opened the kababs. Smell was excellent & mouthwatering. I arranged them on plate, salads & pudina chatney was there. They had their first bite & said Ah! beautiful. I also tried . Chicken reshmi kabab was so soft & tested awesome. Some fish kababs also there & I identified the original kolkata bhetki. I love bhetki fish & I was satisfied. After sometime i opened the biryani packets. Those also smelled very good. It is told that you have your half meal by smelling.the mutton was well cooked & the long grain rice also appropriate with that. We agreed that the food of India restaurant is high quality. We were very much satisfied. Our guests were happy & chherful. That had also their first India restaurant experience. The restaurant is far from our place but my husband said he will bring food from there in future. Thanks to the friend who suggested the restaurant. When we called him to thank he said " dry thanks will not do you have to give me a treat " we said -- " sure. "

Absolute PRIDE of Kidderpore... Only 1 restaurant that serves such good quality normal Biryani for all of us "Biryani-heads" ! Maybe would want to see them doing fish items also... They either don't do the fish kebabs but have accepted pre-orders n still not delivered fish kebabs..instead they delivered chicken kebabs by charging for fish kebabs (which dear friends is ¬†a higher price than chicken kebabs)... also they did not declare that while delivering but left it on us to discover while digging in at the dinner table... ¬†Also would like to mention that the embarrassment we faced due to this was significant since the occasion was my WEDDING party ! That is my only grievance... N that is certainly not acceptable!

A much awaited teat was planned last friday, which was sponsored by our clients..

Considering the budget biriyani was ordered for the lunch, and the order consisted of veg, chicken and mutton biriyani.

I tried their famous Mutton biriyani. Good quality rice was used, the texture was good and was cooked perfectly. It had a decent piece of mutton.

Friends who had the veg biriyani also praised it. However the chicken piece in the chicken biriyani was under cooked and the potatoes were hard from inside. Not sure if it was due to the bulk order, I would love to visit and have their muttton biriyani again.

One of the regular restaurants I like to go to. Love their chicken roll . My friend had a bad experience though. She ordered paneer roll and found probably chicken bits in it. She is pure veg so it was not acceptable. This happened twice. First time they exchanged but second time the waiter was rude and kept on arguing. Thumbs down for that. We Prefer sitting inside in the AC area. Simple and ordinary interior. Biryani in India are damn good. Chicken chaap tastes yummy. Price is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the food. The service is quick. Some of the stuffs are okay others are a big let down. Should separate their veg and non veg section.

It is a trend in Calcutta that people run to Park Circus because this place has the best shops which make great biryanis. I, instead, visit India Restaurant to have one of the best biryanis in town, keeping in mind Arsalan, Shiraz and all.

No other place can make such a great Kachhi Biryani other than India Restaurant.
When I want to keep my menu simple, I go for Chicken Biryani and Chicken chhap or Chicken rezalla. When it is time to go out with friends, who are also biryani lovers, we choose to have Chicken Tandoori and Chicken Peshwari Kebab as starters and then shift to Chicken Biryani along with Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. All the dishes are absolute heaven!!

They take the minimum time to serve the food and the waiters are polite.
Being one of the oldest Biryani shops in the city, the management, till date, search for areas of improvement. This actually shows their customer obsession, a rare quality among restaurant owners in the city.

To me, India Restaurant is a legend and I would go back every now and then to this place for a great meal.

The Biriyani was very good. Of special mention are the huge mutton pieces in the biriyanis. The quantity was maintained in the Chicken Bharta as well although the taste wasn't at par with the Biriyani. But everything was covered up with the quick service.Overall a must visit for all the Biriyani lovers!! :-)

I personally like the Hyderabadi biryani which u get in Arsalan. But u get very good kebabs and tandoori stuff here. Very very very busy counters if u re going for parcels. Absolutely scary parking/no parking available near here. 
The non veg curries and koshas however are way too oily for me. Also the rolls taste too sweet, i.e. the paratha of the roll has too much sugar mixed with maida so diabetics stay far fr away! I suggest u all try Meridian inn, a smaller outlet near kidderpore junction. They re way better in every way and have very clean decent seating for dining.

Dariyabadi & Special Mutton Biryani were both Good & so we're the Chicken Chaps. Well Packed & Timely Delivered to Southern Avenue ... The Dariyabadi Biryani is basically the Kachhi Biryani with an extra mutton Boti ... Nice Sweet & Sour subtle mix of Flavour ... Both Types of Biryanis served with Potato & Boiled Egg ...

The mutton biryani is good. The cheese kabab is out-of-the-world. The reshmi kabab, haryali kabab and peshawari kabab is also delicious. The firni was a perfect ending.

This restaurant is situated near Fancy Market in Khidderpore. They have both Ac and Non-Ac seating arrangements. The staffs are nice and they co-operate. The ambience is simplistic. Remains full all the time and grabbing a seat here depends on luck. They serve you great biryanis as well as kebabs. The mutton items are marvellous and the firni is love. The butter nun and the Chicken Reshbi Butter Masala deserves special mention. I recommend this place because :

1.  Prime location.
2. Tasty as well as pocket-friendly food.
3. Quality and Quantity is upto the mark.

One of the divine place for food lovers .  You can start your journey from Chicken tandoori  or chicken tikka , both are delicious . Laccha paratha is just awesome , you can combine this paratha with   Chicken kashmiri, Chicken or Mutton chap or chicken bharta . . 
For biryani either go for Daryabadi or Kachi biryani , you will not going to lost the taste for sure . .

I am a regular to this place as it is one of the best restaurants for biriyani lovers and me being one!! It is not the best place to sit and eat hence i opt for take away!!"Must eat"for the biriyani beasts!!
P.s. The mutton chap complements the biriyani to say the least!!

This biryani joint is located just beside the fancy market in khidderpore. Known for its biryani. We went from north Kolkata to there just to verify its fame. Biryani is pretty different from mughal gharana but tasty. Tandoori chicken and mutton curry we had ordered were delicious.

Located near Fancy Market in Khidderpore, I chose this place for a casual family dinner solely based on the rave reviews of the food. One doesn't come to such places expecting a nice ambiance or an overall fine experience, but simply to satisfy taste buds. But that is what left me disappointed on several counts. First, there was nothing very 'reshmi' about the chicken reshmi kabab... It tasted very average and the meat was neither soft nor juicy. Next, the mutton rezala though quite nice in taste was a dampener owing to the cuts of meat used. It was 70% fat and 30% meat.    The excess thick fat was not just a waste but also killed the fine flavors of the rezala gravy. As the Kachhi biryani (specialty) was over, we opted for their regular mutton biryani which was done quite nicely and lived up to our expectation. Except in one matter: once again, the quality and cut of meat was way too fatty to be either tasteful or enjoyable. Maybe it was the wrong time to try this place: the last weekend of the month of Ramadan when the crowds are at their peak. The only saving grace of the evening was the cheese-wrapped chicken kabab. The thick coating of molten tandoor-grilled cheese blended really well with the chicken, leading to an overall amazing combination. If I would go back to this place, it would be only for this one item they offer.

THE BEST BIRIYANI I had in my ENTIRE BIRIYANI JOURNEY. Went there when I was in class 11 (2007) with my friend and food enthusiast KAUSHIK BANERJEE who is a witness to the pleasure of MUTTON BIRIYANI and MUTTON REZALA. Back then 2 plate BIRIYANI and 1 REZALA with a couple of FIRNIS totalled to 208/-, visited again this year in January prices have increased but the smell and taste never changed. Never mind the prices, I dig biriyani so does he and we are coming for you again¬†

One of the oldest and most talked about restaurants in the city and famous for its biryani and tandoor dishes. Located a bit out of the way if you don't reside in the extreme southern parts of the city, this place is definitely worth a visit though. Seating people just like any other famous Biryani place around, it has a.c. accommodation as well. We ordered biryanis, kebabs and firnis and enjoyed them thoroughly. There is an option to have Chinese as well, but then again I ask you, WHY?¬†
Once you've had the Arsalans, the Shirazes and the Nizams and you think you've had them all, think again. This briyani is right up there among the best in the city. Must visit!

We went there last Saturdayjust to hang out. The place was packed, mostly due to Ramzan. We stuck to the basics and ordered Biriyani, Mutton Chap and Chicken Butter Masala. The Biriyani was light and very flavorful. The Chicken and Mutton Biriyanis taste very different from each other. The Chap was packed with flavor and Butter Masala lived up to its name.
For desert we tried Phirni and SahiTukra. The Shahi Tukra here as good as it gets. The Phirni was light and smooth.
Overall, its an awesome place where you can get one of the Best Biriyani's in the City and totally worth the money.

One of the oldest biryani joint in Kolkata; India Restaurant serves one of the most amazing biryani in town.  The succulent mutton biryani is to die for. Best part about the biryani here is it's not very greasy and you can feel the taste of ghee in it. I also loved their mutton chaap which had the perfect mix of spices and oil. Located in the busy locality of Khidderpore it becomes difficult to park your car and eat so it is best to take a parcel and savour the biryani at home or office.  The service is quick and the staff here are very well trained to handle a large number of customers at the same time.  So it won't be difficult for you to get your food packed without delay.  If you are a foodie and an afficionado of biryani then India Restaurant should be in your priority list for sure. Do not visit if you are looking for an elite ambience and service. .. simply visit for the sheer taste of the food available here.

When asked one of my friend, place for good biryani first name he suggested was India restaurant, Situated near fancy market kidderpore.
So  planed to visit That place for lunch.
Opted for air-condition section
The place was little small and very average decor. 
Ordered for haleem, paratha and biryani, haleem which I was expecting or what I've eaten was Hyderabadi haleem but this was boti haleem very similar to dalcha gosht....though it was not as I expected but tasted good and paratha was mouth melting.
Next on the line was biryani, with higher expectations when the first bite came towards the mouth the aroma said it all and the expectation was met....
The meat in the biryani was little tough but overall the dining experience was excellent !!!!
The food is real heavy if you are not used to having such a heavy meal then you should visit in bigger groups and share.

We wanted to visit this restaurant for a long time, finally yesterday we made it happen. Yes! it is one of the best biriyani destination in kolkata and surrounding suburbans. If you are driving in here, you may have to struggle for getting parking space. Went to their A.C. section. It is not very specious have very simple decor and average sitting arrangements and though each and every corner of A.C. section was always crowdy. A long queue was at their take away counter. So, you can guess the craze of this place.

Staff were polite and helpful, service was prompt.

Coming to the food, we ordered special mutton biriyani, special chicken biriyani, Chicken malai kebab, mutton rezalla, green salad (as raita was not available then), phirni and sahi tukra.

Special Biriyani consists of two large pieces of chicken/mutton, one potato and one boiled egg. The rice was perfectly cooked long grains, perfect proportion of spices and quantity was more than enough for a single person. The chicken/mutton was tender but a little dry inside, wish it would little juicier inside (like arsalan).

Chicken malai kebab was also very good, soft and tasty comes with pudina chutney and shredded onions. One plate consists 6 pieces of chicken.

The mutton rezalla was the best dish we had here. It was awesome. I still feel the taste and flavour when i'm writing this. Really! Super soft, super buttery, super flavoured mutton piece comes with similarly delicious gravy, surely you will not let it go without licking the plate.

Phirni was not bad but there is nothing special than other restaurants.

The Sahi tukra was also good. But I would prefer it from oudh1590.

Anyways overall I loved the restaurant and will come back shortly to try their Dariyabadi biriyani and mutton barah kebab.

The alley's dingy and it did scare me once to go alone but I was determined to come here, and I did with my dad. 
I had a weak stomach after an accident for years which gave me heartburn after eating anything remotely sinful, yet I used to crave biryani at times. I was in midst of chomping through a parcel of this biryani, suggested by my mesho, before I realised that I've had most of it, and yet I felt I could eat more. I let in my craving, and found the next morning that I didn't have the burn I was so wary of.
And I found my favourite biryani. 
Lacking the stinky dalda flavour and the ridiculous amount of salt in most of its pedestrian competition, its a beautiful, elegant symphony in your mouth. I love the Daryabadi more, the tart dry fruits cutting through the richness, enabling you eat more. 
Also, my father swears by their stew at the crack of dawn, which has been his favourite thing between a late night shift and a food coma. That with thick bread to soak up their sweet, milky chai with a layer of malai on it. 
Its a gem of a place, folks.

As this place's name was popping up at every Internet post about the best Kolkata Biriyani joints, we finally decided to give it a go. We ordered the Kachi Biriyani, simple Chicken Biriyani and the Special Cheese Kebab among other things. 
However, we were at fault of having such high expectations. If the Special Cheese Kebab of Arsalan is nothing short of Heaven in a mouthfull this one is no more than an arrogant and overpriced pretender. The Chicken Biriyani was better than the Kachi Biriyani which is a mini version of the all famous Dariyabadi Biriyani, but is still way behind India Restaurant's so called competitors in all those blogs.
To conclude I must say that the food here is quite good but it is not as good as what we expected. Every item here is overpriced, the service is quite bad,  and most importantly the food is too damn overhyped.

India at Khidderpore is in the league of famous biriyani places like Arsalan, Shiraz or Zeeshan...have visited the place many a times and would suggest the AC seating... Apart for the biriyani which is quite light one should try the kebabs which they serve with a very tasty chutney.. One should avoid visiting the place at around 5 as the kebabs won't be available at that time... Overall a good place just to have food without any pretence

This place is over hyped but is possibly the only place with decent food in the entire kidderpore area.Having tasted biriyani across so many joints in Kolkata i was curious to know what was legendary about this place.Well at the first encounter we were turned back by the staffs saying that owing to roza we are closed till sunset and asked us to come after that. I still was in shock as I could not believe such a thing could be possible so just standing outside the restaurant I called the number given in Zomato and the person receiving the call confirmed that they are open and asked us to come. With the confusion we entered but eventually found it open. The ambiance was extremely shabby and ordinary , but the ac seatings were comfortable.  The staffs were few in number probably again owing to roza and only one waiter was available for taking orders. We ordered chicken special biriyani, kachhi biriyani and peshwari butter masala. The biriyani had a distinct taste and had a well spiced up aroma. Their cooking standards were also higher as they seemed to use good grade of rice and oil. The biriyani is really one of a kind and makes my first and probably the only visit worthwhile.  Other than that everything else else even the chicken and mutton inside the biriyani tasted just average but had a distinct freshness. The peshwari butter masala wss again very very average. In dessert we ordered firni and that is another speciality of this place and their firni is way better than any of the popular joints in the city. Budget wise also their items seemed a little overpriced compared to the quality and service on offer.

Landed here by accident. Asked the taxi guy to take us to some good restaurant and I thank him for bringing us here.
It was crowded and we had to wait a good 25 min before we found a seat. 
The ambience is not great and this place needs some more place to seat.
We ordered Burra Kabab and Kachchi Biryani. The Burra Kabab was very tasty but the meat size being large, the centre was a bit not well done. I had to pull apart the meat.
The Biryani was amazing and I would have loved to try some gravy with Tandoori roti. But the Kabab and biryani sufficed me, my wife and my daughter.
We asked for Shahi Tukda for dessert but we were told that it just got finished. The waiter told us that we should have booked it before we began eating.
Recommended to order your dessert in the beginning.
We ordered Firni and it was very yummy too.

Will definitely visit next time I m in kolkata.

Brought home their Mutton Burra Kabab, Daryabadi Biryani and Muttton Pasinda. Although brought for two persons, quantity was more than enough for three persons.
Place is well known for Kachchi Biryani which we had tasted earlier so brought Daryabadi Biryani this time.
Starter Burra Kababs were tasty soft and with just the right extent of charring to cook well to make it semi soft. Very tasty and recommended as starter.
Daryabadi Biryani comes with two large meat pieces, one egg and a large piece of Potato. Biryani rice was a treat to see and smell. It was soft fragrant with the attractive flavour of meat, masala and other flavouring item such as Keora. Meat pieces were real big very soft and one could just easily scrape off the meat from the Bones. Taste of Biryani goes well with the egg and the Potato. This must be and is in the list of best Biryanis here.
Mutton Pasinda was good to taste but th√© Biryani flavour being so overpowering one need not order such an extra item.

You simply have to try their kachhi biryani and daryabadi biryani. It's location is a little bit of a problem, but the journey is worth it. This place has maintained its standard and quality of food over the years. You can even get extra pieces of botis with your biryani. :) price is reasonable for the quantity and quality of food.

This has to be one of the best places to have hydrabadi kachchi biriyani in Kolkata. Although quite far from the center of the city, the journey is well paid off. The long excursion wakes up the voracious appetite that this place deserves. We ordered hariyali and reshmi kabab to start with. They were nice. Then to the main course we ordered kachchi biriyani, I must admit I have not tasted such a wonderful biriyani in a long time. This biriyani deserves to be served to the nizams. With it we had chicken tikka masala and kadai mutton. The tikka masala went really well with the biriyani. In desserts we orders saahi tukda and firni. Shaahi tukda was a pleasant surprise but the firni was awesome. This was one of the most pleasant culinary adventure I undertook in a long time. I will surely go back there.....

The Mughlai Cuisine! With the aura of the mughals flavouring from their dishes, they have stood out to be a consistent deliverer of lip-smacking delicacies. India Restaurant serves you wonderful Biriyani, combined with wonderful boti kababs. Any time you are in Kidderpore or nearby, you surely don't want to miss out on this super deal.

My first visit to India Restaurant was a memorable experience to say the least. We three friends are out and out foodies and believe that if you don't eat meat all the time, you ain't eaten anything ;) Once we stepped in the place we realized that its a carnivore's paradise.
Buti a dear friend of ours and the keyboard  player of the leading Bengali rock band has been to this place a number of times before and so we asked him to order. He said let's order the chicken tikka and chicken hariali kebabs and then we'll see.
The chicken tikka was too die for. Succulent  pieces of chicken subtlety marinated and perfectly finished in the tandoori. The chicken hariali was abs amazing to taste. Loved the coriander flavour in the marinade and then again perfectly grilled in the tandoori. We then ordered the chicken chatpata kebab. Which was grilled chicken wings. Finally we also had chicken malai kebab. Soft succulent pieces of chicken covered with a layer of cheese and malai and then grilled. Its was abs foodorgasm ;) Oh wait! This was just the appetizers for us....told you guys we are carnivores. Then we ordered the oh so amazing mutton Daryabadi biryani along with mutton chanp. The biryani was abs to die for with 2 pieces of meat abs falling off the bones and a huge piece of alu with all the flavors of the ghee, meat and masala of the biryani soaked in and an egg. The rices was perfectly cooked with the grains abs intact. We also polished off a plate of mutton chanp. A little oily, the way I love it...it was a meal fit for the kings. 
I was in the mood for some phirni but resisted myself thinking about the huge portions of meat that I had consumed in the main course.
Its a very good place in the city for people who love their meat. Towards the end the waiters were also I surprised seeing us eat so much of meat :D

It was lip smacking good.. tried the chicken India spcl kabab(with cheese).. never tasted anything like it.. the cheese and chicken melt in your mouth simultaneously nd floods ur mouth with a burst of flavours.. service was good too.. the chicken bharta is a must try as well.. The biriyani easily beats other renowned restaurants in kolkata..

Finally dropped in here for the first time with family.. Its little far from Kolkata.. The place was more like Amenia, Esplanade one only.. We ordered Chicken & Mutton Biriyani with Chicken Bharta and Green Salad.. It was okay types.. We did not like it that much.. Still if you want a new place and biriyani you can drop in here..

Visited there just twice because its quite far away from where I stay. A friend recommended and the Biriyani here is awesome. One of the best biriyanis I have tasted and I can easily rate the Biriyani higher than Arsalan or Aminia etc.. Its far better and cheaper. I tried the mutton stew and the chicken tandooris and they were a treat. The ambience could have been better and the price difference between AC and non AC sections is quite high. Its Rs 30 more for Chicken Biriyani in AC. Still quite recomended for lunch on an outing or with friends.. I try to visit it as often as possible.

Been here only three times since it is very far from home, the biryani I have to say its the best. My uncle used to tell that the biryani is so delicious that he used have two plates, so I tried and indeed its worth to have that kind of praise. The korma is also lip smacking and the second when I visited I had mutton rezala which just relaxed taste senses. I haven't tried ¬†other items over there thats why I have rated 3.5, but i'll keep trying different dishes in my next visits.

This is the most happening and crowded restaurant in khidderpore and serves really good moughlai food not just in terms of taste but also quality...the Dariyabadi biriyani is one of the best biriyani's i have eaten in recent times....you should also try thier Mutton chaap which is rich and extremely tasty....the Chicken Bharta is also good and is a must try......this restaurant has to separate eating halls one AC and the other non Non-Ac....i would suggested go for the air-conditioned area....overall this is a damn good restaurant for moughlai lovers.

went there many times,a true Awadhi style food place.last time I was spellbound by the lachcha paratha quality.first I thought 30 Rs for a lachcha is a little high,but man I was wrong.it was so good.i ate the full¬†paratha only..yes only..without any gravy and then ordered another to be eaten with rezala.it was perfect fiery hot,crusted,flaky,layered,inside soft..perfect.the rezala was also so good,that my friends kept telling me the restaurant is going to give me discount as I cleaned the plates and bowls by licking.yes I could not control,in rezala it is very difficult to optimize the sweetness,more sweet it is turned out to be a dessert with meat,less sweet,it is a white colored korma..so rezala is real difficult one to make.the rezala was with a perfect sina/rib bone¬†piece with lots of reyazi/marbling fat.as I am regular in other Kolkata Awadhi style places,so I can say this place must be ranked among the top Awadhi food players,on a side note,it is quite pocket friendly and ambience is very very good.

In a quest for brilliant biriyanis we landed up in Khidderpore, on one fine Sunday afternoon, to lunch in another one of the oldest resturants in the city, the Indian Resturant. The best things about this heritage resturants is the unique taste they bring to your platter. We ordered kebabs... (the stand out one was Mutton Barra Kebab)... Kacchi biriyani ( what a piece of mutton we got there, delicious and so soft) and an array of side dishes. All the side dishes complemented the biriyani like bread butter and honey. Mutton fry was just excellent. You dont have to worry about the cost and the service is good. Just visit the place and treat yourself

My present review, please change the quality of your biryani it is pathetic now. How can you compromise with your taste. I took biryani last weekend and trust me it is no more like before. Mutton half cooked rice was hard. Please do something!

After hearing so much praise, I finally got a mutton biriyani packed for me. So l cannot comment on the ambience, but the service was prompt and the person manning the counter was courteous & helpful.
I enjoyed the biriyani. It was a simple mutton biriyani, a simple but delightful one. There was no extravagance of oil, spices or fragrances. Everything was balanced... That's what I enjoyed the most. The portion was smaller than other biriyani places, but enough for one person. The price is at par with local standards.
Overall a good simple pocket-friendly biriyani.

After one bite I looked up at manager, raised my thumb. I took out extra for waiter & chef. Still lingering the taste. I'm looking for my partner to visit for a hearty Dinner.

It costed me 200 bucks ... the taxi fare not my bill (580) as i travelled from south kolkata after reading so many reviews claiming it to serve one of the best biryanis but it was hard to miss once we got there 

LOCATION (3/5)

AMBIENCE(2.5/5)

FOOD(OVR 2.5) //so low only due to the chaap

I ordered the Kachchi Biryani as it is famous for it ... huge disappointment I had to order 2 soft drinks to eat that plate of very greasy biryani They probably use Dalda. There were cashews and raisins something I didn't like at all. The Chaap was extremely bad too salty and felt cheapish I grossed out. But being a biryani buff I had to order a normal plate and took it back home. Their normal biryani was really good but nothing extraordinary about it.

so biryani -Mutton Kachchi(2.5/5), mutton normal(3.5/5)

Mutton Chaap(1.5/5)

PRICE(2/5) //too expensive
 the kachchi biryaniso all in all not worth it if you're close to Aminia/Shiraz/Arsalan/Zeeshan

Old customers of our's and older/better biriyani recipe. 
Had went with my boss. Even he ended up licking his fingers. 
We had ordered kochi biriyani and chicken tangdi kabab, both of which were amazing. Was getting late for home and thus had to hurry up. 
The place to visit in kidderpore just got updated.

I have not been to the actual restaurant, so can't comment on stuffs like ambience. Once I visit the place, this review would be updated with more details. I have had their cheese kebab and kachhi mutton biriyani at ecospace where they recently participated in a biriyani festival. The chicken cheese kebab was ultra awesome but the same, or even a fraction of it  cannot be said about the biriyani. As per my understanding  and knowledge, kachhi biriyani means where the meat and rice are cooked together till tender from absolute rawness. However what they meant was that the moderately sized mutton piece would remain kachhi while being served. The rating solely rest on the cheesy shoulder of the kebab.

The only con is that its inconveniently located. Its one of the best places to eat biriyani and their kachchi biriyani is just awesome. The regular biriyani is good but i prefer Royal at chitpur for that. However, i think the kebab here is a notch better.

The kachchi biriyani is not for the health freak....it has all that should perhaps be avoided to lose weight ..be healthy..etc etc ....but ...it is just yum!

If you are a true Biryani lover, you would know that nothing can fulfill a biryani craving other than a good, juicy plate of biryani. Also you would know that there is hardly anything in the world that a generous plate of biryani cannot cure! So it is that kind of biryani we are talking about here...
I have not been to India Restaurant, but I had heard so much about them that I decided to attend a Biryani festival they were participating in (in Eco Space, New Town, and thanks to that because it is tough for people up east to travel all the way to Kidderpore to grab a taste of heavenly biryani). And boy, was I in for a surprise!
I tried their paratha with mutton chaap, and chicken bharta, and to top it all the ever-so-good Kacchhi Biryani. 
This was like the marriage of the true-bred Awadhi Dastarkhwan and the Sub-e-Bangal Moghlai fare.
Words cannot describe the amazing experience that I had. Each grain of rice glistened with moist ghee, intact in size and texture, yet melted in the mouth. The mutton was tender and rightly flavored, handpicked, juicy pieces - lean yet meaty, soft yet striated! The boiled egg and potato was part of the package which made all bengalis go weak in the knees! The potato, once I dug into it felt like a lump of pure butter - dum-pukht or cooked over a 'slow flame'...and that made all the difference! I am told that the Daryabadi Biryani is also a must try...
The place is pocket-friendly, and service very prompt. Very, very earnestly and highly recommended by me.
Who knows maybe this Biryani will even cure a heartbreak!

The siiting arrangement is fine as well.. u can also go for ac dining rooms if u have a choice... and above all it wont give your pocket a pinch while clearing bills...!!

I was in kolkata a few days back to meet some friends. We all wanted to have a decent meal and then we found this place while surfing on zomato. It was easy to locate this place. It is located beside fancy market in kidderpore. India Restaurant is one among the best biriyani and kebab restaurants in kolkata. We reached this place around 1:30pm and it was crowded. They have air conditioned dining rooms and also the non ac dining rooms. We preferred the ac one. Here the service is a bit disappointing. After we sat down the waiter took about 5 minutes to address us. We asked for some water first and then ordered our food. 

For starters we ordered chicken tikka kebab, chicken afgani and chicken hot n sour soup. The starters were at our table in around 10 minutes. The kebabs were exceptional. They were tender, juicy and were perfectly cooked. I loved the chicken afgani. It was an amazing experience for my palate. The soup was fine.

For the main course we had a daryabadi biryani, laccha paratha, rumali roti, mutton chap and chicken dopiyaza. The mutton chap and the chicken dopiyaza were very oily. We had to drain out the oil first and then eat. I liked both the items. The were properly done and the meat was also cooked well. The laccha paratha and the rumali roti were spot on. The biryani was delecious. The mutton pieces were cooked to perfection. 

Then for deserts we ordered firni and sahi tukra. The sahi tukra was a royal treat to the taste buds. It had a nice flavour of saffron and cardamom. The firni was equally good. I had a lovely time here. This place serves some amazing food at reasonable prices and I recommend every one to try out this place.

AWESOME!! This word pretty much defines almost all the dishes (North Indian).....Specially the Biryani! I am a Biryani Fanatic! The smell and look of a biryani just makes me euphoric!!! So this place is like a heaven for me!¬†
They serve one of the best Biryanis in town! I have tried their Normal Chicken/Motton Biryani as well as their the-famous- and-legendary The Kachhi Biryani!!! The normal biryani is great, punched with the authentic flavor and smell of jaffran! One of a kind and Kolkata-style-biryani to the core!¬†
But I perosnally just love their Kachhi Biryani! Just astounding! ¬†Its more spicy and loaded with more flavors! The flavor is permeated with the rice, meat and the aloo (Potato) ! The Aloo and the chicken in the biryani is a treasure to die for! They serve it with fried onions which makes it even a grander dish to enjoy!

The other North Indian dishes are fantastic too! Amazingly cooked till perfection, preserving the flavor in each dish!! Their firnis and Rolls are also a 'must-have' for all!¬†
Service is fast! Ambiance is normal! Nothing extraordinary! But yeah the food surely is among the best of the bests!¬†

Food: 5/5 (Indian, Have't tried their Chinese yet)
Ambiance: 3/5
Service: 4.5/5

well , to simply put , a lovely food joint with wide range of kebabs and biryani . And it is easy on your pocket too. I won't call it a family restaurant but food is worthy to be mentioned . I love peshowari kebab and hariyali kebab but biryani is also good . The best time to hit the place is between 1:30 PM and 4:30 PM . one minor jolt is that you won't get Nann , a little bit disappointment but otherwise food is fresh and enjoyable . try butter masala of any kebab with romali roti rather than tandoori roti . A must visit place for any foodie . Please don't try vegetable preparation or Chinese .

Don't know how can some people say their biriyanis r one of the best in town..tasted like trash..dry with no special effects to tickle the taste buds..even the local shop in our muhalla makes better...used to go there during my student days when my pocket money was limited..back then it used to be good..both pocket friendly and good quality. But now it's nightmarish. .The mutton is of worst quality ...seems to be from roadside shop or they give stale mutton pieces from yesterdays handi. .found no spices but only biriyani flavoured artificial scents...It charges rs 140 for a plate of mutton biriyani but you can bet in arsalan @150 or dada boudi @ 160..believe me it's the best I've ever tasted..but india is the worst where I've wasted. ..plz don't over rate this under rated restaurant.Dont kill the biriyani culture of kolkata.

When it comes to Biryani, I so don't give this place a miss.
A definitely go-to place for all the Biryani lovers.
Take my word, you'll love it.

BEST BIRYANI IN KOLKATA !!!!! There , I said it. Being a predominantly Mughlai foodie , how could I have missed this joint ?? I feel ashamed that I never been here before. Located on Karl Marx Sarani , this restaurant is one of the oldest biryani makers in Kolkata. We ordered a CHICKEN CHEESE KABAB for starters which was MIND BLOWING !!!! The Chicken wrapped in a layer of cheese literally melted in my mouth. Then came the KACCHI BIRYANI was filled with surprise ; every spoon I had of it gave a new flavour which was pure magic. The DARIYABADI BIRYANI was also unique and had 2 pieces of mutton. Both the biryani had an egg and an aalo each. The side dish MUTTON KADAI was the best companion to the biryanis . Finally the FIRNI without which my biryani doesnt get digested came and it was wonderful too. Prices were reasonable. Sanitation was unsatisfactory , but when U get food like this , U ignore all flaws. The waiter was helpful too. I shouldn't be so quick to judge , but perhaps India Restaurant serves better biryani than Arsalan.

India restaurant has been an amazing place for biryani..I really loved there afghani chicken and the biryani taste is mouth watering...but the ambience needs to be changed a little...need to be more comfortable and maintained...if not its a great place for non vegetarians...

The food is spectacular... The kachchi biryani is definitely top notch... Servers do possess the sence of hospitality. There is a bit difference in the price for Ac and non ac. In the latter you pay 170 for kachi biryani where as in ac you need to shell out some more as it comes for 210. Do not expect to get wifi connection as mentioned here on zomato or else you might face disappointment...

Kachchi Biriyani Is Synonymous with this joint and till date i had the best Chicken and Mutton roll in my life at this phenomenon Called Indian. Thank god i worked at Hide road and my boss often use to treat us at lunch and Indian Was our favourite. I remember giving a huge birthday treat to all my collegues from indian but the money i spent was dirt cheap compatred to the feast. Their Biriyanis and Kachchi biriyanis are just heavenly concoctions, I just love their Mutton Kalia and Chicken stew and their Chaaps are to die for.

This is the best place for biriyani in kolkata 
I have tried all the so called biriyani joints in kolkata starting from arsalan to shiraz to haji ali to ali baba
Nothing beats this
Must try kacchi biriyani
Tikka/kebabs are okay
Do not expect a fancy ambience 
This place means business when it comes to biriyani 
Stone throw distance from fancy market.

The quality of biriyani here is quite good. Atmosphere is friendly and service is alright. The only con is unlike the Arsalan biriyani, this one tends to leave a strange taste on the mouth once the biriyani starts to cool down. I really don't know why, though.

The normal biriyani is also very good.. Succulent chicken / mutton.. The kebabs are also very good :)
The ambience and the location of the place is a little inconvenient and unsafe..
But the food makes up for all of that

A friend of mine once asked "when did u had the best biriyani of ur life?" , for which i told some blah blah blah. He was quick to suggest this place and told me two special biriyanis with a final warning of "be ready to get ur mind blown" . Thus, three of us visited this place on a saturday for lunch. Typical biriyani joint, no one will give a second look at this place. We ordered those two special biriyanis - Mutton Kachhi Biriyani and Mutton Daryabadi Biriyani. By god they turned out to be something special. The Kachhi biriyani had a fine aroma and smooth touch to it with two pcs mutton and one egg. While the Daryabadi was spicier(nothing too spicy) and was completely different from those traditional biriyani we have. Both of them was poles apart in recipe and presentation but both of them tasted equally good. I recommend these two biriyanis to all foodies. And btw beware of the qty cause three of us was unable to finish the two plates. I was completely satisfied with the sumptuous lunch we had there and wish to visit this place once more in the near future

Few of us were kinda bored of the food we were consuming for last few days so on a Saturday afternoon during the breakshift hours we went to this place. Well I must say we were not disappointed. Very welcoming ambience. Healthy environment. Clean and hygienic. Good food. Tasty, healthy, flavourful. Wisely priced. For us the experience was good. I wont hesitate to suggest this place to someone else. Burpppp!!

One of kolkata's most famous restaurants for 'Biryani'. Situated in the heart of khiddirpore, the place is deemed to serve a good mughlai affair.¬†
Ambience has been modernized recently as is evident from the interiors, but place is still small with lot more number of tables than there should be.
Has an A/C separate area which is an added advantage.¬†
Lets get down to the food now, on a weekday afternoon at 3pm the restaurant was bustling with people. Commendable i must say, cause looking at the prices it was sure that the crowd was here for GOOD FOOD and not pocket-friendly food.
We ordered - Chicken biryani (Yes, I and my friend dont prefer the mutton), Mutton chaap, Chicken butter masala and FIrni.

Chicken biryani - was good. well cooked. rightly flavoured. Nothing heavenly.
Mutton chaap - Over cooked, meat was chewy and the chaap gravy had more oil than the masala.
Chicken butter masala - white in colour! First time in my life a waiter tells me butter masala is supposed to be white and malai butter masala is supposed to be red. Anyways at Rs.180 for 4 medium chunks of chicken is pretty expensive. The chicken was over cooked and hard. And the gravy was more oil than masala.
Firni - the saviour of the day. Was beautifully made.

Overall experience. Is ok for a one time visit. But definitely not if you want to showcase calcutta biryani to your friends.

India Restaurant is not the most sanitary of restaurants what with the perennially unclean tables, glasses, rickety chairs and littered floors but if you rise above that and listen to your hunger-struck bodies, this is the place to be! The air-conditioned section charges about 30-50 bucks more per dish than the ordinary section, as is the case with most such restaurants.¬†

My father had heard of the place from Pakistani co-passengers on a train and we had to come here, as ashamed as we were not having known about it ourselves!

It was my brother's treat and we ordered:
(1) Chicken Hariyali Kebab: Six large chunks of succulent chicken that is bound to leave you wishing you could have the whole plate to yourself! To top it off, they do provide adequate amounts of onion and chutney to go with the chicken.
(2) Chicken Reshmi Kabab: Squirt enough lemon juice on your kebabs and you will be transported to other worlds! Tasty, juicy and large-sized, the kebabs are served hot.¬†
(3) Mutton Biryani: Delicious, with one tender piece of mutton and one well-cooked potato; and just the right amount of oil, neither too much nor too less.
(4) Chicken Special Biryani: The only thing special about Special Biryani is the extra piece of chicken (and an egg). Upon later reflection, we agreed that it would have been better to take TWO plates of their ordinary chicken biryani rather than the special one. It was lip-smacking delicious but the potato will remain the star for me. The rice is white and orange in parts, something I don't prefer to see but it didn't harm the taste itself. ¬†
(5) Mutton Rezala: A bit too sweet for my liking and lacking a bit of spice, I enjoyed dipping ends of my Tandoori Roti in the gravy and munching away. However, my father sure made a clean job of it.
(6) Chicken Chap: It was rich, red and ripping good.¬†
(7) Tandoori Roti: Ordinary and easily turned cold, dry and difficult to tear.
(8) Phirni: Only for those with a sweet tooth. If I were to close my eyes and eat it, I would have believed you if you told me it was mishti doi, only denser.

Service was swift and friendly.¬†Amounting to a touch above Rs 1300, we paid the bill and left the place content and willing to return as soon as possible.

The best Biriyani I have had so far. They are just best at doing that. though the location is not that good or you dont get much privacy as you have to share tables like the resturants in Lucknow but the food is awesome and I have never had any hygiene related issues over there. The price that they charge is also very decent and doesn't burn a hole in the pocket. Been there lots of times with friends but then again if you want to take some one close to you and want to have some privacy then this is probably not the place for you.

Located in Khidderpore, this place serves the best biryani in town. Its not too oily, the meat portion is sufficiently large and the taste just awesome. In fact all their dishes are excellent, special mention should be made of their chicken tandoori, which is succulent and cooked to perfection. Another of my favourite is their chicken haryali kebab. They serve the best haryali kebab I have eaten anywhere. Chicken haryali kebab with rumali roti and pudina chutney is just lip smacking. Don't expect a great ambience here though, its always jam packed, your best bet is to parcel the food.

Love the Special Mutton Biryani\Kacchi Biryani with the Afgani Chicken Chaap and the Chicken Peshawari Kebab\Masala. Also the Halim(Only available during Ramzan period) is more than awesome and I never miss it!!!

Specialized in all mughal cuisine preferably beriyani.. Nothing more can be described than the true taste of authentic mughal tradition... Best past is that the menu will make you feel easy to go through some of it's speciality... Service is good with well trained staff... Good value against money...

Few good review, drag me to India Restaurant. An odd route from my place, very near to Fancy Market.. We parceled ¬†Biriyani, one Kacchi Biriyani & mutton stew. The biriyani is ok & very light, though the quality of rice is not the best compared to as available in other places in Kolkata I liked the Kacchi biriyani very much which was very spicy. Both the preparation contain a massive piece of mutton. What I liked was the mutton stew.
Overall a good experience, and will suggest other to try once.

I had Biryani here once. Was actually taken for a ride by the tremendous name it has earned in recent past. However the Biryani served dat day wasnt too fine to be rated to a higher scale. The quantity was wholesome n 3 plates of Biryani could not be exhausted by 4 of us. However I wish to try the Biryani once again when I visit that part of the city in future and put down my final review.

Today visited the kidderpore fancy market .. Nd thus visiting the india resturant is a must. Its famous for its biriyani.. We had biriyani, paratha and mutton stew.. Though the mutton stew did not in anyway look like a stew but the taste was really good. The biriyani was very good.. Most importantly No Dalda!! Worth a good meal.. Nd quiet reasonable..

Well, this was long pending visit. Heard so much of this place being biriyani hub in Kidderpore area.
5 of us visited the place and had lovely lunch on sunday afternoon.

Place - We went to A/C section on hot summer day, and we got a table for 5 people immediately. There were not many people out there on that time.

Food -  We have chicken biriyani , mutton biriyani, with chicken tikka kabab. 
Biriyani was good, less oily, mutton piece was soft, tender and well cooked. 

Had cold drinks with biriyani, and ended with firni.  My friend took Sahi Tudkra , which was awesome. Will try out that next time.

Service - Its as always, good , and quick.

Overall - a very nice place. will visit there again.

Best biryani according to me in kolkata.
This place is cheap compared to its competitors like arsalan,amina,shiraz etc but taste better then all of there biryanis.
Kababs r soft n succulent they melt in the mouth :)
Chicken cheese kabab the specialty of this restaurant is d best kebab in the whole world even it can give delhi's chandni chowk karims a run for its money. I have tried kebabs at world famous karim's chandni chowk Delhi trust me the chicken cheese kabab available here is better
this place has not got the hype like arsalan or shiraz but is undoubtedly better than them when it comes t taste.
n last but not the least the chicken roll out here is a must have even if ur stomach is full just push ur self n have the roll u would cheerish the taste for atleast a lifetime or more :P

I order my lunch from India atleast  3 times a week since my office is nearby. Best mutton biriyani in town with juicy succulent pieces of mutton with just the right amount of fat. The rice is less oily and hence lighter when compared to others. My fav biriyani joint in Kolkata. Also their Afghani kebab is a must try along with kadai mutton. The kadai chicken is also good but the amount of chicken served in this dish is unbelievable when compared to the price. Overall a good value for money mughlai restaurant. The ambience might not be exactly what you are looking for but the food makes it up to you.

The famous Kacchi Biriyani which is cooked in DUM along with the raw meat tasted very different. However, I found it to be a bit oily which is not what we expect these days. But some may argue that what is Biriyani after all without a greasy plate!! The succulent meat was cooked well done and aroma it emitted was special. The quality of rice was as fine as it could be. Also had Chicken Rezala which was okay. The place is a bit compromise if you are with your family. Mornings are better any day.

India Restaurant in Kidderpore is one of the most famed eating houses of the area. There was a time when work took me to the area atleast a couple of times a week plus almost every Sunday would go to Fancy Market for dvd's and cd's of music and movies. As a youngster the Chap and Paratha was all I could afford and sometimes I would cajole my parents into allowing me to pack the Biryani and Chaap for dinner at home and that would be a very happy meal for me ! There Daryabadi Biryani is famed and as a Parsi I often feel its sort of like a cousin to Beri Pulao because of the presence of dry-fruits in it though the Beri Pulao is much lighter. Visited a while back when I had gone that side for some work and packed Chicken Chaap and Daryabadi Biryani also packed the famed Chicken India Special Cheese Kebab since I love Arsalan's version of it. The food was pretty darn good though naturally a bit heavy .... the kebabs were really nice but I would prefer if they used a tad less color on them. I am already looking forward to my next visit.

Got to know about India Restaurant from Zomato. So me with 3 of my friends visited the place. Typical mughlai restaurant ambience, nothing spaecial. Ordered their speciality Dariyabadi biriwani, achari murgh, mutton burra, India restaurant special kabab, firni and shahi tukra. The biriwani was the best I have ever had so far in my life. it was very rich and came in a huge amount. Loved the mutton burra and India restaurant special kabab. Didnt acyually like the achari murgh, the chicken pieces were not well cooked. The shahi tukra is probably best in the town.

After reading so much about India restaurant in Zomato it remained in my wish list for a while..Finally got a chance to pay a visit there. Standing right beside five star market in khidderpore, this place was easy to find.It remains crowded most of the time and specially during lunch hours due to its craze in biriyanis..We were a group of 3 and the waiters generously helped us to find a table.. They have 2 different sections -AC and non AC sections.. There's nothing to tell about ambiance as it is nothing special..So coming to the food directly.. We ordered India Special Cheese Kabab, Daryabadi biriyani ,one special mutton biriyani and Chicken Achari..
Hats off to the cheese kabab!! It was just awesome. One of the best kababs i had in my life till now. Cooked very lightly , the chicken was soft and juicy surrounded by a thick cheesy layer and grilled from outside..I would definitely visit again for the kababs at least.. Cant say about other kababs but this, being their special kabab is likely to compete some of the great Moghlai restaurants in the city..
Coming to the biriyani--Darybabadi biriyani was very light , contained 2 pieces of mutton ,1 egg and a large potato. Mutton was boiled and cooked perfectly and they serve generous quantity.. This tasted great along with the chicken achari which was recommended by the servers..Its a boneless dish ..The gravy was just brilliant but the chicken was a great disappointment .. Those were not boiled perfectly and we had to chew and chew and chew and finally had to get rid of them..
If u r hovering through that area, u might take a chance to taste their biriyani and kababs.. Well recommended!!!

thanks to the Biriyani and kebab Festival at City Centre. i had heard about India Restaurant from my father who had food from the place during his college days. since kidderpore is off the route, i never had a chance of tasting the food of this mughlai specialist. loved the chicken chap and lachchha paratha. the hariyali kebab was so good that we went back the next day just to get it parceled inspite of tasting it the first day. but i simply loved the chicken resmi kebab which can give competition to any good kebab joint of old delhi. the biriyani was good but i would not say the best. recoomended

This review is actually written after two days of Kabab eating from India hotel Kidderpore stall at City Center I at the Biryani Kabab festival. The manager assured me that all the kababs they had there were also available at the restaurant. I went there yesterday and got the Chicken Cheese Kabab, which took 15 minutes to cook, and was served with a side of salad and mint chutney. The cheese formed a thick crust around the meat, and squeezing some lemon on it cut through the thick cheese and gave it a lovely balance. It was also super-heavy. 

My friend got a Mutton Handi which was quite good, and we also split a Chicken Peshawari Kabab today. The Peshawari Kabab is a bunch of chicken wings coated in a curd-based marinade cooked in tandoor. I loved dipping it into the mint chutney and eating it with some raw onions. It was also quite heavy, and I was full after eating a plate of it. There was also the Kachhi Biryani which I wanted to pack home, but it was wiped clean by the time I ordered it. Would love to go to the hotel soon and get me some more kababs and Biryani.

For the experience of Day One, check this link - http://presentedbyp.blogspot.in/2014/02/biryani-kabab-festival-at-city-center-i.html



----- 17 May, 2013 -----

Two Words - Daryabadi Biryani. If you are around Fancy Market area, and you want to eat Biryani with dry fruits, especially Aloo bukhara in it, then this is the place. One plate is BIG for one person, and even a big eater like me cannot finish it all without struggling. We generally order one Daryabadi Biryani, a mutton/chicken Chaap, and a chicken hariyali tikka for two people, and that is happiness within 500/-, and a full stomach for two. If you are lucky, you will also get the shahi tukda, which drips with clotted cream.

Service is brisk, and very efficient. You should see the way they carry food around, almost about to topple, but then suddenly they manage not to topple at all. The skill is worth watching. I have been here a number of times, although not in the last year. I have heard their standard have fallen slightly, but I will not believe it until I eat their meat again.

This restaurant is closer home for me, so more the joy of having such a nice place close home. As given in other reviews, their Biryani is a must have. The Biryani here is very light and simply delicious. It really competes hard with the ones served by Arsalaan.

The place is typical to all restaurants serving mughal food. The ground floor is non-ac and is crowded. The 1st floor has a.c and meant for family, thus a bit pricier. But the place is very clean. The Biryani was a revelation. Light and delicious making you want for more. Another must have is the Mutton Chaap they serve. The meat was very tender (it felt like the meat melted in your mouth) and the preparation absolutely delicious. All this at very affordable prices. Many won‚Äôt like the place because the food isn‚Äôt very heavy, but for me it does the trick.

People should try this place at least once and they‚Äôll surely never regret it. It‚Äôs definitely recommendable.

If you are looking for a light biriyani which does not make you feel bloated & take "dhakar"- India is the place. Arguably, the lightest biriyani in the town which definitely do not compromise on the taste. The ambience of the eatery is not that great & hence I would recommend to bring it back home & to enjoy with family- even kids can enjoy the taste of biriyani & can digest :) I tried Kacchi biriyani & that too was greta in taste- with soft mutton pieces!

Location (Rating - 5):
Just beside 5 star market, you cannot miss the place.

Ambiance (Rating - 3):
A moderate ambiance. Could have been better if it was a little less crowded.

Service (Rating - 2):
The service is not very good not very bad...i say 50:50. It has a more local experience.

Food (Rating - 3):
The time when the India Restaurant started, it was unbeatable in food. Specially the Biryani, I used to consider and rate the biryani of India Restaurant better than Arsalan. But with time the quality has downgraded, a lot. Like the tikka and reshmi kababs a lot here. Other dishes are worth trying and am not saying its bad but since I have had better quality of food at this place I was a little disappointed.

Price (Rating - 5):
The price compared to the food is very nominal.

No big ass review for this one.
Was very disappointed today with this restaurant today, Chicken handi was so badly prepared. Was tasting like a mish-mash of a tikka masala. And the biryani, we ordered chiken got served mutton. Still kept cool and continued, but the taste was so bland. Although the tea I ended with calmed my mind a bit.

Once upon a time this place used to be the thek for a quick trip over the 2nd bridge for a short drive on bike and a biryani stop.
Very sad to give this kind of a review to one of my favorite places.

The food is awesome and mouth watering, you would like to feed jourself till your stomach screams for hault. The Chicken Afgani,Reshmi Kebab and Paratha are a delightfull. the Biryani is  awesome. please try the kacchi  Biryani also.
During the holy month of Ramzan you wolud find "HALEEM "which is very famous.
I have been to this Restaurant often for last few year.
The staff is very cooperative and humble..The ambiance is average ,but worth the taste and aroma of food here.The sweeter dishes are also equally good.

Memories flood back as I decided to write my review for India but then I decided to have a go at India once before I would start to write this so that I could state the present situation of the restaurant also.
Then I got busy with my life and I forgot until life sprang up a surprise for me.
I got selected in G.R.S.E. to complete my internship and of course going to Metiabruz from my house would have to be via Khidderpore.
However again every day I used to see it and every day I would think, not today, I will be here for 2 months non stop anyways.
It all boiled down to the last 2 days of my internship.

On the second last day I went and decided to sit and eat so I ordered a Mutton Biryani, Chicken chaap and then a paratha.
The biryani was very less spicy and low on oil. It is good isn't it?? If you can keep a biryani which tastes like a biryani with less spices and oil it is advantageous what matters is the taste and it was right there just on the mark. Not the best biryani because you just can't compare some of the leading ones today as all are more or less around the same mark. Some a bit less some a bit more.

The chicken chaap gravy was really fine and when I asked for more masala and less oil I was served to my liking which is what I appreciate. In a fast running Mughlai joint if someone takes out time to bring the order just like you wanted you can't help but appreciate it. Too small thing to appreciate? No, it really does make a difference as very few pay attention or care enough. However sadly I could not enjoy the chaap It had a burnt smell in it. 

Must have been a mistake but I feel the management could maybe keep an eye on whether the curry is all right. If it is not good enough then take the chaap off the menu for the time being and start making the base gravy or whatever that can be called again. Trust me if anybody can then India can surely. It is the single most well known restaurant in whole of Khidderpore thus of course they have done very well as the are is where Muslim is a majority and thus serving the cuisine which matches the preferences of the crowd surely does well. This can also be seen through the fact that despite bengali cuisine is a household regularity people still go to so many bengali restaurants. Its nearness to Fancy Market has also been an advantage as many people come here for different reasons. For me it was always some pirated game DVD's :P and thus India was my choice for a lunch.

The Paratha was very good but oily as I tried to reduce the oil by pressing it with a napkin but I wished there were some other breads available then.
The last day of my internship I packed a Daryabadi Biryani back home. Now the daryabadi biryani is rich and a bit sweet because a lot of raisins nuts and other fruits do into it and numerous spices. The briyani here is too rich and oily and different quite a lot from it's regular biryani though pretty good to taste. The mutton pieces were 2 in number. While one of them was perfectly cooked and soft and melt in the mouth type the other was rather a bit chewy. However the new taste and touch to the regular biryani will be something you will remember.

The decor is nice especially in the A.C. section with tiled walls and marbled floors, white ceiling. Quite nice for a regular Mughlai halt in fact quite better than the regular mughlai halt I should say.

I will miss it again for God knows how many days till I can pay another visit. The fact that the area is too crowded and car parking there is tough is also a disadvantage.

Despitr the chaap with a burnt taste and the slightly chewy piece of mutton in the daryabadi biryani I am still giving it a 4 based on old memories and the fact that they have been more or less always right on their taste thing.

Went to the restaurant with high expectations after reading lots of good reviews and after trying many of their famous items i can say that its a decent mughlai restaurant, nothing special or extraordinary, there are many mughlai joints in kolkata which serve better food than this one at kiddirpore..though its popular among locals but not worth going there from different part of the city to try their mughlai items.. Dariyabadi biriyani is good but too heavy on stomach, very rich, not for health conscious people, they don't serve naan or kulcha, only bread item available is laccha paratha which is very oily and made of dalda, fish tikka was bad, they dont use vetki, very low quality, bad smelling fish is being used for making fish tikka, chicken hariyali tikka which is supposed to be the most succulent of the kababs was very very disappointing, its not green,its almost black and no aroma or taste of coriander or mint in it, chicken peshawari kababs are small chicken legs ,white in colour like reshmi kabab & tastes like reshmi also, only gravy item we tried was mutton masala, gravy was too oily and tasteless and little sweet. it has two sections-one non ac which is like a big canteen where mainly local people eat rolls, biriyani and drink tea, another ac section where the ambiance is very  ordinary also, though its a very old restaurant and not a fine dining also still one expects some kind of good atmosphere to eat..price is cheap so if you are in the fancy market area with friends then you can visit there & eat mughlai food at cheap price but not worth going there with family in some special occasions..

they are a legacy and they live up their name .their food has never disappointed me . and I have been going there for the last 5 years . India restaurant is famous for  their Biryani and one if them is my anytime all time favourite is the kachhi biryani and the mutton Biryani I have more of a bland palatte so this appeals to me .my friends usually go for the more spicy varieties but almost every single time we go for biryani  .they also have a fast service and good staff

Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, the great Bengali " Musician of Musicians ", in an interview, once told that "Good music is like good food, it touches the hearts all over the world ".... So is the food from India Restaurant, it touches the heart. Like Pandit Nikhil Banerjee's sitar recital, it spellbounds the customers' heart throughout it course from the plate to the oesophagus. Being a doctor, I always have the opportunity to attend conferences followed by lunch/dinner in almost all the Calcutta restaurants and hotels, including all the five stars several times. In my honest opinion, this medium sized restaurant at Kidderpore offers the most delicious food of them all . Sounds overrated ? Not at all. I have come to this conclusion after 7 years of research with all the restaurants in Calcutta. Though they make wonderful Chinese preparation, I am talking about their north Indian dishes, especially the kebabs and the plain mutton biryani with a piece from the vertebral column (back). 

How to compare ? Have Mutton Biryani or Tandoori Chicken at lunch from 'India' and have the same at dinner from the place you want to compare with, you will feel the difference immediately. But if you give a 7 days gap between the two you may not make out the difference. Two kebabs, namely 'Peshawari chicken' and 'Afghani chicken' are simply heavenly. But when you take a kebab, make sure to have it between 2 pm and ask them to "make it soft". The softening of the kebab is a specialised job and depends on the man behind the Tandoor. Not everyone have the ability to "make it soft". Besides the outstanding quality, what overwhelms me, along with the people of Kidderpore-Ekbalpore, is the quantity and the price. 

No restaurant, in Calcutta, offers such a good quality food, in such a good quantity and in such a standard price( till the date of this review). If somebody finds a better place, please let me know. However, the quality of cooking may not be outstanding everyday as it depends upon several factors, and during Durga Puja and Eid, the quality falls a bit. Highly recommended for taking away a parcel and enjoy the food at office/home. If you have the taste buds of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the inventor of "Kalkatta Biryani" and the pioneer of biryanis and kebabs in Bengal, surely you will fall in ¬†love with the Chef.

This is one must try place in Kolkata, one hidden place which the city's elite might not be aware of or conveniently ignored. I accept the interiors and location isn't something to boast about but the food...well, try out its kebabs, tandoori or its biryani and that's it...you would give a damn about its ambience or its crowd. Prompt service, affordability and cleanliness compliment the lip smacking food.

Visited on 21.12.12.
Had heard a lot about this eatery, and my first visit was worth the wait.
Had a Mutton Kachhi Biryani, which was rather good. Tasty, succulent and mildly sweet with cashew and raisin. Found it quite rich. The mutton piece was so tender and well cooked. The quantity was almost too much. The potato as usual not up to the mark (as is in most places). The egg could have been dispensed with too.
Unfortunately they had run out of Thumsup, so had to do with a Pepsi.
Ended meal with a reasonably well made gajar-ka-halwa.
While there, a waiter served tandoori chicken at another table, and the smell that wafted in made me want to try it out right then!

Probably the best Biryani in the region. It has been a habit to visit them whenever I go to Fancy Market. The chaap has definitely not upto the mark but the biryani is awesome.
