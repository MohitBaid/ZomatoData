This place was a nightmare... Food was awful, but the service was even worse. We were a large group, that might have caused some issues... but they clearly stated that they can host large audiences. Each dish took hours to get to the table. The Tom yum soup was just horrendous and too spicy. 
But that's not the worst part. We were supposed to get a 15% discount due to the discomfort, but instead they added the 15% to the bill by "mistake". 
Anyways enjoy your good amigo (if you dare to go there)

We went here with a nearbuy voucher for Indian non veg meal. The place was quite empty and we were the sole people present on that evening. The decor is good but their main attraction is the most vital which is of course the food. The kebabs served were mouth watering and perfect. Same goes for their main course. Simply amazing food and loved their preparations. I would definitely like to visit again.

Hotel Thames International is located in Ekdalia just beside Rajlakshmi Jewellers. Its two minute walking from Gariahat more. This hotel has a small restaurant mainly serves Chinese and Indian cuisine, which is decked elegantly with tone of coffee-brown furnishing and beige table linen. Today evening I had the pleasure of meeting my old school friends at this unimportant restaurant. As usual they asked me to plan the menu, we started with ‘Chicken Sweet Corn’ & ‘Chicken Hot & Sour’ Soup. Both soups were nicely prepared; taste, flavours & fillings were good.

Then we tried ‘Crispy Chili Chicken’ & ‘Schezwan Fish’ as starters. I had a bite of Schezwan Fish and it was AMAZING! All credit goes to the chef for cooking this delicious dish. Crispy Chili Chicken was definitely different but we found it’s just above average, may be its too common as Chinese starter. Quality and quantity were also good enough. These starters really set our mood for main course.

After few discussion we finally decided to had ‘Sweet & Sour Fish’, ‘Hot Garlic Chicken’, ‘Mix Fried Rice’, ‘Chicken Hakka Noodles’ & ‘Green Salad’, accompanied with ‘Masala Cola’ mocktails. Sweet & Sour Fish & Hot Garlic Chicken was gravy based dish but spices and sauce used were different. Both dish cooked well and tasted very nice. Sweet & Sour Fish tasted awesome with Mix Fried Rice, really enjoyable dish, definitely recommended. Hot Garlic Chicken & Chicken Hakka Noodles were also nicely done and taste great. About Masala Cola, it tasted very average; in fact I don’t even like it. For dessert we had ‘Hot Gulab Jamun’ and it was just so so. Nice place to chat along with your buddy’s, we definitely will be back.

This restaurant is a part of "Hotel Thames", located just opposite to Aliya cinema hall. This place is fabulously decorated and has a optimistic environment. It provides both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. So if you are a person who loves to cherish their meal under the open air, then is somewhere you should definitely pay a visit. This outlet is more than sufficiently spacious and the waitera and other staffs are very courtious and smooth in their service. Though they serve both north indian and chinese cuisines but as the name "Terrace Tandoor" suggests they specializes on north indian and tandoori delicacies. Their kababs are splended and will leave you licking your finger till the very last moment. Their north indian cuisines comprising of -naans, pulao, chicken butter masala, mutton hyderabadi etc are among their best offerings and worth cherishing. This restaurant provides a complete dining experience in a luxurious manner and in an excellent and unbeatable environment.

Ambiance was very good and the waiters were very cooperative. The food was very awesome, specially the murgh butter masala. It is a spacious restaurant and a perfect one to hang out with a large group of friends. Friends, you should go and have a lunch or dinner in this restaurant. I will surely go to the restaurant very soon for another bite of the murgh butter masala.
