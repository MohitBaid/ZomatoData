The ambience was nice very homly nice music but let's come to the main point I think you need to improve on your food my noodles n rice were floating in oil there was no quality or quantity. And your hot garlic chicken we ordered was really dynamically spicy we couldn't even eat it. Hope we get better food when we visit the next time .

Well during puja I had visited various restaurant, the common issue is that the restaurant serves below quality dishes. So this time I thought to give visit to some new places. And I must say that it was a brave decision coming true. The name itself starts appetizing your tummy and after completing me dinner I really felt so.
I ordered fish and chips and crispy chicken for starters and both were superb specially the fish dish.
In main course I had mixed rice,smoke hot fish and BBQ chicken. 
All were just yummy. The taste,the quantity and also the quality were A grade. Till date in this puja I had one of my best Chinese dishes.
I must also say the hospitality from the people of restaurant were too good.
Wish to give me second visit soon.

Few days ago I visited this place near my house . Was very hungry so straightaway ordered Mixed Rice and Smoked Chicken.  

The rice was very good . Fine quality and quantity . Loaded with egg , chicken and prawns . 

Smoked Chicken was okayish . Was expecting it to be better . 

Will surely give another visit to try some more items on the menu :)

I went to this outlet with my school friends and wow it's a steal for any foodie! The starters were perfectly made. Fish and chips is out of this world. Both chicken and fish starters were delicious! Then came Spaghetti with meat balls, well what to say it can definitely beat any luxury restaurants in this. Fried rice and the main fish dish with honey were equally good. The brownie made by the owner was just perfect.

Overall a 5star experience.
Definitely coming back!

Strolling on a janmasthami afternoon we landed in "The Tummy Tucker" for a quick luncheon with my brothers as a post rakhi treat! We entered a quirky lane with colourful graphics on the wall and then a very purple and blueish interior. 
Ambience: The lightning were dim, but nice and soothing, cozy.
Food: We ordered Spaghetti with meat balls, Chicken BBQ , Chicken Rice with some mocktails and Brownie-ice cream for dessert! They were all delicious.. specially the spaghetti was uber delicious. 
Special mentions ....*the tasty brownie filled with such crunchies and dry fruits ... nice bake.üëåüèªüëåüèª

Staff and people : Very nice and warm ... orders were quick and friendly staff !!
