This was in my wish list for quiet sometime... But finally when I could make it with a small group of friends few days back , it was a royal disappointment. Food quality is poor and too much oily food. Since we don't have many dhaba options in South kolkata this one is among the very few options available. If price is not a criterion then better to avoid Jai Hind Dhaba.

A restaurant with good food options, a place we opt for on a regular basis mostly for our Office Lunch. Chicken Bharta, Mutton Keema Mattar is our hot favorite dish from this place. They have delicious North Indian Food Items. The mentioned items we normally order with Rulami rotis, and we literally lick our fingers. One bowl easily serves two person and the pricing of this place is pocket friendly too. Till date this outlet have never disappointed us.

Well , the interiors are typical dhaba style.Over here Dal Tarka and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala are the best , according to me.But the major problem of giving 3 instead of 4 rating is that they use DALDA
IF U KEEP THERE FOOD REFRIGERATED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IT BECOMES HARD LIKE STONE

Jai hind has one of the poplar joints in kolkata, j have stayed close to this dhaba for 5 years during my college days. TRUST ME 5 years and counting I have had several outing dinner , delivery late nights and simple walk-ins, jai hind has never ever disappointed in food and service, they have a heavy rush throughout but still they manage to serve u well, they don't have proper uniform for the serving people, no one speaks English, like u have I'm various restaurants but still they make it to the top of my list whenever I am in Kolkata.

At late night almost an hour before midnight ordered one plate chicken tandoori butter masala through swiggy. They delivered the food within the time , coming towards the food tandoori was super tender & delicious no doubt they are one of the best tandoori joints in Kolkata, the butter masala gravy was thick & flavour full but the emphasis of butter was missing it could be more flavour full by adding more butter to increase his taste.

Punjabi cuisine is so delicious in nature one can hardly express. JAI HIND DHABA keep up to its reputation and brings to you mouthwatering Punjabi dishes . Me and my friend visited today in the evening and it was already crowded . Luckily we got seats beside the window from where one can see the busy street while munching their food .So we kept it simple this time and ordered Tarka fry( Veg dish) and tawa roti with a plate of onion salad and cold drink. The roti was soft and the tarka was top notch accompanied by quick services .

If you're looking for the best Chicken Bharta in Kolkata, there is just one name i.e. Jai Hind Dhaba. Though the other items are also good, their chicken Bharta takes the cake. It's spicy and flavoursome. Undisputedly the best Chicken Bharta in Kolkata.

One the among the prime north Indian food joints in the city.
Stationed at paddapukur this places delivers some wonderful set of dishes.
I usually land up here for their set of north indian curries and kabab's.
Well a few dishes that i would like to mention are the Masla kulcha , Sahi Paneer , Panner tikkia butter masala.
Among the chicken dishes i would definitely recomend Dahi and Handi chicken.
These items will just help you love the essence of this place.
So if you are looking to spend some time cherish some quality north india you should be headed to this place.

Don't judge this place by its name. It is a dhaba but provides damn good food at reasonable rates.
It has 3 floors of dining area and has won a lot of appreciation from well known food critics.
Its open until 2 am at night so after a night of partying you can come here and satisfy your hunger. The time does not affect the quality of food and speed of service.

Ordered Chicken do-piyaza, Roomali roti & Tandoori roti..... The taste of the curry of chicken do-piyaza was good.... But it was not cooked properly coz the pieces of chicken was very hard and dry... And tasteless... Either the pieces of the chicken was not fresh or it was fried and kept for a long time..... And for that i had to waste the food... It was very disappointing.... Should check the quality of the food before serving the customers....

Dhaba style food as suggested by the name itself. Though they also have Chinese cuisine available as seen in the menu. Chinese food in a dhaba!!! Isn't that an anomaly? Well can't comment on that as I didn't have it. But the North Indian fare is what you go for in a dhaba....and yes it's packed full of flavour and tasty. The tarka we had was delicious. The aaloo do pyaja was awesome. I felt that instead of the panir butter masala we should have ordered some other dish, for this dish though popular and recommended was banal. In the rotis, the garlic naan, lachha paratha and onion kulcha were really good. Price wise it is very reasonable. Nothing much by way of ambience. But that's ok....just go and enjoy the robust flavours of the dhaba food.

I went to Jai Hind Dhaba with my parents this puja , late at night because we knew this would be one of the few restaurants serving food even then. I'm a big fan of their "Chicken Bharta" and "Chicken Tikka Butter Masala (boneless)" . Their "Dal Makhani" is so so , I've had better. I don't particularly like dishes with potato but I make an exception for their "Alu do Pyaza" which is finger licking good. The red gravy in which they cook most their dishes is the winner for me , it's perfectly spiced and yet not too hot . Tjeor service is also quite fast. Will definitely keep visiting this place and I would highly recommend you to try it out .

This iconic eatery is undoubtedly the Best dhaba in town. For the north Indian food lovers, this is probably heaven. They also serve a wide range of Chinese food. Also their prices are really pocket friendly. Another major reason that makes it such an attraction is it remains open till midnight and is located near to most of the clubs and bars, and thus all the party goers can rely on this place to dine in at the wee hours. Also if seating is not available, they even serve the food to your car, as per convenience.

This is my third visit to Jai hind dhaba and it has never disappointed me with anything. Their chicken dishes are marvelous and so tasty that it'll leave you craving for more. The rotis are really soft and not at all chewy. The kebabs are a must try. Their Chinese food is decent but a tad bit on the oilier side. 

The décor isn't very fancy, resembles much of the highway AC dhabas with beautiful lampshades. The service is fast and all the staff members are good too. It's been 3years I've been visiting this place and still haven't got any complaints for them. If you haven't yet tried it, without any second thoughts, Go for it.

My friend and I walked into Jai Hind for lunch. We started with a Thai Soup which took an hour to arrive and on consuming one spoonful  we quickly put the spoon down and took a swig of water because of the amount of spice they had thrown in thoughtlessly. We moved on to the main course wherein we were served a salt less butter chicken and decent slices of roomali roti. To take it all down I ordered fresh lime water, as luck would have it, the glass of lime water was saturated with salt to such an extent that it had to replaced immediately. Unfortunately, it was an appalling time dining in here.

Jai Hind Dhaba was in my wishlist from a long time and finally ticked it off few days back. Situated in a very convenient location, it is almost house full most of the times specially in the weekends. JHD also features in late night restaurants, well that is the advantage they have because their are very few restaurants which are open till late. 

Now coming to the food we tried:
Chicken Tandoori: This is really worth trying. Grilled to perfection chicken pieces with salad. Loved it!

Chicken Bharta: Shredded pieces of chicken cooked in Indian spices. Recommended by the waiter himself and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Dal Makhani: Goes well with Indian breads like roti and naa. 

Rumali Roti and Naan: I personally love rumali roti and this was as soft as I expected. Naan as said by my family was a good one too.

Overall had a good dining experience. Looking forward to visit again.

Can't it be more that 5 stars ?!
No other place in Kolkata can beat it's Paneer Do Pyaaza and Roomali Roti (I'm a Vegetarian).

If you're broke, Jai Hind is the place for dinner.

If you've partyed like anything, Jai Hind is the place for after party dinner.

You will never find this place empty. Jai Hind is a welcoming place for every kind of crowd be it friends or family, obviously the time should be take care of :p


Pro Tip: Always jump to Main Course. If you still want a Starter you can go for Crispy Chilli Babycorn.

The food quality is super. If you are a vegetarian then you should try Paneer Butter Masala. It is awesome. Specially the cubes of paneer are almost of same size and that appeals me a lot to eat. Rest its open past midnite so you can dine there easily. It a saviour for people like me who travel a lot.

I went during Durja Puja and was disappointed by their small menu n less option..we loved their tandoori chicken but the main course was ok..we expected better food since we waited more than an hour to get a table

One of the iconic late night restaurants of Kolkata. Every party goers do drop by to collect their take seats. They do offer seats but owing to the huge demand the restaurant mostly remains over crowded. They also deliver to the near by parked cars. That is you can wait and have your dinner in the car itself. Chicken Bharta is the dish to die for

One of the best in India. This place needs no introduction.
Food: excellent
Service: due to high footfall, expect 5 mins extra but worth trying.

So had visited this place really late at night, rather early morning @5am, even then the place was pretty full, staffs were too busy providing their service.. tried their butter nun, masala kulcha ,butter reshmi chicken and raita- all the items were upto the mark, sufficient quantity, taste was also good.. so those who are looking for late night open restaurants, they can come here :)

An extraordinary place to dine in. All cuisines you check out there are amazing on the menu card. I went out with my friends after my exam got over. The place was occupied with more of youngsters. We ordered Garlic Naan, Laccha Parantha, Masala Kulcha, Dal Makhani and Some panner ka sabzi( which I did not like at all). Coming to the Laccha parantha, don't ever order it here or else you'll forget what a typical Laccha parantha is. But not to forget Dal Makhani, it was an finger licking good.

We had our night GT over here. It was late night near about 12 AM but weekend crowd was huge. We were almost 16 people. We had to wait for 20 mins , after that we got our space at second floor. The décor is very simple, just like a roadside dhaba.

Now the food :
Chicken Tandoori : it's famous for their juicy tender perfectly cooked tandoori chicken. Perfect starter.
I always love it. (5/5)
Tandoori roti : Hot soft and crispy.
Chicken Varta : (4/5) Taste was average. But served very hot. Special point for good service. 
Overall nice experience. Good n quick service. Great for late night hangout.

This is one of the best places to dine post midnight in the city of joy. Though, you shouldn't expect a fine dine experience, however the place is always alive with a buzz. The food has a nice flavour of dhaba touch to it! I have tried most of the tasty dishes, few being the Keema Mutton, Kadhai Paneer, Tangri Kebab, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. I love the garlic nan at this place, its soft and the flavour of garlic is dominating yet extremely tasty.

Some eateries in town does not need propaganda, does not need customers good dining experience, does not need reviews on zomato! All they need to supply & supply food on the table of few hungry customers till midnight every night. Jai Hind Dhaba is just like that. Food experience is as expected in a road side dhaba, although this one has three floors of air conditioning rooms. Don't expect good or attentive service but they will fill ur tummy quick so that the outside chaos of waiting customers can be lowered specially in the weekend. One person in each floor takes orders without any written papers and the obvious results we have some missing items. Too irritating! But seeing the price tag u will not regret to take on.

Been the best restaurant till so far economically. A must for college goers. The food here is typically dhaba style specially chicken tikka butter masala and the quantity is awesome as well. If you are searching something that doesn't put a hole in your pocket or a late night meal. This place is what you are looking for.   The ambience is not very good nor the decorations but you can't expect something so economical and furnished. Love this place.❤️

Hopped in here on a Friday night after mid night and the place was asusual jam packed. Even after waiting for a good 5-10 mins we couldn't get a seat on the upper two floors. Since we were dying out of hunger, we settled onto their ground floor which is the less beautiful part without the lamps. The staff really doesn't care if u wait or go during the peak hours. Anyways coming to the food, we stuck to the basic dal makhani, kadhai paneer , rumali roti and fresh lime. Everything was satisfactory . Recommended but try to avoid during rush hours, that is late night on weekends.

Dhaba is very good and food is awesome. I am a regular at this place. The only problem is that before generating the bill they ask whether u want to make payment by cash or card. If you pay by card they they make billing in pakka cash memo and if in cash then in kaccha.   I have noticed that the serial number of cash memo number decreases, it means that they collect GST amount from us and keep them in their pocket. This is Cheating. I have forwarded this matter to PMO and finance minister office.

Keep all your expectations of a beautiful pretty eatery serving you dishes with mind blowing presentations, aside, and go for a meal , a hearty, sumptuous, and delicious meal. That too at really reasonable prices. 

I have been here many a times, and there is a set menu that I always order/ also these are the best dishes here. Mainly it is from the north indian cuisine. 
Garlic Naan / Cheese Naan /Tandoori Roti 
Daal Makhaani /Kadhaai Paneer 
Aloo do pyaza 
Chicken Butter Masala /Chicken Bharta 
And from the chinese menu I pretty much love the Veg Manchurian. 

This place stays open till late at night and has a homely feel to it.

This is our go-to restaurant because it is closest to office and it has always proved to be value for money.
Obviously I have eaten here umpteen number of times both takeaway delivery and at the restaurant as well. The kababs are to die for...especially their Tikka Kabab and the Reshmi Kebab. I love the fact that they do diet rolls which have a stick of Kabab rolled in rumali roti.... Not only are they filling but also are very low on oil.
Don't be fooled by the fact that Jai Hind is a Punjabi run Dhaba. The Chinese dishes are awesome as well.
Be it the Tandoori Chicken or the Chicken Chilly Garlic Noodles....Jai Hind does not disappoint.
Complete value for money option.... which is open till late at night.

It is one of the places where I usually go for dinner when it's too late though the place is usually crowded during weekends after midnight. They have two floors and it is nice. They serve really delicious starters as I have tasted almost all of the dishes. The butter chicken and the tawa butter roti is my favorite. The staffs are good and so the service.

mutton kasha-the best dish out here,very tendered pcs of mutton with a slightly onion mixtured gravy will make you lick your fingers... the best part is the gravy and this dish deserves to be on the top,, plz do have it.

chicken kasha-same goes here for the gravy and freshly cooked chicken pcs with full softness.the chicken will melt so softly in your mouth giving you the ease to chew it..

tandoori rotis are too good even in parcels they give them hot packed....

chicken kadai-lip smackin brownish gravy with 6 chicken pcs in it,,but sometimes the taste varies if you order it regularly....

chicken schezwan fried rice- have ordered this many times and yes never dissapointed,, hot fried rice with small pcs of chicken in it and great quantity .....

jai hind dhaba shud b given more than 4 * from zomato.....seating arrangement is good for non ac and ac. service is on time, good attitude, they charge extra for onions thats sad... the prices are reasonable according to quantity. i want to try more and more dishes here ... next im gonna have a fish dish..  the best part is they are open till almost around 2.30 am midnight thats cool as you can order anything if you are partying late night or a midnight hunger haunts you...

Ordered Butter masala kulcha: which was okayish,it was more like aloo paratha stuffed with the filling of aloos..
Butter chicken: the gravy was pure salty lacked the essence of spices and butter..
The chicken pieces were smaller in size but soft..
Dal makhni: This was the good part of the food.
It was tasty as well as spicy..

I have visited this place twice and loved it just for it's food. On my first visit me and my friends had ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Mushroom Masala, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Tandoori roti and Salad. On my second visit we had ordered Tandoori Roti and Chicken Tikka Masala. One thing which I can tell from my both visits is that they make amazing kebabs. Succulent and flavoursome. Tandoori rotis could have been a little better as in both my visits those were like papads. But apart from that no other complaints. They prices are reasonable so a person can have hearty meal without spending a lot. 😊

The service is quick and the food it's amazing if you haven't tried it yet trust me you're missing out on something real good.
The ambience is simple but comfortable.
Must try: chicken bharta,dal makhani,chicken do pyaza and  butter chicken.
You can also try the tandoori alu and butter paneer if you're a vegetarian.
Must visit.

Good place to have some Punjabi dishes..had butter chicken and tandoori along with nan and roti. Food was nothing fancy. The presentation was also average...although the taste was good. The waiters were a bit casual and unprofessional.

Yet another disappointment in the list of overhyped, overrated Cal eateries. Jai Hind Dhaba just cannot make North Indian food. Coming to the list of most famous dishes - 
1. Aloo Do Pyaaza - was nothing but aloo in ketchup. Never tasted a worse aloo dish.
2. Tarka Fry - Black dal which has no tarka, not even properly boiled. Again a zero on five
3. Chicken Bhartha - The most distasteful chicken dish ever. Totally bland, no ingredients. Just a chicken paste

So many times I wish there was option of negative rating on Zomato for restaurants like these :( :(

A very pocket friendly place with a decent ambience. Does not have a dhaba feel exactly, when it comes to the decor. Really good food, nice service. For vegetarians I would suggest garlic naan and paneer - do- piaya. For chicken lovers, tandoori roti/ rumali roti with reshmi chicken kebab and tandoori chicken. 😍 
A must visit for people who like North-Indian food. :)

Ordered from Jai Hind Dhaba, Paddarpukur to have a quick meal! Delivery took around 35 minutes. Here is the food review

● Dal Makhani: Quality & quantity both were good. Rating: 3.5/5

● Butter Nan: Well made. Good with that Dal Makhani. Rating: 3.5/5

Food was good. The meal was of around 210 bucks only. All in all, a good experience.

The order:

Rumali Roti
Aaloo do Pyaaza
Dal Makhani
Garlic naan
Jeera Rice

If you go to this place, these are must try dishes for veg lovers. Butter chicken is also something to drool for! 

Be it night 2am or evening dinner or for lunch, this place will keep you satisfied with its immense taste and quick service.
A must must try. I have already been here for 12-13 times. Cant wait to go again!

Even then the guys were unapologetic and said cancel the order.These guys are the most horrible ones and do not know anything about service or courtesy.

Traditional punjabi food joint.
You'll find good food at very reasonable price here.
We ordered tengri kebab, roomali roti, aloo do peyaja, chicken tikka butter masala, chicken bharta & kadhai chicken. All were delicious but aloo do peyaja & kadhai chicken were stand out.
At last a sip of lassi will give your food journey a pleasant ending.

Overview : Jai Hind Dhaba is known all over Kolkata for their famous Chicken Bharta and Tawa Roti. This is the very place where the shooting for JAATISHWAR movie starring Prasenjit, Jisu, Swastika, Riya Sen and Rahul took place.

Location : Placed in a convenient location in Paddapukur. Beside Salazar guest house. 

METRO drop : Jatin Das Park.

Food quality : The food quality is very good. Serves mostly North Indian. The taste is so good for any dish you order, thay it will remind you of Punjab or Haryana, if you are a Sardarji.

Ambience : Not too impressive, old type seating by the glass window. It is a 3 storey restaurant. The best view is obviously from the top floor. 

Serve time and behave : Fast serving time and the staffs are not so well mannered, to be honest. They are loud and noisy. Haha!!

Cost effective? Definitely a Yes. Prices are perfect for any type of visitiors...whether students or working people.

VERDICT : The place is very old and serves authentic North indian delicacies. So they actually know how to cook proper authentic food of the region. Food is top notch. But the staffs needs to be a little more mannered and calm. Minus the ambience a bit and this place is real competitor for the oldies and even the newbie cafe's that are cropping up everywhere.

:) 

SOUMEN'S Says :-

Food quality : 4.5/5
Ambience.    : 3/5
Serve Time   : 4.5/5

This place is like heaven to all those black dal lovers.
I am a big big fan of Jai Hind from a very long time now.
1st floor seating is what i prefer always or else will have it in car only - they have this service without any extra charge.
If anyone is fond of rumali roti & black dal and by any chance havent tried this place, you are missing out something very important in your life.
As per the name suggests, the place gives a feeling of a dhaba yet as a restaurant :p
Prompt and quick service with efficient people at your call.
Very reasonable and highly loveable :D :D

Suppose you are in Lansdown area and craving for North Indian food, then Jai Hind Dhaba should be your one stop destination. Been there few days ago by suggestion of one of my foodie friend. Situated near Padmapukur Bus Stop, easy to find.

Now come to review part –

Positive Point –

1. Low pricing – The price of each item is very cheap. You can have as much dish as you want without burning hole in your pocket.
2. Timing – The restro remains open till midnight, so it is a blessing for those, who are looking for food at late night.

Negative point –

1. Food – Probably the worst dhaba experience I have ever experienced. Food was really not worthy and it takes a looooong time to serve food.

2. Stuffs and management – After taking our table, they give us glass but not water. We take the water ourselves. The glass was not properly cleaned. There were some food residue at the bottom of the glass. After changing it, the same thing happened again. I think that was enough to get an impression about a restaurant and don’t ask about the stuffs! Their behavior was such – ‘Dude, why are you bothering me? I will don’t listen to you wither you need anything or not!’

We ordered –

1. Chicken Tandoori(Half) – A dining in a dhaba would be incomplete if you don’t try Tandoori item there. We ordered this one and served in a plate within 5min. The tandoor was well grilled but somehow I feel a little dry from inside. But overall ok. Go for it.

2. Garlic nun and Butter Nun – Well, I will call it Papad instead of Nun! What was that? Both were absolutely tasteless, crispy in nature! In garlic nun, there was just chopped garlic and feel yourself lucky if you get any buttery touch on your Butter nun. Totally unexpected from such kinda restaurant.

3. Chicken Butter Masala – This is one of the popular item here, so without any kinda experiment, we ordered this one. After a loooong wait, at last the food came to our table. Served in a plate and the gravy was dropping out from the edge of the plate. The stuffs really need some lesson about the presentation of the food. Six pieces chickens were there, all are soft and juicy and the gravy was really finger licking but it hardly had any Butter touch. Overall ok.

4. Onion salad – Just some chopped onion served with lemon pieces and pepper sprinkles on top. Nothing much.

With all food mentioned above and with a coke, @it costs around 650INR, which is really a decent one in terms of Pricing, but if you ask about the food, I will hardly recommend anyone here. In conclusion, I will say, Low pricing and availability during the late night is the only UPS here. Don’t expect too much, otherwise you will disappoint yourself. Overall a pathetic dining experiences.

This is the perfect place to be for any foodie and also for late night party goers. The dhaba is conveniently located on Sarat Bose Road and is favorite for most localities. There is often a waiting line to enter the place so be prepared to wait. The joint is open till late at night which is why most party goers land up here for their post booze meals. There are 3 AC seating zones and 1 NON-AC zone. Food wise the menu consists of mostly basic Punjabi food items and that is what they are known for. Don't try ordering Chinese or other items as that is bound to disappoint to. Must haves? Their Chicken butter masala, Chicken Bharta, Dal makhani and Kulchas. Also don't look much into hygiene and basic server courteousness. This place is simple and simply offers Great Food.

Went there a few days before. Odered tandoori chicken, garlic nun, cheese nun, and chicken butter masala. Tandoori chicken was dry and hard. The nun were more like papad. Didn't like it at all. And chicken butter masala hardly had any butter. Inefficient staff. Won't recommend this one.

Well Visited Jai Hind Dhaba a couple of times now ,
Specially on a friends recommendation..
So once it was like at around 12am midnight and once for lunch..
Ordered Bharta both the times and chicken tikka butter masala.. and tandoori butter roti..
Well in a while of time the Roti became really stiff .. so it took me little effort to have the roti..
Bharta both the times was disappointing, the gravy of the bharta was a little raw (flavour of the spices) in that case and as soon as the bharta became little cold it became quite sticky and very thick which didnt tasted good ,
Chicken tikka butter masala .. well I expected the tikka to be a tikka cooked in butter masala gravy but the gravy used was almost same aa that of chicken bharta's gravy , and the tikka was actually chicken reshmi kebab on which butter masala gravy was poured which was quite evident .. nathing so special about decor and service.. so a 3/5 from myside.. not visiting again unless friends again suggests..

The best dishes I liked here was Dal Makhani, Aloo Do piyaza and the egg bhurji! The egg bhurji is lip smacking and the best dish. Very affordable and very amazing place with amazing food!

One of the most popular late night eateries in the city, the food does total justice to its fame. Situated on the main road in what is arguably the foodie heart of the city, the restaurant is pretty accessible and offers takeaways and non AC dining for the budget conscious. A dhaba in its original avatar, it has moved on from its earlier audience base to a more premium clientele especially in the wee hours of the night for patrons on their way back from the club's. However that is not it's only claim to fame, it's takeaway rolls and dining menu is one of the best for north indian fare and we'll deservingly so. We've been told that it's even better for the non vegetarians, but given how we're unable to verify it ourselves, we'll take it at face value. 

As with all such trysts, we were too hungry to click pics of the food especially so given that they aren't too great on the plating bit of the presentation. 

Recommendations: 
Alu do Pyaza: Must have here. Yellow/brownish gravy with potatoes and a generous helping of onion rings, garlic and capsicum and what can only be described as heavenly. The gravy is thick and can be spicy for some. 

Paneer Butter Masala: A great second curry to order. It wasn't as great as the Alu do Pyaza but holds great on its own. It has a generous gravy and is probably like any good paneer dish you've eaten elsewhere. 

Dal Makhani/Kaali Daal: Black lentils is a must have at this place, a personal favorite, would rate it as good as the one you would find at say a Bukhara. Best had with a roomali roti ( which we didn't order) 

Highly recommended for late night cravings or lazy weekends but the cramped ambience is nothing to write home about and probably the reason for the less than Perfect score that the food deserves.

Jai Hind Dhaba is one of the restaurant in Kolkata which remains open late at night till 2am. Perfect for mid night dinner.
I visited here recently at 12:30am at night, place was almost full.
We ordered for 
*Chicken Tandoori : Average in taste.
Then ordered for
* Mixed Fried Rice : Huge quantity and good in taste.
* Sechewan Chicken : Good.
Prices seemed to reasonable, except in the Chinese section which looked bit high.

The reshmi kebab, tandoori kebabs are awwesome. I also love the crispy chilli baby corn. Chicken bharta coupled with bhurji and tadka would make up ur day without hurting your pocket!!

Late night outings are best experienced out here. It remains open till 4 in the morning with crowds gushing and eating their hearts out. 

Located near Padma Pukur in the lansdowne area, it occupies one of the prime locations in the region. No such decors but well organised. 
The food out there gives you a true essence of a North Indian cuisine. People mainly prefer this restaurant during the late nights. The ambiance is pretty good with people all around you even at that late nights.

Any dish you order be it a tadka fry or a chicken kasha or tikka masala along with pulao or roti, you won't regret your decision. It's so well cooked and s really delicious. Top it over with a glass of lassi. Trust me you won't get such a meal so late at night. 

For me it's the same story time and again but it doesn't bore me instead makes me go for that faluda outside the dhaba.

Visited this place around 1 a.m after my college fest, since most places in the city are not open for night owls like me. And you need to visit the place to know how crowded it stays even ar that hour! We somehow managed to find a table for ourselves and settled for Butter Naan, Chicken Tikka and Aloo do Pyaza. The latter tastes excellent, so much that I was busy having it more than the chicken! The price is reasonable. And to end the sumptuous dinner, there was a kulfi stall just outside. Overall, if you're hungry and looking for a place, you know which Dhaba you need to head to!

So finally after so much of research, I found this place near by to my hotel with good reviews. 
If you are very much conscious for interior and service then don't visit this place but if you want
to have a very tasty food then do visit this place. I personally don't get bothered about service and interior if you are getting tasty food then who cares for it.
I have ordered for chicken bharta and butter chicken from here. Presentation was ok and taste was fantastic. I really liked the taste and spices which they have put in the chicken bharta. Butter chicken was also very good.
I suggest personally to have chicken bharta and butter chicken from here because it will definitely satisfy your taste buds.
Service 2/5

In Kolkata, if you want authentic Punjabi food along with the feel of a Dhaba late at night then this is the only place to be...This place swarms at night...Provides an entirely different environment. And there isn't anything new to say about the taste of food at this place...Juicy tandoori chicken, malai marke butter chicken...Even thinking about it will make you slurp if you've tasted it once!!!
If you are on a mid night out with friends and want to gorge on tasty food then this place should be first on your list!!!

Pro-Jai Hind Dhaba remains open till late at night.
Con- Jai Hind Dhaba remains open till late at night and the entire city knows this.

The place is swarming with people on any day post 9p.m. 
The seating arrangement upstairs is better than that downstairs. The place can be noisy and a tad unruly, but all in the spirit of a dhaba. The food is authentic north indian fare, malai maar ke.

Staff tend to be a little lost during high pressure times.

All those who crave good chicken with Punjabi flavors, this is the place to for it folks. Not only non vegetarian, this place offers great tasting vegetarian food. The reshmi chicken kabab, achari kabab, dal makhani and lassi are a must have. This place is fit for all purposes, whether it is family time or a visit with friends.

Jai Hind dhaba is a nice chill out place for most , especially people with midnight hunger cravings!Going there at regular hours will just give you a feel of a normal restaurant but when you drop by at midnight post 12 . Its a whole new ambience all together. Crowds from all sections of society (Well almost) gather and eat here and nothing beats dhaba style food when you are super hungry at odd hours at night.The food , well not the best but considering their 24 hours service and comparing to many other such joints it is good. Dal tadka and roomali are my favourite orders here.Though i would suggest not to overstuff your self with their food as it is not the most stomach friendly at times!

Been here at lunch time with my family and tried some of their signature veg items.
Area wise it was huge established in two floor. In both first floor and Second floor there is dine in areas. Designed and decorated beautifully. Ambience was really good and so as hospitality. Service in reasonable time and presentation was good. Price was pocket friendly. We started with the soups in which we tried sweet corn soup and manchow soup both were made perfectly and tastes very delicious. In Main course we tried dal tarka, malai kofta and Chilly paneer all were perfectly made and tastes heavenly delicious. We had tandoori roti with them which was crispy and tastes good. Must visit place. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

I never thought the day will come when I'll be writing a bad review for Jai Hind Dhaba. Tjis place have been always good for me untill the last time. The service is getting really bad. And about that so called Chinese Chilly Paneer, Ross said and I quote "It tastes like feet".
Please JHD, do not let our faith in you fade away.

One of the best or may be the best north Indian restaurant for many people. Just gave .5 star less because of poor "vatavaran"(vibe) :).... However it can be expected because of old structure . Besides best place for late night dinner . Good service and very nice quantity . I loved its soft butter nan . Everything was good , had a great experience.

Not a fan of Jai Hind Dhaba and it's food but yeh for the first time I liked the food which I had ordered at 1am after coming from work..! The food which I had ordered was hot and well delivered.. I was expecting it to be average one but after shutting down my restaurant at the end of the day I was pleased by the food I ordered from this outlet as I was damn hungry

We were just passing through that lane,didn't know the place would be open that late,and there so many people even at that time.it was 1am..we went in ordered tandoori roti,tandoori aloo masala,and kadai chicken. Rotis were more crispy than usual, but trust me on a cold winter night,garam crispy rotis with those items tasted heavenly, late night bike ride,cold winter,and garma garam dhaba food what more can u ask for..loved it,will be there for another late night venture..

Just loved this place. I have tried other dhabas in kolkata but those cannot match this one. Really impressed with the Chicken Bharta. 
Beautifully shredded chicken cooked in a creamy and delicious gravy. Quantity enough for 2 people. 
We had this with tandoori rotis. I will definitely recommend to everyone to try the bharta here.
Service was good too, however since they charged service charges we didn't pay any extra tip so the server was quite grumpy.

I have heard a lot of good words about this place so yesterday(23/01/2017) I thought that before leaving for Australia I might have a taste of their food.Now, I am not sure how many people here in Kolkata are aware about the service tax legislation but if we do a bit of research its very easy to find out that SERVICE TAX is only applicable if we do a "DINE IN" but not TAKEAWAY or HOME DELIVERY.Please guys do this research and find it out on your own. Its not that hard.Now coming back to the review of this joint. The staffs are very polite and the food i.e the Tandoori Roti/ Tadka that I have ordered for "TAKEAWAY" was very average and the Tadka dish even consisted teeny tiny stones.But the biggest disappointment was the charge of the SERVICE TAX at the point of sale.The explanation that I was been given is: Because I am not paying them using CASH MONEY but was using eftpos( Credit Card) they will be charging me Service TAX along with VAT/ Education Cess/ Kishan Cess.Now, I came here in Kolkata for a month of holiday and was not aware of the complicated tax system, but later on when I was analysing the whole situation of this "SERVICE TAX CHARGE", it suddenly struck me that, that I have been ripped off last night by a bunch of crooks, because there had been no services offered by them at all, apart from cooking and packing the food for "TAKEAWAY". This is when I did my research to find out what the legislation is saying about it, which is: order for Takeaway/Home delivery are exempt from the purview of the Service Tax legislation.  Unfortunately, Zomato is not letting me to post any links of my research but if anyone needs any help in understanding the scope of the Service Tax legislation feel free to contact me through Facebook.You can find me out using my full name in the search option. Good luck and keep enjoying the food that this city offers.Thank You

I don't know what to say this restaurant is the best restaurant in Kolkata. I used to hate dhaba food. I thought that dhaba food was very unhealthy and unhygienic but after today launch I forgot all of that one bite of that dal tadka with butter naan made my taste buds dance. The restaurant was as good as it could get and I highly recommend everyone to go there. I was to busy eating so I did not take any pictures.

I had heard a lot about this place, about how amazing and typical Punjabi food they serve. We had ordered chicken tandoori, paneer kebabs, butter chicken, chicken bharta and aloo do pyaaza. Now even I had very high expectations from this place but very honestly it did not stand up to my expectations. I think I have had a lot better Punjabi food than this one. The food is not bad, especially if you see the prices but it is not unexceptionally good like the way I had heard. What I liked the most was Aloo do pyaaza which I had heard was good. The service is very good. The ambience is not that great but it still works fine. Jai Hind Dhaba works just fine and honestly, I don't think it's that great.

The restaurant is located on the main road of Sarat Bose Road. With amazingly comforting family atmosphere and tasty food at reasonable prices it's the perfect food destination be it for a family outing or with friends or someone special. 
While the menu is a bit limited with a lack of desserts, the food however is beyond any sort of grief.
The Lachha Paratha and Peas Polou were both brilliant. The Chicken Bharta is the best thing on the menu, though might be a bit spicy if people cannot stand chilli. The reshmi kebab was amazing as well.
The service left a lot to be desired with them not writing down the order and coming and trying to clarify quite a few times.

The laccha parantha and butter naan are very well made, and the kebabs are also good. The service though needs some improvements, still this place deserves 4.0 for the food they serve.

You know the concept of dhabas came in to serve local cuisine on highways to all who are travelling by road.. acted as truck stops! More like 'homemade' inexpensive food with basic steel thaalis n glasses! Similarly works the Dhaba in kolkata named as Jai Hind Dhaba..

I am gonna say at the outset please do not go for the looks of this Dhaba.. it has been created to look like a typical Dhaba.. basic facilities like seating and good food you can avail at this dhaba.. situated at paddapukur near Lanes Downe! Has two parts.. the 1st floor is all decked up and slightly better look wise and the ground floor is lil shady..

Lets start the gupshup on the Food that was ordered:
Aloo Pyaaz ki Sabzi: This sabzi is just out of the world.. Jai hind speciality and none can compete when it comes to preparing this sabzi.. super tempting! *mouthwatering*
Must try this sabzi..best had with Roomali Roti!

Kaali Daal: This was equally yum.. with all that tadkas and aromas.. it tickles your appetite all the more! You can sprinkle the masala onions.. tasted even better!
My menu is always fixed and i really really love this dhaba styled food.. am quoting one of the ad line "wo Taste kaha hai.. woh Taste yahaa hai.." @ Jai Hind Dhaba! This place is fairly priced.. the service is quick and it invariably runs a full house everyday! Please do visit this place and am sure you'l relish the food!

Tandoori & Rumali Roties, Butter Masala Kulcha,Mutton & Egg Tadka,Peas Pulao, Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Butter Masala, Mutton Dopiasa  ... every item is awesome & perfectly cooked. 
North Indian food for us means Jai Hind Dhaba we r a  regular customer of it.
Trust me you wont get this quality of food even paying much much more than what they charge u.

This place has been known for good food and it is undoubtedly good.  However, the behaviour of the manager is terrible.  The man named Mr. Happy has a lot of attitude and intentionally does not care about the order's placed by customers. 
I happened to visit this location for lunch with friends. Ordered kebabs along with main course are beginning. After having repeatedly reminding about the kebabs, it was not served until the main course was over and the manager did not care even after being informed twice. When I tried asking him, he casually said if I still wanted the kebab and arrogantly  talked.

A complete no to people visiting with friends and family as you might have a horrible experience at the location. You might not get what you order and face rude behavior while enquiring.

Mixed with some simple Indian breads, the dinner is heavenly. Only reason I rated this place to be a 4 is because it still doesn't accept cards and all transactions are in cash. Had a lot of trouble during this demonetisation phase as the nearby ATMs were always out of cash.

Otherwise ambience is pleasant & cost is also on the cheaper side.

Garlic Naan- This was a bit too hard rather than the usual naan.

Paneer Kulcha- It was ok ok.

Food : The place is one of the favorite for dhaba treat. Punjab di shaan as they deal in, starting from the kebabs which are delightful, nans and tandoori, butter masala, Tikka to lassi. Each and every things is toothsome.
Service is equally good and friendly.

Tried the place for the first time yesterday. The restaurant has three floors. We went inside the first floor. Ambience is ok type, but clean. The service is fast and the staff efficient. We ordered Chicken Tandoori which was average - a little dry. Then we had Egg Tarka, Chicken Dopiyaza and Tandoori Aloo Masala with Tandoori Roti which were all very tasty. However I personally was a little disappointed as they didn't have Sarson da Saag and Makki di Roti, which are expected from a Punjabee dhaba in winter. The prices are pocket friendly. A must visit for lovers of dhaba food.

The most famous place in the city to have North Indian. This place perfectly matches the caption of "HUNGER KI BAJAO"
Service: Super Quick
Cleanliness: satisfactory 
(The Hazra branch might need a lil improvement)
Food: Tounge pleasure 
Interior: Not creative but sometimes only Food matters.
Pocket Pinch: Very Economical 

However this place lacks a lil, on home delivery when ordered via Food Panda. Also they over hype prices on Food Panda. Better to get home delivery directly from Jai Hind itself.

This place is my 3rd favourite place for North Indian food. 

What I normally order - 

Dum Aloo
Dal Makhani
Paneer Butter Masala
Garlic Naan 
Masala ThumsUp

Word of advice- The Dum Aloo can be improved. The Naans should have a little less butter. It literally drips around. There is something up with the Aloo Do Pyaza. It always gives me a stomach ache. (Anybody else faces this ?) Please work on the ground floor. It feels very unhygienic.

Jai hind is the best option for late night hunger!!! Almost 90% of the times tht I have had food here is late night!! The way they manage the crowd is commendable!! Sometimes the service is slow but the rush there justifies it!!!

The most famous place in the city to have North Indian. This place perfectly matches the caption of "HUNGER KI BAJAO"
Service: Super Quick
Cleanliness: satisfactory 
(The Hazra branch might need a lil improvement)
Food: Tounge pleasure 
Interior: Not creative but sometimes only Food matters.
Pocket Pinch: Very Economical 

However this place lacks a lil, on home delivery when ordered via Food Panda. Also they over hype prices on Food Panda. Better to get home delivery directly from Jai Hind itself.

This place is my 3rd favourite place for North Indian food. 

What I normally order - 

Dum Aloo
Dal Makhani
Paneer Butter Masala
Garlic Naan 
Masala ThumsUp

Word of advice- The Dum Aloo can be improved. The Naans should have a little less butter. It literally drips around. There is something up with the Aloo Do Pyaza. It always gives me a stomach ache. (Anybody else faces this ?) Please work on the ground floor. It feels very unhygienic.

This place is good for late night eats since it stays open till late hours in the night. I usually visit this place when I have to have a late night dinner. Food is good and tasty, pocket friendly restaurant. The ambiance is noisy, cleaning is not very good, service is ok.  Indian breads are very good and served hot, curries are also very tasty. I have tried tandoor items as well they are really great.

Whenever I feel hungry at night, or before going from a party, Jai Hind is the place to come. The double mirchi daal tadka, the rumali roti, paneer butter masala, chicken bharta, all these items are a must must try here. It is undoubtedly the place to come, especially if you feel hungry at night. Its the proper dhaba feel, you can sit in your car and eat. The service is very quick, the food is tasty. Even their home delivery is very good, although it takes an hour, but its worth the wait. The food arrives warm. An awesome place to have North Indian food!!

Its a total crap... even in urgent and unavoidable circumstances they dont deliver food to their well known customers staying about 10-15 mins distance from the store, if its not a bill of 400 or more...like wen u are having so many delivery boys, what do u do with them by keeping them in the store and not take orders below 400 ?? Disappointed and shameful customer dealing by such a reputed food hub.

This is an authentic dhaba with good food at great prices. My visits here haven't been as frequent as I would want them to be. I had gone with a friend here and had their butter chicken with naan. The chicken was very tasty with buttery smooth texture of the gravy. We both just dug in and finished it off very quickly😁. It's a good place to have north Indian food 😃

There's not much to say about this place other than the fact that it is the absolute favourite for us when it comes down to Indian. Nothing compares to it, we've been here multiple times but we'll list down few of our favourites.

Tangdi kebabs - the absolute best starter, just the right amount of spice and marination to make it melt in your mouth 
Chicken Bharta - Pieces of shredded chicken with a very buttery gravy, goes well with or without any kind of roti
Double tadka daal - if you can't handle spice, you'd better stay away from this one. Absolute beast of a dish with so much spice, it's very, very hard to handle.
Garlic naan - the perfect roti which goes with any dish and the extra butter is always a plus point. :D 

Follow us on Instagram for photographs of our visits to restaurants in Calcutta and other places we travel to. :D

Located in a pretty busy neighbourhood,Jai Hind Dhaba is not that hard to spot out.

Being one of those few dhabas in town thats got good food at a quite a low price,along with free parking,this place can be a bit crowded at times.The service is quick though.

I loved the Chicken Bharta but the tandoori rotis were thin,papery,crispy- exactly how tandoori rotis are supposed to be!

I cannot complain about the bill though- Rs.339 (considering the taxes).

The ambience and service is good but when it comes to food, if the food is not tasty enough nothing matters to me. 

Butter naan and Tandoori roti was good. Saag chicken, Dahi chicken, Chicken do-piyaza and Butter chicken was absolutely bad. The flavour and taste was pretty oridinary. 

Disappointed.

There happens to be no ambience as such. The food however wins my heart, every time I go. The alu do pyaaza is a must try. The breads are all very different from one another.
Pocket friendly and stomach filing.

Only negative point is there delivery. I happened to call many a times, they just dont deliver on time. And once the food dint come at all 😡. 

So 4 only coz of delivery problems. Or else its 5 rated place

Visited this place during Durga puja for lunch. The place was completely packed. We were asked to wait for 10-15 mins , which was completely OK with us. But the problem started when the number of people waiting in queue increased. The staff did not write the names and there was lot of mess. The service of this restaurant disappointed me. But no doubt the quality, quantity and taste of the food is amazing and pocket friendly too.

I visited this place at nabami.  Seats were difficult to find yet we managed in a temporary place. I found a hair on the chatni provided with tandoori chicken. Jai Hind staffs are of okay kind but they seemed to bother more with those with cars as we were fully drenched that day. Overall the food was tasty. I tried tandoori chicken, fried rice and chicken manturian...It's price tag is affordable keeping in mind the quantity of foods served. I hope to visit this place again but don't want to see hair again!

The chicken tangri kebabs are awsome and juicy, butternun is really buttery and tried tandoori roti, chicken reshmi buttermasala and mutton dopiyaza. Dopiyaza was average.
Gonna visit soon!!

Usually always loved the place.. Eaten there so many times!! Most visited place in Cal..  Which is why decided to treat friends and family to the food.. Had been looking forward to it for very long.. Ordered dal tadka and chicken bharta... One hour later when we finally opened the food it was stinking sooooo bad... I had tears in my eyes.. I've wanted to serve this food to my friends and family for years and it was sooooo bad and spoilt.. It was very very very very upsetting.. The food smelt so bad.. I couldn't even smell it, forget serve it.. If in two hours the food can be so bad, the quality is questionable..

The Missi Roti could've been better. Altogether, nice food at nice price makes this as one of the best restaurant experiences...

This is a reliable place as it focuses only on one thing: great food. It's a paradise for late night eaters. The food is undoubtedly one of the best in the dhaba genre. The butter nan is actually buttery and has oodles of butter in each. I wanted to have Jain veg so the waiter suggested mix veg which was super yummy. My friend ordered for chicken bharta which is a classic at this place. Along with the food, the lassi was worth mentioning. Would definitely be giving number of visits in the future.

Located opposite Laxminarayan Mandir in Bhawanipur area, Jai Hind Dhaba is one of the best budget restaurants for North Indian cuisine!! They serve awesome North Indian items and rates are pretty reasonable. This place remains open till 2AM in the morning. Interior and decor is pretty simple and nothing above the top but trust me, the food makes up for that. 

PS: Their timing really helped us during Durga Puja for dropping in late night after a round of Pandal Hopping!! :D

The location is premium class. Went on a birthday trip on 17th September by my friend, its on the Sarat Bose Road, by roadside. The management was a bit on slack side, we took ample time to just settle down. Many items were ordered but however in rush of eating I couldn't get clicks of all.
We started with Chicken Tikka Kabab, and in main course ordered for Tandoori Butter Roti, Butter Chicken and Chat Tarka. We heavily feasted and the view by the window was also good. For late-night it is a good option, but due to its ambience I would recommend not for couples but preferred choice for Parties as food was good yet also pocket-friendly.

Location-Sarat bose road.

This place is a two storeyed restaurant that serves north indian and chinese cuisine.Its a cost effective place and has that particular punjabi flavour in the food.This place has got ample of parking space and you can order your food sitting in your car.Except the food all other major fields needs a major improvement at this restaurant such as service and ambiance.

Service-The service at this place is very poor.The staff  is quite slow.In order to place your order you have to constantly call them and then when they take your order you have to constantly request them to bring the food.

Ambiance-This place has got a very loud ambiance.And the interiors are also quite simple.A proper maintainance is required at this place at the earliest.

Food-The only aspect in which this restaurant excels is food.They serve both north indian and chinese cuisine but we prefer north indian at this place.It tastes excellent and has that proper punjabi flavour.We had
1:Paneer tikka
2:Shahi paneer
3:Tandoori aloo
4:Yellow dal tadka
All the above dishes were great and worth every penny spent.

Food-4.5/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-3/5

Best dhaba food in Kolkata.
Must try are the double egg tarka, roomali roti, reshami kebab, paneer do pyaza and other north indian dishes.

Extremely convenient to visit at night.

Good food, tastes good. I am a vegetarian so I only know about vegetarian. Dal Makhhani, paneer do pyaza with Rumali roti is amazing. I am dicey about the quality. But it's very pocket friendly!

Jai hind dhaba is a very old dhaba which serves some great north indian and punjab food. It remains open till late at night and is a great place for some delicious north indian food at very low prices. There are two different areas for seating arrangement. The family dining area has a better ambiance then the other areas. Due to the low prices the ambience is not that good. The staff is very friendly and well mannered. The tadka fry needs a special mention. It is very tasty and rich in flavour. This is a must visit for everyone. :)

Jai Hind Dhaba, the name itself insights a lot of nostalgia into the minds of us Calcuttans, famous for it's mouth watering Punjabi cuisine, this restaurant serves food for as late as 2AM. Home Delivery also till 2AM is icing on the cake. If you ever visit Kolkata, just don't miss eating at this joint, for you'll regret later if you don't.

One of the most visited place of my life. :D 

Great food, authentic punjabi taste and cheap price (compared to others) ... 
Service is so so as it is always filled up with foodies. The AC room is small and you might feel uncomfortable because there will be someone else standing beside you to take your table, while you are having food.

Have been there, for like more than 10 times they are always late at servicing plus the behavior is too too bad. Too much attitude with the punjabi as if they have not opened to served but we are serving them by eating their food! No relationship build up. 
That's my overall rating. 
The place is good. I completely like the place. No offence to the food. 
Food is good for lunch and dinner. Pricing is cheap but the thing which bothers me is the maintainance, You order now and get the food after 30 mins.

By now I have visited Jai Hind many a times. Being really near to my institute, this place has been a favourite hangout spot for me and my friends. 
Their Indian dishes are something really addictive, but you can't really deny that their Chinese section is pretty good. This place offers apt quantity of food with respect to the price. This place automatically turns out to be a favourite place if you are looking for good food and tummy-filling meal.  

Their "must-try-items", according to me would be:

Chicken Bharta.
All the kebabs.
Nuns and Rotis.
Khadai Paneer.
Butter Chicken.
Chilli chicken.
Lassi.

Punjabi Dhaba food.
We kolkatans can never get over this craze and it if we do get over it somehow, it really won't be healthy because there is nothing bad comforting as dhaba food. The kebabs, the lassi, the kulcha, naans, tandooris these are just dhaba style food written all over them.
And jai Hind Dhaba had been fuelling the untimely dhaba food Cravings of the people living in this city for quite a while now.
If you are on the look out for amazing kebabs and chicken bharta, this is your place to be.
Although the butter chicken was a huge let down! It was low on the taste quotient but pretty high on the butter quotient.
Other than that you will find yourself enjoying all things buttery.

A legendary place, when it comes to defining Dhaba Food. Located conveniently at Paddapukur, you would always see a buzz infront of this hotel. People parking their cars to place their orders and/or people lining up to get their food packed. The favorite items of mine, here are Chicken Bharta and Dal Makhani. Combine this with Butter Nan, and you wouldn't need anything else for a trip to heaven.

Last time when my friend was in Calcutta he insisted on visiting Jai Hind dhaba like crazy. There's some kind of non-veg tarka that he was dying to have. We had another guy along and 3 of us headed to this place.

Little did we know that the route is so simple. We went to Ballygaunge and somehow after walking too much we reached here.

We tried lovely parathas, chicken butter masala, some kind of shredded chicken dush and paneer. We loved it all. We long walks under the sun was successful.

It was much later in the eve we realised that we paid a different bill. Perhaps, our bill was exchanged with another customer. The third guy is a mathematic teacher so we left the case on him. Ultimately he couldn't retrieve the cash though the person from the other end apologised.

It was our fault that we were less attentive and more into ourselves. But, the food was heaven n thereby, nothing to regret.

Do visit!

The name Jai Hind is very popular with the club hoppers and late night partying crowd in Calcutta. The location is great, situated on the main road, plenty of parking, plus they serve food in your car as well. The place is open till way early in the morning. One thing's sure no matter what time you go they will server you piping hot , delicious food. I must have personally tried almost half their menu during my numerous visits.
Some of the must tries here would be the Chicken Bharta, Aloo Do Pyaza, Chicken tikka Kabab, Chicken Tangri Kabab and you absolutely can't miss out on the Double Mirchi Tarka. The food prices are reasonable and is easy on the wallet as well.

This review will be based on both home delivery and personal visit.
The restaurant is of two floors. And quite spacious. Almost nothing for decor or ambiance. The service is pretty fast and food is very pocket friendly. The dahi chicken was very yummy and tandoori roti was made quickly as we were ordering more and on point. My friend had the alu doh pyaza and liked it. More or less a good experience.
Now coming to the home delivery. Placed the order on zomato and was hugely disappointed by the service of the restaurant. Firstly the dish (chicken bharta) was packed in a foil compartment which had no logo of the restaurant. Secondly we were not given any proper bill. Just a paper with the details written in pen. The dish was also not good and seemed colored. NOT RECOMMENDED.

Ordered something to fill the tummy for dinner(a small order of rumali rotis and scrambled eggs). Food was good. Packaging and delivery charges fair enough. Delivery boy was slightly on the snobbish side. 180.12/- was the bill amount. There was no return initially for 2 100/- notes given. He did not even utter anything remotely linked to tipping. Almost 5-6minutes of persuasion 10/- returned. I wonder why the delivery charge was taken in the first place. Hoping for a better next time as this was my first.

I went there only two times during lunch time with my friends. The last time we have ordered masala papad,butter chicken, garlic nan, daal makhani, roomali roti, mutton kasha. The service here is good but it took a bit time I would say over 20-30 minutes and then finally they served us the ordered food and by that time we were famished completely. The ambience is not so pleasant. It's just okay. The foods are not expensive at all. The foods are good but not great I would say.
If you're on a tight budget and hungry don't hesitate to come here.

Was craving for "Paneer Tikka Kebabs" at midnight & was around Jai Hind Dhaba, so went in and ordered the same. 
But I was utterly disappointed as what I got was a few pieces of charred Paneer cubes without proper marination along with lachchha onions and mint chutney.
The craving "died" after the 1st bite.
Alas!

One of the very few joints in kolkata for very late night dining. Had been there past midnight at 1.30a.m. the place was bustling with eaters even at that hour. Service although was slow due to the crowd, food was made fresh. Hot crisp Tori, nun accompanied with chicken bharta, daal makhni and handi chicken. Biryani although was not available,we could not complain as they were doing the great task of feeding hungry souls at such odd hour. Great place to be with friends!!!

An awesome place to try out. The moment you enter the smell of kebabs will blow you away. Going here one should definitely try the dal makhani, paneer butter Masala, aloo do pyaza, chicken bharta, and the garlic Naan. These are must tries. The garlic Naan is simply amazing. The kebabs are also really delicious. The shortfall was the tandoori roti which was a bit hard and dry. Mix veg palao is also not that good. 
Other than these the food is a delight.

It's operational hours is an USP and everything is superbly tasty and very economic.

There is nothing that I have not liked such as Roomali Roti,Butter Roti,Egg Bhurji,Paneer items,Cream Palak Saag,Corn Palak Saag,All dal preparations and different Kebabs in Butter Masala.

A highly recommended place of South Kolkata.

Situated at Paddapukur along Sarat Bose Road this place has really left me smacking my lips. I heard of this place from my friends before also but finally got a chance to try it out myself. The place is just as ordinary as the rest of its type. The decor of the place is more like "Giant Alice getting into a mouse hole" as you have to crouch your way in, but the food was something really that compensated for it all. I went there with my friends for a dinner and I ordered according to their sugestions a Chicken Tadka few Tandoori Rotis and a dish of Chicken Tikka Masala.
The recipes are as follows -:
1. CHICKEN TADKA
First of all Chicken Tadka is another
version of Dhaba Special Tadka Dal Recipe
Tadka is definitely a famous item for
roadside dhabas. It is whole green moong
Dal cooked in spices with chicken or egg
or chicken and egg both. The tadka which
was made out here was just something I
have not tasted in ages. It was made with
correct amount of spices, not very spicy yet
not bland either. The chicken chunks were
well boiled and cooked and blended well
with the dish.
2. TANDOORI NAAN
Needless to mention this is an authentic
Indian bread which is generally
hand-stretched and baked nowhere but
the traditional Tandoor Oven. The tandoor
naan made by this place was almost upto
the mark excepting it tasted a bit more
Crispy than usually expected. Will not
say excellent but on an average good.
3. Chicken Tikka Masala
Another dish very famous with the Indians.
This is actually chicken tikka which is
chunks of chicken marinated in spices
and yogurt baked in tandoor oven
and served in spice mixed sauce,
generally a tomato and a coriander sauce.
The dish was very well made, the chicken chunks tasted real juicy and gave that melting feeling inside mouth.
All in all the experience regarding the food was not that bad at all infact the food was well cooked especially the tikka I will not just say it was good it was very good. The staffs were a bit busy though but that is understandable as it was a busy Saturday evening. The food reached the table on time so I will say, well managed. No classy decor thus giving you that typical fast food restaurant type of an atmosphere. Definitely a good place for some group of friends or party people out there to have dinner on their way back as this place stays open for quite some time at night.

Read the following true story if u have the time:

How i wish i had listened to my parents and ordered food for a dinner party at home from ANY other restaurant apart from jai hind dhaba in Kolkata on the 2nd of july 2016.

Had placed an order for chicken bharta, boneless butter chicken, malai kofta and palak corn saag while kaali dal and tawa roti were made in home. The order was placed at 9pm via zomato delivery. It showed that the food would be delivered at around 10:30 pm which was understandable as it had been raining.
A few snacks were made at home for the guests as well as ourselves which ran out by 10:45pm. When the food still hadnt arrived i called up the place and the person told me that the delivery guy was on the way and would reach in 10 minutes.

The food arrived at 11:30pm. A FULL DAMN HOUR LATER THAN SPECIFIED. And i was surprised and exceedingly annoyed by the fact that the person at the dhaba who answered my phone calls hung up midway TWICE. Thats when i lost my cool and tore my vocal cords.
After 4 more calls to the dhaba and a couple to the delivery guy and a few heated words with the person at the dhaba the food finally arrived.

Thank god.
Finally. Right?

Wrong.

The butter chicken was horrible, the malai kofta and the palak corn saag were too spicy for a normal person to eat. The best part about all the dishes was the kaali daal that was made at home and maybe the chicken bharta (which was the only reason for the 1 star although the overall experience was worth a negative rating).

The only satisfaction i got from the entire ordeal was writing this review in which i poured out all my anger and frustration at ordering food from Jai Hind Dhaba via zomato delivery.

I've been to Jai Hind numerous times. Jai Hind is the default place to go for hundreds of Calcuttan foodies. The north Indian cuisine here is like anything. My favorite is the Aloo do piaza, but lately the paneer butter tikka has improved a lot. Do try it along with Garlic Nan and Dal makhani. There's nothing like it.

Pure Dhaba food to relish with when you are out with your friends for a long drive or even a night out. Service is quite prompt and the food tastes just the way a perfect roadside Dhaba food would be like. I like the paneer bharta the most and can go really crazy for it.

Hungry at 1 am? This is your place to be that'll welcome you with open arms. This is my Go To place whenever I am craving for pure dhaba food. It's a two storeyed building. The ground floor looks very very very basic ( just a heads up if people are expecting amazing ambiance). The first floor is new and a much improved version. It has red couches and lamp shades dangling on top of each table. But wait, seriously who cares about how this place looks? The food. Oh my god. The generously buttery Butter Naan, the thick and tasty kaali daal, the perfectly done tandoori, paneer butter masala, the juicy reshmi kabab, the daal makhni,  the spicy chicken do piaza and the orgasmic chicken bharta 😍 I could go on and on. The quality has been pretty standard for all these years. The staff is more or less efficient. There are a few loopholes in the crowd management probably, but I'm willing to ignore that because the food just tops it all. The home delivery is quite efficient, quick and up to mark as well.

This is the ideal place where you can visit to satisfy your late night North Indian food cravings. The waiting time on weekends, even at midnight is around 30-40mins.

Please do not visit if you are looking for a cosy romantic place to spend quality time with your someone special. The interior is plain & simple with waiters running around with food plates.

The food is average to good. For the veggies, do try their Mixed Vegetable.I have tasted few of their Chinese dishes too  & they are pretty average .  

Portion is good. Price is reasonable.

Heard about this place and wanted to go there for a long time. Could not make it as it was not in our way when we are out. Finally went there just to taste the dhaba food. 
Took half chiken tandoor as starter, chicken kasha with extra spice, butter nun, tandoori roti with butter and one lachcha paratha.
The food came really late, being a dhaba I expected it would be faster.
However the food was really tasty and my crave for north indian food increased.

This place used to be our favourite as it was very near to my ex office and used to hop in on Saturdays for group lunch...
It's a typical Punjabi Food destination and they make some really soft butter rotis to be accompanied with Kali Dal or Chicken Bharta or Butter Chicken...Their Lassi is also well made but surely not the best...They have a kulfi counter as well...
Previously it was only a one room restaurant without AC but now they have axtended it with 2 seperate set ups...

Lovely punjabi food.  The dal tadka is to die for.  They serve crisp,  piping hot naan.  The other curries are good but in my opinion its not required.  Just the dal and roti are enough.  They serve mean roomali rolls also.  I am not a big fan of the lachha paratha rolls that are served elsewhere.  So the roomali paneer tikka rolls are a welcome change for me.  I absolutely love this place.

If you are looking desperately for a restaurant really late at night, this is the place for you. But do not expect anything out of the ordinary regarding the restaurant. The food is only slightly above average and is a bit overpriced for a so called "dhaba". Would not recommend it for a date. Good place to hangout with a group of friends though. The masala kulcha that I had ordered not only had a pretty hard crust, but the filling was done like a miser. I've also tasted Paneer kadai, Dal makhni, Mixed veg, Mutton keema tarka, Chicken tandoori butter masala and Chicken korma there and as I said they were just average. Except for the  paneer kadai which I found to be delicious. The delivery time is impressive but the catering staff weren't very hospitable.

This was my third visit to this place. this time for dinner,this joint being very close to my office we generally order foods for lunch.

Coming to food they don't have much variety I have tried both their veg and non veg items and must say that i liked the veg items more.

This time we had ordered chicken tangri kabab & tikka kabab,both had the same marination,over spiced and a bit over cooked.

The chicken served to us was not fresh and thought it was kebab it was very stiff and chewy.
coming to main course we ordered butter chicken masala and nan.
The gravy was okay and had amazingly small chicken pieces.

For the price part, compaired to the quality of food it seems unjustified.

The food is very consistent and service is excellent. Best part is it's opened till 2 at night. They have indoor seating and they serve in the car as well.

Their daal makhani and shaahi paneer is to die for.

No fine dining in kolkata can beat this place taste wise

THE only thing that is good about the restaurant is it's timings. The food is average at it's best. The rotis are made in a hurry, and doesn't quite suit the prices. The ambiance is far from good, and so is the overall decor. The good service and well behaved waiters can't make up for the bad food that they serve and that too in this moderate price range. Overall, if you are struck at 2 am, for some food, and with no good restaurants open nearby, it can be a last resort. But for a healthy date or any occasion it's a huge no.

Well I have seen this dhaba since 2001-2 when they had newly built their air-conditioned section, it was earlier a dhaba  sprawling on it's very best location with the ground floor functioning over the years they added another floor and lastly the 3rd floor was added. Coming to the food delivery I have had experience of the take away service by talking to the person in the restaurant via phone and placing my order and simultaneously sending my domestic help to pick it up as soon as it would be ready. Their food tastes extremely ordinary more so the chicken items. The naans and daal are made well specially the butter naans. It is definitely a savior for mid night food cravings.

Some places just go unlucky for me. Is it me or is it something else?
This dhaba featured in one of the best in Kolkata became my choice for puja lunch. It is a late review. I went to this place on an ashtami afternoon with my family. We ordered for reshmi kebabs and then polao, naan, bharta, paneer butter masala, chicken butter masala. 
I always keep fingers crossed while visting restros during puja as many places fail to deliver those times. So I tried to stick to a simple menu and waited for the food. 
The kebabs came on a foil plate with toothpick. I have always given priority to taste first and then aesthetics or decency. The kebabs were average like any other basic eating place in the city. The polao was big letdown as clearly the cook did not know how to cook a non-oily tasty polao. The side dishes were a wonder, as all of them tasted similar. Clones they were, apart from the names and the paneer and chicken pieces. It felt as if they had dipped everything in the same gravy and served. Huh!
Prices are affordable. Service was not so good and I did not expect that too, as during puja they serve for long hours at night also. 
The pain of choosing a well heard restro and then a letdown feeling hurts too much. It feels then shit, leave this, I need to have a great dinner now!

This place serves amazing north Indian food in town . I have been here many times and not even single time I have been disappointed with the food . they don't have good ambience but it gets nullified with their amazing food . You can try chicken tandoori and all kababs. My favourite dishes are chicken bharta, chicken tandoori butter masala, dal tadka,  panner chilly Indian and mutton keema kaleji. The best part is that they serve till 12 to 1 midnight.

The Tandoori dishes are fantastic. The Tandoori chicken and the butter chicken are really nicely prepared with the perfect amount of sweetness, spice and everything nice. The paneer butter masala (cottage cheese curry) is also very richly made and is can be enjoyed with their naan as well as butter roti. The prices are really cheap and therefore is not heavy on the pocket as well.
Must try dish has to be their Dal Tadka. The pricing is just right and service is super quick. Not for people for are looking for a fine dining experience. However, must visit for food lovers!

Sunday nights are to be avoided at this place. It was packed! Had to wait a good 45min to get a table. The guy at the counter wasn't doing it professionally enough as he should have been writing down names of ppl waiting. But after all it claims to be a dhaba so yeah, shouldn't have expected much anyway. Coming to the food, ordered what zomato recommended. Butter chicken, paneer butter masala, tandoori roti, jeera rice and daal makhani. Food was rich and nice enough to leave one satisfied. They seem to have decreased the amount of rice they serve. The price of the place is what it should be and one wouldn't feel fleeced. They've a second floor dining space now which has beautiful large glass windows which give the place an open feel. Overall, good experience despite the start 👍🏽

This is THE place for night owls like me! When you have no other place to order food from, this acts as the lender of the last resort. Having said that, the food is good enough for you to consider it as an option even if you have others in hand. Most of its paneer options are excellent (do not ever try their palak paneer, its awful) Special shoutout to their Indian chilly paneer. Its just brilliant. The choice of your items at this place is very important as traditional dishes like paneer butter masala etc. are not quite like what you would find in other places. Must haves include: crispy chilly babycorn, fried rice and paneer do pyaza. Definitely one of the best when it comes to dhabas.:)!

The only single reason this place has any footfall is because they are open throughout the night. Period.
The food was rubbery and pathetic, the service was just about tolerable. This is so below par that only if you are totally drunk, you can tolerate it. I found it pathetic from every angle.
But thanks for keeping it open throughout the night. Hence the rating. 
It might be the case that I visited 31st December night but whatever!

Cozy , sparsely occupied joint . the dishes are quite economical . now the taste part.... Tandoori chicken platter was quite good , nothing idiosyncratic. The pieces of chicken were a bit less juicy. The mutton keema was also very nice , but a little high on salt , maybe we felt such as its a keema dish. But the piéce de résistance was the chicken bharta. It was well mashed and perfect blend of the spices. The best dish that this dhaba can offer.. It's worth a try. The lassi was also so and so.

Went today will say the worst food i ever had food is nothing more than that of an ordinary roadside dhaba! It is noisy, old, congested and busy place ambience is not to be talked about, this is completely a road side dhaba. Don't visit with family. Stay away from this one. 

The salt and spices were very mild almost tasteless ordered spc channa masala which was yuck only a spoon of butter over it and it becomes special channa msala and what to say about malai kofta which was so tasteless and such bad taste that if you throw it in front of dog he/she will also not going to eat such rubbish. Naan was costly as per as size. Pea's pulao taste was like I am having fried rice not the best quality of food that's available. This place is a life savior for late night people... If you don't get food anywhere you will get it here

Overall it was a worst experience, not overwhelming. The price seemed a bit higher with all those service tax, VAT etc save your money don't dare to experience it better to have food in Pooja Snack (girsh park) which is very much cheap and great quality of food.

Ambience is okaish. They have different seating options for non ac and ac. 

Service is really fast. Its that kind of service which we actually expect in a 'dhaba'. 

Aloo do pyaza is a must try!

Went there after a long time after a movie at Forum. Was disgusted at the quality of food and the deterioration that has happened in the last 2-3 years. We ordered Chkn Tikka kabab and paneer tikka both were decent although the paneer lacked any seasoning. But when we ordered the Main course is when we regretted going there,The Dal tarka was bland and tasteless,absolutely lacking in any taste .
The Chkn tikka butter masala was much the same and tasted like a sludge of refined flour or maida with pieces of Raw chicken thrown in. YES the dal and the chicken both tasted the same and both had no taste. Pathetic food overall . Either it was bad day to visit or just another day...i am staying away from it for a long long time.

Typical dhaba food quality with an urban packaging.
Prices are pocket friendly.
Bharta, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, kebabs, polao all are nice.
They don't accept cards.

The dhaba is some place around "the dugout" on Sarat Bose road. Convenient metro stations will be Hazra or Netaji Bhavan.
They've a quite spacious interior... Though service was not at all prompt..and the waiter was rude.
Coming to food we ordered butter naan, tandoori roti, mutton kosha, zomato suggested - chicken bharta.
Chicken bharta was flavoursome... Perfect :)
Mutton kosha was also good.
Naan was costly as per as size.
Enjoyed the lunch.
So ratings :
Food : 4/5
Ambience : 3.5/5
Service : 2/5
Value for money : 3.5/5
Recommended.

Located in Paddapukur. You can easily locate this place by the crowd, irrespective of the time.

It has 3 floors. We went there around 2 AM and sat on the Second Floor. The seating arrangement is fine. The ambience and Decor is simple. 

Tried Garlic Naan, Chicken Butter Masala and Chicken Bharta. All the items were great.

Overall, a must try for everyone. Good Food is what matters the most. Right ! :)

Like a quentisensial good Dhaba, Jai Hindi is open till late into the night, acts as a last resort for post-alcohol binges, is priced cheap, and serves very good Butter Masalas ,Tandooris and Naans.

Likewise, like all Dhabas in the world, the ambience + hygiene is often lacking and a few (or more) of its curries are often similar, pre-cooked and orange-ish (like the Aloo Do-Pyaza I had was most likely butter masala gravy + extra aloo added later, garnished with deep fried onions on top).

If you visit (and you must), visit with a Dhaba mindset, and order, amongst others, Paneer Butter Masala (which has extra soft paneer, and a smooth butter masala gravy, which though isn't as sweet as Delhi style butter masala) + chicken bharta (a mildly spiced rich dish made out of chicken keema), along with a garlic naan and a Lassi (which isn't as rich as a Lassi should be, but sufficiently light to help one gulp down a heavy meal with lots and lots of butter).

I usually wrap up the meal by hopping on the other side of Sarat Bose Road and walking to Pabrai's for ice-cream.

The took an order over the phone at 8pm and said that they would deliver by 9pm. After 2 and a half hours of waiting and 19calls to the Dhaba and the parcel guy that still haven't delivered. On top of that they kept on maintaining on every call that the delivery guy has left with the order 5 mins back. THESE guys give Calcutta a bad name!Supremely talented with the worst of the kind of attitude.....5 for food 0 for Service....

This was our first visit to Jai Hind Dhaba. Came here with a lot of Expectation.
We ordered Tandoori butter roti, Butter Chicken, Veg pulao and mutton masala.
Butter Chicken was very delicious. Chicken pieces were soft and tender and gravy was perfect. Veg pulao seemed nice, but the quantity was on the lower side. We didn't like Mutton Masala. There was nothing special in that dish.
Overall it was an average experience, not overwhelming. The price seemed a bit higher with all those service tax, VAT ect.

North Indian has always been my favourite cuisine so when my friends pointed out this place I did feel happy. You get excellent butter chicken here along with the best garlic naan (aaah the butter on the top!!). We also tried butter masala kulcha and kadhai chicken which were simply fabulous. Will go back again!!! :D

Out of the world food. The go to place for most clubbers of Kolkata. Since I am a vegetarian and can only suggest on the veg food, don't miss out on the aloo do pyaaza, dal makhni, shahi paneer. The food is fresh and taste is mind blowing. However the place loses out on interiors. But considering it's a dhaba one should not expect much from the interiors.

This was my second visit here. Yesterday we wanted to eat some Punjabi food. Although it was vegetarian for us we decided to visit here. On my previous visit I've tasted their delectable kebabs. The most recommended one is the Chicken Tandoori. Also, the Chicken Tikka Masala is awesome. Now regarding yesterday's dinner we ordered Dal Makhni, Aloo Do Piyaza, Paneer Tikka Masala. Rotis were assorted. ...Garlic Naan, Butter Tandoori Roti, Roomali, Onion Kulcha and Butter Masala Kulcha. We also ordered a full plate Chicken Tangri Kebab for the kids. The Dal Makhni was good but not the extreme creamy ones which are definitely better to the palate. The Aloo Do Piyaza was a close kin of Aloo Dum but the fried onions added that extra zest. Paneer Tikka Masala was awesome. ..spicy with tender chunks of char grilled Paneer.Full marks for that. The Rotis were all very good but a special mention on the garlic Naan and the Onion Kulcha which were fabulous. Soft textured bursting with flavour from the spices. My son said the Chicken Tangri was excellent. ..juicy and flavoursome.Lastly for desserts we tried kesar pista kulfi with falooda. This one stole the show.Creamy kulfi with delicious falooda topped with rose syrup. The Ambience on the first floor was very good. ..lighting was dim ..glass full screen overlooking the road. Servers are polite, proactive and brisk. Recommended if you like "Dhaba" food. Price is justifiable. CHEERS.

Tadka and chicken bharta are definitely a must try. Other then that not much else to mention really. They do have a non AC and AC areas to sit. That's really all to mention really.

Food here is cheap, quick and tasty. We prefer to stick to the Indian food at the place. Place is always brimming with people so we tend to get the food delivered to our place. Delivery is a bit slow though.

One of those places that would still be worth it even if the prices of the food increased.

I have placed an order for food at 9.20 pm. The delivery was committed in 40 minutes. It is 10.45 pm right now and the delivery boy is still on his way. On top of everything the person receiving the calls is telling me that such delays is normal. He also said that I am wrong if I am calling again and again to check on my order. He was very rude and unaccomodating. Kindly beware of even worse situations when you place an order with Jai hind dhaba. The explanation given is that he had other deliveries also to make. I have guests waiting at my residence and have no food to serve them. I am feeling so ashamed. And I am regretting placing an order with Jai hind dhaba.

Now coming to the food, we had ordered kashmiri alu dum, dal makhni, paneer butter masala and veg pulao with tanduri roti.
All three dishes were horrible. The red gravy was full of tomato puree and the color. Tandoori roti was served half cooked. It was really hard to chew even.
All in all a horrible experience.
Vegetation customers, do note that the gravy prepared here is d common for veg and non veg items.

The restaurant turned out to be a big disappointment for my birthday treat.The restaurant provides several options for vegetarians but the food is sub standard. A dhaba is marked by its alu paratha and this place sadly dishes out alu parathas with unseasoned mashed potatoes with green chilies only. The malasa kulcha was meagre looking and the worst I had. here was no difference between the gravies served for paneer and mushroom. Definitely not made for second visits for vegetarians.

The main plus point is that it provides FREE home delivery and its open whole night ! Whoa! What else do you need when you can kill your midnight hunger by ordering food from here!

Whether it's a late night stopover or a midnight binge ordering, jai hind dhaba is a reliable place to satiate a hungry soul. The chicken tandoori is juicy and amazing, and the other things are good too. Their gravies are thick, creamy and might not be the healthiest, but since when did dhaba food become healthy? I love this place, and it ranks at the top of my favorites for late night haunts.

I've been here quite a lot of times and I've had a good experience all the other times except for once. We usually stick to ordering the same things like butter chicken, chicken bharta, dal makhani, kadhai paneer/ paneer butter masala and butter naan and masala kulcha. All the items are really good and they serve good food even at 1 o clock at night.
Only once among my visits, I'd found the naan to be too hard to tear and had ordered baby corn which was so not good. So I'd like to warn people from ordering the baby corn here, but apart from that everything else is very delicious.

I'm studying in Delhi and I carry Jai Hind back every time I come back home otherwise my flat mates in Delhi threaten to lock me out of the flat. :p 

Anyway, I've grown up eating Jai Hind and have countless memories associated with the food here. Many a clubbing nights / late night FIFA sessions have ended with the amazingly unhealthy but extremely tasty food of this place. 

The must haves include: 

1. Chicken Bharta 
2. Anda Tarka (double mirchi double anda if you like spicy food)
3. Rumali Roti (always)

A die hard fan of Tarka Roti from the line hotels in and around West Bengal. This place brings back a lot of memories when I am dining here. 

The days when we were in college to the times when we were in Kolkata to celebrate a get together or now friends weddings and present wedding bashes. Life was chilled out and we had at our disposal places like these with mouth watering food and excellent service. 

Trust me a place can change the equation of a lot of things when they served amazing and food to die for. 

Jai Hind is one of those places. 

My personal favorites the Tarka dal and Tandoori roties. But they serve amazing spread of food and most of the dishes are excellent. The lassi and buttermilk served too are great and the place is buzzing with people from all cadres. Taxi drivers to students to old aged and people from all castes, creed and walks of life. 

I have also seen a lot of people come in Beamers and Mercs and wait in their cars for a parcel. 

This is the aura of the place. 

Kudos Team! 
Thanks for all the memories that you revive every time I visit you. 
Cheers

A mordernised dhaba,food is average not that good,but roomali butter roti is one of the rarest thing that is available in the city and they provide it. So thats probably their best thing.

I would give them 0 if possible!

I ordered food for home delivery and they assured me that I would get the food in half an hour. After 40 minutes or so they called and told me they can't deliver unless bill value is 500 rs and my current bill was only 250. I was amazed since I have ordered many times from Jai hind for home delivery and never faced any problem. Still deciding to give them the benefit of doubt, I told him to take 250 as delivery charge. He refused saying he's not allowed. Then I said ok u pack food worth 250 rs and give to any poor person on the way since I don't want to call for it at home and waste the food. He said no to that too. Then I told him ok double the order and deliver to my house. He started shouting and said that no I won't deliver the food and hung up! 

Such disgusting behaviour! Instead of being apologetic about cancelling the order when it should have been delivered, they had the audacity to shout so much! 

Never ever calling home delivery from there again!

My family and I ordered chi bharta , dal tarka, paner butter masala 3 tandoori butter roti, naan and masala kulcha after an hour staff ask us to leave because we didn't order proper dish.
If they don't want to serve us or they must tell us or it will take time.
After this there staff used some bad language to my family and we left the place and didn't turned back ...........

There are times when you suddenly decide, I'm not going to eat at home tonight, but you look at the clock and it's already 10 pm, and you change your decision. But while I lived the  3 best years of my life as paying guests in Lansdowne during college, this was my midnight go-to place with my roomies. 
A number of times we just walked to the place at 11 or 12 at night and satisfied our intense hunger. 
Each time we ordered something different, and I don't remember the food being unsatisfactory even once. Of course, it's a difficult place to get a seat at past 8 pm, and it's a common sight to see people ordering and then eating their food while in their car just outside the restaurant.
The kebabs, the rotis, the chicken dishes, the mutton dishes, and the beautiful memories  always bring a smile. This place has always had a good crowd, and with those rates, it's pretty affordable, considering the area is abound with college students. This place will always hold a special place in my heart. :')

Had recently checked in along with my crazy friends.
To start with Chicken butter masalaa was really bad as the chicken was not prepared well as it was not soft..
Chicken bharta was good..
Panner butter masala was good ...
   
"The gravy of panner butter masala and the chicken butter masala was just same."

#The best "alu do pyaza" I had in my life seriously it was simply amazing....
Stuffed kulcha was soft stuffed well...
Butter naan was also good not burned or any kind of rawness..
Romali roti was also fine..... 
And to end coke ....

Nice place to go after party!

Every curry though tastes exactly the same .but its fine after a good round of party at 3:00 am.the rotis and garlic naan were crisp.
The mutton and chicken was cooked well.
The ambience was good.

And to end it all the falooda kulfi downstairs,cant be compared to a delhi outlet but i liked it.

Calcutta Dhaba food has always been my favorite, and every time I visit the city a meal at one is a must. Azad Hind is the one I usually visit but tried Jai Hind this time and absolutely loved it. The butter tadka dal and aloo do Pyaza we ordered with tandoori roti and Masala thumps up made one of the best meals I have eaten. Next time I am in Calcutta, this is the place I will hit for my Dhaba food cravings!

Have visited this place quite a few times. Located near paddapukur lake, opposite to laxminarayan mandir, Jai Hind Dhaba itself is a Landmark.

Interiors - Nothing great, just plain table chairs n sofa. But its d food that brings people here.

You end up here anytime and they will serve you the best. It's always a backup option for me.
What interests me here is its aloo do pyaza, dal makhani, paneer tikka and tandoori roti. They even serve good Chinese food. Not authentic but spicy..
Order anything and you'll be satisfied.

The one thing you will love about kolkata is its food.. And restaurants like jai hind adds to the good ingridents on the recipe which kolkata is.. I have been here for many times and also had experienced its home delivery.. The food here is i would say just the way North Indian cusion should be.. 
I being a vegetarian will refer you to try specifically the Dal Makhani, Kadai Paneer , Aloo Do Pyaza.. These are my favorites here. And as far as breads are concerned it depends upon your choices ; were they have soft rumali rotis , flavour full masala kulchas and much more to offer ..

There is good Indian food, then there is awesome Indian food and then there is jai hind food. You have cravings at 1 in the midnight for greasy, rich and typical Punjabi khaana and you have Jai hind for your rescue!  It's amazing how they operate and how they serve so many people so efficiently. The service is prompt, the food is brilliant, what else do you want. I love the breads they serve, the butter naan is so soft and crisp at the same time, so fluffy and so different than the other dhabas in Kolkata. This is probably Kolkata's best dhaba in terms of taste, service and everything. Amazing! Simply love this place!

I have a love-hate relationship with this place in the sense that at times I really love their food and at times the food doesn't taste that great. The Chicken tandoori and kebabs are quite satisfactory. But like I said, the kebabs are amazing, soft, tender and juicy most times. Really really good but then on a few occasions I found it to be a little stiff. The Butter naan and Tandoori roti are good though. The Butter chicken is passable. This place is known for it's tarkas and they do live up to that. The lassi is also amazing. There is nothing exceptional about the ambience and yet it's comfortable. I don't like the ground floor seating  arrangement though, it's a little shabby and looks unclean. But I like the first floor seating area overlooking the street. The huge red sofas and the light flowing in through the glass windows makes the ambience cosier and warm. The place has this typical dhaba vibe to it which I love. They remain open till late and they even serve the food in your car. The takeaway service is prompt too. The prices, I'd say are very moderate. I wish they served biriyani, the typical dhaba style biriyani. That'd have made me visit more often.

If looking for the authentic cuisine of Punjab... just visit JAI HIND DHABA. If you expect a fine dining experience, then you better avoid, as the name suggests... Its a DHABA. Whatever its a dhaba or a restaurant, I will love to visit again again, just to taste their "parathas" and "chicken bharta". Its finger licking awesome!!!

Ok I don't care about all the good talks about this dhaba or you may call is restaurant whatsoever but let me come to the epic point that is tick 3 pm u enter a restaurant and barely u sit and then the waiter or server comes up and say kitchen is closing so give your order fast :D I mean if your kitchen was closing why did you let any customer enter and sit then ? You should have put a sign board or your hours of operation and moreover which means that we are forced to order in a hurry ?? Is it so  ? We pay 1500 to 2000 and can't relax and order and repeated reminder comes from the waiter than whatever you want fast fast kitchen is closing .lol seriously I aint coming here if this is the service of the restaurant or dhaba but il be honest the food was well prepared specially the chicken bharta that's like no doubt about the taste and aroma but still I will come back to my point that a restaurant doesn't run just on food but manner and well service of the staff so was lil disappointed with my visit this time .

My verdict - For me good food and well behaved service goes hand in hand .

The service was also prompt and the staffs were good.Only bad thing was the washroom was  highly unhygienic and dirty!!!😑😑
I also happened to relish the kesar kulfi at a counter just on the pavement where this dhaba is!!! Overall a good belly treat!!!

This used to be one of our regular late night eating joint during our school and college days since its near my place but been there recently a week ago after long time.Nothing to talk about the ambience since its a dhaba not a proper classy restsurant,but the 1st,2nd and half of the ground floor is airconditioned and as per me its better to sir upstairs since it gets a lil crowded downstairs.Now as far as the food is concerned to ordered our all time fav Chicken Bharta,Chicken Butter Masala and tarka with Tandoori rotis and Nuns,it tasted well and probably more because we were really hungry,one should definitely give it a try specially if they suddenly feel hungry at odd hours and are nearby this place.

At the middle of the night if your stomach barks for food then the first name that should come to your mind is the traditional Jai Hind Dhaba. Both the Paddapukur & Hazra branch are ready to fill your tummy from the very first shine of the sun till the midnight moon turns on.

I had my dinner over in the Padmapukur Branch at 5 am. I visited this Dhaba at Durga Puja timings so even at 5 am morning it was very crowdy there, although especially at Puja timings the restaurant keeps open for almost whole day.

Location : This place is located near to the Netaji Bhavan Metro Station on Sarat Bose Road. Padmapukur Tank is the nearest landmark to this place.

Decoration : The place is huge including 3 floors of the restaurant. A small AC cabin is on the ground floor after that the 1st & 2nd floor is packed up with lots of sitings for a number of gangs to enjoy their Dhaba experience. The sitings are really comfortable with huge tables & sofas. You will also get a whole table for your gang, doesn't matter if their is less people in your gang you still don't need to share your table with others. The environment is pretty good, neat & clean to enjoy the Dhaba foods & dim lightings at night makes it more pleasant.

Staffs & Management : The place is so famous that I was already started to expect so much from them & just at right time the behavior of the staffs just whispered in my ears that "Buddy don't expect so much from us, we don't care about you." After asking them for few times about the siting they didn't guide us even they directly ignored us. Still we were able to find a place & shuttle down. After so many tries finally somehow we got their menu card, actually their special menu card for Puja. Then when we were suppose to place the order we tried to call the waiter & like the previous attempts they ignored us on face like a "EX GF" do. After few, few & few more minutes they finally took our order & served us pretty fast.

Jumping to the pet Puja experience : We ordered the following items as per Zomato users reviews because seeing the stuffs behavior we didn't expect them to guide us with their special foods...

Chicken Bharta : This is the dish that brings the actual Dhaba experience to your mouth. It tasted good. Very perfect amount of oil, spices & chilli were used so it was not so oily, spicy or hot. Kind of light taste, but it is easy to love. Chicken were soft & it becomes smooth into the mouth. Combining this with Rumali Roti offers some pure pleasure.

Butter Chicken : It is the traditional loving dish at every Dhaba. Just like the Chicken Bharta very perfect amount of oil, spices & chilli makes the taste real good. The butter chicken was not very rich but thick smooth gravy is such a pleasure to the mouth. Chicken pieces were very soft & nicely cooked. Rumali Roti is the perfect combination with this.

Roti : And here is the disaster begins. Usually nobody mentioned this but I got such disappointed that I am forced to mention. We ordered Tawa, Tandoori & Rumali Roti. Tawa Roti was simple home made kind of roti with no taste, little dusty & that is absolutely not going to fill 1% of a hungry stomach. We were shocked that they charges us Rs. 11 per piece for that bad quality simple rotis. Then it comes to the tandoori roti & I gave up completely. It was less Roti more Papar. It was hard, burned, very highly cooked makes this roti hard to chew. We ordered couple of them & every time it came cold & tasteless. This items can not be enjoyed with their such good dishes. Finally we shuttled with Rumali Roti. It was very average, smaller than other restaurants & it also carries a higher price tag.

Masala Onion : This is a famous dish over there. Onions are cut into big circle shapes & mixed with rich chilli powder & salt, nothing special about this. The quantity was good to solve the salad purpose to a number of people.

Pricing : Pricing of all the foods were good & deserve the price point well, except their Rotis. Rotis are such expensive & offers such ridiculous taste. Masala onion cost us Rs. 50, it seems little higher to me. All those food came with a price tag of Rs. 688 including Vat that is average price point. Thank god they don't take vat on rotis.

Conclusion : This is a good place for late nighters. Offers some excellent food for a good price. Recommend place to visit & experience good dhaba foods. This place delivers much better foods than their own Jai Hind Hazra branch.

One stop destination for every person living in the city for a late night dinner/snacks. You can order from your car if you are interested or they have both AC/Non AC seating zone. Food is very tasty but a bit costly considering their standard and other service they provide. Do try their Chicken Tandoori which is one of my favourites out there. Apart from that Chicken Bharta and Tadka Fry is decently tasty. Dont stress too much on the hygiene or service quality and there is a high probability that you will find this place crowded even at 1 in the night as there is a dearth in options for late night food.

Decent place. Authentic food. Went there yesterday(Durga Puja,2015) and found the prices were suddenly hiked by a considerable amount (by at least 10%) in the name of Puja Special which is quite unfair. They charge VAT separately which I wish was included in the prices. Coming to the food it tasted very good. The tandoori rooties were cold and hard and brittle even at 1:45PM when the restaurant opens at 12PM. The chikken tikka butter masala, dal makhani, and Paneer masala all tasted authentic and just like a dhaba should. The ambiance is quite poor even in the AC section but the rich aroma of food all around does help. Good enough for a family lunch or dinner at a pocket friendly price. If I go back it will be for the food. Specially the chicken dishes.

For authentic north Indian delicacies, this is the place you should go. Period.

Ambience is not much of a praise worthy, but the food is oh so delicious. The taste reminded me of the times when I was in Haridwar back in 2007.

We decided to hit this joint for Shaptami Lunch. We ordered Tandoori Rotis, Dal makhani, Paneer Butter Masala and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala.

The steel plates gave a rural touch. If you are looking for a fancy restaurant, I won't recommend this place. But this place has a comforting ambience. The Tandoori Rotis were perfectly made but once they get cold, they become chewy and rubbery. The Dal makhani was extremely well made. The Paneer Butter Masala tasted much better than all other restaurants. I don't know about the Chicken Butter Masala but my friend seemed to enjoy it very much. None of the dishes were spicy.

The service was courteous and the turbaned manager/owner was quite active unlike most other owners who just sit and chew some stuff with weird stares. This restaurant is a must go for all the north Indian food lovers. I noticed some families ordered Fried rice (Chinese delicacies) in a dhaba which disappointed me. If you have come to a dhaba, please don't order Chinese.

In a place like Kolkata, its difficult to find a good eatery with comfortable prices. However, when you finally find one, you promise yourself to go there as many times as you can.

So i were here for the first time and had chicken reshmi kebab, butter chicken , chicken bharta , black daal and naan. And it was really amazing . Just as you expect dhaba food to be. We even had the schezwan noodles. It was good too. And like any dhaba food , butter and oil were used were generously. But once in a while that is fine I guess. Do go there for a good dhaba experience.

Ambience is not to be talked about, this is completely a road side dhaba.. Don't visit with family, completely pocket friendly when hungry till death, home delivery is preferable for starvation rather pick up option is best thing as nowadays due to heavy load home delivery takes more than an hour. Keep in mind when you hungry and don't have ample cash you can fill your tummy by only 200 bucks and get hold of coke as well for the after effects

Jai Hind is one of the oldest dhabas in Kolkata. Though it's decor may not give the same story but it is very rustic at it's heart. The Dhaba provides sensational North Indian food, taking you on a miniature Punjab trip. To further increase their appeal they have friendly and courteous staff and lighting quick service. Jai Hind is an ideal place for a family or buddy meal. I would advice you to stick to the Indian course as the Chinese food there, won't  satisfy your pallet. 
My pick of the restaurant is Kaali Daal.

This is my 3rd visit but sorry to say that they should know the basic terms of service as one of the staff has served us mineral water in the reused glass...n on top of that one of the waiter was not able to serve us the proper order..n he ws getting  confused many times..The Kolkata people are aware about the well known restaurants bt then staffs should nt take advantage of their valuable customers bcos by doing this dey r spoiling der own image....

This place in kolkata was the only place which was open till 4AM in the morning. We were around 15 people and went there around 2AM the food they provided at that time was delicious. The tandoori , chicken reshmi butter masala and naan.

Not only is the food here extremely appetising, but also value for money. Everything here tastes authentic and yum!!  The chicken tandoori and dal makhni is a must on my order everytime I visit this place, because they're really that good. But, one has to be prepared to wait for at least half an hour, if they're planning to visit this place for dinner, be it any day of the week. The overall experience here will leave you satisfied, without punching a hole in your pocket :)

Naan, kulcha, chicken, paneer, mushroom. Jai Hind never disappoints!
Sometimes they over-do on their oil, but the food has always been tasty.

The food is detoriating day by day. I feel I should stop ordering in here. Jai Hind Dhaba , Kyu ittna quality kharab ho rh? Everytime I order something and the food is not good we think , Ok ! Not everyday is a good day. But since the last three times we have noticed that the quality is getting worse day by day. The Owners , please see to it that your cook is seen to it.

I went there after reading the reviews about good north indian punjabi food..As a being of North indian,I would say there is no taste in paneer butter masala which I order along with butter nan.I ordered masala papad too,there was a piece of hair inside the papad,I immediately complained to staff and they replace it.I went in AC dhaba as there are two sittings AC and Non-AC.It is overpriced too as per the taste and quality . Disappointed

Landed in Kolkata and we had just checked in at our hotel. Searched a place for lunch and Zomato lead us to Jai Hind Dhaba. We had our heart filled with Tarka Fry, Paneer Butter Masala and Channa along with Butter Naan and Rotis. All the items had the Punjabi flavor and loved every dish till the last bite. Thank you for a wonderful meal.

Kolkata has a variety of delicious cuisines to choose from but being born and brought up in north India, nothing can replace my love for Punjabi food and that's where jai hind comes in. The paneer dishes and butter chicken out here is amazing!! A great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a hearty meal at a very reasonable price. Plus its open till like 2:30am which makes it a must go for students who get midnight hunger pangs!! 😉

Late night plan? Short on budget? But no compromise in quality? This is the place! Decent space as there are two ac floors and a non ac section as well. Parking may be a problem in peak hours.
Food: The kebabs are good, but a bit dry. Go for the naans and butter masala dishes. Definitely end with a kulfi.

Jai Hind Dhaba. The name says it all. If you are a foodie and have tried almost every place you wanna eat, this must be somewhere on top 5 of your list. The north Indian is extremely good. Paneer Butter Masala is definitely the favorite here. I haven't had better paneer butter masala than served here. Be it a late night dinner or hefty afternoon lunchtime, you ought to have your stomach filled. This by far is the best Dhaba in town. Have fun having food here.

ever since joining sishumangal hospital as a resident, this amazing outlet has been my life saver from the awful hostel food. be it our late night visits after tiring duties or home deliveries, jai hind has been the only option. the fact that it remains open till 3am at night is a big plus as on many occasions, we have duties till 12 at night, hence there are not much options but to go to this joint which is also quite near to my hospital. 
we have tried almost every nonveg item in the menu, among which mutton keema, chicken bharta and egg chicken tadka remain my favourite. have them with tandoori or roomali roti with a glass of cold drinks, and you wont regret. for the veg lovers, i would recommend their dal makhani. the price is quite reasonable and the service is prompt, however the home deliveries are sometimes a bit delayed. 
i definitely recommend jai hind.

My friend SaYan GupTa  and I visited this eatery for lunch, just a couple of days back.
Young, hungry yet not with much money in hand, we opted for the dhaba for a filling luncheon. And yes, we were fairly satisfied. We ordered a small course of tandoori roti, roomali roti, dal makhni and butter chicken... Added a couple of cold drinks and we were sorted. The bill came to a whopping 500/-.
The dal makhni was tasty, with a dash of green chillies. The butter chicken smelled richly of butter, so lived up to its name. Adequate gravy, and 6 succulent pieces, were well shared by the two of us.
Our only disappointment lies in the tandoori rotis. They were hard, and bit too crispy. One would have to have enough patience to be able to tear the roti and dip it piece by piece into the gravy. It spoiled the overall experience in a big way. The ambience is conducive for eating, with mouthwatering smells to enhance the appetite. The decoration is simple, done up in appetizing reds.

The dishes i usually try here are their tarka and their chicken bharta. Apart frm that i also have tgeir kababs( i dnt knw why but i love their malai chickn kebab and their hariyali kebab). 
They even do home deliveries. Overall i like this place. Definitely a try fir those who already have not.

Have lost count of the times I've visited Jai Hind. They serve fine Indian Cuisine and Chinese as well. The best thing about Jai Hind is it's open 24x7. I have visited Jai Hind with my friends after parties mostly late at night. But it seems to be crowded almost all the time! They even have home deliveries which is the second best part. When I was staying at a PG in Park Street, Jai Hind was the one to save me from the tasteless PG food. Thank you Jai Hind 😄

Whenever you feel like having a desi night out Jai Hind Dhaba would a long way in satisfying that desire. The food is orgasmic specially the anda tarka or paneer and aloo do pyaaza. It gives you a rare Punjabi feel in Kolkata. The ambience is a little shady if you're used to 5 stars but it's a go to place for having a delicious meal. The roomali roti is a standout. Recommended by most Calcuttans

We were planning to have a family lunch at Jai Hind Dhaba since a long time and finally we went there this Saturday. Being vegetarians we ordered for Dal Makhni paneer do pizza, malai kofta and garlic Nan, masala kulcha and tandoori roti. The food was overall fresh and tasty. However, it was a little extra spicy and also it seems they generously use red color in the vegetables. The Nan and tandoori roti were well baked and good, masala kulcha was nothing great. Overall I think they should reduce the teekha. Per head cost came to ₹200. Overall a 3. Maybe this is the best Dhaba for kolkata, but nowhere near the quality of Sharma Dhaba of Jaipur.

Wonderful place to hang out late nights. Loved the food except the rotis/ kulchas which becomes very hard if you don't eat too fast. For vegetarians this might not be the best place to have starters as options are very limited though there is plenty of options for main course. Very highly appreciated is the lightning fast service and the behaviour of the staff.

Amongst India's contribution to the world,The Zero,Rabindranath Tagore,M.F.Hussain and Leander Paes......the Dhaba food will count as a significant one.

Robust,rustic,whole spices,quick curries,killer dal,whole onion,green chilly typify Dhaba food.Though nowadays we have a/c halls and wooden furniture in place of charpais and wooden planks to keep your food in,the Jai Hind Dhaba though a recent addition has already carved a loyal fan base amongst kolkatans.

Tandoori Chicken,Butter chicken,Mutton Korma ( though strictly not a Dhaba item ),Dal fry and surprisingly a killer chilli chicken.

All items good,a little oily but that's how Dhaba food is supposed to be.The upper floor is air conditioned and the glass window offers a great view of the teeming S.B.Road.

Reasonable prices,good service and you have a comeback joint here......

I always wanted to experience what eating in dhaba is like. Jai Hind Dhaba gave me one of my best meal. As it is a dhaba, we tried punjabi food. Paneer tikka, chicken bharta are must try. Tandoori chicken is absolutely awesome. Special mention for lassi. I've never had such good lassi before. And not to forget the tandoori roti. The interior is prim & proper, services are prompt, and food is lip- smackingly delicious. What more does a food- lover want! We'll definitely visit this place again.

Today i went to hazra for some work and suddenly i was soo soo hungry. A number of places crossed my mind while i was searching for a right place to eat . Then i opened my bookmarked restos in zomato and saw if i bookmarked any place in and near about hazra. Then i found this place. 

Location -- this place was located at paddapukur. This was the first time i was going there without a car so i really didn't know how to reach. I started walking towards landsdowne and after reaching the crossing i took an auto upto this place. So now i can easily locate. And now i can say this place is easy to locate.

Ambience -- when i reached there, only two people were sitting and having food. I saw very few staffs and they were pretty slow compared to their service during night even late night. Even a waiter gave me a glass but didn't serve water. I did self service. Well this kind of behavior is certainly not expected from jai hind.

Food -- now coming to the part for which i went there. I ordered chicken bharta , roomali roti ( as tandoori roti was not available ) and masala onion. 
The chicken bharta was in a word awesome. It was just out of this world. Had a very typical punjabi flavour which i love and that tinge of masala. Ohh!! I love that smell. It's certainly one of jai hind's best dishes. 
The roomali roti was soft and hot served direct from the tava. 
Masala onion is another thing to die for. Nothing special in preparing it. Just lemon and red chili powder mixed with onions but the proportion and process makes it just yummmm...

Overall, a nice experinece. Recommended if u are looking for a nice and pocket friendly punjabi dhaba ..

A perfect punjabi restaurant. The location is good. When it comes to food it's a sure thing to visit. I heard that it's basically a North Indian restaurant though it serves Chinese dishes. I tried Chicken bharta, Chicken butter masala, peas pulao and butter naan (thanks zomato for guiding me on this). Me and my Foodie friend really enjoyed the lunch. Butter Chicken was rich, Chicken bharta was creeaamy, so good. And the peas pulao was perfect but it was served less in quantity as compared to its price and the naan was soft and buttery. A must visit for the North Indian food lovers.. Next time I will try the Chinese dishes.. And yes, one of my friend told me to try the tandoori Chicken but our stomach was left with no space. So next time I am sure that I won't disappoint my friend. :)

Went to this place for the first time two months ago with three friends.  In the last two months I have been here 5 times . The finger licking good taste, creates craving to come to this place again and again.

The place is open till 2 am in the night. Prices are reasonable. Service fast.

Ambience good. Obviously not like fine dining  restaurant.

Waiting time even in the middle of the night is the one that kills but they can't do much about it. The dhaba is always full.

Jai Hind Dhaba is famous for its dhaba style food and late night service. It is located just beside paddapukur bust stop and is the nearest eatery from my place. I had dined here many a times and everytime my order would be chicken bharta or butter chicken. The bharta is highly recommended since it tastes homely and one plate easily serves two. This time i wanted to try something else. So i had a takeaway of chicken do piaza. It was very tasty with the right amount of spices and tasted perfect with home made polao.

Nice place for hangout and the best thing is their timings. The food is typical Punjabi style dhaba food.The ambiance perfectly matches with the name though it's air-conditioned.They have Chinese dishes in offer but never dare to try it. The pricing also is very reasonable.

This is one of the foodies destination for late night people. Food is pretty good. Along with  Tarka,chicken bharta and other punjabi gravy the veg preparations are equally tasty. The lassi is a must try beverage. The ambience is jst as same as typical punjabi dhaba nd is crowded throughout d day. So make sure if u go there u have enough time in hana.

Tandoori chicken is mind blowing. Soft and tender. I am a big fan of their butter chicken. The paneer butter masala is hand in glove with  tandoori butter roti/laccha paratha.

I was there with my friends yesterday to celebrate birthday of one of our best friend. This was very good in all manners. There we ordered chicken tikka butter masala , crispy baby corn, paneer butter masala , chilly mushroom and many more. This was a friendly place . I was there for first time.  But I liked the place very much.

The best dhaba in town. You can eat in your car, there's three air conditioned floors with the third floor being recently made. The ambience is great for dinner - much better than one would expect out of a dhaba.

Their Double Mirch Dal Tadka is really amazing for those who can handle a little spice. Normal Dal Tadka is for the ones preferring it less spicy. Dal Makhani is also quite good.

The mixed vegetable, aloo do pyaza and Garlic Naan are great

And a little masala onion to go with it all.

One problem is that they only have Pepsi and not Thums up. I really wish they could get Thums up instead.

The location of this outlet is just havoc, you can connect to this place very easily, next, the space that this restaurant has got is very large, 3 floors airconditioned and one non AC section. Its value for money, given the location, the comfort, the airconditioned setup and the quantity & taste of the dishes. We ordered hot and sour soup which tasted not that great, but the Chicken Fried Rice and Szechwan Chicken tasted very good. Agian I would like to mention the quantity factor which was sufficient for two. The service was quick, and I will visit the place once more as the authentic punjabi dishes are yet to be tasted by me and they are very famous at this outlet. Only the odd thing is the washroom at this outlet which is a separate setup and on the ground floor that too not well maintained which is not at all commensurate with the restaurant. Another big minus point is ''only cash transaction'' method followed here and for this I had to visit an ATM to pay up the bill. Prices are very much okay.

We ordered 1 tandoori alu, 1 paneer tikka and for the main course 1 dal makhani, 1 chana masala, 1 alu do piaza and in rotis 1 rumali roti , 1 garlic naan, 1 masala khulcha n a plate of rice along with onion salad and 2 cold drink. The bill was 1067. The rotis were really soft n garlic naan had that crispiness. Alu do piaza was amazing. Overall good food in cheap price.

Pretty decent dhaba cum restaurant on the busy sarat bose road near padmapukur. I liked the Dal Makhani, Tandoori Chicken and Butter Chicken, which are a must at any punjabi eating joint. They do not charge tax on the kulchas and rotis, which is a rarity these days. The service isn't the best I have come across. The seating upstairs is simple. They do not accept cards, which is a negative. And the biggest plus is that they are opened till 2am, so no matter how late is it, you will never be short of good food at reasonable rates.

The most visited dhaba by my friends and I, Jai Hind Dhaba is a very well located on the main road ( Sarat Bose Road ) right next to Paddapukur. 
The dhaba sells Indian and Chinese food however I've never tried their Chinese cuisine. 
Talking about their Indian cuisine, Jai hind sells the best dhaba food in the city at unbelievable prices. With no particular target audience, jai hind dhaba has lovers ( rather loyalists )of all age groups and is fully occupied on all days of the week. 
For students like us, unwilling to shed out a lot of money however demanding great food, Jai Hind is the place to visit ! 
Their Butter Tandoori Roti or Butter Naan paired along with Chicken Tikka Butter Masala along with their mindblowing lassi is my personal favourite, and the aroma never fails to increase my appetite. 
The super efficient service, great pricing, extensive menu and long hours of operation, makes Jai Hind Dhaba one of the most promising food joints of the city that would never fail to disappoint customers. 
The deduction of the 0.5 marks are for an unhygienic / dirty mens toilet which needs to be improved for that full 5/5 since its a vital part of any dhaba/restaurant. Other than that no complaints and a big thumbs up to Jai Hind Dhaba !

This outlet is situated bang on Sarat bose road,where i go for my tutions 3 days a week. Consequently,I've paid innumerable visits to this place.
Its basically a no-frills kind of a joint,serving excellent food at hefty portions at unbeatable prices. Their aloo paratha is a favourite of mine,as well as their tandoori aloo. 
Chana masala,dal makhani( served with a huuuge dollop of butter on top), mutton keema,chicken tandoori are some of my other picks.
I usually pair them with romali rotis and raita.
The service is prompt. They have an ac section ,too...if you are big on surroundings.
A perfect answer to my post-tuition hunger pangs.

Well I love this dhaba food more than others. Advantage of it staying open longer is a big plus and reason. But that apart the food is very good the double mirchi tadka alu do pyaza kaali daal garlic naan and roomali roti make up the regular order for my family and friends. We even call for the food at home for poker sessions and when there is dhaba food craving! It is good on the pocket and it is definitely very satisfying to eat (you have to forget the calories from late night eating!).

Tandoori chicken is fantastic. Breads are good, other non veg dishes are okayish. Paneer dishes r good even. 
Lassi is great ofcourse. 

Bottomline: This place offers decent food at economical price and added that it caters late at night so earns brownie points wid foodies and@ nocturnal beings alike.

This place serves finger-licking north indian food at unbeatable price. The best part about this place is the consistency..everytime you order your favourite dish it will taste the exect  same as it did last time. Special mention has to be made of their "dal makhani" and the special "double mirchi tardka"..both of which go best with rumali roti. As for the chicken items, " chicken bharta", "chicken kasha" and "chicken do piaza" have to be my favourite.
A big thumbs up to this restaurant from my side. I only wish more such places would open in south kolkata!

This is a place which comes in handy after a night of partying... Catering to the large group of nocturnal hungry people and sitting right beside the pan Asian hotel... It's a decent fare.. Which remains open all day and all night long.the chicken bharta, tandoori roti, paneer, peas pulau.. Are just okayish.. Nothing great..and the pocket pinch is also not much.but it can take time for even a small takeaway. Ambience is not that great and waiters can be callous sometimes..however as said earlier when you r hungry at the dead of night you might overlook everything :-)

So maybe this place isn't much in terms of ambience and decor,but it serves you what matters most and that is comfort food! Be it the sweet aroma of peas pulao, butter rumali roti, butter tandoori roti or the lip-smacking, finger-licking side dishes like chicken do-piaza, chicken kosha, chicken butter masala cooked to perfection- they leave you asking for second or even third helpings. And the pocket pinch for two is around 400( very cheap). So when you are ravenously hungry and your pocket's half-empty, surely give this little dhaba a visit. :)

I went there with my family , place is easy to locate and happens to be one of the most famous places in bhawanipur to eat. We had ordered variety on the menu chicken shami kabab , butter chicken , roomali roti , garlic and butter nan , aloo do pyaza , mixed non- veg fried rice , chilli paneer , dal takda , and many more. Place is good and clean. Talking about the service "WORST service" ever . all rating here is for food solely. They took a hell lot of time to serve and when you reach there hardly would you find any waiter to concern your order. They didn't even gave a single spoon or fork on the table. Repeating again, WORST service ever this was perhaps the reason I won't visit that place again. Food was good take parcel for happy eating . my second visit was good and food was served faster.

If you are looking for a place for extremely good north Indian food at an unbeatable price, this tops the list. Even though, it is named "dhaba", it offers dining in all varieties. You have options to sit in an a/c or non a/c sections. There are 3 floors in total. The food is rich and delightful. Best part is that it is worth the money. Neither too cheap nor too expensive, one of the favorite hangouts of people in Calcutta going for good food and not brand. Not suitable for fine dining, large gatherings are well accommodated.

Jai Hind Dhaba is conveniently located in Sarat Bose Road and is a pretty popular joint not only because of its delicious food but also because of it's price. Pleasantly it's rather easy on the pockets. I have been visiting this place for quite some time and it's easily one of the best food chains in town. Unlike other dhabas the quality is good and surprisingly not very greasy. Also their home delivery system is rather efficient and super fast. Their yellow butter Dal fry is undoubtedly one of my favourite dishes. There's not much of an "ambience", pretty humble but the taste is finger licking good. Their bread section comprising of tandoori and roomali rotis are top notch, jeera rice, mushroom masala, chicken tarka, chicken tandoori are some of the dishes I love to order whenever I am there. 
They also have a roll section where they serve "fat free rolls"! Though I am very much keen on having the full fat rolls it's definitely a weight watchers delight to have a section like this. This place is a must try for anyone who loves good food!

Need chicken after dancing till 2 am and cannot hold back your hunger? Hop in at Jai Hind for this place is simply amazing when it comes to eating good late in the night. Though almost everyone knows still, their chicken bharta is a must and shouldn't be substituted for any other item.

Visited the place on twice ....and it's one of those rare laces where the 2nd experience was far far better that the first one. Conveniently located and location is such that you won't miss the white on red hoarding!
the place i beautifully lit up in the evening with a glimpse of the sarat bose road through those large glass windows. Decor is simple a tad old fashioned but then the food compensates for pretty much everything!
Pick up any thing from the menu and it's bound to taste nice.
The mutton keema is bliss. The bharta is probably the best i have ever had. So were the  kebabs n the tandoori chicken(and it wasn't charred, thankfully). Even the Shahi paneer tasted so so lovely. Everything cooked to perfection with the right amount of spices. It's one of those places where i feel safe to experiment.....i mean ...i am sure nothing can go wrong with them.
Now that i am writing , an urge to visit the third time is creeping up my mind.......

I absolutely love it. 
Nothing makes me happier than the rumali roti, chicken tandoori and of course the chicken bharta. 
You can NEVER go wrong with chicken bharta here. 
It will legit never disappoint. Right amount of butter , spices and chicken. 
You might have to wait a tad bit long on weekends for a seat but the food here is a total worth it. Both quality , quantity and value wise. Also, they have friendly staff who really see to it, that you had a good experience.

I was in Kolkata in transit, and my friend took me to Jai Hind, claiming it to be the finest in the place. That turned out to be true!
We enjoyed "double chilly daal" - a very spicy dal, which was had along with dal makhni to tone the spicy name down. The paneer was very soft, as good as any Dhaba's. What took the cake was alu do pyaaza. I could never imagine that dish could taste so exotic! They would customize your roti as you please, and served really good kulcha. 
The restaurant's interior was very spacious, long tables with a beautiful lamp hanging just above the centre.
And, the bill was almost half of what I had imagined.

Jai hind dhaba can be compared with MAA er Adore (Mom's love). It never disappointed my. In 2014 Durgapuja Astami, when me and my friends failed to grab food anywhere in Kolkata.  We lastly went to jai hind dhaba, take away our order in 20 to 25 mins. Also food freshly made. Teast were good. Tandoori Chicken was average, daal Tarka & Chicken Bharta were awesome. As a delhite, I know they have scope of improvement.

Ordered chicken fried rice and chicken tikka butter masala and green salad. The gravy of chicken chicken butter masala was awesome...so eas the chicken fried rice. The chicken pieces of of the butter masala could have been a bit softer...but it was not the their fault...may it was grilled for a little longer than usual. And most of all thanks for opening till late when there is no other option to dine out late  night in kolkata...one can simply rely on Jai Hind Dhaba...kudos!!!

Ambience is a little below moderate.
At night the lighting of the restaurant is dim you wouldn't recognise the colour of your gravy. If u r not sitting near those glass windows then your experience deteriorates by 50%. By far chicken bharta is their best chicken dish where the chicken just melts in your mouth. We also ordered daguerreotype chicken which is fairly nice. They do not have fresh lime soda, just fresh lime water. The masala Pepsi was horrible.

This place is very good... The foods are very tasty .. :) The chicken and veg items are much more tastier than the mutton items.. I was very surprised by the Dhaba cause I don't expect much from this Dhaba but this Dhaba Exceeds all my expectations  :) 
The Dhaba is well decorated and the prices which are shown in the menu are all included tax.. :p 

Thank you :)

This place is renowned for being open till dawn literally. There has been times when you come out late and you know that all hotels have closed  except this one. You should not care about the ambiance, they serve good food. They serve good kebabs and i also like the dal makhani and roti.

This is d place fr late night party-goers, craving fr North Indian food .. Egg Tarka wid Roomali Roti is my personal favourite .. Kadhai Paneer and Aloo Do Piaza are also yummy .. Quick service is another virtue of this place .. Ok sort of an ambience .. d 0.5 goes missing because d pricing is slightly high fr a 'Dhaba' .. Bt surely, d quality as well as pricing is way better than Azad Hind and Sharma Dhaba .. Definetely recommended ..

I went to this place for the first time when I was in school. My friends and I dutched. That is when I tried Dal Makhani with roti. It was just amazing. It was perfect. I still don't miss out on it. The tandoori chicken butter masala is another dish that I also don't miss out on. Highly recommend everyone!
A thumbs up to this joint for serving food for as late as 2am. Park your car and have jolly time with your buddies with finger licking food. Take the food in your car....nothing better than that, late at night in a deserted road.

Craving a midnight meal... jai hind dhaba is THE place to be. Hot, yummy indian food fresh of the kitchen. Open till wee hours of the morning. It is usually the go to place for all late nighters either from work or from a party.. prepare to find a mix croud of ppl when u go there.

The chicken do piaza and the egg tarka are my favourites coupled with hot tandoori rotis. Explore the menu. The food in general is good. Items like masala onion, mixed raita  and masala pepsi are good side dishes to order.

Easy on the pocket. But due to popularity u could be struggling with parking even at 2 am! 

All in all a good place. Do scope it out.

One should visit the place to have Punjabi Dhaba Food... One of the best... Apart from tandoori chicken, butter chicken, I love to have their kebab (reshmi/ tikka)... Chicken Bharta with romali roti/ butter nan - the best... Also special egg tarka is wonderful... But in the evening after 8 pm there are heavy crowd... So you might have to wait a long to get chance... Also they serve food on your car outside restaurant on the road side... So getting food here is not a problem... Another good thing abt this restaurant is that it remains open till mid night...

One needs to understand that good service is an important part.
Jai Hind dhaba having good food does not bother about serving the customers, nor in fine dine in nor for home delivery.
Ordered food at 8pm and still no delivery till 10 pm having being told 45 minutes and the people are out speaking over the phone. 
Ridiculous service and staff......

We pay for the service and food its not what is provided free of cost.

We went there when the facing for Punjabi food called us from within. We ordered the tandoori chicken for starters, and it was wonderful. The chicken was well done , crisp outside and tender inside. Finger licking good. We ordered butter roti ( and god, are they cheap!) And chicken tikka masala and chicken butter masala. I was a little disappointed here as they kinda tasted similar. We ended the meal with masala cold drinks and nimbu pani. The portions were good , and the price is the best part. Service and ambiance , average.

This place is situated in Sarat Bose Road next to Pan Asia Hotel & opposite Mangalam hotel. This dhaba has become one of the best Dhaba in Kolkata. It's open late till night and peoples come their after 12 midnight also. 

I have been to this place many times but every time the quality of the food is getting better. I am a vegetarian and have tried many items out there and everything is good. Perfect taste and perfect blend of spices. Just love the food out there. Will surely recommend this place.

I've visited this place last week. The ambiance of this restaurant is quite well but not like a dhaba. Food quality is very high. Though its a dhaba however I suggest all to try Crispy Chilly Baby Corn. But ultimate attraction of this restaurant is obviously Punjabi dishes. All dishes are very delicious. Best of luck.

Late night food and this is the place Kolkata looks up to, cars all around the place and one would definitely meet old friends who party Late night .

Food is just the way it should be "maska maar ke ....tadka phaad ke....."with butter lacing your food pipe it's a haven for people who love there food to be teekha and chatpata.

Service is quick and prompt.

Try there chicken bharta, keema matar and dal tadka, paneer bhujia with crisp garlic naan. 

The last time I had tasted such rich food was in kesar da Dhaba in Amritsar.

We had ordered a home delivery for food for 7 people on 23rd october, 2016 and the delivery was supposed to be done in camac street area. The order was placed at 8:10 PM I was told that the food will be delivered in 40 mins. Unfortunately after calling umpteen no. of times on their no. given on zomato i.e. 92305 08033 the person kept assuring that their delivery person has left and food will reach anytime. But to my utter dismal, we waited till 10:15 pm and then finally we decided to go out somewhere to eat. It was a pathetic experience from this renouned food joint for home delivery.

Jai hind :- 
The dal makhanj of this place is quite an addiction...
Somehow if I wanna eat Indian, I can only think of this place... Any other restaurant the I automatically start remembering the dal of this place....
For egg lovers :- the double dal tarka is fantastic
I have my friends who love the garlic Naan n Romania roti by them....

I wish they start serving thumbs-up again coz one does need d fizzy drink after such heavy food...

The 2nd floor is still our favourite place to sit... Since it's spacious n the height is definitely an advantage compare to the 1st floor...

It was midnight and we were not just hungry, but starving! So the only place we could think of was none other than Jai Hind Dhaba. So we headed there and once we reached the venue, it seemed like it was hardly 7/8pm.. All the tables were occupied and we had to wait for around 15 minutes to get a table. Once we managed to grab a table(which was actually a 6 seater but then all 8 of us managed to squeeze in). So we ordered tandoori chicken, chicken bharta, chicken butter masala and tandoori roti. Well, if you ask me, I found everything absolutely delicious as I was starving and every piece of food i gulped seemed like heaven ;). However, I definitely recommend the chicken bharta and tandoori chicken The chicken dishes might not be the best in the city yet they were well prepared. But all said and done, full marks for serving tasty food when all the other restaurants were closed! :)

This particular place is one of the few life saviours in town. Be it midnight, 1 or even 2 or 3 AM, and you need to eat - this is the place you should come to. It served my ultra late night hunger on more than one occasions. The people are really helpful and friendly and the food is absolutely top class. You can either sit inside and have your meal in two separate sections or you can simply enjoy it being in your car or a cab. The people will serve you well and they do late night deliveries too which is one of its kind.

So after a tummy filled year and a half in Hyderabad, this was the first restaurant my inmates took me to in Kolkata.
At first I was like "Its a Dhaba, let's go somewhere else", but after tasting the food I realised this place does justice to the hype it gets.
For starters we had some fries and paneer which I gobbled up when no one was watching. Since we all were vegetarian we order North Indian and to my utter surprise it was finger licking good. We had our table on the second level and the ambience was decent. Its friends ke saath vellapanti type place. Good for those throbbing hunger pangs and light on you wallet.

Food served is tasty. Nothing special to mention about the menu and more or less has the standard dishes one can get at any dhaba or north indian joint. However, the tandoori chicken is a must try, it is cooked to perfection,the spices blemd in very nicely and the chicken is also quite soft and juicy.

The hot n spicy bharta here is still my favorite in Calcutta, the kulcha soaked in butter slides down my throath still as it did 8 years ago. The prices are extremely reasonable and my friends swear by the tandoori chicken! Whether you want to go for a quiet family dinner or a friends birthday celebration. This is the place to go!

It gathers brownie points on account of the delicious food in its menu and the late night delivery. It is a lifesaver for many hungry souls of Kolkata looking to satisfy their hunger pangs late at night. I can only review the food ordered through Home delivery and didn't actually visit the establishment. 

First and foremost, the delivery was prompt; within 30 mins of ordering even at 11pm in the night. 

Coming to the food:

1. Chicken Bharta - Shredded pieces of chicken in a thick,yellow tangy gravy was an absolute delight. Nicely cooked with a balance of spices.

2. Deal Makhni - The traditional North-Indian black deal preparation was expertly prepared just like it supposed to be and was thick;just the way I like it. 

3. The tandoori rotis were nicely packed and were piping hot when we had them. 

The place has attained legendary status in Kolkata and has garnered loyal fan following. So go ahead and order away.

Though the ambience is not the very royal class(Being a Dhaba) it is managable and the food just makes u forget all of the other things! I have been there a couple of times and they havent dissapointed me! I would definitely recommend the Rumali Roti and the Dal Makhni!

I would refrain from logging in my first encounters at this joint as then the food quality if not excellent was good. But recently this popular joint daunting on the "Dhaba" culture has ignored heftily on the main thing an eating joint is based on...TASTE OF FOOD!!!! Repeatedly i have found all there curries to be literally the same...its like different name for same package.....and they are always saltless to the point it becomes almost inedible. I took a butter Chicken and Chicken Do PIaza recently only difference in these two curries are the dopiaza has fried onions on it and the butter chicken does not. The Dal makhani is better in comparison to the formerly described items. But still it always gives me a nagging feeling that there is some very vital ingredient missing in it. I just love there rotis...i wish all there other dishes were made with the same love and care as the breads. They are Fluffy soft and just perfect. The tandoor items are too dry and again they miss the salt. I love there masala papad which is basically roasted papad with onion tomato and chillies.... their chicken bharta is by far the best dish...over all FOOD QUALITY AND TASTE NEEDS A HEAVY OVERHAULING!!!

Visited this restaurant with my partner for lunch. Located near the paddma pukur swimming pool and opposite of the hotel Mangalam. Indian and Chinese both dishes are present in their menu. Staff's were not that active to attend the table. We ordered chicken tangree kebab, rumali roti, tandoori roti, butter chicken, and lassi. Tangree kebab was not that juicy. But, the butter chicken was a hit , its creamy gravy with soft pieces of chicken was perfect. The bread was also soft and buttery. At last the lassi was perfect and is highly recommend. A good place to visit with friends.

4 of us decided to dine at Jai Hind Dhaba after the Manchester United vs Southampton game which the Reds lost. Most of us were disappointed with the loss as it is and the experience at Jai Hind did not help us much.

The place is a dhaba and staying true to its name is a noisy, old, congested and busy place. At 11pm the tables were almost full with many standing outside smoking and eating kulfis. The crowd was mixed with mostly students and few families.

The food was nothing great to write about. Each of us ordered 2 breads and a side dish. This includes Dal Tadka, Egg Tadka and Chicken TIkka Masala. All of them were mediocre. The price wasn't! Rs. 198+Taxes for that Chicken Tikka Masala is insane! What were you smoking brother while fixing the price of your menu? The bill came to about Rs. 700 per person which in no means worth the food we ate. We felt ripped in the end.

The service was like any dhaba, quick and non-interactive. But no issues there. 

Credit goes to them for staying open at such late hours but the food was mediocre and for such a high price. The place is a 'must visit' in Kolkata according to my friend, Sachin Bagri (one of the four who is also a Calcuttan). This is the 3rd time we guys have become a victim of his judgement w.r.t to doing things in Kolkata. You owe us a lot Bagri!

One of my favourite resto/dhabas since school days. Ever since i shifted base to Mumbai, I Always eat here atleast once whenever I visit kolkata. Good ambience, great food and value for money. If you are bored of punjabi food, their chinese is surprisingly good. Schezwan rice is recommended if you love super spicy stuff.  Every Indian dish is recommended.
If you dont find a seat inside, you can just help yourself outside. They have wooden benches to sit or they serve you at your car.
Do finish off with their Sitaphal kulfi with falooda.
Happy hogging!!! :)

Hello Everyone,

I visited this restaurant few days back with my family. This was my first visit to this restaurant and I hoped for a superb satisfying meal initially. We took 2 plates of Vegetable Fried Rice, 2 pieces of Laccha Paratha, Paneer Dopiaza, Vegetable Shahi Korma for 4 of us. The service wasn't that bad and we got our recipes within double quick time. As per the fried rice was concerned, it was pretty much satisfactory, although the quantity was good. Unlike some other restaurants like Sher-E-Bengal, where a plate of fried rice can easily feed 2 people, the quantity in this restaurant was pretty much on the satisfactory side. Although the gravy delicacies were good, but not something exceptional or out of the box type. Although I didnt have Laccha Paratha, as per my parents, they were just good. I would suggest the restaurant authority to reconsider the quantity of fried rice they provide at that rate. Otherwise, this is a good family restaurant for sure.

Jai Hind Dhaba was on my list because of a number of recommendations by friends and family. To avoid weekend rush, I decided to go there on a Monday for dinner. We were a group of seven people and were keen on having a wholesome north Indian meal. We ordered paneer butter masala, Dal makhani, malai kofta and tandoori roti. Dal makhani was not at all up to the mark and it seemed that it was just the liquidish version of tarka fry. Paneer butter masala and malai kofta were great though. As far as tandoori roti was concerned they were good, but I've had better ones in Kolkata itself! 
The service was very slow. As this is a dhaba I expect the service, especially when it comes to roti, to be really quick. Rather, it was pretty slow as I had to wait for almost 5 minutes for the second batch of rotis to arrive! 
They also didn't have fresh lime soda! 
Overall experience was okay! 
I'll prefer this place only if I'm out of options and too hungry to travel far! 
Food - 3.5/5
Service - 2.0/5
Ambience - 3.5/5
Cost - 4.0/5

Probably the most loved Dhaba in Kolkata,Jai Hind Dhaba offers an ocean of North Indian dishes but everytime I visit this particular joint,for reasons unknown,I always stick to the same set of items,their speciality i.e. dal tarka and roomali roti,and I need not write about it because I believe half the city has tasted the above dishes and I am at a loss of adjectives to describe the mouthwatering cuisine.Although I'd like to speak about the kashmiri aloo dum which I reckon was flavoured with maggi masala magic which itself questions the cook's ability to deliver something exclusive.I simply love Jai Hind's Crispy Chili Babycorn and embrace the fact that it comes in abundant quantity.Jai hind might not be the best when it comes to presentation and can be criticised for using the same gravy for almost all the veggies.
Above everything,jai hind is pocket friendly and the food is reasonably priced and comes in fair quantity.
Conclusion-Jai hind offers the best punjabi food at optimum cost,located in the prime area,supported by quick service by the staff and ample amount of seating space considering the extra storey added.

Visited Jai Hind yesterday with friends..A very neat and clean dhaba,seating is comfortable.
Coming straight to the food,we had paneer tikka and aloo tandoori in the starters.Both were well done.The paneer was decent but the aloo had not caught the flavours properly.So it was bit of a let down.
In the main course,we had daal tadka and paneer butter masala.
1) The Dal Tadka is a spicier and slightly thicker version of the Dal Makhani.I liked it.

2) The Paneer Butter Masala tasted good but the masala could have been richer and thicker as a "butter masala" is supposed to be.
The service and quantity was average.Although food is pretty cheap,I'd give them 3/5 .

Very aptly situated restaurant as it's close to some major night clubs and hookah parlours...so after a rocking party you can straight away head to JHD for a great dine in.
"The speciality of JHD is that it's open 24 hrs"

You can come in here with family or frnz...basically suits every generation of the crowd. You can even park your car out and order directly from there to have your food brought to you.
The service is good. And guess what it's all within budget. So worry about any load on your pocket and just enjoy the treat.

We have been to this place quite an infinite number of time right since my college days... The food, veg or non-veg, tastes so homely. You will end up licking your fingers. We went again today for lunch and sat at the AC part, yes, it has 1 normal and 2 AC division. We ordered Tarka Fry, Chicken Butter Masala, Egg Bhurji, Salad and Breads. All of them were delicious. Ended with Lassi. The rating is purely on food quality only. The service staff are pretty normal and do not expect fine dining experience, you will even have to ask for salt!!! Still, you will love going back if you love your food.

As much as you want to avoid Jai Hind, you cannot ignore it.
Extremely sought after post late night partying/drinking sessions or the mornings after to cure a hangover.
The food is just barely above average, but good to soak up all the alcohol in the body with its high masala and oil content.
The usual orders include Chicken Bharta (which has more masala than chicken and one ends up hunting for the minced chicken pieces but tastes quite good), chicken tandoori (which is well cooked and tender at the same time), double mirch daal tadka (my personal favorite, if you like spicy-chilly things, it is a black daal with an extra tadka of chillies) and accompanied with rumali rotis and lachha pyaaz.
The delivery service is quite slow but they make up for it when you dine in.
Dhaba food at not quite the dhaba price!

This is one of my favourite dhabas.

Food: Quantity is more than sufficient and quality is just awesome. Jai Hind Dhaba has never served me mediocre food. Their food always leaves me licking my fingers. Their paneer tikka butter masala, butter chicken, paneer do-piaza, rumali rotis and kulchas are awesome to taste. I rate it 4.5/5.

Ambience: They serve food on several floors of the building and the quality of the decor increases with each floor and so does the price. They have comfy red sofas and a basic table with a traditional lamp hanging above it. All the floors have a glass wall overlooking the main road. As far as I remember they have no music. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: They are pretty fast. The staffs is well-behaved and attentive. They remain open till very late hours. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Slightly higher than some more economical dhabas but keeping in mind the better ambience and better quality of food, I think they deserve the money.

Overall I rate it 4/5.

I love the North Indian out here. I go there at least once a week! You have to try out the Aloo Do Pyaza, Paneer Butter Masala, Double Mirchi Tadka. 
There are a variety of breads but the ones I always have is Butter Roomali and Garlic Naan. This is the best and the cheapest north Indian outlet I have ever come across. You should definitely go there if you haven't been there before! Its a must go place in town !

Well well..  I had just a few of their dishes.. So maybe it's kind of unfair to judge them based on that..  But then, one chance is all that you get to impress, or in this case to do the opposite. 

We ordered chicken korma, paneer butter masala, butter naan and tandoori roti. The breads were freshly baked, but the curries were horrible to be very polite. And you know what, the two dishes tasted nearly the same.. Can't rate a place high just because the quantity is good and the pocket pinch is minimal. 
Also, seeing the rampant use of child labour is a BIIIG turn off. So, definitely not recommended.

Jai hind dhaba was one the most popular dhaba for late night party people like us .When ever we used to feel hungry we know which were the places we could visit.Ambience is very much dhaba type.they serve good tandoori or kabab items apart from regular and popular Punjabi dishes.The best thing is the TAT ...located @ prime location near to park street .Price wise reasonable.... so if you @ Calcutta and partying @ Soho .or near to bhawanipore for your office work pls visit.

Located on Sarat Bose Road  near Paddapukur, this dhaba is a superb place for North Indian and Punjabi food . The food is fresh and chatpata , just the way U want in a Dhaba . The CHICKEN TANDOORI is magic and just melts in your mouth . The CHICKEN BHARTA tastes excellent with BUTTER NAAN.  The naan is a bit rubbery though. The joint is open till late night and is the perfect place to hit when U have late light hunger pangs.  The ambience is good , but the waiters need to behave themselves . Good food , good value for money .

Once i went around 11:30 pm with my cousins and had a blast!!
There were people still having their food and so it didn't made us feel that we were there at the odd time..
They didn't compromise with the food at that time also..
We had veg. north indian food and it was lipsmaking...

It was below average with barely any chicken and huge quantities of gravy.. It's a really pocket friendly place and the food is also good over all...

Some places never get old. For someone based out of cal such as myself the shock was that this place has become way bigger with three floors now contrary to just the ground floor a couple of years ago. The ambience is still the same though. Highlight here is definitely the chicken do pyaza. In case you thought what roomali roti meant you should re check over here as it is definitely the usp. Overall a good eating experience. The only drawback being the service. Waiters tend to be slow but once the order is taken. It doesn't take long to deliver.  Happy eating.

The tandoori food here is delicious but bad ambiance, plastic plates, water in plastic jugs & weak decor are the spoilers. Dal Makhani & Paneer Do-Pyaza are good among the veg dishes. All other dishes have the exact same gravy which is extremely disappointing! Must try: dal makhani with butter naan, tandoori chicken & paneer/chicken chilly dry.

Update 18.03.17: The quality & taste of food has gone down severely. That special 'jai hind taste' seems gone.

My first visit to this joint.I opted for take-away.My verdict - a mixed bag with lots of optimism on my forthcoming visits when i intend to polish off other items from the menu.
I had ordered the egg tadka, their specialty aloo dopiaza and the evergreen Punjabi/dhaba favourite chicken butter masala,roomali roti and the tawa(phulka) roti. The tadka as expected was outstanding.Well most dhabas in Kolkata get it right and Jai Hind was no exception. The aloo dopiaza was also well made and quite tasty.Frankly i did not have much expectations from a humble potato sabzi given that am a hard-core meat eating bong.But i was pleasantly surprised.No wonder my fellow foodies have gone ga-ga over this dish.The mood spoiler quite surprisingly  was the chicken butter masala. The gravy was spicy,salty and quite tasteless. The dish comprised six pieces of boneless chicken that were soft,juicy and succulent. But everything else about the dish had gone wrong.
The rotis were soft and flaky. The size of the helpings was adequate.Prices as always in a dhaba were very pocket friendly.Service was polite,prompt and helpful.
Looking forward to trying the tandoori and mutton dishes on offer in my next visit.Hopefully my ratings on this joint would improve by then.

We were just in time for a casual lunch, probably a bit sooner, had a decent experience  with the service, food and the ambiance. Just to mention you wouldn't care for the ambiance for the place this is. This place is basically a dhaba style restaurant. We ordered the Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Butter Masala along with Roomali Rotis. The tandoori was charred to the right degree and tasted hearty with the accompanied condiments especially the mint chutney. The chicken butter masala was a bit sweeter for me, nonetheless it was devouring and tasted good with the rotis. The service was decent, neither too slow nor fast, or should I say a good time waiting for, if you are in for a yummy and a quick meal.

The mistake would be to order Chinese from this place. They do a good of that too, but you cannot judge the place by their Chinese food, which is nothing extraordinary.
If you do not do that, and stick to tandoori, this is place is off the charts. They do a terrific tandoori chicken and butter chicken. And the kebabs are amazing too. The nans are good too. I personally love the mutton do pyaza and chicken reshmi kebab. Service is prompt. And dine in is comfortable. What I like most about this place is that they do home deliveries even late into the night. Which is a huge advantage.

their chicken butter masala had a steep fall in its quality,and chicken bharta was stickly ok,egg tarka was good and roties were served cold and after constant reminders we were served lukewarm rotis..

the greatest issue was the long serving time of about 20 minutes despite the fact that some other groups who ordered later were served earlier.

i beleive their home delivery is much better option.

So, I went here on my birthday. And yes I was satisfied with the restaurant. But not totally. First of all the food was awesome and the place was very good. The ambience was way too good but thumbs down for the staffs as they are mannerless. Doesn't know what to say and what not say. 

The waiters spoiled our mood totally so not writing too much. But the food, you must go and have chicken do piazza. Its awesome.

Come here only if you're a group or family! We tried to get a late night dinner here the other day but being a two-some that meant first being asked to run between the different floors of the building. Secondly, once we had actually been given a spot (at an admittedly large table) a new group of people happily plonked down next to us and started chatting loudly. When we tried to order we asked the waiter for a smaller table - he said there was one and led us away, allowing the group to completely occupy the table we had, however the table he referred to was already occupied and he asked us to sit on the side on two plastic chairs waiting for them to finish. Clearly he wanted to seat the large group and get us out of the place.

Went there with a group of friends and ordered Chicken Bharta , Egg Tarka , Chicken Butter masala , tandoori roti and Rumali . Can say that the chicken bharta with the Chaat Masala combo is amazing . But sadly,Chicken butter masala is a huge disappointment . But all in all , this place is reasonably priced with quality food .

Good food especially for me because I love spicy food and it just provides that kind of food
It comes handy at late night
I just love the food @ Jai Hind
There is only one problem when there is rush they do not make proper food like sometimes food is less spicy or it is very oily.

I have never dined in here.. it is always a take away for me when i used to return from Forum after a movie towards home.. the place serves really good food and is very pocket friendly.. this is one of the late night eat outs that Kolkata have.. and the food is just Heavenly..  the ambience is nothing fancy though and you can ignore the chinese menu totally as the north indian fare here is to die for.. Try the dal tarka in any form-- veg, chicken, mutton or keema.. it is the best dish they have.. Among others the chicken bharta and paneer butter masala are good too.. The rotis are soft and goes very well with the gravies.. Just visit this place for the divine food.

One of my favourite go to places in Kolkata.  You know sometimes how you really want to have good food and you do not give a shit about the company you have and the ambience of the place.  All you want is good food! Jai hind is one of the few places you'd want to go. Reasonable prices,  chicken bharta and butter rumaalis to die for,  jai Hind is the best place to overeat!

I have ordered a 1000 times. I ordered today again. They took the order wrong, delivered wrong. Then when we asked them to redeliver and do it fast since we have half the food, they said they cannot deliver soon. Now what will i do with half the food so we asked them to take it back. They told if you give back we will never take your order ever again. Very rude for no fault of ours. Ofcourse you cannot expect courtesy but today's incident is unacceptable. I have been a fan but they should understand with 10 new restaurants popping up everyday their attitude need to change. Disappointed.

I wish i could rate this more than five. Its a life saver. No matter what time it is, jai hind is there for us always. No matter in which part of the city we party, we always come here for the after-party. I think its the cheapest quality-dhaba in calcutta. And the food? Lip smacking. The chicken bharta is the best i have tasted. The kebabs are nothing less. The paneer, soft and tasty. Even the simple tadka is finger licking awesome. I have visited it numerous times. Be if christmas or new year or birthdays or boring afternoons or after any other party or simply just like that. I even like the papads here. They also serve us food in our cars. During christmas or new year, the entire sarat bose road maybe will fall short to accomodate the number of cars. The staff is quick. In the daytime, they get a bit slow. But come night, they gain their vigour. Every time i visited during night or mid-night or 3am, it was jam packed. Had to always wait few minutes before getting a table. In short totally worth a visit. Highly recommended. Cheerie!

Forget about the ambience and location. Or in fact go to this place for the the ambience. A no nonsense dhaba in the middle of the city. But that is a secondary factor. Go to this place for one thing and that is the food. The tandoori chicken is the best that I have remember having tasted. Beautifully marinated and tender. A touch spicy. I cannot stop eating it till I have chewed and extracted all the flavor off the bones. Okay, that was probably a bit gross to visualize, but you get the picture. Whenever i go, I  just order the tandoori chicken, dal tadka and tandoori roti. The dal tadka is as good as you will get in any restaurant or dhaba anywhere in India. But the tandoori roti will blow your mind. Soft with the right amount of charred crispiness. It melts in your mouth. And the best part is that it is served as soon as your order. The advantage of going to a place like this is that they keep making rotis non-stop as guests are constantly ordering. So you order and they serve within a minute. Hot rotis, creamy dal tadkas and the heavenly tandoori chicken. I am drooling as I type this and dreaming about my next calcutta trip. And one more thing.. . the price. The food is so cheap that it is ridiculous. Obviously the good food and such great prices is what keeps the crowd coming back again and again. The place is open till late in the night 365 days a year. In fact during festivals like druga puja it is open 24 hours. For any genuine food lover, this is a must visit when in kolkata. If you know a place that has a better tandoori chicken, I would really like to know.

Good place to go on a Sunday. Neat and clean and plenty of parking around. We sat down on their 2nd floor and from there the view was good. Food in jai hind Dhaba is good but it's not something you crave for. We ordered for dal makhani, aloo do plaza, paneer and chole. All sabzis were but again what can you expect on a Sunday. Rotis were ok. Initially they served dhila dhala rotis but on request they changed the rotis and were awesome. A good place to go on Sundays

OMG how did i miss reviewing Jai Hind Dhaba!!! This is another place which i am frequenting since my teens. Jai Hind is another saviour for the party people in Kolkata and for people who are nocturnal beings. The place has a drive in ambiance where you can just park your car and a waiter comes takes your order and serves your meal. The other option is you go inside the restaurant which has two floors and sit. I personally prefer sitting upstairs as its more cozy out there. They sell all kinds of food starting from typical dhaba food like tandoori kababs, chicken bharta, mutton curry, roti, naan ( i like the garlic naan here), etc. The pricing is reasonable and the service prompt. You are bound to meet some known faces on each visit for sure.

Midnight hunger pangs .. Think no further. Jai Hind serves one of the best Punjabi food in the city and does it late into the night. On weekends i have seen the place open for as long as 3 am. The food iv had here has mostly been either take away or in the car. But for the few times i did visit the restaurant i found the ambiance was decent for a dhaba. The food is  really appetizing with Chicken Bharta being my all time favorite. Also the dal tadka double mirchi (extra spicy) is delicious. The tandoori items are also exquisite. The service is prompt and effective. Thumbs up to this place. Recommended to all !!

This place comes to our minds whenever we are out for partying and it serves us food even at 4.00 am in the morning.
Jai hind has been now a perfect place for all the party people after they are over with partying and want to fill their stomachs.
The food served is also dhaba style and good in taste.
Time taken by them to bring your order is also not much long even at the time of rush.
Many times it happens that the taste is not good or not upto the mark, they are very courteous to change it without any further discussions and arguments.
Our anytime order is the same.. Dal tarka, aloo do pyaza, chicken tikka butter masala & rommalis and kulchas..
everything is very lip smacking. The fried onions they give on the top of the aloo do pyaza is superb, on my last visit we aksed more of it and without any question the staff brought us a small bowl of it. 
 The casual environment gives you comfort and no formality zone.
i even have tried chinese there and it also left me with a content stomach.

Just one thing guys try and keep some more hygiene and please stock soft drinks in the chiller. Till now I have not got a chilled bottle of pepsi or 7 up.
Otherwise everything is good and thank you for serving people like us till so late with a smiling face always.
JAI HIND! Recommended by me :)

People around me are often irritated whenever the topic of food comes up because I believe, I am the biggest fan of Jai Hind Dhaba and this is my only answer to questions like "Where do we go for a meal?"
I don't even know the number of times I have visited this place and the number of times I have left it after feeling heavenly. Honestly, it's not as cheap as it used to be but every penny spent here is worth it. 
The best dishes here are paneer butter masala, aaloo do pyaza and butter rumali! There have been times when I ate 7-8 of the better rumalis. Not that I was not full, just that I was not done. 
I am a vegetarian but going by the looks on my friends' faces, I am sure the butter chicken and the chicken bharta are worth trying!

Well when it comes to this dhaba , i have only one thing to say that the only PURE DHABA food . There is not at all parking problem . Location is perfect . The service is also very nice and it is clean compared to other dhaba. The food here is super yummy . The aloo do pyaz here is with something different taste . Of you go for dal makhani then you will feel the real taste of the dal makhani . The chana masala is also awesome . The service is no  doubt fast no matter how much is the crowd they know how to manage . The price is very economical and you will surely enjoy the food . There is home delivery option . If you order good of good amount they can deliver you anywhere . The plus point of this place is it's opened till late night . This is total satisfaction guaranteed place .

Been there innumerable times mostly at the late night hours like 1 to 2 am with friends & never ever been disappointed with their foods and services . Those delicious soft tandoori rotis (my personal favourite ), makai ki roti ( though seasonal ) , roomali roti along with  buttery delicious mouth watering chicken bharta , butter masala , chicken tikkai butter masala & mutton kosha gives the feel of oven from the heaven's kitchen . Foods are always served fresh & hot , even salads are also prepared very fresh . They never compromise their food taste and service . May be dats the reason why it is so popular over the years . Its a definitive destination for your late night supper . U will never be disappointed with them . 
Costs around 500 for two

Late into the night, Dinner time, Lunch time..This place is an absolute delight for punjabi food lovers. The dal makhni is like no other place in kolkata. The rotis, naans, kababs are a beautiful blend. You simply fall in love with the aloo do pyazza. Peas pulao with dal makhni is a deadly combination in my opinion.  However, ordering food at home late into the night sometimes gets not so fresh food. Sometimes you have to fight with the rumali roti to eat it. Thus, maintaining consistency of its food irrespective of the time ordered would take Jain Hind dhaba to places

The place is a must visit for those having a taste of North Indian food. The Panner Butter Masala, Dal Makhani, Chicken Do Pyaza are simply out of the world. Not to forget the Raumali roti and Garlic Naan! Consider yourself lucky if you get to sit in peak hours during weekends. The bill goes light on the pocket and the place is sure to score ones heart! The only con of the place was inability to accept card payments.

I went to the place for the first time at around 2am with my friends. Please don't expect a great ambience there. The food there is nice. Go for the typical punjabi cuisine of roti and chicken bharta which they specialize in. The chicken tanduri is also good. If you are hungry at a time when all the restaurants are closed crash in to this place and you will not be dissapointed.

Was driving around 9pm, on sarat bose road and stopped by jai hind dhaba for a quick meal. As usual, the place was packed & after a wait of 15 mins, we finally were seated on the 2nd floor.

Orders were placed:

Egg bhurji
paneer tikka butter masala
chicken korma
green salad
tandoor rotis 
& the areated bevys

I don't know what went wrong, but the paneer and the chicken both were tasteless and greasy. I know dhaba food is always greasy. But it's usually greasy & yummy. We ended up filling ourselves with the egg bhurji and salad. 

Perhaps, works better post partying and liquor. Didn't work for me.

One of the biggest advantages of this place is that it does home delivery till late at night.It was the saviour to our late night hunger pains during the recently concluded football world cup.

This is one of the more tasty yet reasonably priced places located at Sarat Bose road.Although I have had home delivery from here most times,I have been there once or twice myself.The place is crowded and the ambience is not the best.There are both ac and non ac sections.Hygiene and cleanliness can be an issue at times.

Coming to the food,there are Indian and Chinese cuisine available.I have never tried their Chinese and so will not be able to comment.The Indian is typical Dhaba fare.The food is tasty on the whole.The dal tarka fry,chicken tandoori butter masala are worth recommending.One thing is that the food can be a little inconsistent at times.Recently I had ordered Chicken tandoori and Chicken tangri kebab.They were okayish and nothing spectacular.The Chicken Tangri kebab was in fact rather disappointing.It was a bit chewy and dry on the inside.The size of the chicken pieces were also on the smaller side.

The prices are pretty reasonable.The service is more or less swift.Overall a decent option for a nice tasty pocket friendly meal.

Jai Hind Restaurant, Sarat Bose Road, Kolkata

Changes in Kolkata has got me unnerved a bit and I am not a biased person as such but hate my favourite food joints and their dishes tweaked weak and deter rioting. Everything has lost its charm, the dhaba’s more bong than authentic Punjabi dhaba charm loosing its USP to posh airconditioning. Original cooks having migrated leaving 5th generation of outsiders as the only corden bleu in the city has made me wonder if it is finally Kolkata and no more Calcutta.   One of the lazy tired evenings that we reserved only for rest. For dinner I voted for Jai Hind Dhaba on Sarat Bose road near Padopukur. Why because the nostalgic taste buds of dhaba food from Kolkata was still sharp in my memory.

We ordered Dal Tarka at Rs75/- per plate, my all time favourite dhaba dish - One Chicken Do Piaza at Rs.135/- per plate, one chicken Reshmi kebab at Rs.140/- per plate of 6 pieces and one Chicken tikka at Rs.140 /- per plate for the same numbers. Also a Egg chicken Roll to sample the famous chicken rools of Kolkata.

The chicken was gooey with more crème than Piaz ( onions) and a bit sweet devoid of chilli spice, The dal looked creepy but was well done , smooth and tasty. The presentation, even from a dhaba pedigree seemed lousy. The Reshmi kebabs were everything but reshmi and the tikka’s were just OK! Chciken roll was good, atleast better than what we get in Mumbai.

Nothing to write home about but sulk about the lost Purono Calcutta and crib that I did not get my quota of good Punjabi food. 

Ambience – Home delivery!!Looks like a decent restaurant from outside. Did not venture inside. 

Menu – 6/10 Seems sketchy and old 

Taste – 3/10 Not impressed and not happy!!! 

Customer Service – 6/10 delivery in 20 mins is Good   

Value for Money – 6/10 Cheap does not mean value for money

Recommend – Lost glory! The Punjabi soul mushy with Bong emotional living! Avoidable!!!

This place is right around the corner where I live, it remains open all night, they deliver and I Love North Indian food. All the reasons why i absolutely love this place. The food is amazing and you cannot stop licking your fingers once you start eating. There is double mirch tadka which is insane. North indian  food has many varieties and dishes but if the Roti, Dal Makhani and Paneer is not good, it's a waste. That's the first thing I always order. This place will not disappoint you. And the fact that you can satiate your hunger in the middle of the night and also have the food delivered wherever you are is awesome. You could also eat in your car if that's your thing. The place gets insanely crowded in the weekends even after having 3 floors.

So I've lost count of how many years I've been coming here. Still the best dhaba food in the city especially after a hard nights party or for comfort food after a long day. The staples for me to select from include Egg Tadka, Keema Mutter, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Reshmi Masala, Chicken tikka and cheicken Reshmi kebab. For the vegetarians, theres always the same with paneer and then theres the double mirchi tadka daal if you want to a reminder of what you had, the next morning ;P
Rotis are great all around but I prefer to have plain instead of butter as it really brings out the taste of the daals etc. 
In case you are looking for a snack the rumali rolls are great too and the best part is you can always build your own combo. My personal recommendation is the chicken tikka egg bhurji mix rumali roll.
Now even though the best experience of dhaba food may be in the car I prefer a little space when I eat so I prefer the seating. Dont be fooled by the appearance of the place though. Its small noisy and dimly lit but you get all kinds in there. Families, youngsters, couples etc etc.
I am not going to try and rate any criteria since things like ambiance, decor, staff etc are really pointless to write about when you're paying 500 for 2 and left licking your fingers.

Although, I must say it still has some way to go before it matches Shere Punjab at Kolaghat. The quality there is stellar. It often tastes like its fresh off the farm. Not to be confused with Azad Hind on Bombay Rd. which is, for the lack of a better word, shit.

I have heard several times from my friends about this restaurant. At last i went there today with my gf. They have separate place for AC and non-ac and  the AC part is divided into ground floor and 1st floor. We took the ground  floor. The environment was nice and service was good. We have ordered Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, masala kulcha, butter nan and butter tandori roti. The food was very tasty. Price was also reasonable.  Next time i want to taste other dishes.

Where does one start, and where does one end when reviewing such a place? People might not know where Lansdowne is,  but everyone sure knows where 'Jai hind' is. I wouldn't give a very detailed idea about the ambience,  the cuisine,  etc because frankly there isn't much. But before you judge further,  hear this. One of the finest North Indian delicacies you could ever find is served here.  Be it the Chicken bharta,  the Chicken Tikka masala,  the dal makhani, and the steaming hot rotis to go along. A place which serves almost any time you go (I was actually gorging on all of the above at 4:30 am on the World Cup final night!!). 

Enough said,  even the staff is courteous, and the place will definitely leave you in awe of its simplicity,  yet incredibly tasty food. So typically Punjabi,  like everything else.

I wouldn't discourage anyone to not try the Chinese dishes, but since it is a dhaba, I have to say, their North Indian dishes are really good. The chicken and paneer dishes, and their tandooris and kebabs are fantastic!!!

Ambience - Never been here cause the delivery is brilliant.

Service - As said before the delivery is brilliant. They bring food quite fast and the best part is you can order your fav. Indian or Chinese meal after midnight (though we never did) and the food remains hot and fresh.

Food - This is the best part. The food is great! You'll get more than what you had expected from the price of the dishes. Both the quality and quantity are great and it keeps you asking for more!

i haven't tried chinese at jaihind so won't comment , but indian food specially punjabi evergreen specialities are a hit with both locals & expats alike . the ambiance  is nothing worthy to write home about , but the location is brilliant  & specially the views from the   A/C 1st & 2nd floors cannot be overlooked  . we usually go there with family   as it fits our budget  . on our last visit we had 1 full plate tandori chicken ( rs 250 ) , 1  full plate chicken do piaza ( rs150 ), 1 plate keema mutter  ( rs 160 )   & 1 plate mutton korma  ( rs 145 )  along with 14 tava rotis ( rs 126 ) & 3 butter naans  ( rs 105 )   & the bill came at a moderate rs 1158 ( including 14.5 % VAT  & 5% service tax ) . coming to taste keema mutter & tandori chicken was cooked flawlessly , chicken do piaza was ok -ish but the let down was the mutton korma for me which was a bit   oily & the gravy had a peculiar taste . over all a  above average dining experience accompanied by some stunning views of sarat bose road  . will come back again   very soon !!!!

Had been to this place on last Saturday with parents.. We were sitting on the 1st floor.. The window view was nice.. Ordered rumali roti, daal tarka, chicken bharta, chicken reshmi butter masala, lassi.. Serving was quick.. Believe me or not each and every dish was mouth watering starting from the soft rumali roti which you can tear so easily without any effort, delicious tarka, creamy bharta, awesome chicken reshmi butter masala to super hit lassis.. Complete 'paisa vasool' food.. According to me it should be placed among Kolkata's top 5 dhabas.. I would like to visit this place again..

I remembering visiting this Dhaba first time in early 2002 as a college goer having limited resources to spend. To be honest, got hooked that day itself having Dal Makhani, Tandoori Roti & Chicken Do Piaza Boneless (I still remember!) and complimentary onion salad. It was a non AC dhaba then, but over the years made an AC section beside and then added the AC floors above and now also offering Chinese cuisine.
I have eaten here at almost all time, afternoon, evening, night, very late night...the service remains very prompt, the quality remains the same. Though I am a complete veggie now, but will add my favourite dishes offered here:
- Tandoori Aloo and Paneer Tikka (Typically Dhaba style with charcoal aroma) 
- Dal Makhani (You definitely cannot miss it)
- Aloo Do Piaza (The best in town, especially with those golden brown onions on top)
- Paneer Butter Masala or PBM (Consistent in taste all these years with good quality Paneer)
- Malaai Kofta (The gravy tastes good)
- Chicken Do Piaza Boneless (Superb! Same taste over the years, non veggies should try)
- Chicken Bharta (Very few eateries can make this perfect...smooth)
- Roomali & Tandoori Butter Roti (Both excellently made)
Cost for two people: 500-700 (Excl VAT)
P.S. Their home delivery is also good and the food remains hot. One advice - don't order naan or kulcha for home delivery as it will become almost rubber-like after sometime.

The location, the crowd even at 1 am in the night is amazing.

All are amazing.

After reading so many rave reviews about this place, I finally had a chance to have a hearty lunch there. This Restaurant has a typical dhaba feeling that one can not miss. Simplicity is the brand here and they flaunt it with their decor and seating arrangement.
Coming to the food, we had  chicken tandoori as starters, Tandoori Roti and Chicken Bharta as main course.
Food was tasty, served hot and definitely delectable. But we really did not find anything special to go gaga about their food. The chicken of the tandoori was not properly cleaned, The roti was not that much crispy and seriously I have had much better chicken bharta elsewhere. So overall, I will say my experience of this place was moderate, not so good, not so bad, nothing special really.
P.S - Our short stay at the restaurant was marred by a group of women who were howling and shouting like anything and even mocked us when we requested them to tone down a bit.

Jai hind dhaba...! We didn't had much there coz we already had sumptuous food before visiting there. But the chicken roll is amaziinng. Not like typical oil filled Kaathi Rolls. No oil at all...! Rumali roti stuffed I mean literally stuffed with chicken tikka. I had 3 of them though was pretty full. Such is the quality. Once you relish your taste buds here trust me you wouldn't wanna go anywhere else.

Visited this place yesterday around 1:00 pm for lunch, first of all they disappointed me saying that they haven't started it yet and it will take around half an hour to serve! I had a movie at 1:35 and had almost no time.
They should start a little early as 1:00 pm is a decent time for lunch.
However we ordered food and asked them to serve as soon as possible.
We ordered Chicken Kadai, Sahi Paneer and lassi. Chicken was good and Paneer was decent too.
Lassi was better than the food though. 
No decors, confused service!
Yet the food was good, would have rated 4.0 if I wouldn't have missed my movie by 5 minutes :P

Location: Sarat Bose Road, right next to Pan Asia Continental.

This place has been here for ages now, but, never had I given it a try (this was so a year an a half back).
But, surprisingly since the very day I have given it a try, it has been on my favourites and is one place I look forward to every now and then.
It's divided into different sections in the aspect of air conditioning (with or without) followed by different price ranges for each of the section.
This place has recently expanded to be a two-level dining place.

Always ready to dig into the delicious food out here. It is a place to crave for its lip smackin' food.
The service has without fail always been excellent: within minutes the complete order is on the table; after all that's how a dhaba should be!

My order always has either Rumali Rotis or Tandoori Butter rotis as the choice of bread but, have tried the other breads too and also call for them occasionally. This is the place where the Rumalis never give a rubber-type feeling and feel like "cotton balls" (as stated by one of my friends).
The Tandoori Roti is always made according to your choice, of it being crisp or soft. 
The Garlic Naans are crisply baked with the right amount of garlic. The Masala Kulchas are just about okayish.

Although have tried a number of mains along, but Special Butter Tarka and Aloo Do Pyaza have always been on my favorites to have along the assortment of breads; trust me, they are delicious (though towards the stodgy end). The salads do shuffle between Masala Onion and the usual Onion Salad.

It is a great thumbs up for the party goers and late night diners as this place is open till the wee hours and one also has an option to dine in the comforts of their cars. 

One can expect a pocket-friendly shell out of around Rs. 200-250 per person.

Recommended :
• Rumali Rotis/Tandoori Butter Rotis
• Garlic Naan
• Special Butter Tarka 
• Aloo Do Pyaza
• Paneer Tikka Butter Masala
• Vegetable Do Pyaza
• Vegetable Pulao

Have availed its Home delivery Services quite a few times and must say, it's definitely a quick one! :-)

A good place overall. (Y)

The main advantage that the so-called Dhaba has is that it is open all-night..  So the late night-dinner-lovers love this place. Also, the restaurant deliberately maintains a dhaba style. The order-delivery is quite fast.The food is awesome, especially the Mutton Saag and the Chicken Butter Masala. Tandoori roti is not a good option here, but Butter nan is too good. For rice/pulao lovers, you could order peas pulao. Do not have any idea about the paneer dishes, but dal makhani is quite good side dish with the pulao.

Right next to Pan International in the Paddapukur area of South Kolkata, Jai Hind Dhaba will be hard to miss with its mildly towering nature. Bowing before our cravings for meat, when my friend and I reached (on a weekday afternoon), the ground floor was fully occupied. We were directed to the first floor where every table was occupied as well. The service was visibly swift and we had to wait for only about ten minutes before we were shown to our table. 

The insides were coloured in soothing shades of orange sunmica and the food on each table seemed better than the previous. Our order consisted of Chicken Tikka Masala, Laccha Paratha, Plain Naan, Aloo Do Pyaza and eventually a cold drink. Food was delectable in every way and the quantity was adequate. It was perhaps the tastiest chicken we had had in a long time and I could not get enough of the rich gravy. The only suggestion would be that if you're a party of two then the Aloo Do Pyaza may be a dampener after a couple of helpings. The seasoning tends to be bland after you've known the succulent nature of the chicken preparation. It is better suited for a large group of people, each with a small portion of the dish. The accompanying bread was served crispy and hot.

The bill totalled to a touch above Rs. 500 including tax. The servers never hurry you even though there maybe others waiting in line. 

Extremely satisfied and hoping to return very soon :)

The ambiance is good. The taste of food is delicious and guess what they know how to use right amount of spices. Paneer Bharta is also good. Few days after I tried Tandoori Chicken and it was great.

This restaurant makes arguably the best chicken tandoori in town. The texture, marination, tanginess is just about right.
So no matter what you wish to have order a chicken tandoori first.

Coming to the main course,the butter naan is standard. The tikka and reshmj butter masalas are prepared with incredibly soft chicken. So soft the chicken melts in your mouth.

The restaurant is spread across three floors and has a nice ambience. The best part about it is it's timings. If you are hungry at 1 am this is the place where you should be.

Excellent food at best ever price. Super fast service with both options of sit and eat as well car service.
This time we chose car as our dining place. Its a fun experience to handle your own plates as well as keep managing the ordered food trays. It can be a real juggle to manage everything in your car, but its fun with loud car music or gossip with friends. 
A dinner with rainy weather outside amd hot punjabi food inside.
Must try for vegetarians are kali dal, paneer tikka masal and roomali roti.
No other place in cal can serve roomali roti like this. Almost paper hin.

This place is one of the renowned dhabhas of Kolkata.. Its pretty famous among various people .. The ambiance is nothing great but as the name suggest "DHABHA" I do no expect decorative interiors.. They just believe in concentrating about food so lets do that.. All my visits have few dishes in common like : dal tadka, butter chicken boneless, rumali roti , paneer butter masala and fried rice.. The food is quite nice justifying its name and in par with the taste of Dhabha.. They could however consider on improving the interiors to add a spunk to their hangout.. Occasionally their dishes are a bit more on salt so they might check on that. Other than that an awesome place to hangout in with reasonable prices..

this place is the place to be once the "normal" food joints have closed down alltogether...

have ordered from this place latest at 3AM on a saturday and the guy was at my house to deliver in like 30 mins with hot piping and fresh food...

have visited this places after hitting the pubs or clubs or on random late night drives....

the first thing that comes to your mind when you visit here is that this place is a well oiled machines... from parking to ordering to seating to the kitchen... everything runs smoothly and you will be in awe of the speed at which these guys can deliver....

now coming to the point... Jai Hind has expanded and now has 4 places in which you can sit and the price keeps changing in 3 of them...

the cheapest of the lot is the non AC version on the ground floor... second to that is the AC version on the ground floor... after which the first and second floor in the same more expensive price....

now as you go higher in the building from left to right the cleanliness keeps going up to the top floor which is most clean of the lot...

my suggestion is that you should eat in the AC ground floor unit cause the kitchen is right behind you and the food come instantly and piping hot...

things to try... the chicken bharta, the panner tikka butter masala, the DAL TADKA (to die for), and the kebabs... these are my patent order in this place and till date they have never let me down...

all in all this is my "go to" place when i need soul warming heavy food at weird hours or at a cheap price....

Whenever i go to jai hind dhaba,my must have dish is the tarka fry.I love it.There are actually three places to sit and eat here.One non ac section,second the ac section and the third on the top floor of the ac outlet,all at the same place.The place is small but the food is good.The chicken tandoori s are worth the price.The chicken kadai is also very very good.The food is fresh.You can't complain about ambiance in places like this..Overall 4 stars and a recommend to all.

I don't know why people are liking this restaurant. I went there yesterday with four friends and what i found was a over-hyped below standard food. We ordered tandoori chicken, daal tadka, mushrooms, paneer and chilly baby corn. Chilly baby corn's name should be named sour babycorn as it was hella sour. Roasted chicken was good. ( i have had better tandoori chicken in SAIMA ) , then the paneer was lacking the much expected punch, daal makhani was good and the naan and masala kulcha was horrible.. All together the experience was below par.. I don't understand why it is so famous.. The only good thing is that it is open till late night for party people..

'Chicken Bharta' a must try at this place. As the name itself suggests its a dhaba you obviously won't expect much of an ambience here but once your start digging on the food you will know what pure Indian food taste like. Quality of food is beyond excellence. Only if they could expand their restaurant and improve their parking facility then that would be great.

Easily my favorite dhaba in Kolkata. Easy on the pocket. High on taste.
Situated on a busy street. There are 2 parts to this dhaba. One without the air-conditioning and the other a little more sophisticated with air conditioning. I'm not too sure about the pricing difference, so I can't comment on that.
Chicken tikka butter masala, laccha pyaaz and dal makhni. My mouth starts watering hearing these names itself ! Food is what makes this place so famous. It stays open till very late past midnight, so that's a plus for the party people.
Service is quick. There are choices but I end up not experimenting at all and ordering all the favs I mentioned above.
Its a great place for a foodie, who doesn't mind the ambience and is concerned only about the food.

It's a no-nonsense only for lip-smacking food place. Save yourself from the trouble of looking through the menu card, Chicken-do-piyaza and Rumali roti(without butter) are good enough to make you fall in love with this not so sophisticated a place. An afternoon lunch here is always satisfying.

If  one wants to have a taste of a typical punjabee food preperation he should head here.In Rome do as the Romans do so when in jai hind do as punjabis do.the food is delicious with lots of butter,you get that buttery taste in most of its dishes.if you are a diet guy this place is a sure no-no for u.But if you want to eat like the punjabi with no tention attitude it is. Surely for you.The food is very good,the location is perfect,best  place after a party.there's nothing like a dhaba infact is a restaurent but only way you cn call it a dhaba is that it is not heavy on you pocket and you can have the food in your car..Only place they needs to work is in the serviee,the waiters are a bit rude sometime..well but thats how you get in a dhaba at 2 o clock ..

PROS - I have ordered several home deliveries of their tandoori chicken but dined in only once. The tandoori chicken is a tad too spicy for my liking honestly but the rest of my family members seem to love it, thus the more-than-many a times orders. The best part about their home delivery is the efficient and quick service, maintaining the hot and freshly roasted aspect of the tandoori chicken.
On my recent and first ever dining experience in the Dhaba at 4 in the morning, I was thoroughly impressed with how fast they manage to serve orders without compromising on the quality of food. I loved tearing the hot, absolutely thin roomali roti and going for a bite of the buttery chicken bharta along with the chatpata salad. To a large extent, the salad and its potent lime aspect helped me restore my composure and stand on two feet straight. :P The gravy of the bharta gets the tear-wrap-into the mouth action in an infinite loop. :) Thereafter, we ordered egg tadka, to which I had straight nayed because I was already full. When the tadka arrived piping hot on the table, my senses gave in and I fell for the infinite loop all over again. I ate like I haven't in the entire day. 

CON - They don't accept cards. We had to get cash at that point in that situation. Not expected out of a place that serves lip smacking awesomeness. 
I am not asking for too much, am I? Yoy guys are this considerate already, being a little more will only add a feather to the cap. It is doable. I know you guys can. :)

Located in sarat bose road, Jain hind is itself a landmark! 
It is the only place that comes to mind when I want to have some really delicious food and besides that, It is pocket friendly. So, college students like me can afford this place on a regular basis. My personal favorite is Aloo do pyaaja and chana masala...Totally taste worthy...Another good thing about jai hind is that it offers free delivery even late at night! The ambiance is okay but the food makes up for it! The waiters are friendly!
If you like dhaba style food, Jai hind is a place to go! Besides this, they also serve other dishes like chinese.
This place also serves good manchurian! 
Go grab a bite! You wont regret! :)

One of the most famous and popular dhabas in this town, Jai Hind serves pretty good food at decent prices. The service is pretty efficient and there is not much to say about a dhabas ambiance except people having loud conversations and gorging on the hot and fresh food. The various butter masalas are good here and so are the kebabs. My favourtites are the chicken kadai and the chicken butter masala. I usually go with the hot tawa rotis the softness of which I quite like but the kulchas, parathas and naans are not too bad either. I also like the raita here. I have never tried the tadka and the dal here but my friends tell me that the dal is ok but the tadka is pretty good. All I have had here is the usual dhaba fare and have never been motivated to try the Chinese probably because better quality Chinese will be available elsewhere at those prices. All in all a place which can satisfy your hunger pretty well. My best experience here is of a ashtami night when four of reached this place from Maddox Sq. at about 10:30 pm absolutely famished and polished off the chicken kadai with buttered tawa rotis.

Good and wholesome Indian food ! I've visited this place a couple of times.....and both times I was quite satisfied. On my second visit, we did arrive a bit early for lunch, but service was not too slow. We ordered the Chicken Tandoori for starters.....it tasted delicious with the accompanying condiments, or just by itself. Well spiced and a bit charred....just the way I like it. For mains we ordered the Chicken Butter Masala along with Roomali Rotis....a very basic but classic combination at any dhaba or dhaba style restaurant. And they did do full justice to it....it was served piping hot and tasted really good. Overall, a recommendable destination for a quick and yummy meal. 4 stars from me. :)

Jai Hind is the answer for your midnight food cravings. Open till the morning hours you can get good food and good service here. Pros: the food. Parking available right in front. You can always eat in your car if you want to. Good staff.
Cons: not open in the morning. Always crowded because of popularity. 

All in all a good place to eat.

Words, Gut Space and Wallet Money always fall short when you visit this place, well not literally but to some extent. The Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Garlic Naan and the Laccha Pyaaz and obviously the Dal Makhani should not be given a miss at any cost whatsoever. The place isn't that cheap as it looks like but should not be given a miss. They serve food until 2AM in the night so one really shouldn't be worried if they have a craving for that perfect dish at midnight or past it. I visit this place almost once a month cause the flavour keeps lingering in your head.

This was the 3rd restaurant I visited during my Kolkata food spree. Famous for serving till late night, crowded by all class of people, cars lined up on the street, waiters running to get the order is what you will see on any given day in front of Jai Hind Dhaba. The restaurant is on 3 levels, the ground floor is non-ac and the 1st and 2nd floor are air-conditioned. The restaurant is famous for north-Indian / dhaba style food. I visited the place during Durga Puja and the placed was overcrowded. It didn’t take us more than 5 min to get parking space 100 meters from the restaurant, we decided to move to 1st floor and saw people lined up in front of the entrance and we ke  pt walking and reached the 2nd floor. A group of guys standing out informed they were waiting since the last 20 min and the hunger in my tummy angrily roared back at me. We decided to go in and talk to the guy manning the reception, 2 min sweet talk in Punjabi and well we got our seats in less than 5 min.

I was sitting right below the A/c and the waiters were so busy that they didn’t get me the remote or change the swing. As the place was crowded we stuck with the dhaba basics and played safe, we ordered paneer tikka, panner butter masala, tandoori chicken, chicken butter masala and butter naan.

The paneer tikka was ok, the marinade was still wet and soggy. Chef should have left these for couple of more min to serve it right. I can’t blame them as I am sure the poor soul behind the tandoor would be going crazy with all the order tickets rushing in the kitchen. They were probably serving approx. 200+ covers that night.
The tandoori chicken was nicely done, the marinade was seasoned well and kicked a storm with the mint and curd chutney, lime and onions.

Now comes the main course and again a disappointment in the veg section, the paneer butter masala was not seasoned well. The salt and spices were very mild and almost to the brink of becoming tasteless. On the contrary the chicken butter masala was good, chicken was a little chewy but the gravy was good.
The menu was temporary, I am sure this was for puja week with prices higher than usual but still won’t burn a hole in your pocket.

While on our way to the parking we saw a kulfi guy in front of the restaurant and ordered custard apple kulfi with falooda. The kulfi was little grainy but still kulfi as dessert was worth it.

Will I visit again? Maybe as the day I visited they kitchen was too busy and it would be good to give them another shot.

Overall: 3
Food: 3
Service: 3
Price: 3

Paid a visit after many years, this time with friends. Kitchen staff had a really bad attitude towards us, and one of them indirectly expressed his displeasure as we repeated an order. He was preparing to temporarily shut the kitchen for a few hours, and was the only kitchen staff there. Why bother to open the restaurant and welcome people like us when you are not ready to serve ? Anyway, coming to the food, we had ;

1. Mutton Korma- Tasted more like the Bengali dish " Kosha Mangsho " .
2. Mutton Keema- Nothing special.
3.  Dal Makhni- Too bland to be a Punjabi dish.
4.  Chicken Bharta- Better than the other items that we had. 
5. Butter Naan- Average, but we liked it as we were really hungry .

Been coming here from the days it was a hole in the wall joint,when it was actually a Dhaba. Not complaining though with the way it has bloomed into a multi storey restaurant.  This review is not based on a single visit but on my experience over the last few times.
I don't recall  if I have gone there earlier than 11 pm but still the place can be pretty packed during the weekends. 

Service is quick with a no nonsense air to it.

Food quality has pretty much remained the same over the years. Love the dal makhani and Paneer Butter masala with either Tandoori or Roomali roti. Where non veg is concerned they do a decent Chicken Bharta and Mutton Keema.

Have never tried their Tandoori items though I have heard good things abut it.

One thing that has been disappointing is the lassi which used to be really good but the last couple of visits have ben awful.

Service: 7/10

After my experience at Jai Hind last Sunday, it would be an injustice if I dont write a good review for the restaurant ! 

I have dined/taken away food from Jai Hind, n number of times ! It is the best option for late night food cravings or a quick dinner post party and drinks session ! 
Location and ambiance: Jai Hind is located on Sarat Bose Road beside Hotel Samilton. It is itself a landmark, so finding the place wont be a problem. It is spread over 3 floors with a small Non AC section on the ground floor and the rest is Air Conditioned. 

Food: If you want dhaba style food in the middle of a metropolitan like Kolkata, then Jai Hind is your best bet. Piping hot rotis, butter tandori rotis along with Chicken Bharta, Egg tadka, chicken reshmi butter masala are like the staple dishes out here. Chicken Tikka kebab and Chicken tandoori is also too good to taste. The complimentary salad tastes awesome along with the Indian cuisine served here. 
Service : Service is spot on. You can choose to have it in your car, and the waiters will serve you right in your car. Parking becomes a problem after 9PM as you can see more than 20-25 cars lined up waiting for dinner to be served. You can also choose to dine in and may have to wait for a maximum of 10-15 minutes even during peak hours. 

Now why I am in love with this place all the more : Recently on a Sunday, I was partying till very late and was crossing from this place around 3 in the morning and we saw this place semi open (not semi closed as im an optimist ;-) )
I and my friend went in and we were offered a table on the 2nd floor. Luckily they accepted our order of Chicken Bharta, Roomali Roti and Egg Tadka ! It was served to us within 5 minutes. We were damn hungry  and we really enjoyed the meal at almost 3.30 in the morning. The only downside was that they did not accept card at that moment that is totally okay as there are a couple of ATMs at stones throw away ! After a wholesome meal we headed back home paying around Rs400 including tips. A very well deserved 4.5 for serving lip smacking Indian cuisine at unbeatable prices and that too at an odd hour  !

We ordered Rumali roti , Chicken Kassa, Chicken Do Piaza, and everything was awesome.If you visit this area you must opt for this restaurant. Rs.300 is enough for two people to eat here..Give this one a visit you will not regret :-)

With a quintessential Indian name this place delivers more than it promises!!
This is my second year in kolkata and I already must have visited this place at least a hundred times (not exaggerating).I am big foodie and barely have I found a place delivering such unmatched quality of food for years.Never have I been disappointed with the food here.Yes the service might be a tad slow but I am ready to trade that for some brilliant food.
What I like the most about this place is how they have been able to maintain the punjabi-ness of the food for years and have not tried to alter the taste to match the local flavour. Their food is loaded with butter (precisely what you expect from a Punjabi dhaba).Their kebabs and tikka's impeccably cooked and last but not the least they have a very huge seating arrangement so rarely does one have to wait.
This is one place which I highly recommend to all food lovers.

Located at Sarat Bose Road, Jai Hind Dhaba is a perfect place for North Indian's Food Lovers. 
It Has 2 Sections. Ac and Non Ac.
Went with my friends, we ordered Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Tikka Kabab, Chicken Tangri kabab, Rumali Ruti, Tandoori Ruti and Chicken Bharta.
Chicken Tikka Kabab is just Superb. Chickem Tandoori and Chicken Tangri Kabab is also very good.
Both Rumali and Tandoori ruti is good and Chicken Bharta is delicious too.
Their food quality is just superb at very very reasonable price.
Ambiance is Okay. Staffs are Okay. 
Overall its a decent place for North Indian Food Lovers.

Jai Hind Dhaba has made a name for itself because of the quality of food it serves. I frequently order from this Dhaba and the food is always fresh and well prepared. I would readily recommend their excellent Tandoori Chicken, Murgh Bharta, Butter Roomali Roti and the Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. They do have a limited Indian Menu, but what they make, they make well. I would also recommend their Chicken Reshmi Kebab Roll (wrapped in Roomali Roti...not paratha) and the Masala Onion Salad. I hope they keep up their standards and continue to keep dishing out their specialities to the populace at large.

For those interested, they also have a Chinese menu, some of which i'm told is good.

Went to Jai Hind Dhaba couple of days ago.
Pros:-
Descent service considering the guests present.
Cons:-
Breads not cooked properly.
Probably the oil which they use to cook is not good as we were a group and almost all in it suffered from stomach or throat problems the day and after of consuming it.
Masala soft drinks had no fizz, seemed they were made out of liquid of 2 litre reusable bottles that were kept open for quite long.
Poor quantity.

This place is must for all the DAL ROTI people.

I have visited the place for almost 15 yrs now. It still maintains its "tadka" taste unlikely other famous options. It is a regular for all the dal tadka and punjabi food lovers hopping  in for a quick service. A must visit place hoping to have the great punjabi food experience

Obviously considering the the DHABA place , ambience factor is not expected. not to mention that prices are not a factor to consider at such places. the place has extended its services with an extra floor with chinese options. I do not consider them in my jai hind experience.

Still favourite amongst people for in car dine in after a late night movie, a great cricket match win, or friends hangout.

One of the best dhaba in Kolkata.....amazing food with fantabulous flavour. Even though the ambience is not great but nothing more can be expected from a dhaba. It has both ac and non ac accommodation. You can walk in anytime for even midnight 2am it is open and they also serve in the car so no worry if you don't get a seat. I tried aloo do pyaza, paneer tikka, dal makhani and mixed veg all were pretty good but garlic naan was bit chewy.

Jai Hind Dhaba Zindabad !! 

By far the best dhaba in kolkata ! Its even quite popular among vegetarians . Their Dal Tarka is always in our list of orders...also chicken bharta, kadai chicken, mutton curry are its signature dishes . Also try their chilly chicken dry and Chicken mix fried rice.

Jai Hind Dhaba.. It is located in Sarat Bose Road, bang opposite Lakshmi Narayan Mandir and beside Pan Asia Continental just before Samiltion Hotel. This place has been here for ages  but surprisingly I never got an opportunity to try the place out. I had got rave reviews from friends and relatives and therefore was longing to try this place so I went there last Friday.. yes, they were right. It is a place to crave for its lip smacking food. Whatever we had was so good that I cant wait to go back. It is divided into 3 sections with AC or without, with different prices for each section. I personally liked the 1st floor section and chose to dine-in there. With lights hanging on the table with red sofas it has a very Peter Cat-meets-Bar B Q kinda feel. The service was excellent.. within minutes all the food was on the table - that's how a dhaba should be. It serves the softest Rumali Rotis I've ever had. We'd ordered Dal Makhani, Aloo Do Pyaza and Malai Kofta along with it and they were all soo good. You don't expect one to order Chinese at a Dhaba but we did and were pleasantly surprised. The Dry Vegetable Manchurian (although Indianised) was super yum while the noodles were good enough. It is a great hit with the late nighters  and party goers as it is open till the wee hours and one has the option to dine in the comfort of their cars. Expect to shell out around 350 per person (the good thing is, there are many items which have been exempted from tax which makes it even cheaper !)
Can't wait to go back and try their kebabs, rolls and other things on their menu !

Not to be Missed : 
● Rumali Rotis
● Paneer Butter Masala
● Aloo Do Pyaza

There are times one is hungry at 1.am ... and there are times you have a butter chicken craving ... Then this is the place that comes handy. Well when it come to curries, a punjabi dhaba is not just reliable but also pocket friendly. When  you have popeple coming over be rest assured the food from here is a party pleaser. 

In many cases when we have a huge group of people to feed. we cook two dishes at home and get two from jai hind. They make amazing kulchas and naans ... I have never had the kebabs here as i cant get enough of the kali daal and chicken bharta .. 

Their kadai chicken and tikka butter masala are yummy too ... Their food is very rich and greasy but there are times one needs such comforting food, especially if we have lived in delhi and lived off chawla chicken.... A butter chicken craving is very difficult to be satisfied by anything else 

Also during house parties we usually order rumali rotis form here in bulk and they are usually very soft. 

The keema mutter and egg kassa also deserve a mention . Go here at 1 am and see it packed. Jai hind rocks ... the food is fresh and always delicious ..

For an ardent food lover like me- even a dish could speak a thousand words and if its Jai Hind Food- I probably would be conversing with them, for every morsel has a story to tell on its own.
I couldnt resist myself from writing a second review for Jai Hind- because it goes without doubt that this place needs a second mention , cos its truly one on my favourites in the city, and yes, Calcutta for me is incomplete without Jai Hind Food.
As Indians , and more importantly as humans we do understand and acknowledge how good food is a blessing to us and how much we love this..! And when I speak of Good food and love for the same- Jai Hind defines and completes that experience.

My earlier review is very specific of the location, ambience, must haves, service etc etc..! and this was my very first review on Zomato , hence showing my obsession for Jai Hind Food :)
But having now travelled to few more cities and exploring various options and cuisines food could offer- there was no second Jai Hind , not specifically in terms of food, but also in terms of the rustic feel Jai hInd culminates into - crowded, messy, cars around, noises but yet so much it has to offer..!

Being a famous landmark in Calcutta and having served food to may be even my grand fathers- this place lives up to its dedication to serve authentic North Indian Food- with a dash of spice and a tinge of Love!

Yes- this place doesnt have very good options for starters and their Chinese is decently average- But the North Indian Food needs a second, third, fourth and many mentions..!

Some of my favourite picks:

>Tandoori Roti- Please tell them , whether you need them soft or hard and they would make it accordingly for you. If its not that hot, please mention it to them, and they will change it right away. Rotis are awesome- and if accompanied with a dullop of butter, the smile keeps getting bigger :)
>Rumali Roti- Awesome, just make sure you have it hot..!
>Aloo do Pyaza- The crispy Fried Onion along with it is magical- it enhances the flavour and makes this dish a complete story.
>Malai Kofta- Served in Orange Gravy, this dish is the star of the Lot. The only place where I find malai Kofta in subtle spicy gravy. The Gravy is thick and really good to taste.
>Kadhai Paneer: Paneer, Capsicum, Onion together in a rich creamy gravy. Although I find the salt content a bit less in this dish always- but then otherwise its a treat!
> Shahi Paneer: They are too good with Paneer. You can blindly place an order for any paneer dish..! This one is the hot seller and this dish deserves every bit of being one.
> Mixed Veg: Although I dislike Mixec Veg personally and never order that in a restaurant , but at Jai Hind , they cook it so royally that you wouldnt mind eating it again.
> Dal Tadka- Now this is different from Dal Makhani. The Tadka is more thick and they cook it so aptly that the flavours are a treat to your stomach..!
> Dal Makhani- Smooth, Creamy and simmered on Low Flame-this is their fastest Running dish because we indians Love Dal Makhani and you'll love it more here..!

Writing the above has further strengthened my craving for a meal at Jai Hind :) 

You can also try the array of other dishes they have to offer. Missi Roti, Mushroom masala and Veg Pulao -all of them being equally good.

Ive lost count of the times Ive been to Jai Hind . Have tried all their seating options- paying different prices for the same food..! 
Yet- I can go here a multiple times - happily and willingly. Open till almost 3 in the morning- this dhaba never sleeps.

However- the car bonnet table is my favourite and I enjoy it more with the Calcutta hustle Bustle being my favourite music. The Waiters rush and cater to a dozen cars with eager and hungry people and then they leave no complaints to get that salt and achhar and pyaaz and papad for you just like a superman would.

Jai Hind- you guys are awesome and as my rating truly describes- its INSANE..!. Just keep on to ur standards and keep making thousands of faces like me smile everyday..!

lf you havent had food at Jai Hind in Kolkata- youre really missing out something..!!

This awsome dhaba located at Sarat Bose Road, is the best place to be at when you are at Kolkata.
If you're in for the Ambiance, this place is a strict "NO" but if you're a true food lover, this is a foodies Delight!
Located on main Sarat Bose Road, you'll always find rush to this dhaba and also the traffic around as both sides of the Road are flanked by Cars, as people often have their food in the Car itself, enjoying the rustic ambiance.
North Indian Punjabi food is their forte and Thumbs up to this place for the kind of quality it has maintained for the past 50 years.
Favourite picks are -Tandoori Roti, Aloo do Pyaaza, Malai Kofta, Paneer Butter Masala/Kadhai Paneer, Dal Tadka, Masala Papad and Sprite. Rice Lovers can go in for Veg Pulao,it is good to taste and quite a filler.

The best part about Jai Hind is that it is always on the go, You get good stuff here, service is quick, and yes-"its not a much pocket pinch..!!"
Meal for two- Around 300 bucks and ull go out with a full smiling Stomach..:)

When at Jai Hind, dont forget to try out the Kulfi Waala sitting just outside the Dhaba. Do taste the Falooda and Sitafal Kulfi, Its a sweetaholics delight.
Jai Hind can never get out of you...youll get addicted to its awesome Delicasies.
Chinese is not good here...so dont make the mistake of going in into Jai Hind and ordering Chinese Food :P

I give all stars to Jai Hind for serving the most lip smacking food I've ever had ! Kudos Jai Hind - you're serving love, food is just an excuse :)

Paid my second visit to this outlet and it was not the most pleasant. If I recall correctly the standard of food served had also taken a bit of a hit from my last visit.

The location is very very convenient. I had actually gone to AR Digital across the road to take printouts and decided to sneak in for a quick lunch. I was asked to move from the first table I sat on saying it would seat more people. Fair enough. I asked for a chicken tikka kabab, a chicken dopiaza and rotis. Service wasn't terribly quick but not super slow either.

The kabab platter had 5-6 pieces and server with onion rings and green chutney. It was nothing to write home about. Kababs almost tasted like seekh. Some spiced (chaat masala mixed) salad with it would do well. The dopiaza was plain passable. I have had better. Rather rich. The chicken portionwas perfectly satisfactory, and a breast piece, as I had requested. It was very soft and tender too. The tandoori rotis were good. Thin and crispy.

I wanted a Thums Up and was informed of there being no colas. Not acceptable. I requested them to get one and it was met with a not very friendly response. The young sardarjee at the counter was neither pleasant or friendly. Sad to see this lack of customer friendliness.

There are some really annoying points. When I walked in the staff were engaged in banter. Most annoying for customers. Later,  I found another customer sharing my table. I did not particularly appreciate that since the prices charged were restaurant rates, and I felt they should behave like a restaurant. I pointed out this and did not receive a very pleasant response.

Contrary to other reviews, I do not find the prices too reasonable. They are just about ok. I have had better kababs in better places for less.

The food is ordinary but what can you expect at 2 am in the morning; something is better than never. However, the staff is very rude and abusive with no idea about courtesy which is very essential in this business of hospitality. They'll behave like hooligans and will behave as if they are doing a smart job by misbehaving and ill-treating you as if you are a hooligan yourself. But if you behave very politely even after such a rude behavior from the staff you'll be treated as if you've been provided a favor to sit and eat and better finish your food and leave soon without any further discussion or complaint. Inside of the restaurant is like a fish market with people talking loudly at the top of their voice; equally accompanied by the group of abusive staff making  the scene worse. Definitely not a place for decent group of people who are looking for late night munchies in the city.

"Jai Hind Dhaaba " an old authentic/pure Punjabi dhaba in  Sarat Bose road,Kolkata . A must try for people wanting to get a feel of authentic punjabi cuisines in the city .You may have to struggle for a space to dine-in during peak hours. I have been visiting this place almost for past 2 years , and today was another day I went to the dhaba/restaurant to relish my taste buds again .
You should see the tandoori being cooked outside the hotel in the first place with proper tandoor ovens and cooks in their complete attention for the kebabs/tandoori chicken to be cooked to its best .

Must try starters : Tandoori Chicken,Chicken Tikka,Reshmi  Tikka ,Tangri Kebab
Must try Main Course : Egg Chicken Tarka,Chicken Bharta, Chicken Tikka masala,Butter Chicken,Dahi Chicken, Paneer Butter masala
Must Try Roti's: Butter Naan, Lachcha Parantha,Garlic Naan,Aloo Parantha,Onion Kulcha
 
Not to forget the Paneer Butter Masala which is the best vegetarian dish that this Dhaba is famous for ,Apart from the chicken delicacies you should try this recipe for a change . And how could I forget the yummy "Sweet Malai wali Lassi" at the end of the splendid meal.

I must say a "Jai Ho" for the Jai Hind Dhaaba . They are opening the 2nd floor now to accommodate and serve more food loving people :)

Very impressive! I have been here couple of times, and this has proved to be the perfect dining place for me, both in terms of food and price. My desire to visit this place again became stronger after I  noticed the renovated 1st floor seating area. Needless to mention, food is very economical. The location also suits me quite a lot, its right on top of Lansdowne road. The best part is, its open till two.am at night, that gives me a lot of advantage. 

Coming to the food, they prepare excellent meals. Unlike the other dhabas, this has its own Punjabi uniqueness. The butter Nan, Butter chicken and baby corn are exquisite.  The chicken tandoori's are my all time favourite. Yes. They are tender, tasty and juicy. One may also expect good quantity out of these meals. I just feel that the service should be a little better. They serve promptly (after all its a dhaba!) but the serving personnel didnt seem upto the mark. So this needs to be taken care of. Ambiance seemed fine, I dont expect any better out of such casual diners. 

Yet, I proudly rate it a 'FOUR' solely, due to its excellent food. Looking forward to dine here again soon!

Had dinner with family at Jai Hind Dhaba during a vacation in Kolkata. We had ordered tandoori chicken, chicken butter masala, daal with tawa roti and masala kulcha. The food can be best described as simple yet delicious. It is a fine place to hang out with friends as well. However, on the minus side: 
1. The service is  a little slow.
2. Wouldn't suggest it for peace-loving people (The whispers get transformed into a clamour even at 2.00 in the morning- it is usually THAT crowded)

Jai hind is a very old Dhaba and I'm visiting it for years. Basically has three sections: 1) non AC 2) ground floor AC and top floor AC restaurant too. They even serve in cars. Everyone living in Calcutta must have visited Jai hind. 

 Discussing the pros and cons now. 

Pros : 1) food is delicious
2) serves the best rumali roti
3) reasonably priced
4) quick service 
5) ambience is ok
6) located at the prime location

Cons: 
1) they charge differently at times on their mood. Sometimes dal cost 65 sometimes 75 sometimes 70
2) lacks music system 
3) service is terrible at times

Must try : spcl dal tarka, paneer butter masala, chicken boneless kababs , chicken butter masala, rumali roti
======
Special Mention to: Chicken Reshmi Kebab/Tikka Kebab/paneer tandoori in Roomali Roti

Went there for a late lunch today, sat on the first floor. Decent ambience, clean. Service was very quick (probably owing to the very few people at the restaurant during that time). Food was good in quality. They don't serve fish and that's a drawback. Also, Lassi wasn't available at 3 in the afternoon. But still, overall, a decent place.
Pocket pinch for two - Rs 600

went for a Sunday dinner, crowded place
 ordered for chicken tikka masala for starters. served wid a tangy chutney,onions n lemon, was yummy n decently priced for 6 boneless tasty chunks of chicken.
main course ordered for onion kulcha, not dat good. rumali roti n laccha paratha, both good and chicken butter masala. absolutely no taste. plane orange gravy wid chicken chunks. potential of a gr8 taste but failed hugely.
all in all gud place for North Indian food. avoid goin on sunday evenings to stay away from waiting.

Well this place really impresses me big time. Though the ambience is very average and nothing very attractive yet it's food quality and quantity is overwhelming. The dishes are well prepared and pricing being very reasonable. The staff are cheerful but yes not very affluent. Their tandoori section is amazing and Chicken butter Masala is my favourite. Their tandoori roti is awesomely prepared. You can try their chinese food too it's nice but I feel their Indian section is much better. 
Overall I rate it 4, I would definitely force you to try their food in order to be happy after your meal. I don't mind visiting this place once a month.

Jai hind Dhaba is a treat by Kolkata to all the students who stay in PGs or hostels nearby. It offers a lot of things for you to eat at an affordable price. If I would have been passing by Sarat Bose Road and felt like having something, I would definitely step into Jai Hind to have the roomali roti and the double mirch dal tarka along with some masala onions. They have different sections- the AC and Non- AC one's and prices in both are different. Food quality is not sacrificed for the pricing. They have worked hard o keep the balance between a restaurant and a dhaba. Service is quite fast and home delivery facility provided is awesome. Keep up the good work.

My favourite and I am deducting 0.5 only for the space crunch that might happen sometimes, especially Saturday nights!
I am a vegetarian, and if you are the same or wish to try some heavenly food, go for Paneer Butter Masala, Dal Makhani, Aaloo do Pyaaza! All rotis (assorted breads) are awesome, but I'd like to mention that Butter Rumali Roti here just enhances the taste of everything!
Paneer Tikka is okay, Chinese is good!
Never forget to end things here with Papad.

I will say Jai Ho for Jai Hind time and time again ! They make really good food and have excellent vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Personal favourites include Chicken Bharta , Alu Dopiaza, Kali Dal Tadka , Dry Chilli Chicken and Paneer Butter Masala with the Naan or Tandoori Roti.  Their Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Tandoori Chicken are very good as well. The best part is you can partake their food either in the AC dine-in , take away or in the comfort of your car. Its open till late and is a super option for when you want to eat out but not dress up for a meal with out compromising on the taste and quality of your food.

one of my most favorite places. a place for all seasons. THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS JOINT IS THAT IT IS VERY LIGHT ON YOUR POCKET, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ENJOY A HEARTY MEAL!

These guys have maintained their standard of food over so many years, even though it's become famous.

Great food. No frills absolutely. Food served on melamine plates so if you are the finicky kind, enter at your own risk.
coming from a movie after 11.00 p.m.?
Looking for piping hot indian/ punjabi food, this is the place to come to.
excellent choice of vegetarian as-well-as non-vegetarian selections to choose from.
The Black Dal Makhani, the Black Dal Tarka (tadka), Chilly Paneer, Paneer Butter Masala, Aloo Do Pyaaza, Palak Cream & Kasmiri Aloo Dum, are just few of the many things that you must try. Tandoori Aloo and Tandoori Paneer for starters are also great. The range for "paneer" & "egg" dishes, mentioned on the menu are a wide variety to choose from.
I am an eggitarian so I can confidently say that the Egg Tadka, Egg Curry & Egg-Do-Pyaaza are just yummilicious!
Choice of Rotis (for the sophisticated lot, "Breads") are also gr88, whatever you may order. Butter Naan, Masala Kulcha and Tandoori Roti... the staples are all there. The best for me though is the "Tawa roti" (phulka) buttered or non-buttered (your choice) because it's really light on the stomach if you are out for a late meal. However, a must try is the "Garlic Naan" (and one should ask to make the naan a bit crispy). Delectable, especially if you don't mind a little bit of extra-garlic-y taste in your mouth.

pulaos are so-so, just above average, if you may! (i tried the veg. ones)

The kulfis of the kulfi-wala just besides the exit gate are the perfect ending to a hearty punjabi/ Indian meal. The flavors of kulfi keep changing depending on what fruit is in season, although Kesar-Pista is the all-year-rounder. Additional topping of rose-syrup (diluted sharbat) and "Faluda" is there for the take, if you like it.

HAVEN'T tried the Chinese food out here. heck, don't need to... when in a dhaba, eat the food that they are masters of!
