I had a liking for this place since I were a kid becoz of its non veg dishes...today I went there and was happy with he service but I had to deduct a point becoz the coconut chutney they served with masala dosa was fermented..they changed it as soon as we  complained . but that was not expected of a reputed place like theirs. anyway...the chola batora I ordered was tasty but the magso milkshake was very light . the keseria kulfi was good...I liked the ambience and the staff ..

Pavbhajj, chhole bhatore, idli, lassi, phuchka, shakes....Junior Brothers is the ideal place where you can choose over a wide variety of NorthIndian & SouthIndian fast foods and snacks. Their chhole bhatore and mango lassi are to die for, so do their pavbhaji. Located at hindustan park opposite to Bank of Maharashtra.

Junior Brothers is the place to come to if you are in the Gariahat area and looking for vegetarian fare. Located between Triangular park and Hindustan Park, it is quite conspicuous with its huge signboard and glass doors. Their dahi vada and chaats are pretty good. They serve brilliant kachoris too. They have certain South Indian items on their menu as well and the dosa is pretty good. Try their kesari lassi of you have a sweet tooth, I really like it. The one drawback that I feel this place has is that they do not serve any hot beverages. So if you want to relax over a steaming cup of chai, this is not your place. But the food is great and the service is prompt and this makes it a perfect place to grab a quick bite.

This is a extension of Gupta Brothers. Food is too good. Jalebi fried in Ghee and Club Kachori are must try over here. Chatni is also really nice which is mostly sweet blended with a tad of pudina. Hing Kachori is also good but lacks the smell of hing.

A place you can trust to satisfy your hunger when you are in a mood to have some vegetarian food. Their hing kachori ,peas kachori , chats( especially the dahi phuchka),chole bhature or bhature alu dum can comfort your hunger pangs .Pretty reasonable on your pocket .Not bad to give a try may be a  few more visits after that !!

I have been frequenting this place since i was a kid and feel the need to mention that the quality of both food and service has not gone down ever since. Still as prompt with their orders and the food is so fresh every single time! Just entering this place is a pleasure with the smell of chats and choley everywhere! The prices are reasonable for most items.

Recommentaions:

1. Papdi chaat
2. Alu dum bhatura
3. Dosa
4. Samosa
5. Lassi

The staff here is very polite and prompt and always eager to serve well. If in the neighbourhood and in the mood for a quick hot fresh meal look no further!

Located near Ananda Publishers and an extension of Gupta Brothers.
I have been eating here since the time my feet did not touch the foot rest on the high chairs.
Nostalgic value apart,the place is a hassle free,good vegetarian food place.
They serve a sweet-sour chutney with chola bhatura and samosa which is to die for.
You pay at the counter, get served,eat and leave.
Hopefully with a smile on your face.

Located in Hindustan Park. This is an extended version of Gupta Brothers right next to this. 
You'll find loads of options to choose from.. mainly chaats and other things. 
You order, pay right there, sit and eat in peace. Friendly staff there.

A pretty nice place to have south indian food and several chats. Fully air condotioned and clean place to have a quick bite. I tried their cheese masala dosa, idli,lassi and kulfi. All were pretty good with no complaints as such. But I was a little dissapointed with the staff though. They were so lazy that they did not even come to our table to take order. I had to literally shout and place my order. Overall a good experience.

Located next to the Ananda Publisher's shop, I came here often when my tuitions were nearby. Their papri chat is awesome. It's not as same as the roadside ones, which are my favourite. But they are served with dahi and all which I started loving after having the papri chat here. It was so good. I used to customize with more imli chutney and it appeared more tangy and flavourful. There are south Indian delicacies also. I never tried them. My dad used to have them. He kinda liked it. So I can suggest you to try also.

Junior Brothers is located near Triangular Park and perhaps one of the pocket friendly options providing decent Vegetarian snacks. I tried out Mix Chat and Alu Tikka Chaat and a kulfi at the end, and admittedly the kulfi was the best of the lot in my POV. The Chaat's could have been a little more spicy, nevertheless it was pretty decent. 
Ambiance wise, it was quite pleasant, peaceful and extremely clean. 

For bank card holders, make sure you take sufficient cash in hand as they dont accept cards.

Located near triangular park, this place serves pure vegetarian food. A favorite joint for many, due to their widespread offerings and affordable pricing. Tried the Masala Dosa once, and the filling was sumptuous, full of flavors. The dosa was crisp, making it one of the better Masala Dosas available in this city. I ended my meal with Badam Sherbat. An absolute delight, I must admit!

An all time favourite place for Radhaballavi and Aloor dum, Junior brothers have always got be transfixed with joy and mesmerised for their Aloor dum is heavenly. The chutney they serve is absolutely delicious. The masala dosa is equally good. 
Radhaballavi and Aloor dum is always a good combination. The prices are quite nominal and doesn't at all justify for the food they serve, I feel as if they are underpriced.
I also relish their rose sherbet and aam Panna. The waiters are courteous and are ever helpful to ensure that you have a good meal. I always visit this pace whenever I am around gariahat. Recommended.

Bon apetit 👌

Visited this place on multiple occasions. I generally prefer to have the dahi phuchka. This is the only place where I have dahi phuchka. Their chhole baturey and Mixed chat is also quite good. Among the beverages I usually have kesar kulfi or lassi. The ambience is decent but the sitting arrangements are not very comfortable. Some of the chairs are really very high. The prices are moderate and pocket friendly.

Have been visiting this place since childhood. The place has remained the same since last 20 years or more I think. 

Ambiance: Good. Homely. 

Service: self service. 

Food: Mainly a vegetarian snack joint. Taste of food is very good. Specially their mixed chaat, Pani puri and of course dahi vada and rose sharbet. 

Pocket pinch: Prices have been increasing over the years, yet reasonable as of now.

Located near triangular park, this place serves as the best junction to gobble up some decent snacks and juices at the cheapest rates. On a weekday afternoon when I came in, this place was housing a decent crowd. Going through the menu, I ordered for a samosa chana chat, badam sherbat and mango shake. One needs to pay at the counter while placing the order. The chat was delicious with decent quantity, the samosa being on the spicier side.The chaat didnt have the typical chat sauce which is tomato based and tangy. Instead, the chaat had a thicker, cooked gravy, which tasted very similar to chole gravy served with bature. The drinks were refreshing. They were consistent and tasty, with lesser proportion of ice cubes and more amount of drink. The badam sherbat was truly amazing and will be my personal favourite every time I visit this place !

This is a very decent purely vegetarian joint.
It's very old and I visited this place today after four years . Previously,  when I was in school,I used to come here so often whenever I felt like having chaat or chana bhatura. 
So today since I was not too hungry,I visited this place just for nostalgia's sake and was so happy to see that they have not compromised one per cent with their quality.
I had dhokla and lassi.Both of them were so good specially the lassi.
This is very pocket friendly as well!

I was unaware of this place till now.. We had a chat party for holi and the food was bought from this place..
We had phuchka,churmur, dahi vada and samosa chana chat...
Samosa chana chat was one of the best that I had..dahi vada too was pretty good,the alu for the phuchka was average since I like mine spicier..
We ended it with rasmalai...which was very soft and spongy... The entire food tasted very fresh... Even the phuchka seemed to have been freshly prepared...
Waiting to try some more things at this place

For the first time I have to put such low rate for any outlet.
Junior Brothers was a name to reckon with during our childhood days. Many a time during weekends my father and myself had taken Dahi Vada and mixed chat from here. During my college days, the service deteriorated. I remember once I took my friend there for Dahi Vada. Not only they said the curd was not available after making us wait for a considerable period, they were downright rude. I had stopped visiting it since then.
This November, my cousin sister and her son - both NRIs - came to Kolkata. My nephew wanted to taste the Dosas of Kolkata. My sister, who is much older to me and had spent her childhood in Gariahat, had nostalgic feeling for this joint took us all there.
It is well maintained in terms of interior. Neat and clean. Enough chairs.
We ordered one masala dosa for my nephew and sada dosa each for us both. 
The food took a long time for arrival. The filling of the masala dosa had a stale smell in it. The outer covering was not crisp enough. And the accompanying coconut chutney was as thin as any sherbet. Overall not fit for consumption.
Both my cousin and her son were furious and wanted to speak to the manager. The first person who came forward, startled by the western accent of my nephew, went and sent another boy, who was definitely not a manager. When we insisted on speaking to the manager, he went and another boy came forward, again not a manager. Thus four persons came and went, unable to provide a manager. The last person to approach us was a fat man with a soiled shirt and a cook's cap adorning his head. He claimed to be a manager ( which we doubted). He was, however, polite. He listened to my sister's complaint and on her insistence, gave back the cash we had paid. 
Not going there anymore.

I have been there uncountable number of times. Every single preparation is delicious. They use pure ghee as the cooking medium, the best quality badaam, milk. No regrets ever. The staff is nice. The ambiance is nothing special but it is alright for breakfast.

The place is clean nd tidy with only 4or 5 wrought iron tables. Each nd every dish frm thr menu is delicious nd appreciable. The stuffings of their singara nd khasta kachori is amazing served with their special chatni. Only thing I don't prefer to have here is phuchka, I thnk its better njyd frm the phuchka vendors. The service is prompt nd they r generous with their extra chutni packets. 😁

It is a very nice place for vegetarians. Chola alu tikia and mango kulfi are must haves. The prices are pocket friendly. The service is prompt and the staff are very polite.

I frequently used to visit this place for a quick snack when I was in school. It is located just beside Gupta brothers at Rash behari avenue. The chaat items and phuchkas were hit items here.. They serve south indian food also and dosas were quite popular. Service was very fast and prices were very reasonable.

Have been visiting this place for ages and just love the papri chat and kulfi. Our Sunday take aways are always been club kachouris . The place has always been neat and services at jet speed. Quality, taste and pocket friendly prices have made me regular customer. Sitting arrangements are good but some being bar stools, I found it a bit uncomfortable else would have given a full score!

This is very near to my college. And it serves purely veg food. I have tried many of their items and all of them r lipsmacking. Their pav bhaji is the best I have tried till date. Chola batura, lassi, dahi vada and samosa chaat  r just too good. Veg can also be soooo tasty. And when it comes to price, must say it's very reasonable. Though it's a small joint but it is spacious enough.

Serves as a great breakfast, or a Sunday brunch. Actually it can be enjoyed anytime, it is that awesome. ideal winter breakfast. #ClubKachori is a inseparable of kachori like pooris prepared from a club of ingredients served along a mouthwatering potato curry and tamarind chutney TREAT!! Served in many restaurants during Sundays, people actually queue up for this dish in many restaurants. Available from 7 am to 10 am only.

This joint is located just opposite "Nike". It is quite an old place and hence known to everyone who regularly visits gariahat. They have two seperate stores, one for the restaurants and another for sweets and other packed snack items. The decor is quite clean and soothing. Their restaurat counterpart has sitting arrangements with around 7-8 tables. They have both bar chairs with elevated heights and normal wrought iron chairs as well. They serve pure vegeterian savories ranging from dishes like- mixed chaat, paapri chaat, dahi vada, dhokla, radhaballavi & alurdam, lassi, badam sharbat etc. I have crashed in here for few qick snacks during those festive days when non-veg is forbidden and i wasn't dissapointed. Now the other counterpart is for sweets and other snacks. This part also has a squeaky clean layout and decor. Their offerings of sweet includes- kaju baarfi, ghee laddoos, malpoha, chamcham, rabri, rasmalai, sandesh, pethas etc. In short "Junior Brothers" is a one stop destination for your vegan cravings.

Had been to Junior Brothers couple of times, most of the times for a quick breakfast. The place has got nice wrought iron seating arrangement, with most of the tables quite close to each other since the place is not that big in itself. You need to go up to the cash counter and place the order there, pay the money first and then wait for your food. Sad part is - every time I had to wait for a bit too long, not sure if I am the only unlucky one, or the service here is really bit on the slower side. Anyway, I had chaats, dosas, lassis and kulfis here. And till date I think the Kesaria Kulfi was the best dish which I had here. It has got some rose syrup over it that makes it taste so great, it has got a perfect texture and always served super cold. Apart from this I found the Mango Shake and Rose Milk Shake to be okay. But the Cheese Masala Dosa was a disappointment, not the way I like it. Firstly, on that day it came to me after the Kulfi was served!! And when the Dosa was being served I found that some shredded/grated cheese was there sprinkled over the Dosa and no cheese was there inside it. The sabji inside was strictly okay, nothing great. This variant of Cheese Masala Dosa was so new to me and I am sure I will never again try this stuff here. Need to go back to Rasam or Banana Leaf to have some good Cheese Masala Dosa next! But anyway, the things are quite reasonably priced here and that's the silver lining for sure apart from some great Kesaria Kulfis!

Cheers!

**Location = Located at Rashbihari Avenue, just beside the Gupta Brothers outlet.

**Brief = Have had lots of superb food and fond memories of this place.

**Ambiance = Not a huge place, with small tables for 2-3 people per table.Its airconditioned.It has a prepay service and sometimes they take a bit of time to place food at your table.

**Things tried = I love the pav bhaji they make,its really delicious.Also the raj kochuri is really large :D
Papri chaat is also a decent item here. But my favourite reason to visit this place is the kulfis :P
I just love them here.

**Recommended = Chaats and bhaji pavs are good, but do try their kulfis,its awesome :D

**Purse Check = Rs.300/- for 2 people is good.

**Overall = A nice place to sit,talk and have some fresh chaats,dosas and kulfis :)

i went to junior brothers(gariahat) on 4th september 2014 arround 6pm to hang out with a friend as i always did when ever i was in gariahat and as always the food was good n so was the service n not that many people arround - i initially ordered soft drinks and veg cutlets and i started chating with my friend n after some time as we were going to order for some thing else suddenly one old man came (waiter) who pushed me in my back n shouted aloude n told us to leave as one other party (customer) were waiting which we didnt noticed - the way the old waiter behaved with us surprised me n i felt so insulted infront of my friend whom i insisted to come to this place for good food n service- i left quitely just because i was with a female friend n i didnt wanted to disclose n boost my background n identity but it was one of the worst day of my life - i want the owner to read my expirience n take action against the oldest waiter n the manager who was there on duty that day - i know u wont but by any chance if u care about ur reputation i hope u would act n if u do so plz make sure u inform me so that i can go ur place again n have a good time with my friends  -my email id is-- shantanub71@gmail .com

I have turned vegetarian for this month and that obviously left me with very few options in food places. Thank God I visited Junior Brothers last week which totally made my foodie tummy super happy even with my vegetarian diet.

This place is located at Gariahat near Kolhapuri Center, beside Gupta Brothers. There are high chairs with high tables towards the entrance and a few normal chairs as well. You need to pay for your food at the counter and wait till your food reaches your table. The service is quick and this place will give you an old Kolkata feel with Uncles and Aunties chitchatting all around :)We ordered lassi, dosa, pao bhaji and kesar kulfi. The lassis came first. Lassi was nice and thik. I would have preferred a little more ice, however, it was quite nicely made with less water and more curd. The pao bhaji was AMAZING and I loved it. A had the dosa and he was pretty pleased as well. The kulfis were the final icing which I liked quite as much.

Quite a nice place and pocket friendly. You can face a little problem with unclean tables but that can overlooked since they give pretty decent food for what they charge. Recommended :)

Just one word fits for this fast food corner, that is "awesome". If you are up to some Desi fast food like Papdi Chaat, Raj Kachori, Dahi Valla, Pav Bhajji and other chaats, then this is the place for you.

Food is just wonderful, all kinds of Indian chaats and street food is available here. I recommend the Papdi Chaat and the Dahi Valla. Pav Bhajji is also nice and recommended for a stomach filling experience. Quality of the food is great and very hygienic, they make everything in front of you according to your customized preference.

Prices are one of the reasons for joy as it is pocket friendly. Service is mediocre and at times really slow, but isn't too bad either. Ambiance of the place is just about average. There are tables inside but seating arrangement is too small to accommodate huge crowd. At times, you may need to share your table with someone else (if you are alone). You would also like to try their takeaway service as they seem to pack your chaats and stuff really well and no mess at all.

Finally, if you are bored of having rolls and don't want to spend too much, this place might be worth giving a visit for your evening snack.
