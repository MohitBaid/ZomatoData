Gupta roll centre is a fast food eatery , located at Ballygunge

Take away counter with no sitting arrangements .

Pocket pinch is ok.

Tried chicken roll and mixed chowmein , both were bit oily but tasty. Chicken roll was soft, fresh with nice fillings. Mixed chowmein had also generous fillings and was cooked well.

Overall satisfactory.

Located close to Deys Medical.
We opted for this place during our training days at Deys. 
Talking just in terms of food, this place is great. 
Ordered their paratha aloo combos for just a very reasonable price. The quantity and quality both were upto the mark.

Good a very deserted place not too much of crowd in any seasons. If u feel bore or get frustrated try the rolls it will make u feel better. Egg roll is a must try from this restaurant
