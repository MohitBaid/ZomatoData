The place is quite unhygienic and needs to be visited by pest control ASAP.
The vinegar is being kept open and sauce bottles do not have caps. :')

Worst service. The men never saw a woman before as it looks like. Unnecessary sounds, coughs. Plates of previous customers are lying on the tables. No concern. A/c stays off while there are no customers. They start considering about their state once a customer steps in. They couldn't find their menu. Single menu card they have I guess.
Go there only if all the other eateries are devastated due to zombie attacks.

We were too hungry to search for any other place this afternoon when we found Blue Poppy already closed Â & entered this eatery as it was the first one to come across our way.
We ordered chili chicken, egg noodles & chicken fried rice.
Average food.
Remarkably bad service.
I guess it is okay for home delivery only.

Good food. Seating is available. 
I had chilli chicken and chow which was fair enough. If someone is looking for  roadside good food, this is the place. 
Roll is the suppose to be the tastiest. So try it out once. :)

Tried their rolls, been here twice. Once I tried their chicken roll, and once I tried their egg chicken roll. I wasn't impressed at all. The rolls are too mainstream. The quality is very average, and the chicken roll lacks quantity of chicken. Wasn't really a good experience here.

Went there for the first time today. The place was quite empty when we first went there. The staff were cordial. Coming to the food, we ordered egg chicken roll. The roll tasted okayish. The price is quite decent. One big disappointment is that they dont really have all the delicacies mentioned in the menu. Like when we were about to order momo, the waiter said that biryani and momos were not available. I can say that if you want extraordinarily good food in a pocketfriendly budget, this might not be the right place.

This place isn't so bad....dont know why the rating is so low...
However, went for having something in evening and we ordered egg chow and chilly chicken (dry)....
The taste was good....
Its not very spacious but one can go for quick bites....
The rolls are also good.

Was hungry and on my way just drop in to this place to have chicken roll which is really tasty. 5 minutes walk from jeevandeep bus stop. Price is reasonable. I won't forget to grab roll from this place if I go to Russel street

So this is a small joint just beside sugar and spice. Does not have much of an ambience....it is quite congested with  few tables and chairs...its better to opt for takeaway. Food is "okayish". I used to really like their chicken biryani which is available at 70rs only. However the quality has declined a lot. One can give it a miss.

This place is not one among one of my favourites because I didn't liked this place because of it's dull ambience and dull staff....
The only thing good about this place is that you can get good food at a low price that's it.

This a a tiny place just beside Sugar and Spice at Russel street. the rolls are good. the chicken egg fried rice worth just Rs.70 is enough to fill two people. So you may go there for a cheap and not so bad lunch.

After having read its not-so-good reviews on zomato I was skeptical to try anything else but a humble egg roll. The roll is priced at 25,but the man gave us a change of Rs.4 with a lame "pore adjust kore neben" He could have returned rs.6 too and he could have adjusted 'pore'.

Anyways,this is near the maidan metro station,between sugarr n spice and russel point,opposite 6 Russel Street. I never actually knew it has a sitting arrangement until yesterday. And it was very small so we preferred to stand outside. 

The roll was good. The paratha could have been better though. It had cucumber inside(which many a egg roll seller give a miss)along with a sumptuous amount of sauce and onion.
All in all, one can go for the rolls for a quick bite.

I usually like to think that there are two kinds of food joints - the expensive and the cheap. If your restaurant falls under the latter, you need not produce absolute blockbuster dishes, but still atleast put up something worth charging for.

I've been to Indo China a few times, basically because it's right beside Maidan Metro Station and St. Xavier's College and I can safely say that rolls are the only thing worth buying from here.

Their Chinese is quite terrible and their beverages are atrocious. I haven't tried all their dishes, and I don't even want to. I do visit them often enough, even with Blue Poppy right there staring at me.

The restaurant is terribly small - which doesn't help them, but it doesn't really bother me at all. Service is non-existent.

Update (4/9/2015): As bad as ever. Their food may have gotten worse, which I honestly didn't think was possible. Strangely enough, their Mughlai Paratha wasn't too bad. The waiters are pointless since you're pretty much doing everything yourself.

Thank you for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

If you are thinking to drop by this place called Indo-China situated near Maidan Metro Station, change your mind!! This is the worst place to get your stomach filled. I ordered one egg-chow without gravy and another veg chow with gravy. First they gave both egg chow with no gravy and then they exchanged for another tasteless veg chow that had "hairs" sprinkled on it. The strawberry shake was somewhat okay but the cold coffee was not worth speaking off. Never visit this place.
