Indeed a very good place for snack. There are many types of dishesh available. Go and have fun. It is little bit costly also. Has a seating arrangement.

It serves some good amount of quality stuffs. Behind Ramkrishna Mission, this is a very good place to keep your stomach cool without burning your pockets.
