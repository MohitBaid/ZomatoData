I recently visited the Tastes of India - the biggest food carnival in Kolkata and there only I came to know about Patchwork Orange and randomly I went towards this stall and saw there's amazing decoration and very nice packaging of the juices and the various deserts surved by Nisha Di, as I would like to say. I told her that I'm very tired because of the work that I did whole day and I want you to give me some juice which will freshen me up and will keep away the tiredness from me and she gave me some Rosemary juice... I don't actually remember the name but yes it did worked.!!

Thank you for serving us di... Our country needs such innovative and interesting homemade cooks.!!
 
Would love to visit many a times.!!

A close friend of mine suggested Patchwork to me at Tastes of India. They have a variety of juices and I chose Passion fruit Mint. It was a refreshing bit of coolness under a hot sun!

Feb 2017:

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

Patchwork Orange was one of the participants there.

Along with other savoury and desserts, this home chef had a wide selection of natural extract juices packed in lidded glass bottles, displayed neatly in a metallic tub containing big chunks of ice.

I opted for a bottle of Lavender Lemon. It was like a fine lemonade with a subtle hint of lavender. A slice of lime was inserted in the bottle to provide visual appeal and flavor of lime find. It tasted refreshing.
