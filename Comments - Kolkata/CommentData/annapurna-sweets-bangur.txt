Tried two different type of sweets from Annapurna Sweets, the one in Vangur. The sweets were tasty. The kaju barfi was a bit thinner than the normal size.

Annapurna Sweets serve vide variety of sweets and are very reasonable priced. I tried recently their malai chumchum, chocolate sandesh, rosogulla, few items of sandesh. All were good. Try it you shall like it.

This particular brand of sweet shops is quite close to my heart. Been seeing one of them near my school and another at Salt Lake Sector-III. This particular outlet lived up to the mark as well. Had hot samosas and Mishti Doi. Sumptuous, filling and tasty are what that could describe the offerings here.

If you are craving for pure Bengali sweets here is Annapurna sweets for you located at Bangur where there is few options for it.

Located near the bangur super market this place is a decent one to get some sweets specially their various sandesh. Also the Misti doi tastes very pure. I liked the singara as well which is purely Bengali one. A good option for sweet lovers.

Decent sweet shop. Though they have raised the price now. Come to Annapurna for the samosa/singara. It's the best that you'll ever eat. Really.......no one, no shop will ever make such tasty samosas. Try itðŸ˜Š
