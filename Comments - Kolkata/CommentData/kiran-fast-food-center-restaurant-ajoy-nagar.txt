Kiran is located just opposite to the Mukundapur Auto stand. They serve both Chinese and India dishes. From biryani to pulao to fried rice, they prepare everything ane they prepare it satisfactorily.
I usually take away from them, but they have seating arrangements inside, though not at all classy, just typical fast food centre type.
The chop items they prepare are pretty nice.
If you are at Mukundapur and want some food at low budget, Kiran is the place to go for.

It serves yummy momo's, egg tadka, fish chop, mughlai paratha, the almost lost delicacy of 'chop' is well revived in this outlet. The ever smiling face of the owner Mr. Swapan Saha is so welcoming. Though its basically a fast food joint whatever it serves is yummy.... All the best in the days ahead...

Basically it's good. It's a fast food center still you'll get Biriyani, Fried Rice and many more just like a restaurant..
If you have low budget and want some good foods yeah give it a try :D 
Tho it's not much fancy. Typically Indian Style and Indian flavour. 
Thanks 
Ohk bye .
