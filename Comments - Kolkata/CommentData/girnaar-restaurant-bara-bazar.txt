Yesterday i went with my sister to this restaurant to eat Dosa. The food which we have taken are Cottage cheese dosa & Girnaar Special dosa with Lime water. Taken 30 mins to bring the food & the drinks. We thought the food will be good bt we are dissapointed with the food as we could nt finish it.No taste & anything. The lime water was ok.
Gave 1 star for the staffs who are friendly. This is the first visit & probably my last visit to Girnaar.

Ambience: Soothing
Price: Average to Moderate. Indian dishes are priced average, while pizzato and Italian items are costly. Au Gratin is 170, the portion is very low. Paneer Matar and Dal Makhani is 160 each. We ate Roti, as the tandoor was closed at the hour.
Food: Awesome. Fantastic.
Quality: A1+.
Quantity: Italian and Pizzato are very low. Indian dishes are average to moderate.
Service: Don't want to comment much, as each order took more than 10 minutes to reach us, and by then the food grows cold. The first order took 25+ minutes, almost.
However, I must say the quality of food more than compensated for it.
4 people, 11 roti, 2 papad choora, 2 Dal Makhani, 1 Paneer Matar, 1 Raita, 1 Au Gratin, 1 Paratha, cost us 950+.
Total bill was 1165 with vat.
Taxes: They kill the most.

I will recommend anyone here. One of the best places to go. üòÄüôÇüòáü§ó

We went to this restaurant on 7th June, 2017. We were 12 people having dinner together.
Here I am going to rate the different aspects of this restaurant 

Service 4.7/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
Food 4/5
Cleanliness 4/5
Spice in food 5/5
Menu 4.7/5
Taste 4/5

I would suggest that you must order Chinese Chopsy as Starter, Kulcha and butter naan for main course, and girnaar special ice cream for dessert.

That ice cream is the best I have ever had. Although the dishes are a bit expensive but it's totally worth it.

Go for it guys, this one is an awesome restaurant for once in 2 months.

I'll be sharing a pic of the girnaar special ice cream..check it out

This vegeterian restuarant in barabazar is a vegetarian's delight! 

We ordered Butter nan,Vegetable Makhanwala and Kadhai Paneer.

Vegetable Makhanwala: This dish was delicious, with lots of butter as the very name suggets. In addition to all the regular vegetables they also used baby corn in this dish, which i liked. It had a tangy spicy taste. Awsome it was! ‚ù§

Kadhai Paneer: This dish lacked salt; this was the reason it lacked taste at first. Otherwise it was well prepared. The paneer pieces were soft!üòä

Butter nun was soft and had a good amount of butter! üòä

The prices were moderate with taxes though not reasonable! 

Girnaar is alright for one time visit for a non-vegetarian like me.

A casual and nice restaurant for laid back lunch or dinner with great staff and services!
The food is good here and not that heavy. It will keep you satisfied yet you will feel light! We loved the whole seating arrangements and they can accommodate many people at a go. 
We visited here on a thursday afternoon for lunch and was surprised to see it crowded already! 
We ordered a Veg Special Thali, Butter milk and Tandoori Roti.
Veg thali had everything in it with 3 varieties of veggies,  daal, rotis, pulao etc.
All the veggies in it was delicious and we loved the gulab jamun a lot!
Overall a customer friendly restaurant with good food at affordable prices!

P.S.- Would surely visit again to try out the other cuisines!

Good place for casual dinner or lunch. Will not hurt your pocket. But do not have very high expectation. However you can enjoy Saturday during end of month as it will not hit your pocket much and you will enjoy restaurant food.

This veg restaurant is located at Barrabazar. Since I am a veg food lover, I keep searching for various of the same genre.

Nice ambience with amicable staffs along with pocket friendly quality dishes.

Tried Cheese garlic naan , aloo paratha , malai Kofta , aloo dum and mixed raita. 

Paratha and naan were soft, malai Kofta was delicious , aloo dum was spicy and tangy , mixed raita was nice too.

A must visit for veg lovers.

I recommend it's Tandoori Alu with green chutney which is awesome and Yellow Dal Fry, Steam rice, Alu zeera, Mix vegetables, all are so tasty. This restaurant provides large variety of very good south indian foods, Italian pasta and Pizza and much more... Service is courteous, the quality of flour of Rotis should need to improve, finally If you are vegetarian food lover this restaurant never disappoint you..

Went here for lunch and tried a regular thali.

1. Ambiance is good. This place looks like every other restaurant only that decor was festive. Probably, Christmas and New Year were yet to wear off from this place.

2. The place was decent on cleanliness. I found the need to wipe the spoons and forks once, just in case.

3. The service was good. The staff was hospitable.

4. I tried regular thali and masala chai.
Regular thali was ordinary. The taste was average / good.
Masali chai was good though.

On the expensive side given the area, place and food.
