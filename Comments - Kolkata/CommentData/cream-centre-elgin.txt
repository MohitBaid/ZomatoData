The place is so pleasant. Soothing music. The staff is courteous. Also, the best part is puzzle paper as table mat with stationery in place. A must try in when in Kolkata. Also, for all the cricket fans, it relays live matches.

Went there for lunch with family. The main restaurant area was closed for a private party. The only available seating option was a 4 table, 20 seater outside portion. This does not work well for the overall ambience for dining. Anyway, as for the food we ordered for a Batata Chaat, Chhola Bhatura and a Paneer Kebab and Lahori sizzler each. 
The sizzlers were more like sabzi and rice on a sizzler platter. The Bhatura was too oily but the Chana was of decent taste. The Sev Batata chaat was far better. 
Overall, very average tasting food. 
But this does not warrant just a 1 star rating. The main reason for such poor rating is the indigestion that all of us faced after lunch. Not one but my entire family. We all suffered from major indigestion and stomach ache.
Probably it was stale paneer or something

Never going back again.

Very famous for it's sizzlers
A tasty fresh menu offering lots of items to choose from, apt service and decor, and decent clientele

We were two of us and enjoyed a lot over there.

Ordered the big nachos, the Italian sizzler, fresh like soda and sizzling sundae.

Have tried the Lonavala outlet before and knew that the sizzlers gonna be amazing 

Big nachos was the show stopper , really liked it as we tried it for the first time.
Sizzlers we're good and fresh lime soda was a regular drink as everywhere else.
Best part is the engaging games while the waiting period.. good mind behind this surely

An excellent place for vegetarian and specially if you looking for Jain food we ordered chola bhatura . Italian sizzler which was very good some paratha and cheese toast. Food was excellent but the place is bit noisy .if you are going for a kitty party like us do not miss to confirm discount they offer because we later realized it only on bill above 5000.  And if you are about to order sizzler do not order any soft drinks before  becos they have a drink free with it. Overall food experience was good. Happy eating.

Well I really wasnt sure about this place ....and now i realise one must not drop down to inference before trying .
A true beauty in every sense . The preparations and ofcourse the presentation is completely out of the box . 
The place is large and really classy . Those tender sofas and dim lighting adds to the style and decor of this place .
The food ofcourse has its own quality .
The idea to try local foods and present them in new flavours is what pushed me to try few more dishes .
  
A must visit for young people and dont miss the puchka ....the use of basil and other spices just takes it on a different level .

Although it was a bit difficult to locate the restaurant, it was worth all the effort as we indulged in the delicious veg cuisine. The ambiance was simple yet elegant which would definitely impress you as soon as you enter the place. Though it is quite a pinch in the pocket, its worth the money. You would literally transform into another world as the american cheese balls melt in your mouth. The nacho's come with a sauce that is capable of bringing out the glutton in you! I personally love their margarita which looks like a mountain in a glass with all the crushed ice. And it is something you would definitely relish. The sizzler are fabulous and would definitely blow your mind with both the quality and quantity. To end this beautiful food experience you should definitely try the chocolate sizzler. It will give you a foodgasm for sure! The bubbling chocolate sauce with the perfectly done brownie is the best blend with cold vanilla ice cream. If anything feels like paradise..it is this...it is this!

Visited almost after an year, and the food quality has pathetically degraded!! Had to leave right after the starters. Even the nachos weren't edible!! Mojito didn't even taste good! 
Wish to visit never again.

I personally love the interior!! Although the only drawback is the only-veg menu here. But nevertheless i would suggest chilli cheese toast, cheese pizza, arabiata and alfredo pasta and ofcourse the sizzling brownie!!

This kid has been around the block for quite sometime now, nevertheless one on my recent visits was the compelling agent behind this review. Pretty basic interiors much in the need of a revamp now. But the place is good resort for all those on the look out for pure veg restaurants. Frankly for me Cream Center has somehow just reduced to a go to place in between my shopping escapades. I always heart their chola bhaturas, sizzlers n brownies.

The place is very calm and has a great lighting effect for a family get-together or a nice romantic date. Soothing ambiance and comfortable atmosphere.

Order munchow soup (5.0) which was served at a good temperature for consumption. The portion for a one by two was good. Taste was very nice.

Nachos with cheese (3.0) - I personally did not like the way it was served. It is good to look at but then difficult to breat and eat. The veggies given also needed some mix of salsa and cheese. Although the idea to serve the veggies seperately was nice.

Chinese sizzler (3.5) - this is something one should try out. It is a very fine blend of a sizzler and a chinese dish. The spice is well controlled. Although I think some panner or veg munchorian should be served along with this and the veggies should be increased.

Panner ka baap (3.0) - I am not very sure if I have named the dish correctly or not, but it is a good sizzler to have. Not too fond of the green paste marination on panner was a negative part of for me. The dish is good but this wouldn't be my first choice even though this one is a chef special.

Sizzling brownie with ice cream (5.0) - this was a perfect end to a sizzled dinner. The cashew added tonit tasted amazing and this one is worth a taste.

I think which I did not like was that they had an offer of 15% of for a bill of over 4000 for those who had their anniversary. We were a 100 odd rupee short to the mark and also we were a regular customer but they simply refused to give the offer which was disappointing.

Overall the service was great and this place is worth a visit.

The best food joint for vegetarians! I have been to this place for several occasions and never have I been disappointed!
Ambience-
Wonderfully lit place with yellow lights and moderately spaced seating arrangements! 3 out of 4 times that I have visited this place ,I was made to sit beside Kitty parties that made the ambience so noisy...
Service- quick and the waitresses/waiters always serve with a smile!
Food-
I tried the following items from here on different occasions-
1)Sev batata Puri
2)Dahi papdi chaat
3)Bombay ragda
4)Mexican fajita sizzler
5)Aloo tikki sizzler
6)Chinese sizzler
7)Lime ice soda
I liked all their items apart from the lime ice soda as I have tasted better lime ice soda else where!
The Bombay ragda that is basically ragda patties is simply the best here!Out of all the sizzlers I liked the aloo tikki sizzler the best -the rice served with it is wonderfully flavoured and the aloo tikki super crispy! Recommended!Their chats are as good and won't disappoint you!
Prices are a little on the higher side considering this food joint serves only vegetarian delicacies but the taste,service and plating of dishes make up for it!
I would recommend this place to every vegetarian food lover!

I was really happy when Cream Centre had opened in Kolkata. It is a very old restaurant in Mumbai and I had visited this place there. The Cream Centre in Elgin road serves good food and the taste is similar to what you get in Mumbai. My favorite dishes are Nachos and Chhola Bhatura. This place is a boon for veggies like us in Kolkata.

I went there at the end of 2016 and ordered subz dum biryani, kali mirch mushroom and kulcha. The kulcha was not bad. The biryani was too spicy. The mushroom dish had less mushroom and more bright green peas. I had to search for the few mushrooms underneath the peas. The person who took the order gave a lame excuse that the amount of mushroom, in a dish which seemed  to be mainly about mushroom,was supposed to be minimum!!!

Went there last week with my family .Food was pathetic. Most hopeless Experience 

I am just writing about Few items,

¬†Corn and cheese balls- hopeless as if they must have been bought ready made frozen and just fried.

Big nachos- Hopeless, soggy  and so much costly . 

Ordered mexican sizzlers, which had the some rajma and butter rice and some odd vegetable and for that they charged a bomb. Panner tikka for 350/- .shame on the management to charge such prices.

¬†By the way the restaurant was almost empty . In all shall never go again .My suggestion to The Management of Cream Centre, Sir Please reduce the  cost of your dishes or you will Dis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

hi, went there for my moms birthday along with some cousins, have had a good experience in the past so thought of going there again, but this time the experience was pathetic!!!
Seems as though yr chef has changed, we ordered¬†

Corn and cheese balls- just fine as they must have been bought frozen and just fried.
Cheese chilli toast- taste was good, only better if bread sides could be cut and then served.
Ragda pattis- pattis hardly had any filling n was dark brown in colour, full of oil soaked into it, maybe quality of potato not good.
Big nachos- Yr refried beans(rajma) are totally sweet, seems as though just cooked in tomato sauce and ketchup,if ur serving nachos, should atleast give a good tomato salsa, sour cream, also a avacado dip(Thats optional) , yr cheese sauce on top hardly has any cheese, where"s the cheddar cheese???? If ur charging nearly 500 for this dish, u need to improve it !!!
¬†And ordered 2 mexican sizzlers, which had the same rajma and butter rice had no butter....i mean sizzlers are damn easy....u cant go so wrong with their taste....
¬†And also ordered sa po schzewan sizzler- well total disaster by the order taker and by the chef....no comments...

Not recommending this to anybody else...

You know how sometimes it happens in a bollywood movie.....an excellent trailer of a movie builds up the excitement....excellent star cast.....but when the movie is over you feel that boss this could have been a classic but what we have now is just so average......I had a similar feeling after my visit to this restaurant. Excellent menu and well prepared dishes but all of it is spoilt by there service boys. By the time the food reaches your table its cold....the naan has died a 100 deaths by the time the side dish gets served on your plate. The first thing that we were served on our dinner plate was naan and the side dish arrives a good 10 minutes later. The chefs of this restaurant must sue these guys who are spoiling their food because of their lackluster attitude towards serving the clients. The management really needs to hire a few efficient guys to manage the customers.

Cream centre is a pure vegetarian restaurant that has spread its wings in major cities of India with Kolkata being one of them.In kolkata they have two outlets with this being their first outlet.They are mainly known for serving fast food,Italian and mexican cuisines.Though they also have a section for north indian but there would be few who instead of trying their other cuisine would opt for north indian.

Service-The service at this place was quite fast and reliable.The saff was too cooperative and have been trained very well with the dishes served.

Ambiance-Being a family-restaurant the ambiance at this place was extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are very basic and the seating place have been divided into 2-3 sections.In terms of hygiene and cleanliness they always have been really particular which you will notice whenever you visit.

Food-Now coming to the main section,the food at this place was good but it was not worth the price they had quoted.Especially items like "Papdi chat" and "paneer tikka" costs 200 and 400 with taxes.The plating was also quite normal.We had-
1:Original Tandoori Panner Tikka
2:Sev Batata Puri
3:Spring Vegetable soup
4:Chef oriental special sizzler
5:Channa bhatura
6:Fruit Factory

Among them all were good in taste expect their "Original Tandoori Paneer Tikka" which was not satisfactory.

Cream center is located in the lane right opposite forum mall in elgin road, it is easy to locate and parking isn't a hassle here.¬†

Cream center is the perfect place for vegetarians and a lot of family members birthdays are spent here. The service is quick and the food is delicious, I'd list a few things which I really liked:

The big nachos - The nachos tasted amazing and the quantity is great too

Chole Bhature - Man those are some big bhatures! like really, be careful when ordering this

Paw Bhaji - The Paw bhaji is great, full of butter, but meh, who cares!

The sizzling brownie is great too and all the drinks are good, it's slightly expensive but the taste and quantity of food won't leave you complaining. Great stuff overall!

We always have a good time at Cream Centre though this time it wasn't the same. The world's best nachos is truly the best. Without a doubt. 
Their pizzas are delicious and tasty. Must order. Thin crispy and full of flavour. 
The biryani was awful. My uncle doesn't eat onion garlic and ordered a biryani for himself, it was tasteless and bland. Won't recommend it. 
Also the spaghetti in ariabiatta was sweet?!!! It tasted horrible. But the service was great.

I was the first diner that evening. What I like about this restaurant is its professional yet friendly approach. Beginning from the usher who offered me a seat to the steward who showed me to my table and helped me choose from the menu, they knew their duties well. As far as the food is concerned, one is spoilt ¬†for choice of vegetarian stuff. I took their Chinese sizzler which was very filling and tasty. I definitely want to go back to this restaurant to try other items. It is a vegetarian's paradise.

It was Mommy's birthday yesterday and after much fuss we decided to celebrate her birthday dinner at Cream centre.
I love the zillion lights welcoming us outside the restaurant.As we walked in the decor reminded me of the practical setup of several restaurant chains.Basic,practical,unimaginative and impersonal.
The staff however is very attentive and courteous.I would specially like to mention Shayani here who is all smiles and attended our table
We ordered Spring vegetable soup,Paneer ka baap sizzler,Subz dum Biryani,triple chocolate sundae & a Fruit factory.
The Spring vegetable soup was well done,high on taste and with that black pepper zing that prepares your pallete for the main course.That said soups are always better when loaded with shredded veggies,i missed that .
Paneer Ka Baap sizzler,true to its name it does look like the Big thing,around 5 Big cubes of Paneer marinated in red tomato sauce,mint chutney and sauteed,placed beautifully on a bed of fried rice tossed in soya sauce and fine crunchy veggies,potato
wedges on the side and grilled chunks of tomato onion & capsicum,It was cracking hot and served to us promptly so that we enjoyed it while it was still hot! We asked for mint-yoghurt chutney on the side which was then served promptly.It was good but could be a lot better,all they need to do is zing up the mint and tomato marinades for paneer,Yes it was slightly low on tang but overall it was a delight.
The subz dum Biryani was cooked to perfection and served with raita ,onions and pickle.
We washed down the dinner with ice creams which were absolutely satisfactory.
Overall a good time at Cream centre!

A nice place for vegetarian food in the center of Kolkata. ¬† We loved the sizzlers, cheeseballs and of course their Big Nachos. ¬†The channa batura deserves special mention as it tasted totally out of the world. ¬†The pricing is a bit steep which is a bit of a deterrent. ¬†Apart from that the ambience is great and so is the service.

A nice place for vegetarian food in the center of Kolkata. ¬† We loved the sizzlers, cheeseballs and of course their Big Nachos. ¬†The channa batura deserves special mention as it tasted totally out of the world. ¬†The pricing is a bit steep which is a bit of a deterrent. ¬†Apart from that the ambience is great and so is the service.

Nachos are amazing. Ambience is good. Rest food is good but nachos always steal the show. Pricing is as per the food quality. Good to go with friends.

Cream Centre has always been a family restaurant since many years. Their ambiance is quite decent and their staff is well mannered and trained. 
when i went i saw waiting are going on, but that young manager politely said give some moment and one table arrange for us. i didn't expect that kind of hospitality from other restaurant.¬†

Coming to the food, we ordered american cheese ball & paneer baap ka sizzler. Oh My God!! It was simply Heaven, especially paneer baap ka sizzler. paneer was soft and yes not to forget, the green chutney served along with it, I still have that taste in my mouth, I dont think I have ever had such a delectable food ever in my life!! 

Kudos to the Team of Cream Centre, may you flourish more and more!!

It was a pleasant experience visiting cream centre after 3 years. Except for the menu design makeover nothing much has changed. The cuisine ranges from Italian, Mexican to North Indian.

Ambience : Spacious and illuminated. There is nothing much to boast about the ambience. 

Service : The service is excellent and the waiters are courteous and friendly. The average food waiting time is also quick. 

Menu : Even after 3 years nothing much has changed in the menu. The menu is limited and considering the fact its a pure veg restaurant,  I am not surprised. 

Food : The Big Nachos is a must try and we werent disappointed although the salsa sauce was extra sweet. Then we ordered the American cheese balls and Chilli Cheese Toast. They were quite decent. The 'Paneer ka Baap' sizzler is awesome. Sizzler has always been a personal favourite and Kolkata doesnt have a place where they serve amazing sizzlers. So this was surprising because I have had sizzlers in far more famous places then Cream Centre. An underdog and a must try! For the main course we ordered masala kulcha and dal makhani. Well, I have had better Indian food on roadside dhabas. The kulcha was thick and half baked. It was pretty average. For drinks we ordered Peach Iced Tea which initally tasted very good was too sweet for my taste buds.

Price : The price will pinch your pockets. For guys trying to impress their girls, give this a miss. 

Definitely coming again for the sizzler and the nachos.

I have heard so much about this place that instead of being a die-hard vegetarian I had to pay a visit to this place for the sake of Big Nachos. And they didn't let me down, though I would rather not prefer the salad with my Nachos but I am not complaining. I tried out Enchiladas and I must say that I should not be judging it as I am not a big fan. The Chili Toast with herbs were good and cheesy enough. The only thing I didn't like is the Sizzler where the Spaghetti was too tomato-ey! Other than this service is good, and they have an interesting table mats which will keep you engrossed till the time your food is served.

Have been to this place a number of times. One of the few vegetarian restaurants in kolkata that has been consistently good for all these years. Spacious and well illuminated, this one. Staff and service is spot on. This joint doesn't boast a very diversified food menu. I love its big nachos, they are to die for. Be it Italian or north indian, both cuisines are perfect. Try it's chana bhatura, they are real good.

LOCATION : 4.5  
Located just near forum, a perfect location 

AMBIENCE : 4.0 
The place is amazing .
Interiors perfect. The staffs were cordial.

FOOD : 
1) AMERICAN CHEESE CORN BALLS:
The taste was very good and the flavour of corn & cheese bursted as soon as I had it.
A MUST TRY FOR CHEESE LOVERS

2) CHILLI CHEESE TOAST:
 I have  had this dish earlier when I had visited earlier but this time the bread was overbaked and burnt which ruined the taste.

3) GRILLED VEGETABLE AND HERB PIZZA : 
*A MUST TRY FOR EVERYONE*
The smoky taste of the grilled veggies were amazing. The crust was crispy and hence overall very well prepared. Well done!!

4) SIZZLING BROWNIE : *A MUST TRY FOR EVERYONE* . VERY AMAZING . THE CHOCOLATE SAUCE WAS HEAVENLY AND THE BROWNIE WAS SOFT 
   * JUST AMAZING !!!!!!*

I had a terrible experience yesterday while placing an order for home delivery. I wanted to place an order for bhatura which is actually the baked kulcha they used to serve earlier. On confirming with the staff whether they still serve the baked version, the staff confirmed that they only serve the baked version and none other. Hence placed order for 4 baked bhatura's along with other dishes. On receiving the order, it was the fried bhatura rather than the baked one which i had ordered for. On calling them back, the person answering the call said they only have the fried one and excused himself easily saying that he had not taken the order and that the order was taken by a new staff. So I had asked them to replace it with Naan since they do not serve the baked version anymore which I actually had ordered for. But when I received the delivery again, the 4 bhaturas was replaced with a single Naan and no balance refunded for the rest. Again, frustrated called them back and the same person answered the call and this time being extremely rude and said that I should have said that I had ordered for 4 bhaturas, its not his duty to find this out. The staff started shouting and said that he had not taken the order and was not bothered and all this while I kept my cool with him. When I asked my balance to be refunded, he said that he would not do this and send the remaining Naan, which would have reached at about 11pm, approx 3 hrs since the time i had placed my first order. On asking the call to be transferred to the manager, he said that the manager will call back in 5 mins. There was no call from the manager, I ultimately called half an hour later and this time not keeping my cool asked for the refund and complained about the behaviour of the staff to which the manager seemed to pay no heed.¬†
The owner of the restaurant should look into this matter and train their staff who understand nothing about hospitality and the lack of proper knowledge on the menu the restaurant is serving.
Also, I have not received the refund as of yet, as promised in the first half itself. ¬†
I would never look placing an order with them again and will personally suggest to check before placing an order to them.¬†
Such an atrocious behavior from the restaurant is just not expected.

After seeing the reviews, I was expecting the place to be awesome. I went there for Sunday dinner and ordered
1. American cheese corn balls for starters
2. Italian baked sizzler
3. Brownie with ice-cream with fudge sauce

Didn't like the cheese balls much. My wife would make better cheese balls any day. It was served cold initially had to get it changed
Sizzler was nice. 
But dessert was very bad. The ice-cream used was of bad quality and was tasteless.
Would not recommend.

Situated in heart of kolkata near Elgin Road (Allenby lane). We visited to celebrate something special for my brother... we ordered Cheese chilli toast -which was nice, cheese ball- was loved by all, paneer tikka not up to the mark...very blend. For main course we ordered Tandoori Aloo Rahara- nice full of flavours & Dal Makhani- ok types... nothing great and breads lacha parantha, garlic naan & stuffed kulcha, now the kulcha came with charcoal too which was served in my kiddos plate... so the manager was called, he politely accepted his mistake & said he would take care, all the while my bro was making video of the conversation, we asked a written sorry letter and he said he can't write that because that can be forwarded and restaurant may SHUT DOWN. 
Since, we were there to celebrate we didn't wanted to spoil our mood further and left it midway pointing to take care in future. He served us a Brownie Sizzler as apology. 
Overall average experience.. the interiors are regular and nothing fancy... average service & seemed overpriced in comparison of taste.

There is absolutely no denying to the fact that Cream Centre has earned a lot of fame in Calcutta, thanks to delicious food & amazing hospitality.
I have been a frequent visitor to this restro. But The last visit was something I'd like to erase from my memory.
Staff Behaviour wasn't good (which is quite unexpected from a restro of their stature). And Service wasn't as quick as It used to be, around a year ago.

For starters, we had ordered chilli cheese toast, Nachos & a beverage (Can't recall the name) !

Chilli cheese toast came with Under-fried chips. Nachos were great. In a rush to get the main course stuffs over table, the waiter almost snatched the glass of beverage from a young member of my family. Of course, We didn't feel like making an issue out of this. But We did inform the management about this in a bid to help them improve their degrading services.

I hope the management will take a note of this feedback and take constructive steps to improve their services in future !

Personal favorites are Italian sizzlers, aloo methinks paratha, world best nachos, double baked pasta, triple chocolate sundae are a few..

We entered this place on a not so busy day . The decor was simple and elegant like a fine dining joint . Presentation wise they should change uniform of their waiters who look more like house keeping . Coming it the menu i ordered for a big nachos which is my all time favourite since i first had them in mumbai , fries platter and half and half pizza . 

The nachos were absolutely delicious , the fries platter were however a disappointment. Onion rings were too much soaked in oil , chilly cheese toast lacked  chillies and corn balls were a disaster as they were single coated batter fried maybe the crumbs had gone moist .
The pizza was good not exceptional though . Overall will obviously visit again but not order the fries platter

Chhole bhature and nachos are the must haves here. Also sunset drive (slush) is excellent. Sizzlers aren't that great. However, the Brownie sizzler is an exception, being the best dessert available. Really classy ambience with extremely courteous staff. No options for non vegetarians as it's an all veg restaurant.

To start with, I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. If you're going there for the first time,this review can help you ensure that you come out contented from the restaurant.

WHAT TO ORDER:
1)Bombaiya Ragada:- They are to die for.
2)The  world's best nachos:- a fitting name.
3)The drinks:- The glasses were taller than me! And oh so slurpalicious! The ones I ordered were Orange Blossom Soda and Lemon Iced Tea ,the latter of which I wouldn't order again. Since strawberries are in season,strawberry iced tea might be a better choice. But the Orange Blossom Soda is spectacular!
4) Thin-crust pizzas:- Absolutely ideal if you're looking for  something that hits that sweet spot between light and heavy food.
5)American Corn Cheese Balls:- Need I say more? Corn and cheese is a winner any day.

WHAT NOT TO ORDER:
I'll make this brief because I get nauseated whenever I talk about the supposedly famous 'sizzlers'. Italian or any cuisine, we've tried and hated them all. They are the perfect example of inedible food. Rather than a 'sizzling' performance, it disappoints greatly. 

CONCLUSION:Almost anything from here will leave you satisfied but steer clear from the sizzlers for an untainted experience.

Ordered in dinner tonight. 
4 out of 5 dinners ended up with stomach upset along with flatulence and acidity.  The 5th dinner was the only one who had not had  the nachoes and the enchiladas....both of which contained kidney beans in sauce.
Highly inadvisable to have good from here. 
The sauce was also extremely sweet as if a dollop of sugar had been added.

The world's best nachos are the world's best nachos. The service is so quick you won't even realise. Good natured staff. Coming to the onion rings - chola bhatora- and the the three in one pasta- they are exclusive. The chilli cheese toasty is also fair on it's part. If you visit and do not order a nachos- the visit is a waste.

Cream centre, I believe is more popular in other cities and that is because it's probably better in other cities. The kolkata outlet has decent ambiance and good variety of food. It's a good family restaurant but the food is average to good. The chana bhatura and other specialities are good but the sizzlers and other items are just about average. The hot/cold coffee is pathetic! ¬†But the yoda soda deserves a special mention. Barring the managers, don't expect good service from other staff members. Also overpriced for the kind of food it serves.

Having heard some great reviews of the place, I really wanted to try it out but was bit let down and din't quite find it so value for money.

Located in allenby road, cream centre has a top notch location. The decor was mediocre and ambiance too casual. The music was too loud and messed up for a family dinner. The staff service was prompt. I felt restaurant is too rigid with their menu and I missed few items in the menu especially more option in soups.

Coming to food, I thought it was about average. Cheese balls and French fries were decent. Corn soup was okkayish. Chana bhatura seemed overrated to me. However naan and teekha subzero handi were excellent followed by an average pulao.

Overall, in my opinion the place is just about ok for a casual dine in although I feel at this price point, there are much better options nearby !!

Located in the lane right in front of forum, Elgin road, the place needs no navigation to be located. The entrance of this restaurant is so small that it's deceitful. It's only when you enter you realise how big the restaurant is. It has a seating capacity of 150+. The ambiance is so nice, nice music in the background, very courteous and well trained staff. Had heard a lot about its food and so was very excited to try dishes even on a full stomach. What we ordered:
1. Their popular big nachos( picture attached)- We fell in love with the dish the moment we saw it. So beautifully presented, the nachos were hand made, warm, wafer thin and super crisp. The nachos were dripping liquid cheese which was epic to see. As far as the nachos and cheese are concerned, the dish scored. Only if they could have dealt with the refried beans better, like it had a huge scope for improvement, when you taste the sauted beans and vegetables, you won't even realize you are having a Mexican delicacy. It tasted very Indian. The salsa served with it was horrible. Extremely sweet, not spicy at all..a good salsa should have the flavour of jalape√±os, and it certainly didn't, in fact they use 'Real' tomato juice in it. Overall, il still give the dish a 4 for its presentation and the nachos and cheese ( You'll know what iam talking about when you see the picture).
2. After reading their menu I realised chole bhature was their speciality. It was exorbitantly priced and weirdly too. They charge you separately for the chole(189/- approx) and the bhatura (89). For a person like me, who has eaten chole bhature from every place in Amritsar, its hard to be impressed by the dish specially after seeing the price. The chole were pretty nice. Superply cooked, extremely tender( each and every piece), tempered with ghee, but very mildly flavoured and not spicy at all. It was good inspite of the mild flavour. However, I've had better chole than that. The bhatura was not good...tasted a lil bitter. 
It's almost unfair to review a restaurant on the basis of just two dishes. The next time il try more dishes and write another review.
Overall, do go with your family, dig a hole in your pocket, have a nice dining experience.
P.s: this review is entirely unbiassed, based on my personal experience!

A complete wow experience is all I can say about this restaurant. I visited this restaurant a day back and being a non vegetarian I was pretty sceptical about spending so much on a vegetarian restaurant but I got awestruck with the overall experience at this restaurant. I would start with the decor and ambience of this restaurant which I would like to give 5 on 5. The service personnel were extremely cordial and sober. Last but not the least I'll talk  about the  food so we ordered a big nachos and a sizzler, the nachos were actually too much for 2 people as it can easily be served to 4 people it was so much in portion but the sizzler was not that great and i would not suggest anyone to have the sizzlers. Though I didn't try the mocktails and the desert but it really looked yum. So I would like to recommend all the  non vegetarians who want a change to their taste bud to visit this place. Only thing to keep in mind is that this is not a pocket friendly restaurant but a proper fine dining restaurant so 1k is the minimum bill that you can expect for a couple.. 
Happy hogging..

It is one of the best restaurant  to have good vegetarian food in bhawanipur ! It is located in Allenby road  near forum , perfect place for perfect dinner ! I visited this place many times and tried their best dishes like chola bhature , american cheese balls, Italian sizzler, white sauce pasta and their best dish ever 'world's best nachos'üòã beginning from their location to ambience to food i would say this place won't let you disappointed in any manner ! However now talking about their service which is pretty good ! Although the place is quite pocket pinch but the food and the soothing ambience will make your money worth ! *Thumbs up* üëçüèª

I had first played guest to this brand of restaurant in Patna & the lip-smacking taste along with the lavish decor & service compelled me to pay a visit at its Kolkata branch, near forum mall. It served me with the same level of ambiance & service but the food wasn't like I had had in it's other branch, though it was good. Tried the #VegSpringSoup, #HaryaliPaneerTikka, #CholaBhatura & #Sizzler and all tasted fine. This veg restaurant boasts of trademark over its various dishes & at the time of my first visit, I was surprised to see that that the presentation of the dishes served exactly matched with the menu pictures; which is a tuff job to maintain. All in all a good fine dine veg restaurant.

It was a wonderful lunch at Cream Centre with a group of friends. It was a week day so the place wasn't that crowded and the staff went about their work efficiently and deligently. Unlike an earlier visit when they had been frazzled coz place was overcrowded and we had been kept waiting for a long time. The food, whatever we had was excellent. The soups were very satisfying...I had the spring vegetable soup and loved the crunch of vegetables and the surprising twist of "chenna" in tthe soup. Others had sweet corn soup which was ok. The Big Nachos is one of their specialities and it wad totally justified and yummy. We all loved it. The sizzler that we had was a bit disappointing. We had baap of paneer should have had either Italian or Chinese one. The Dum Biriyani was full of flavour...all liked it. The Chana Batura was also good...the giant sized batura making our eyes pop. The chana was very tasty with the right blend of spices. Overall fully satisfying and tasty food worth the expense.

The Intalian and the Mexican food are great to taste, and the ambience is a soothing one. It's one of the good place for vegetarians to visit in town.

The chola Bhatura was very good... But the spoiler was the manager of the place.. He was behaving as if he was doing a favour giving a seat to the people.. I happened to ask him to call the person who had taken our order..to which his reply was 'Abhi koi khali nahi.. Dekhte hai.. ' 
Would never go back to this place for such service...

The last I visited this place was months back so I'm not sure how much this place might have changed
Famous for only one thing-the world's best nachos-that's their claim and I absolutely agree to that, intact I go to that place just for their nachos
Regarding other dishes-they are good but not very good-desserts are tasty though!
Price is also fine though I find Bombay shiv Sagar serving better food at the same or even lower price
That's all I had to say, if I visit the place again I will definitely update my review to show how it might have changed.

This is my first visit to this pure vegetarian multi cuisine restaurant situated near Elgin Road Fouram Mall , earlier I had visited its Patna's outlet located at Exhibition Road for lunch and it was the magic of their food which bring me back . Each outlet are lavishly decorated ambiance. I would say that this the only restaurant which present dishes as the same manner as displayed (colour & decoration) in their menu card, which is really a hard job to mention. I have tried their (Kolkatta's outlet ) Spring veg soup, Chana bhatora and Hariyali Paneer Tikka which are delicious . This restaurant has gott copyright for its chana bhatora receipe. I'm not satisfied with the quality of flour they used for the Tandoori rotis. Staff are trained, courteous, service is good, You can visit this restaurant for delicious snacks like chana bhatora, pasta, Mexican food, sizzlers, sandwiches etc.

Four of us after shopping at Forum stepped in at 4 pm for a quick bite..Ordered the signature chhola bhatura, the Big Nachos and lemon ice tea..extremely filling and yummy.The nachos was dripping in the sinful cheese sauce and lying beneath was herbed bell peppers veggies and refried beans.
The bhatura which came accompanied with black chola vinegar onions and pickles was a tad bit oily but as huge as a kids globe!
The ice tea was refreshing and large enough to give company to the whole meal.

Pocket pinch was 600 for above.It is a delight for vegetarians here in Kolkata yet when you compare to the  Mumbai outlet ,this outlet lags behind in terms of taste presentation and service.

Yet I shall visit again for I don't think anyone else in Kolkata does better chhola bhatura!

Had dinner at this restaurant recently. The location is very convenient(just opposite forum mall). Its a blessing for vegetarians. Especially the jain food option is very rare to find in restaurants these days. The place looks good when not full, but the so many tables in so less place makes it a noisy affair when full. The lack of distance between tables only adds to the problem. 
The food is amazing. Though priced a little high, its bearable comparing the taste and quality. They have a very catchy menu with pictures of food items, nachos being the speciality. The staff is courteous and service prompt.
On the whole, a good dining experience, but not a quiet and peaceful one if visited on weekends and holidays.

This is a pure vegetarian restaurant situated in Allenby Road , a perfect place to visit with family and friends. The service is great and the ambience is also nice.
I have visited this place many times and have tried many of its dishes. Now coming to the food -
1) The white Sauce pasta is great.
2) The Nachos - Big Nachos is presented very nicely in a pyramid form and is very nice. Frankly speaking I find it better than the world's best nachos which is also nice.
3) All in one - is a platter consisting of French fries , onion rings , cheese toast and cheese balls.
I found it very average and would not recommend it to anyone.
4) Their Pizzas are also good.
5) Their American cheese Balls is very good.
6)Have tried their Italian sizzler which I found quite average.
7) Their North Indian food is also quite good.
8) The quantity of chola bathura is good and it tastes good as well.
9)Their Peach Apricot Drink is a kind of a slush and is quite good. This cool drink is perfect for summer. The kids also love it.
10) Their Brownie Sizzler is a must try. Its simply amazing .
They also keep hosting various food festivals like sizzler and biryani festivals which the foodies might find interesting.
In short one cannot go wrong with this place.

Too much crowded on weekends. Ambience is great. Spacious joint. We had ordered pink strawberry soda, world's best Nachos( was not at all worth, better to order with Mexican beans), Italian baked sizzler, American cheese balls( yummy), Veg sweetcorn soup. Food was delicious. Only Nachos was not at all good. Some items in the menu they didn't have to serve.

This place serves the BEST nachos. 
I literally swoon at the sight of their nachos. The Indian dishes taste quite good and also pocket friendly. The continental ones being their forte are a bit overpriced, a tad bit, but it's worth the momey. 
They have a beverage called blush on ice. Which is basically a very tasty form of ice. It's not possible for one person to finish it, without severe headache, but it's delicious to taste. 
They often have biriyani festivals and such others which are worth a visit. I recommend this place for casual dinners.
P.s- they also do home delivery. That's a huge add on!!

Starters are good to eat... But when it comes to the main course department ... It was disgustng... The tandoori roti we had ordered was simply ghar ka tawa paratha...the paner sabji had only gravy n 4 small size of paneer... The most humurous part was the finger bowl in which the water level was so low that only the tip of the nails could be put in...

I was searching for a good dine in restaurant on zomato where i stumbled upon cream centre. I have been past this place like a million times but never bothered to step inside, for i thought this place to be pretty small.
Come Sunday and all the impression i was under regarding cream centre was shattered.
I was, to be brutally honest, taken aback by the size of the restaurant. I didnt knew it was that spacious on the inside. 
Decor:: the place is appropriately lit on the inside. The decors and colors used are soothing to one's eye. It gives a kind of calmness. 
Food:: The menu is appropriate for vegans and i feel it is adequate enough. Prices, given the year, are decent for a dine in. One bread that i had ordered didnt quite like was 'Lacha Parantha'. It tasted like a normal roti. 
Not to miss:- 1) Lahori Sizzler, 2) Cheese toast, 3) paneer tikka masala. 
Restaurant :: Quite spacious for the entrance it has. PS- Dont judge a restuarant by it's entrance üòÇüòÇ. Waiters were very well trained. Manager was good. Everything was proper,  besides the food being served pretty quickly. 
Verdict :: i had a wrong notion about this place before visiting the same and i'm glad that i visited this place, to only shatter my notions. I kind of loved this place. Would definitely visit this place again. Perfect for a small group for lunch and dinner. 4/5.

Cream Centre is truly a vegetarians delight! Arguably the best pure veg restaurant in town. Located conveniently at Elgin Road, this place offers cuisines like Italian, Mexican and North Indian. The staff is courteous and the ambience is nice. You can hear soft music being played over the speakers making the feel all the more pleasant. I went with my family of 4 on a lazy Sunday afternoon. We ordered 'worlds best' nachos, italian baked sizzler, all in one pasta and channa bhature. For beverages we had blush on ice and lime ice soda. World's best nachos definitely lives upto its name! Its a strict no-no if you're diet conscious but if you don't mind putting on a few extra pounds those nachos are worth it! The sizzler also was great and the Channa bhature with a bhatura as big as a football was equally good. The beverages were lip smacking as well. This is one restaurant that even hardcore non-veggies won't mind ditching their chicken and fish for the green pastures. Its always wonderful eating at Cream Center.

The ambience is good. The menu offers so many choices that it gets confusing on deciding what to order. I liked most of the dishes I ordered. You should try the Nacho's as I found that it was the best.

The only problem with this place is the service which may not be good at times.

Best place for vegetarians! Ambience is good. Food is delicious. Worlds best nachos is amazing and highly recommended! Pasta n pasta and all in one pasta are really good. Even the paneer tikka is okay, but there are places which serve better. Chhola bhatura is one of the best Ive ever had.. and the north indian food is amazing. Drinks are decent too.. overall an amazing place :)

Mumbai's famous and favorite dining definitely also Kolkata's favourite now. Cheese corn balls, BIGGG NACHOS and Chola bhaturas are must haves. Sizzlers, Panner platters and capsicum rings are wonderful picks. JAIN FOOD AVAILABLE. 
Service is a little slow, so must improve there to get full rating.
Suggest all to visit. Value for every penny spent.
Shall be visiting regularly.

I visited cream centre first in Mumbai.Its one of the best places for vegetarians.
Coming to the Kolkata branch,the taste and quality is same as the Mumbai branch.
Have American corn cheese balls, worlds best nachos, paneer ka baap sizzler , subz biryani and sizzling brownie with ice cream.
Most of the other items are also good.
Would recommend this without qualm.

I tried out Cream Center over the weekend. They are apparently pretty popular and highly rated. We ordered the methi aloo paratha and the nachos. The paratha was pretty good but the nachos were a Indian fusion version which I didn't like much. Also the service was a bit slow. The guys on the table next to us were also complaining of slow service and it was a lazy afternoon with not many guests. I might go in again for their signature chole bhatura.
Seems like a decent option specially for pure very folks.

Have heard often about this place..so went today with some of my friends..tried their starters only..it was satisfactory!
Their big nachos is a must..also ordered their All in one(starter platter), but due to waiter inexperience for serving it along with nachos, it got cold and so taste wasn't upto the mark..
Sizzlers were too good, especially pasta therein..
Overall, having a mouthful experience, I would think of giving it another shot for their tempting looking North Indian..

Cream centre is a place which offers a lot of variety! Located at Elgin it's always a convinience to be there! And with different cuisines one can satisfy his desire for any kinda good food !
A must order is the big nachos! Enchiladas are good..I loved their all in one pasta in penne!
American corn cheese balls were nicely made! 
Delhi parathas served with curd n pickles was good.. But they could be better! Not the perfect kinda parathas we love from delhi..
the sizzling brownie with vanilla was perfect! N they make good mocktails! Service is ok...pocket pinch is approximately 600 per head ..

I went to this restaurant on a Sunday lunch outing with 5 friends. We got a table easily as the restaurant was almost empty when we entered.
For starters we ordered both the types of paneer Tikka on the menu and corn cheese balls. Both the paneer tikkas and the cheese balls were prepared flawlessly. For the main we ordered the big nachos, cheese macaroni and sizzler. The nachos was big enough for all 6 of us to share and was tasty enough to get over in minutes. The cheese macaroni was very cheesy but if you don't like cheese so much I will recommend you not to order the dish. The sizzler looked stunning and the potatos were the best part.
The signature drink here are the ice sodas and size is worth the money for the drinks and the dishes as well. The staff were also helpful in suggesting dishes they make best.
Really enjoyed the food.

Its been a while since we ordered something except the regular Pizza Hut/KFC / Dominos at our office. As my current work schedule doesn't permit going out ordering outs have been the latest trend. I on behalf of my colleagues have ordered more than 3-4 times in the past month. Food quality is impeccable. There is no room for compromise. Packaging is brilliant and way above the normal standards you would expect. I was so happy to look at the Matt finish boxes of our food. Although one minor hiccup was the time it took to open the seal on a lot of food boxes which I'm sure is because spillovers can be totally kept out of question. We ordered a range of food from North Indian to continental. The "Paneer ka Baap" should not be give a miss. Also an assorted Veg platter (can't seem to recall the name) was really good. As while eating at such feasts my focus is on starters and desserts, for a change I even tried the main course which was really amazing.

Their tagline is 'the veg edge' and there is one to their food definitely in terms of the way it is prepared and presented. (However, the staff can do with being more courteous and providing better service.)

To tell you the truth I have been to Cream Centre before,had quite liked the ice cream sodas which are served in monstrously big glasses, the Original Chole Bhature tasted exemplary and the best in them was the chole, to be honest I have never had such awesomeness in chole before. 

I also have tried the american corn cheese balls which me and my partner just love as they are so crunchy from the outside but so delicate and delicious from within.

The sizzlers,yes now let's talk about the sizzlers, the first time I went there I had the Italian sizzler with noodles and cheese potatoes served in a sizzling hot plate. I remember my taste buds reaching heaven and back post the food was done with.

I would be remiss if I did not mention what happened today when I went there to stir my foodie cells (also reason for my poor rating).

I ordered Bombay Ragda which was great to taste with authentic ragda and amazing aloo tikkis.

Post this I ordered the sweet lassi and let me tell you what a disaster that was, it was not prepared to perfection and was extremely thick and sour which when I returned came back with almost the same sourness but a bit less.

Then came the Paneer ka baap sizzler, I had really thought it would be good to taste however I do not think it meets the list of other amazing sizzlers this place has even halfway.

All in all I guess a bad day in a good joint. Remember not to forget making the right choices.

I am truly trying to forget today's experience and visit there again to see if they change my mind.

Organised my Anniversary in Cream Centre one week back. Food was simply delicious.  Best thing is that they serve north Indian, Pizza snd some amazing sizzlers as well as chola batura. This is very rare.  Only thing they need to improve is service since we went on Sunday and lot of crowd and they were short of staff and so service suffered.  Rest every thing was just right

I come here with my aunt, as vegetarian places with decent food are hard to come by. The food here reminds her of her days back in Mumbai, so it also has a slight sentimental value. 
Today we ordered dahi batata puri to start off with. the staff were quick with the order, as it reached us quickly. The batata puri was really good. It had a potato filling, and various sauces and chutneys flavored it. After that we ordered Chana Bhatura, which also reached us quickly. Both the chana and the bhatura were delicious, albeit a little greasy. 
Overall, the ambience and the food served to give me a great impression of the place. A must visit if you're vegetarian, or just want to have some good Indian food.

It's again a delay in review...¬†
By now every one this place and its specialty... For me its an over hyped place... ¬†Since its walking distance from my house and my parents eat at only veg places, we are left with no options if we do not want to travel anywhere...¬†

As far as the look is concerned, its same everywhere all over India.. They have puzzle @ tables so that one can be busy till the time food is being served...¬†

On 16.12.2014 - it was my dad's birthday and he wanted to visit the place.. So we went..

Ordered¬†

Nachos with Baked Beans - When they served it, the cheese was already spread with beans on the top... ¬†It was ok in taste but little heavy

Italian Cheese Chilli Toast - 8 pieces is being served with Tomato Ketchup... It was ok in taste.. Nothing different from what is being served @ other places

Channa Bhatura - One piece of Bhatura - which we told them to cut into four pieces and Black Channa / Chole was served... Its nothing appealing and unusual as people make it.. Not worth the price they charged

Mexican Fazita Sizzler - It was nice with one tikki and rice was served....

Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream - It was nice but the it becomes quite thick and stretchy once it cools down...¬†

One Fresh Soda Mix was ordered too - Taste same everywhere

All food ordered was Jain and total bill inclusive of Taxes was Rs 1700 (rounded off)

I have eaten @ their places in Mumbai, Pune and Lonavala - the craziness is same everywhere..¬†

Please make reservation before going to the place on weekends.. There's a long queue on weekends...

Have been here quite a few times. It is a family place. 
The food is not bad but not too good either. What makes it worse is the price. It is very steeply priced for the food we get. 
The hyped chhola bhatura was very ordinary and the nachos are just too heavy. The portions here are very big so if you are just 2-3 people you will have a tough time finishing it. The pastas are okay,nothing great. Sizzling brownie was a disappointment as the chocolate sauce becomes stretchy as soon as it begins to cool down.

Arguably the best restaurant for vegetarians in Kolkata! Cream centre has a lot to boast about. A pure veg restaurant is not very frequently seen in Kolkata. Recently however, specially in and around Elgin Road, quite a few such places have cropped up serving authentic vegetarian food ranging from North Indian to Italian. 

Cream centre offers a delectable range of dishes covering several cuisines like Continental, Italian, Mexican and Indian. I have tried their cheese balls, the Big Nachos, onion rings, chola batura, sizzlers...the list goes on. I quite enjoyed their refreshingly bright, colourful and mocktails (especially the orange blossom and pi√±a colada). On my first visit, our long list of orders, made heads on other tables turn. The server graced our table with a football sized batura, served with chole, garnished with coriander which tasted better with some lime sprinkled over it. 

The Gluttons pick would be : Nachos, Onion Rings (because of the crispy outer layer) , Dal makhni /Paneer Makhni and chole bature. 

Verdict: Truly, if it can make a carnivore like me forget non vegetarian for a while, this place is bound to make you fall in love with it's food. Must give them a chance to serve you.

I have been to cream centre couple of times. Their quality, quantity & taste is something which makes me go back again all the time. Their serving size is good enough for 3 people. Yesterday I got food home delivered but it was a big disappointment. I ordered soup, papdi chaat & chilly paneer sizzler. Paid about 800/- & all I get is 5 pcs of small papdi with a cup of dahi, soup, rice & chilli paneer. The quantity was so little that only one person could eat. I have had chilly paneer sizzler in their outlet which is extremely elaborate with veggies & other accompaniments. They aren't maintaining their portion sizes & quality of food also.

Have you ever complained about the lack of variety among vegetarian sizzlers? Are you tired of the regular mundane vegetarian food? Tired of Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizzas?

Then this is a place to be.

If you are ordering sizzlers, pastas or pizzas, you will get your money's worth.
If you are ordering chaats... Wow! Really? You go to a street food hub of the city and have street food not from the street? You deserve a medal!

Pro
Nice vegetarian restaurant with Jain preparation availabilities too.

Con
Price is a bit too steep, for low prep items as well.

Special Attraction - Sizzler

PS - If you are a college student saving up on money, unless you are willing to sell your kidney, this is not a place to visit.

It was a fateful and a very warm encounter with cream centre which occurred om the afternoon of the 1st of October. The place has a good ambience but be advised, it's a good place to go to, but only with your family. Food is great, though i didn't try out a lot of dishes. Fresh lime is the best that i have ever tasted. DO NOT EVER ORDER ONION RINGS AS STARTERS. That's what ruined the day . quantity is great too. Had one and a half bhaturas and that filled me up for the rest of the day . Will definitely go back.

As I went on my birthday with friends so we basically ordered every type of thing except Indian.. What I liked the most was pasta no doubt.. Pasta was like so yummy with authentic taste. Only 1 drawback I would like to mention that is among the starters I did not find baby corn which is a must for me. But if I overlook that then its a 5 star restaurant. :)

I have never ever ever ever been to a pure vegetarian restaurant. The idea of a pure vegetarian sounds weird to me. On persistence, I went to Cream Center. I was very sure that I would not find anything to eat there.
I was very surprised to see a long waiting and a packed restaurant. The ambience of this pace is quite good. Very lively. I ordered Spicy Sa Po Schezwan sizzler which was really good. My husband ordered the Paneer ka baap sizzler. I love the Paneee sizzler as well. It's worth the money we paid for. I would have to admit that it's the best sizzler I have had in Kolkata so far. The fod was very good, both taste wise and quality wise.
I would love to go back and try some other dishes here.

Starters were good. American cheese balls and herbed chilli cheese toast :P
In the main course, they served yellow dal, dal makhani, and chana. To my surprise the dishes were lipsmacking. And not to forget, desserts were a turn on. Sizzling brownie fundae amd kulfi.. Wanna visit there soon.

I hav visited dis place thrice and i was so much into sizzlers tat i didnt giv a try to others..
Location wise it's perfect as i dnt find a good place nearby forum mall for lunch or dinner.. 
A veg outlet nd it makes my mom happy nd i can go along wid her too.. 
Though i didnt like d ambience too much but yes d place is neat and clean

When you go to this restaurant, you have got to literally carry your bank account along! It is mind bogglingly expensive! We ordered 'the big nachos' and it was huge to be true. But, just that one dish made us fork out 450 bucks. Gladly, the nachos were good but, it still isn't gonna be worth 450 bucks.

We had gone for a family dinner on Sunday 3rd Aug '14. We made our reservation and were told that it would take approximately 15 mins to get the table. Table for 6 is not in demand and hence the wait will not be more than 15 mins. While there were already people waiting for an hour, this person continued saying that it will take min 15-20 mins....After continuous follow-up and talking to person at the door, it took almost an hour to get the table!!!!!!!



This table is just next to the entrance where there is limited ac ventilation...thankfully they gave another table where ac was working....finally we get to order the food....plates come but not the napkins....food comes and it is coldddd...the soda's never came until the end.....onion rings had too much of oil in it......chana bhatura were just ok and cold....we tried ordering for some deserts, we were told that the ice cream is over....so none of the deserts were available....after that I could not see any single staff member to ask for my bill...I had to personally go down and ask for it.....



the explanation was given that it was too crowded and lot of families....its always the case with other restaurants on weekends....in Mumbai (where I had for the first time in 1997), the wait time was no less than 45 mins...but the wait was worth it....in a restaurant business, one should be able to give a nearly correct estimate of waiting time....



here, the service was pathetic....overall a horrible experience....

Rocking place for vegetarians! 
The items on the menu suited my tounge well.  
The nachos are perfectly crisp. 
One must also try the sizzler spread here! 
In short a nice experience all together! :) 
I'm coming here back for sure!

17th January - 
Went there for dinner with a group of 5 cousins. Started with Cheese corn balls and World's best Nachos. Cheese balls were perfectly cheesy but the nachos were lacking flavour. 
Next dish that followed was Double baked Italian pasta. The red Arrabiata sauce was perfect, though it didn't seem that the pasta was Double baked as the name suggested! 
We also ordered Vegetable Ranch Pizza and Spicy Sa Po Shezwan Sizzler. 
Both were perfect. 
For dessert we ordered sizzling brownie with Ice cream.... The chocolate sauce was perfectly caramelised! 
We also ordered aloo methi paratha, the compliments with it were raita and dal makhni. I really like dal makhni and would surely order it next time as a whole dish! 
The service, though, could have been better! 
Food - 4/5

Ambience - 3.5/5

Their chinese sizzler was delicious - a must try if you visit the place. Bt grilled n herbed vegetable pizza was a disappointment..as the crust was really thin and it tasted jus lyk masala khakra :p
All in all will giv them 3 out of 5.

From outside it is really nice looking place.
Decor is good inside.
Friendly staff.
Popularity is for Jain food and pretty famous in Mumbai.
Popular among Mumbaikars is working for them, had heard of amazing ragda pattis, chole bhature and sizzlers among them.
When I visited, ordered jain sizzler and regular chole bhature. Imagine serving me regular sizzlers and claiming it to be Jain when I can smell onions and see potato chips. 
I asked them to correct the order. Waiter gets the same sizzler removing potato chips.
Wish I could have rated negatively for such behavior.
WAY tooo pricey for horrible service.
Food is not as good as it branches in Pune / Mumbai

Cream centre is located amidst the hustle and bustle of Allenby road. Contrary to its location the ambience inside the restaurant is soothing and contemporary. The capacity seems to be of around 60 people. Three of us went there for dinner on Saturday eve during peak hours i.e. around 9 pm.  Opposite to our expectation we immediately got seats, generally I have seen people waiting outside this place on weekend. They have kept some chairs in the waiting area.

We ordered American corn cheese balls, Italian herbed chilli cheese toast, subz dum biryani, fresh lime soda and papad. The serving time was hardly 5 minutes. Cheese balls and toast gave a homely taste. If someone detest spicy food then these are good option. Subz biryani was perfectly prepared and was served nicely with raita and papad. Overall the food quality and taste was decent enough to make sure we can visit this place again. We shelled out INR 944 for our sumptuous meal.

The staff was courteous and asked for the feedback. Below is the rating for this place on different parameters:
1.  Food quality- 4/5
2. Taste-3/5
3. Ambience-3/5
4. Service time-4/5

Will definitely recommend the place if you drop nearby to Forum Mall, Elgin road...

This noshery is like a modern 'dhaba' imparting a flickering friendly spark which could barely reach the threshold level for me to write this review.

Starting from the ambience, is quite plaintive and unadorned but the isolated seating with a personal TV is something worth fighting for when you are getting a reservation.

The menu selection is alright and everything is Indianised to comply with our taste buds but some dishes really stand out like the nachos, Italian sizzler, most of its Indian items and the rest unnamed dishes that I leave for you to choose. The waiters seems to be like our household helpers helping us all along like a toddler. What I like and try to see in a server is his knowledge about food, how he can sell that to us and yes of course, whether he knows the basics of dining. These points are missing and hence this give us an inkling that we are having food in our homes. 
The eatery can reach high level of decibel during peak time or rather say most of the time. It is very informal dining, good for hanging out with your friends and family and also for celebrating any occasion.

Everything with this restaurant is just above average but still forces us to come back for more, saying to us that yes, it still has more to offer, it has got what it takes you to impress (but a failed perseverance). There are several more options one can opt for anytime but still I would suggest to give it a try.

Excellent place to visit with your family. The service is prompt, the music just right, and the ambience pleasant. The food is delicious,  and it's hard for me to pick which cuisine I enjoyed more. I recommend the Cheese Balls and a particular sizzler that consists of a variety of three different portions. Not a place where you casually meet up without much planning though,  because the food is on the costly side. Definitely my favourite eatery in Kolkata right now.

Visited Cream Centre last month with my dad for a treat of his birthday and we agreed on tying vegetarian only, the place is good in some terms and poor in other terms. First of all the environment of the place is very good enough and i really loved the lighting ambience of this place and very much poor in terms of fooding quality.  We ordered sweet corn vegetable soup as per my father ordered which was good they as per my choice we ordered naan and dal makhani which i regret from the moment i ordered the makhani was full of oil stuff i wondered whether there was any daal in it. It was very disappointing and the food tasted horrible. I have given a rating of 2.0 only and only because of the ambience

Cream Centre is one of those places which I wud never ever like to visit.the food the service is pathetic.The north Indian cuisine is something you dont want to try there.The staff is lazy,ignoring.I havent seem a restro where there are glasses on the table but no one to pour water.Finally when the food comes the plates arent served.we had to ask rather beg for anything and everything.It was my bday treat and I was humiliated by there act.1 one my guest's even left the venue which was disrespectful.something good on offer at the venue is the strawberry or orange soda they serve otherwise food is pathetic service is way below average.So I would like the management to look into the matter and for sure they have lost a big chain of customers

The settings and the ambience are serene and welcoming. Right from the beginning one is comfortable to stay at the place for long. The variety on the menu is quite substantial and the service staff add comfort and ease of ordering. The food is not only tasty but is also very well presented. On the whole the experience of eating at cream centre is a very refreshing one. However on the indian side of the menu the cuisine does not live upto the standard that it sets with the mexican and continental fare.

If you're a no onion garlic person who craves for quality food your search ends here. Chola bhatura specially is a rare find for people like my mom. And that too which make you drool is great..
The staff are a ready with a smile and you can pose as many questions about the food they would be ready with a satisfying answer..
So its a good place for biryani, nachos and quality time.. the only drawback is absence of hot drinks

Cream Centre is one of those places which makes you want to come back for more!.Great food (Read:the big nachos,all in one pasta,sizzlers..the list is endless),extremely polite and well informed staff(this is a rarity!the waiters in many restaurants stand like a tree when we question them about the special of the day or ask for suggestions).The interiors are mind blowing and the food is rightly priced!
I think all these reasons  are enough for me to rate this wonderful place a 4.5 :)

Special Mention: I live quite a bit removed from the main city, and it was my mom's birthday - unfortunately, we couldn't make it to her favorite restaurant: Cream Centre. So, I called them for home delivery - and I was surprised that they agreed to deliver to such a distance! And more so, when one of them called me up personally to check if the delivery had been done on time, if the food was to my liking, and wished my mom a Happy Birthday too! I love the service!

Venue: A simple setting, with a lovely warm decor - you immediately feel at home at Cream Centre. There is ample space - and though its almost always full, it is amazing that I've never had to wait to be seated! Seating is comfortable; lighting is interesting - all in all a great place whether you want to spend time with friends, or family, or business colleagues: and I've been here with all three categories.

Food: Lipsmacking! I've been here numerous times, and tried out almost everything on the menu - and I must say, I've never been happier than at Cream Centre! Everything on the menu is a must-try, but I would like to mention their Onion Rings: my 5 year old son and my 55 year old mom both love it to high heavens! The crispiness is perfect and the oiliness-almost nil. 

Service and Staff: The staff are courteous and helpful. I've never had a reason to complain or wait. They customize your meals in case you have some requirement. In fact, once they changed the soup for us, after a few of us were half-through it because the rest of the people found it a tad bit too salty. They in fact go to great lengths to ensure you are well-served and happy. 

Yes, they are a vegetarian restaurant - but even the non-vegetarians I have taken there have loved Cream Centre! Kudos for such a lovely restaurant! 

PS: Why didn't I give it a 5-rating? Its too far away for me to go often :-( Can you open up more branches - say somewhere near Garia or at least Jadavpur or Tollygunje?

Pros
- Good Decor and Nice Ambiance
- Food is awesome. The Chhole Bhature and the Pasta they serve are out of the world. 
- They have variety of veg sizzlers which are mind blowing. I never thought veg sizzlers can be so good.
Cons
- The food they serve is very heavy, so it is not for the weight watchers

Have been to this joint quite a few times, as it is one of my parent's favourite places. The decor is nice and simple with ample sitting space, (till date haven't had to wait for a seat).Yes you can say that being Vegetarian joint it would be never full, but on the contrary i have never seen the place remotely empty also. Overall the staff is courteous and have even customised our dishes a few times, which is good.

All the items i have tried till date have been great or above average . If I am suppose to choice the best in the menu for a perfect order for two, then i would suggest:

1. World Best Nachos
2. Bumbaiya Ragda Patties
3. Lemon Iced Tea
4. Delhi Tawa Paratha
5. Chefs Oriental Sp Sizzler
6. Sizzling Brownie Fundae

Just writing this makes me hungry, hope someone finds it useful. And for fellow Non Vegetarians, do give the place a try once, yes i understand the thirst for meat is always high, but i don't think you will regret the experience.

I am a hardcore non vegetarian and would not have visited this place had it not been for a Jain business associate. He suggested that I try the nachos and the macaroni and cheese. More on that later. The ambiance was a little noisy but the decor was pretty nice and the orange colour combinations were quite mood brightening. The staff is neither bad nor good and the service was just about basic but nothing to complain of. Coming to the food now, the nachos as other reviewers have written are really quite good and the salsa dip that they served had the perfect balance of sweetness and tang. The mac and cheese however was below my expectation and I did not really like it that much. Some mocktail that I had ordered was quite thirst quenching. Overall it was an average experience and I am not going back again.

First of all, the Subz Dum Biryani. I understand that it is a little stupid to mention this first. But it is the VERY BEST Biryani I have ever had. Being a Vegetarian, there are not many types that I may have had. But whatever much I have, I am yet to come across something better than this.

The place has a sober ambiance. Comfortable seats and good lighting make the place appealing.

Coming to the other dishes. The Nachos with Beans is actually the World's Best Nachos as they claim it to be. The Paneer tikka also tasted quite nice. I did not much like the other starters though.

The main course had a great variety of dishes. The Sizzlers were fairly nice, the Indian fare tasted very well, the Channa Bhatura was just fine. Italian is my favourite cuisine, and I was not overwhelmed by the Italian fare; it tasted nice but not all that great. The Pizza was one disappointment for me.

The Beverages, though a tad overpriced, do taste good. Of the desserts, I simply loved their Pan Ice-cream, which was a temporary addition to the menu.

All in all, would recommend the place to Vegetarians, who want a variety of tasteful dishes and a good ambiance.

I have frequented the Cream Centre in Mumbai for years and was quite happy when this place opened up.  Visited Cream Centre a while back and ordered the Nachos and Cheese toast to start with both of which were good . For the mains we ordered the Channa Bhatura and the Cheese Baked Macaroni.  Personally I was a tad disappointed with the channa bhatura but the baked dish was good .Overall  the food was nice but somewhere lacked that punch that makes a foodie go gaga over the taste. Service could be better as we had asked one of our dishes to be customized but the dish was served as usual , we were in a hurry so did not ask for it to be changed. Not a bad over-all experience.

Had been there a couple of days back with my cousin. Food was average...Nachos were just OK and didn't find their claim of "world's best nachos" to be true. Sizzling brownie was good but yet I am NEVER going there again.. the reason being : On the next day of our visit we got a call from one of their employees accusing us for not paying the bill amount. I told him the bill amount and the tip amount that we had handed over to the waiter who was attending to our table but he kept repeating that we had not paid. This was the most insulting experience that I have been through on any of my visits to a restaurant. 
I will never go there again and will not recommend the place to any of my relatives/friends either.
(They got our number from the review card where we appreciated their sizzling brownie and their service by MISTAKE! Now this was a mistake!)

This is my second review of Cream Centre. The first one was for dine in. This one is for home delivery. My location is situated within 1.3 km from this restaurant. Also I have ordered food before from this place. Now coming to the point of writing this review is it took close to two hours for delivery. Clearly if you are hungry and looking for home delivery this should be the last place to order.

The place is a modern haven for those who like to have pure Jain food or even vegetarian food. It is a welcome change from the conventional and old restaurants which serve such type of food, and is a very modern take on how vegetarian food can be made tasteful. The restaurant claims to have the "World's best Nachos", which is really yum, though one feels very guilty after having so much of delicious cheese. Also, the sizzlers are extremely good, and is enough of a main course to fill up a meal for 2 persons. Good hospitality, with a pleasant ambience, and voila! They provide home-delivery too. Easy on the pocket too. All-in-all, thumbs up! A must visit.

worst restaurant in Kolkata....

The nachos, sizzler and the garlic bread were fantastic. I wouldn't recommend the enchiladas as it is too tangy. A comparitively cheap place with fantastic food.

Being a vegetarian, and needing a place for a family outing in a city like Kolkata can be very difficult apart from your local club here and there. We got our bit of surprise when we visited Cream Centre.

For finicky oldies to impatient kids, the best joint in the city offering vegetarians the best fresh food with a host of options for all. The Nachos are absolutely killer. You can go for the Chola Bhatura or the Pizza, and both promise a fabulous taste. Good helpings as well!

Can be a little expensive, but then for the ambience and service it's all worth it!

Decor and service is good but was disappointed with the food. Had decided to go for the chana bhatura as this had been their trademark in Mumbai. The chana fell totally flat. Another guest went for the thali, but all the dishes, kali dal, chana had dark gravies and same masala. Others also felt the food was so-so and needed upgradation. Planning to try once more and see if there is any improvement.

Cream Centre is one of the best place to taste mouth lickering food and non-alcoholic mocktails and beverages. The list will be endless starting from nachos, chola bhature, pastas, etc....The authentic taste prepared with high quality ingredients rightly justifies the pricing...
The staff members are very helpful though professional....I will remember the professional attitude of Mr.Sushovan Chakraborty who was really very helpful in giving us expert advice in choosing the right combination...
I again strongly recommend to visit Cream Centre.

Cream Center at Elgin Road near Forum Mall is an ideal place for pure vegetarians including the Jains. The tastes of all their dishes are authentic and mouth-lickering. The ambience is awesome which will definitely rekindle your memories if you have visited their outlets at Mumbai.The service quality if not the best but will definitely be one of the best in our City of Joy. The guys out there are very efficient, specially the Floor Managers.
A must visit for all vegetarians and for all foodies of Kolkata. 
Cream Centre is a special place to enjoy quality & tasty food at an affordable price.

I love their nachos. I come to cream centre just to have their nachos only whereas my family orders something else. The restaurant is full everytime I come. However I recommened to reserve your table before coming. The staff are very friendly and is always ready to help u. I had a gala time there enjoying ipl matches as well. Hats off to cream centre for giving such good hospitality to its customers which u might not find in any other restaurant in the city. The interiors are very high standard. And I believe the restaurant serves to that class of people only. Saw their delivery bike downstairs while leaving the restaurant. Will do home delivery one day.

Chola bhatura is something we've all grown up with. So I couldn't really digest how expensive it gets at Cream Center. I guess you could blame the location. Any eateries within a 100 m radius of Forum tend to get super expensive! :D
So yes,that's the first thing I couldn't accept about this place: its pricing. At a time when cafes are mushrooming all over the city, who spends so much money on eating the same old pasta? 
The menu is kind of all over the place, in the sense it doesn't follow any particular cuisine. I mean, biriyani to nachos to chole to pasta: you get what I mean!

Service is good though and the decor and ambiance are nice. I'd thought of a very different kind of setting for a place with a name like cream centre, but its like any other restro, only a little more expensive!

Wouldnt go there solely for the good food,nope.

Visited the place recently during lunch hours. Cream Centre, being one of the favourites of my brother, i was highly recommended to to go and try the 'Worlds Best Nachos' and the Ice Lemon Soda. However the nachos were a big big disappointment. They definitely were not the world's best. By the time the nachos were served on the table, they had become completely soggy. We requested the staff to get us the nachos without the cheese dip on top, and they were still not crispy enough. however the salsa dip along with it was nice. 
The drink came in a tall glass, and was chilled and soothing.
Also, the staff was very polite and courteous, and the ambeince was appreciable.

The food at CC is good and with kids who like varieties this is one place which one would have liked to go more often. A recent incident at CC was certainly disturbing. We had ordered for some extra Salsa dips. The waiter was prompt and almost immediately picked up a used left over bowl form from the used plates (notice that used plates are kept at the table near the entry into the kitchen and in front of the visible kitchen part ). On asking him what was he serving he said it was good and unused. We asked for the manager he realized the error immediately and himself got a fresh bowl of salsa. 

Just wondering that a popular restaurant of the repute of Cream Centre blatantly indulging in these sort of practice  makes you wonder as to how safe, fresh and clean is your food in the kitchen.

All my friends couldnt stop raving bout the cheese balls at this place..and being the cheese lover that I am, it didnt take me long to go here...from outside it looked like just another small eatery but when I walked in I realised the place was not only huge but also well done up. A special thumbsup to the staff for being so friendly, welcoming, helpful and prompt.. I ordered the cheese corn balls ofcourse but they wernt as amazing as I had expected...for the main course I had a pepper double baked pasta..it was very nice. It was hot and well prepared and tasty..I relished it..for dessert I had their tutti frooti which was nice as well..the waiter also informed me that they had a rajasthani thali buffet..will definately be going back for that...

Desperate for Nachos and cheese and cant find a better place? CC
Missing out on Mumbai food, and are willing to let taste buds go down but content with the feel and ambiance? CC
Looking for vegetarian only but donot mind paying almost star hotel prices? CC
Confused as to what you want to hog this weekend but want to have chola bhatura. quesedillas and pizza all on one table ? CC
CC( cream center) the name itself transports you to marine drive bombay. For all of you who love the city and its food, visiting CC is like paying royalty to Amchi Mumbai. 
The menu boasts of all possible things you can think of! Again a Pure Veggie place, extremely noisy on weekend and extremely fluctuating food quality.
Service is quick and that has always been the hall mark of CC
The mammoth Bhaturas need to be timed and eaten with a stop watch on as if you spend 20 minutes on them they may get hard and stiff to bite.On most cases you will need to order extra chola.
Supereme Nachos, always the flag bearer for CC , but be prepared to pay for the extra cheese you order. I have been unable to figure out when 9/10 patrons order for extra cheese why doesnt the management top up the cheese in advance. These nachos are not authentic Mexican fare but they are the ones which we Indians (and mumbai frequenters) love.
Difficult to find a parking slot. 
Steep on the wallet. 
But if bored of naan, daal, chana, noodles, chilly potatoes, this is a good place to get some fresh air (and food)

frankly what's the hype about this place??i truely fail to understand what is it that draws the crowd here??have heard it was good years ago when it started in mumbai but why till nw??? frankly i found nothing remotely tasty in this place...i hated the much talked about "chhole bhature"... i mean who on earth serves bhaturas which are crispy and which get easily powdered like paper dosa ( btw the chhole too had no flavour)???and i tried their sizzlers too which was pretty flavourless!the rest of the food too was'nt not that good
Honestly i would reccommend this place for only itz drinks..the orange float and the lemon ice tea both were simply awesome!!the staff too is nice and friendly..i've heard that nachos and pastas out here are nice though have'nt tried them yet!as a whole i can't just give anythng more than 2.5 to Cream Centre ( that too only for the drinks, staff and ambience)!

Went to Cream Centre recently and had a fairly good time. Loved the ambience and the food was decent. The nachos were not up to the mark and could improve. The plating was inappropriate leading to the nachos being soggy. The veg biryani was delicious and served well too. Also the service was below the mark. The staff were busy inside the kitchen and no one was around to attend to us (group of 4 friends) when required.
Over all the ambience and the veg biryani got the better of me. :)

Their World's Best Nachos truly lives up to its name and their Italian is good. Besides that, their biryani appealed to my taste buds and biryani being something that ranks really low on my preferences, I was overall impressed with the place!

Made my second visit today - 06 Feb 2013, for a quick snacky lunch.

I was hoping to have the tikia chana, but surprised to see it off the menu. Was offered Bombay style ragra pattice (sic), which though served well was disappointing. No lime with the onions. The patties were passable. The ragda was too mild. The chutneys too demure.

The server suggested the lime float, which was made with khus syrup. Was rather nice.

Service was friendly and pretty quick. What I liked more was the server was willing to make suggestions which I find helpful, rather than most other places that say good good to everything.

The biggest downer is the price. Things are way too expensive. I thought so before too and today's increased prices is a revelation. Not worth it. Not at all.

I went there recently...its located near to my house and located in the lane opposite of Forum Mall. Its located opposite a saree shop named Rupriya. 

Its having a nice ambience and  food quality is passable. I did not like much.Food quantity is also not much. I ordered for Baby Corn crisps and American Corn Cheese Ball which were well. And for dinner i ordered Mexican Fajita Sizzler,,,it was not bad.

Staffs are well-mannered and service is slow. I think the food does not deserves this prices. they should be less.

I would rate 3.0 for CREAM CENTRE.

Good place for vegetarians. Their Bambaia Ragda Patty is good. The Brownie on sizzling plate is not worth it. Drinks are nice. A Should Visit place.

Cream Centre.. Located in the lane opposite Forum in Allenby Road..
Food is OK. I didn't like it that much. It was not that great in taste. Very limited menu though it looks huge most items are repeated on the menu. Come on, Its a bombay based chain, I expect it to have decent food at least. I tried a few of their signature dishes. "World's Best Nachos" was almost contradictory to its name :/  Ambiance is good. I would give a thumbs up for that. Service is something they can improve upon. Pricing, I would say that its overpriced for the food they serve. I guess, its not the food, but the presentation, location and the ambiance that the charge for. Given a choice, I would definitely want to consider another restaurant. Two and a half stars from me.

This has to be easily one of my favorite dining locations. It is a vegetarian's delight. They serve really good food, moderate service though. 

Love pastas & nachos there. They make their own nachos and it is a must try! You should also consider eating sizzlers over here. 

All in all, a fantastic place not to be missed out on!

Extremely disappointed. Ordered for world's best nachos. What I was served with was definitely not nachos. The sauce too wasn't too flattering and very bland.The dip somewhat salavaged the whole dish. Paneer tikka wasn't well marinated and plated carelessly. 
   Seeing the place bustling with people I had hoped for a better quality of food. Highly overpriced even though its a purely vegetarian restaurant. Wouldn't try again! I would rate it a 3 on 5

perfect location.. always brimming with people and you might have to wait for a little while even on a busy weekday lunch there.. very nicely made and well maintained .. the only set back is the food .. i would not rate too high on food but apart from that everything else is very good there.. service is quite quick.. the self proclaimed - worlds best nachos is not exactly the worlds best mexican nachos.. i have had authentic mexican nachos from the origin of the nacho place.. and they are different .. so the claim is really not upto the mark..rest of the things are pretty decent and would not be soo disapointed visiting there !

Located in the upmarket region with Forum, a stones throw away, this place was bound to be a hit. Branch of the famous Cream Center in Bombay, this outlet lives up to to its parent's name.

The menu is a nice mix of snacks, both of desi and international variety. Their Nachos are one of a kind. They come spread on a plate with a delicious topping of melted cheese and seasonings. Although a bit heavy, it turned out to be a great starter. 
The Pasta and Enchiladas were well-made with correct amount of flavour and body. 

The show-stealer for me though was the Iced-Tea in the end. It was a slush with ice so fine, it melts as soon as it enters the mouth. One has to try it to understand the beauty of it. 

The service is pretty decent for us. Although, i did see a women visibly angry at the manager over some issue with the billing.

The fact that the restaurant is completely vegetarian is a boon for the affluent Gujarati-Marwari community which predominantly occupies the locality. I visited this place at 3pm on a Saturday and it was running at almost full occupancy with a crowd mostly comprising of women and kids.

A good place to have tasty and reasonably-priced food in a very cosy ambience at any time of the day.
