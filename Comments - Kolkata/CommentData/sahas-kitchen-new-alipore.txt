A very exciting discovery for home delivery of a wide variety of food. The rates are very reasonable and the  quality of food is good. The momos are definitely worth trying!

Good value for money snack especially for takeaway or home delivery.You can also grab a bite or a meal by seating on a stoll and wall mounted rack in the garage area over there.Food prepared is excellent at such a price.Tried their Chilli Fish which was awesome and Veg Chow that was well cooked.Kudos

It is not a big place, but it makes some damn good food, especially their aloo paratha. They also make naan, roti, kulcha, moghlai, roll, tandoori and kebab. They also have Chinese and Bengali, but their North Indian is the best.
