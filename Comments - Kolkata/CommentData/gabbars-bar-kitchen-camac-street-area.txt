Gabbar's - This quirky name is enough to attract attention! And now there's an even better reason as to why you should visit this Bollywood themed restaurant this winter! They have launched their amazing Winter Special Menu : "Chillin' Like a Villain".
The menu options are fab and I loved each and every dish that I had tried from the menu. So let's begin!

> Drinks

‚Ä¢ Robert and Bhalla - This was a green apple flavoured drink with a hint of lavender and cinnamon. Tasted perfect!

‚Ä¢ Aam Berry - This was the best drink of the afternoon! Mango was blended with strawberry to get the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.

‚Ä¢ Imli Rita - Margarita gets a twist here by infusing tamarind! Quite an innovative drink. Recommended!

‚Ä¢ Shaitaani Sharaab - If you wanna experiment, this one's for you. Red wine brewed with spices like star anise, cinnamon, clove makes for a unique drink! Must try.

> Starters

‚Ä¢ Kya Cheese, Cut Piece - This was a fab veg starter, with baby potatoes marinated in yogurt and stuffed with cheese and jalapenos.

‚Ä¢ Amritsari Chakri Paneer Tikka - The presentation was innovative and the paneer was creamy and almost melted in my mouth. Recommended.

‚Ä¢ Murgh Tikka Mumtaz - This grilled chicken tikka just won my heart. It was spicy and the pieces were juicy and succulent.

‚Ä¢ Bhatakti Bhetki - Whole Bhetki fish was roasted and grilled to perfection and had a filling of minced bhetki fish and spices. Yum!

‚Ä¢ Tandoori Pomfret - This was the show stealer of the afternoon. Two whole grilled pomfrets were served with mint chutney and pickled onions. Tasted out of this world.

> Main Course

The Winter menu focuses more on tandooris and grilled items, hence the main course menu is not that variant. We had two items which were bang on!

‚Ä¢ Shakaal ki Shaan - I was so excited to see Punjab's favourite winter food, Makki di Roti and Sarson ka saaj on my table! Moreover the makki di roti was served in nachos style, and tasted amazing with the creamy sarson da saag. Must try!

‚Ä¢ Bajro no Rotlo - This was a Gujarati special thaali which included roti, baigan ka bharta, gujrati kadhi and jaggery. I tasted this thaali for the first time and loved it. Recommended!

> Desserts

‚Ä¢ Meri Berry Ke Ber - A very quirky named strawberry pie with a lattice top served with a dollop of ice cream! Must have.

‚Ä¢ Gogo goes gaga - Chocolate Pizzaaaa! This cute little pizza looked so appealing. It was topped with chocolate sauce, nougat and fresh strawberries.

These were some of the items that I tried off the Winter Special Menu and I loved it!! The items were quirky named and moreover had brilliant taste. Do visit the place and enjoy the ambience of Gabbar's and of course the great food with a glass of mulled wine or Shaitaani Sharaab! Enjoy!

After 17yrs i finally hit a good place in my Kolkata trip. And it was fun in gabbars. 

Food menu was interesting and price was it was ok. Every item in menu they tried to keep creatively and tasty. We were bunch of 5 ppl and each one was happy about their food and service 
Small menu but delicious innovative fast food kinda joint. For city like kolkata it was really overwhelming. 
Decor of Gabbar cud be much better. 

Over all we had fun experience in Gabbar's and wud like to hit t place again if there is some new addition in menu.
Chai biscuit and 
Hazaro khwayishe aisi was one dessert item everyone must try

The theme and decor of this place is awesome, specially their wall art. the cocktails were very good but the food dissapointed me a little, it was not up to the ratings and the reviews of this place. We had ordered papdi chaat 2.0 which the staff presented wonderfully with liquid nitrogen but it tasted horrible. The rest of the food was okay. Also the staff were hurrying us up although the place wasn't even half full. Overall it seemed like a waste of money.

A Bollywood themed bar-cum-restaurant located in Camac Street Area. As the name suggests, the place exudes a filmy feeling the moment you enter. The walls are all full of Bolly graffiti and famous dialogues from Gabbar the villain. Even most of the dishes are named after the characters and cast of the movie "Sholay".
FOOD:
Not only the ambience, even the food will make you fall in love with the place. Though a bit on the pricier side, they have great atomic and molecular desserts and some of the best kebabs in town. We tried some of both and were left yearning for more.
SERVICE:
Was prompt and staff was courteous.
Would love to visit this place full of Gabbar-ish vibes again, for the food though!

It located just near the American consulate or ICCR Kolkata in Ho Chi Min sarani. Nearest metro station Maidan.
Presentation of foods are awesome there. Also taste of the foods are good. We ordered diy masala papad, gababr's drumstick, kkk kebab me kebab. I really enjoyed that masala papad and kebab me kebab. Taste wise that was pretty good. We ordered normal tuborg pint, beer knees, mojitis mirchi maar ke and one signature premium(60ml). Ambience is films and based upon the great SHOLEY..!! If you are a sholay fan you will surely enjoy it. Drinks prices are on the higher side but I think trying cocktails are worthy.
I can recommend indian foods here.

2nd stop of our #lastdayoftheyear celebration was this bollywood themed restaurant located at ho-chi- minh sarani near the us consulate building. 
With different movie posters and graffities everywhere and loud bollywood numbers playng in background this place is equally cozy with friendly courteous staffs, always on their toes to serve u best.
We are in mood of chatpata foods and as this place is known for the molecular gastronomy, we ordered molecular phuchkas "balam puchkari".üëåüëå 8 pcs were served  beautifully with aloo and chat fillings witb two types of pani ie. Pudina pani and imli tastes at its best. üòçüòç
Then we ordered "mirchi munni" cocktail, tastes as bollywood as it's name implies. Mango with dash of currypatta and üå∂. #FUN
Along with our pav bhaji fondu this drink was just üëåüëå. The pav bhaji fondu is nothing but the regular pav bhaji served in a fondu style where cheesy pavs were of bite size pieces; just dipped into the bhaji and put into your mouth. Tastes best as per our bengali tastebuds, hot spiecy and tangy.
For dessert we opt for "tumhari mudpai mere kabje mein hain" from season special menu. It is chocolate mudpie with a coconut twist served in coconut shaped pie crust with vanilla ice cream. Sinfully tasty üòòüòò
Although they levy 5% service charge along with gst but the place worth a visit for twisted version of our known regular items.

You will love the Menu Card a Lot!! I mean the names are hilarious! Overall had a great evening with my friend at this place!! Everyone must visit this place.

Its been a while since I have fallen in love with a restaurant.. but gabbar's kitchen did it for me.. from the decor to the food everything is just yum.. me and my roomie from m.tech days visited this place and since we both are a fan of bollywood the posters on the wall were a treat for us.
The food was absolutely delicious.. the presentation was fascinating. We had the chicken potli kebab and mocambo khush hua for starters and yea it's gonna stay with us for a while..
Am recommending this place to all my friends and family and am coming back soon.
And p.s. we loved being served by the guy in DeVdas T-shirt..

Gave this place a try with my friends this Christmas night, I was made to wait because the place was a bit packed but I did not like it since there were empty tables. However, I chose to ignore it because the staff who served us was courteous and he neutralised the bad points.
The decor was quite decent. Bright and full of dialogues of "Gabbar, the iconic character".
We were served a complimentary dish to begin out dinner, it was quite fascinated to look at. Served in a bowl that gave it the look of egg shells, it was a cocunut based dish and felt like egg yolk to the eyes.
I liked the taste though. (P.S. I am a vegetarian)
We ordered panner tikka and pasta, which were decent. However, what I loved was the kulcha that was served like tacos with the filling of chole. The kulchas were so soft and melted in my mouth (I can't explain the feeling üòç)
For drinks, I had "Chintoo" which is a LIIT. I can category it as chota packet bada dhamaka üòù.
My friends took mocktails, lichi based and a regular mint lemonade, which was quite decent.
Overall, my first experience was quite nice. Would like to give this place a second visit üòç

Talk about worth the wait and Gabbar's would be the name off the top of my mind. After an hour-long wait we were spared seats at this much-talked about restaurant and the moment we set foot here it became pretty clear to us why there is such a buzz in town about this cracker of an eatery at Camac Street. The theme screamed Bollywood at every nook and corner, be it the specially designed wall which bore graffitis of Basanti, Gabbar, The Angry Young Man and other Bollywood legends or the super efficient waiters who bore name tags of Hero no.1, Devdas, Mr. India and other B-town heroes. The menu list was a peculiar one with the craziest names of dishes one can ever guess. So hands down, this is the most impressed I have ever been with the decor of a themed restaurant.
Coming to the food now, we started off with,
‚ù§Chicken Potli kebab-- The most innovative way of presenting the every day grilled chicken kebab. The kebabs had the most thrilling filling of malai infused chicken which had a very different texture from the char grilled chicken cover making you have a very different kebab experience altogether.
‚ù§Galauti Kebab-- I could talk about this dish all day with the warmest of feelings. I can safely say that this was the best North Indian starter I have ever had. Galauti kebabs are meant to melt in the mouth and among all the galauti kebabs I have had, Gabbar's would top my list without a second doubt. What made the already perfect kebab rise to super perfection were the crunchy crackers served as a biscuit underneath them which balanced the meatiness with the much needed crunchiness beautifully. Highly recommended!!!
The mains consisted of,
‚ù§Warqi Paratha-- The cardamom infused parathas were fresh in taste and soft in texture.
‚ù§Makkhan Singh's Butter Chicken-- Though the dish was not excessively tangy which makes me detest butter chicken in general, it failed to win me over because it was quite bland in taste and the perfectly cooked chicken was the only thing which saved the dish.
The evening would finally remain memorable for the following two desserts for sure,
‚ù§Hazaron khawishein aisi-- Full marks for innovative presentation. The apparent potted plant was the most beautiful roller coaster of chocolate one can ever taste. It contains every flavour and texture of chocolate one can think of starting from crumbled up Oreo biscuits to chocolate brownie to molten chocolate and a tinge of vanilla to provide some relief from the sweetnees of the chocolate and the surprise bursts as you keep digging deeper into the pot.
‚ù§Nutella Cigars-- The stellar of the evening. Presented with liquid nitrogen inspired from the smoke exuted from a cigar, this dish again wins for presentation. As for taste, the choux pastry wound around the oozing nutella was utterly crisp and fine in texture and I guess nutella never fails to win hearts. Please do have this if you are at Gabbar's.
As for the staff, they were the most efficient bunch of young men I have met in a restaurant after a long time and they really made our evening memorable. The only small thing to complain would be the extremely loud music which forces you to talk over the noise which is quite frustrating during a good meal. Other than that, I really believe the next time I think North Indian, I would sure as hell think Gabbar's.

Went there last week with one of my friends.
Located on ho chi minh sarani. The ambience was very good and the interior decor took us back to iconic Bollywood moments, so njoyed that. The Complimentary drink on offer was also good, with bird's nest and egg shell container. We had ordered kkk-kebab pe kebab, spicy basil fish, cantonese chicken and schezwan fried rice.
The starters were better than the main courses.
The staffs were very friendly and courteous.

Ok, so the place is a little ways away from the busier lanes, so for those not familiar with the general area, it might take a while to locate. But that's what Google maps is for. üòõ And the place offers parking space, so that's an added advantage. Now, this place is unlike any other eatery I've ever been to. The decor is quirky and old-timey Bollywood themed (guess who inspired the restaurant's name üòõ) and the food, which is awesome by the way, is presented in a unique style. Excellent service, nice ambience and not too pricey, either. Overall, I was happy with my experience here and will definitely come again.

Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen has been the pioneer in introducing the concept of molecular gastronomy in Calcutta. With a quirky decor and graffiti on the walls, resembling scenes and dialogues from the movie Sholay, this place is a great option to dine with your family and friends. I was recently here to try the new Winter Special Menu launched by Gabbar's. The menu  mostly includes dishes which are grilled over tandoor, along with some innovative drinks and desserts. 

| Drinks |

‚Ä¢ Robert and Bhalla - This is a green apple drink, flavoured with lavender and cinnamon and served in a goblet ! The flavour of green apple was indeed refreshing. 

‚Ä¢ Aam Beery - This is undoubtedly the best drink in the drinks section. Mango and strawberry were blended to bring out a sweet and tangy flavour. 

‚Ä¢ Imli-Rita - This was a tamarind flavoured margarita served in a chilly and salt rimmed glass. This was a beautiful tangy and spicy drink.

‚Ä¢ Mona Darling's Mojito - Interestingly, this was a jaggery flavoured mojito which was unique and tasted brilliant. 

‚Ä¢ Shaitani Sherbat - Red wine was brewed in house with star anise, cinnamon and clove. This was served warm and went well with the tandoori dishes served next !

| Starters |

‚Ä¢ Kya Cheese, Cut Piece - I completely fell for the potatoes ! The baby potatoes were marinated with yoghurt and stuffed with cheese and jalapeno. The potatoes were well grilled and they melted in my mouth, erupting cheese which was sinfully good ! 

‚Ä¢ Amritsari Chakri Tikka - Paneer slices were cut in pinwheel style and stuffed with spices. The paneer tasted great. 

‚Ä¢ Murgh Tikka Mumtaz - Chicken pieces were marinated with spices and grilled over tandoor. I loved the soft and juicy texture of the chicken. 

‚Ä¢ Tandoori Pomfret - I believe this is something you can't miss ! The pomfret was perfectly grilled such that the fish was extremely soft and could easily be separated from the small bones. 

‚Ä¢ Bhatakti Bhetki - Whole Bhetki was stuffed with spices and grilled. The stuffing was delicious and overall, this was a great dish.

| Main Course |

As mentioned before, the winter menu is more focussed in the grills and hence doesn't have much main course options. Even I was too full with the delicious starters. I chose to try two of the main course dishes. 

‚Ä¢ Shakal ki Shaan - This was my favourite winter food. Sarson da Saag was served in fondue pot with nachos styles makki di roti. The saag tasted good and went well with the rotis. 

‚Ä¢ Bajro No Rotlo - This is a Gujarati delicacy where millet rotis were served with a beautiful Gujarati kadhi, baingan ka bharta, garlic chutney and jaggery. This is a wonderful combo for the winter season. 

| Desserts |

I loved the unique and amazing desserts. 

‚Ä¢ Meri Berry Ke Ber - This was Strawberry Pie served with Vanilla Ice Cream. The pie was well presented in a broken plate and looked great. It was well baked and the strawberry filling tasted heavenly !

‚Ä¢ Gogo Goes Gaga - This was a chocolate cookie pizza topped with chocolate, nougat and fresh strawberries and drizzled with chocolate sauce. It was simply out of the world. The cookie pizza was thin and crunchy. The topping of chocolate and fresh strawberries was irresistible !

Overall, Gabbar's has a beautiful and a very well planned menu for you this winter. Enjoying the delicious kebabs with a glass of mulled wine can be the best way to chill this winter and Gabbar's is all set to give you this wonderful experience. I totally loved the new winter menu and I guess even you would love it as well !

Don't let the quirky name cheat you into believing that this is a very laidback hangout zone . For me and my friend , it was way too posh. The  fun decor clashed with the uptight environment . I know you don't comment on the lighting of a place where you are supposed to taste and talk about the food, still i can't help saying the chandelier and overall lighting was in stark contrast with the wall commemorating the famous lines of Bollywood movies down the decades and the peppy music being played . I had mulled wine and my friend had a glass of sangria. Quantity was good. Though I felt the wine used in making the sangria lacked the strong smell that one associates with wine. It was more watery. The mulled wine was made well. The staff was polite and well behaved. Maybe  I will give it a second try to have their food.

I‚Äôm not really a repeat eater that is I hardly visit the same restaurant, the ones with a cost for two higher than 1200, more than once. But then this one place I‚Äôll go back again and again because of their amazingly courteous staff, prompt service, excellent interiors and that food platter which serenades all your senses literally. The Portions are enough for two person with a moderate appetite. The ingredients fresh and the decor perfect for a million photops. But for two persons the cost for two will definitely climb above 1600 but it‚Äôs worth it.

Food was fine. Ambiance is okay. The thing that is worst about them is that they they charge 5% service tax on the bill apart from GST. When questioned about the same to the waiter, they said it‚Äôs because the GST rate has been reduced radically. 
And yes, they were out of 100 pipers after a couple of orders. They didn‚Äôt have enough stock. 
Menu is not that great, very average. 

Not done !!

The only reason I decided to visit this place was because I had heard so much about the presentation and not only the taste of the food. Located in the same lane as the American Consulate, the restaurant is a mid sized one but one that could have had a better layout. Coming to the food. 

The BALAM PUCHKARI is your typical Calcutta Puchka, but presented in a much more sophisticated manner. Each puchka comes in a soup spoon with the aloo masala already there. The two paanis, imli and mirchi come in a test tubes which are placed in a bowl with liquid nitrogen coming out. The puchka was good but the paanis need improvement. The imli was not sweet at all and was very very tangy and the mirchi paani was just poor. 

The PAPDI CHAAT, again, great presentation using liquid nitrogen and great dish in taste. Nothing to add there. 

The ROME ALI PIZZA (truffle) was a typical truffle pizza, full of cheesy and mushroom taste. However, there was no liquid nitrogen presentation as I had thought, reading from the menu. 

PANEER TIKKA was good. The paneer was  soft, as it should be,  and the amount of seasoning was perfect. Not too much, not too less. A great dish overall. 

For deserts I tried the NUTELLA CIGARS. There was nothing good in it except for the presentation. The outer shell of the cigar was too fragile and the balance between the crispy outer shell of the cigar and the amount of Nutella was also not very good. 

Overall, it's a decent restaurant. You may give this one a miss if you are not crazy about the liquid nitrogen presentations that it has to offer.

Wanted to visit this place for a long time, finally did that yesterday. So to start with its a bollywood themed restaurant with an innovative & attractive menu offerings. Me & my friend were served with a complimentary dessert in an egg shell shaped shot wch was made of coconut water & mango and tasted amazing. We ordered chicken potli kebab, gabbar spl ma ki dal (dal makhni), spinach kofta in cream gravy, warqi paratha and masala kulcha. Yes we ate a lot a lot but couldn‚Äôt finish it so packed some as well. Also I ordered kala khatta rum wch was good again. To end it with we ordered Nutella cigars which was lip smackingly delicious. All the items were cooked to perfection and served with loads of courteousness & smile. The staff is very friendly must say. The price is bit on the higher side but absolutely worth it. With so much food the bill came arnd 2.5k including taxes which is pretty reasonable nowadays. 
Keep up the good work...

I went to this place on my birthday hence I had  lot of expectation and yes!!!! It didn't disappoint me. I had a great time there and ambience,service was no doubt good.
They served us 'andaaz apna apna' as complimentary appetizer and it was really creative.
we ordered Crispy prawns, Gabbar Ghotala, Galauti kebab and Lichi and kaff!
Food was amazing and they served it with creativity.

This would certainly be my last visit to this place because I remember booking a table on a weekday for dinner around 10:30 and they did reserve my table . Only after reaching the place , the manager (not so sure whether he was the manager) apologises saying he would not give me a table because there are promotions of 'doob' going on . If you couldn't give me a table why did you reserve one over the call for me ? You guys didn't even call me to cancel my booking . Also after reaching, the person refusing says he is going to call us and apologise, well I didn't recieve any call or texts . This was highly unprofessional, being a resident of Kolkata and going for dinner every other week , i would never recommend any friend of family . Reserving a table and saying no when we reach , was highly disappointing.

This molecular Gastronomy restaurant has got everything right. The location is in thr heart of the city. The restaurant makes an impression right at its entrance with a retro Bollywood theme. The service is great and the staff takes good care of their guests. I ordered the chilly garlic noodles and they were awesome. The complimentary 'Andaz Apna Apna' egg shooter gives a glimpse of the molecular Gastronomy skills of their chef. The Litchi and Kaffir lime mojito is good and the chocolate bomb they call golmal is a treat to eyes. Hot chocolate melts the chocolate crust to reveal the mousse of the day, but the quantity is too much for one person to finish. All in all a good place to spend an evening.

Gabbar‚Äôs is a bar cum restaurant located in Ho Chi Minh Sarani opposite to American consulate. This place is quite well known for its molecular gastronomic Food and it‚Äôs innovative presentation of food and drinks. We went to this place on a Saturday evening and had a prior reservation for 14 people. It is the same place with pretty much similar entrance/ambience as it predecessor Amigos. Just that the walls are nicely painted with Sholay movie graffiti. We started with their starters like inverted vada Pao, Amritsari Kulche, Papdi chat, dal chawal arancini balls, romali roti pizza, lemon coriander, tomato and manchow soups. Out of the whole lot pizza was quite good though it didn‚Äôt have any romali roti feel. It was just standard thin crust. Amritsari kulcha and chole were good and papdi chat and inverted vada pao were ok types. All 3 soups were amazing with a special mention for the tomato soup for its unique smoky taste. Since we were already full with starters we just decided to order veg Hakka noodles, pasta and risotto for main course. Noodles and pasta were ok but contrary to our expectation risotto was amazing and perfectly baked. We ended up with DIY masala papad which is not worth mentioning. Overall a good experience. Service is quick. Price is affordable.

Though the place is really nice to hang out but it is over hyped and overpriced. I took Murg Tawa Biriyani which was delicious, Mogambo Khush Hua from which each kebabs were tasty, and; Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito. Each dish was tasty but not that much as people say. They take extra service-charge which is not acceptable.

Ambience was really nice. Sholay themed restaurant. Staffs were humble too. We ordered
Balam phuchkari - phuchka with mint jelly and aloo stuffed inside served with tamarind & mint water gastronomy style. Price was too high for this also it did not live up to my expectations taste wise 

Murgh lababdar & masala Kulcha - yummy n really good. Simply loved it.

Mirchi maar ke (Virgin mojito) - the Mirchi kick was less n taste of mint was dominating the spicy kick to the drink.

Golmal - it was really nice but I wish some fresh element such as fruit and some crunch may be nuts or dry food could make it one of the best dessert. I like it but it's too sweet.
But it's worth visiting once for everyone. I would like to still try some other dishes may be some other time.

Well this is a must visit for every food lover. Visited the place twice. And both times the experience was awesome. Not only are the staffs amazing but they also add quite a twist to the most simple and ordinary foods. The desserts are awesome. Especially jalebi bai and the nutella rolls. The biriyani they serve is also quite good however i best liked the curd preparation that they serve with it. All the foods are amazing. And even the mocktails too which have funny names. Chikni chameli, luscious laila etc.

Visited this restaurant on a weekday.
Wasn't pretty crowded since we reached 15 minutes before closing time.
The staffs were really courteous it was an hour passed their closing time by the time we finished our meal still no one asked us to hurry up .
Hence:
Ambience: 5/5
Staff's behaviour:5/5
Some of the dishes worth trying are Rome-Ali pizza, Truffle mushroom stuffed kulcha,Gabbar Ghotala which is mutton mince and pav.
Try Litchi and Kafir Lime Mojito in mocktail.
They also provide complimentary palate cleanser that's mango mousse in coconut water served in an egg shell like cup.. which was a really interesting thing.
For desert.. the jalebi bai was mind blowing

Ambience lovely (I visited during the pujas when the place was abuzz with loud conversations and laughter), people waiting on us were friendly and helpful (in spite of the Puja rush 3 different people came up to ask how the food was..maybe I was giving that extra happy glow that comes out of me when I am having really good food and in general a good time)..where can I start with the food...the drink that was suggested was the only downside of the evening...food is awesome...i shall not talk on the quirkiness of the presentation as I need more of an inspection...the food speaks for itself .i definitely plan to go in near future to satisfy myself with the knowledge of personally tasting each item this place has to offer..

"JAB DUR KISI GAON ME BACCHE KO BHUKH LAGTI HAIN TOH USKI MAA BOLTI HAIN BETA GABBAR'S CHALE JAA"
This bollywood themed fine dining restaurant in kolkata celebrates the richness of bollywood. U get into the groove ri8 from the time you enter this place. Walls painted with famous dialogues quirky decor potrait shots of actors get you in the mood for something jhinchak.
The food is quite good presentation steals the show and the cocktails especially the house specials are droolworthy. A special mention to the dessert dhoom macha le which is served on your table in a special way and ends with a bang. Hazaron khwaishen aisi looks very cute and is extremely delicious.
We went on a sunday night 1hr before the place closes down and belive me even then it was a full house show.
We ordered 5pints of buddweiser beer and 2rumpannas (they wre tangy and quite strong)
For starters murgh malai nazakath which is a house recommendation the kebabs were extremely juicy and delicious,one of the best i hv tasted in town.
Mains included
Chicken babumoshai- slow cooked chicken in bengali style gravy
Warqi paratha- crispy cinnamon flavoured parathas
Masala kulchas-very soft and excellent filling
Desserts included
Dhoom macha le
Hazaron khwaishein aisi
So at the end of it when we left the place our faces had "MOCAMBO KHUSH HUA" written all over it

This place was another one in my bucket list. Their concept of naming the dishes inspired from Bollywood to the infusion of science in food by their molecular techniques is something I have been really looking forward to trying.
The place is a 5 mins walk from the Maidan metro station and is pretty easy to locate in Ho Chi Minh sarani. 
Once you step into this place it gives you a very Bollywood like feel with its quirky decor and hindi music playing in the background.
Coming to the food, we had ordered their very famous chicken Potli kebab for starters and it was indeed a treat to the taste buds. The mutton filling which burst out with every bite of chicken was delicious. With that we were given a very tasty complementary mango drink, andaz apna apna which was made by their unique molecular and gastronomical technique and had a very out of the box presentation.
For the main course we ordered peas pulao and murgh tikka lababdar. The food was quite good and only con with the chicken dish was that it was a bit too salty.
Finally coming to the dessert, we had ordered 'yeh hai Mumbai meri jaan' which was a Parsi kulfi. Perfectly sweetened and well balanced with the rose flavoured molecules it came in with a beautiful presentation.
What made our experience even more memorable was their extremely good service and the very courteous and friendly staff. All in all it was a great lunch experience and I would definitely visit this place again. Indeed a must try.

After a long wait I met my college friends almost after an year. This place looked promising so here we were for dashami lunch. Seating and decor really good. The place had this unique appeal about it with the theme set in the wild west in Sholay. 
Starters were pretty nice. The stuffed mushrooms were quite the standout among the starters. Chicken dilwan tikkas were also white juicy and delicious. The babumoshai chicken was really good and had a very delicate balance of flavors. 
Nice place to hang out with your friends or a casual dine with your family.

Truly a wonderful find. I had no idea such a wonderful themed restaurant was there near my workplace. Went for a team luncheon and it was a good experience. The visit can be summarised as follows -

The good -
i. Staff - As courteous as can be.
ii. Ambience - Themed after the famous tropes and dialogues of bollywood, Gabbar's walls are adorned by small posters of old bolly flicks. Even the name of some dishes are after bollywood flicks/ tropes. The efforts put behind to theme it on bollywood or "bollywoodity" is quiet amusing in itself. When you have dishes named like "Gabbar ki maa ki daal", "Munni ke badnam kofte" and golgappes called "Balam Pichkari", it is bound to be an entertaining situation. 
iii. Food - Apart from all those fancy bells and whistles, Gabbar's deliver true in the domain of food as well. In starter we ordered Galauti Kebab which was soft and juicy. In main course, the Murgh Tawa Biriyani was good. It tasted somewhere between bengali awadhi style and hyderabadi dum style, but nonetheless it was good. Masala kulcha was truly amazing and a must recommended along with Chicken Babumoshai. 

The bad -
Truly there was not a single bad experience, but for the sake of nitpicking one can consider the fact that it charges an additional service charge which nowadays seems redundant no matter how much someone tries to justify. 

So, will I be visiting here again ? I am pretty sure I will. And would recommend to the bollywood fanatics out there too. It is a good place for hangouts and has great food. Keep it up guys.

Went for Mom's birthday lunch. We had :

‚Ä¢ Mac n cheese balls : 6 balls filled with gooey mac and cheese served in fried spaghetti nest with mayo dip.

‚Ä¢ Mogambo Khush Hua : 2 Lamb Galauti kebabs, 2 Fish, 2 each of 2 types of Chicken kebabs. Each of them were tasty

‚Ä¢ Mushroom stuffed Kulcha with truffle oil : 3 small kulchas served with Daal and Truffle oil.

‚Ä¢ Rome-ali Pizza with Chicken : 6 pieces of crispy roomali roti based chicken pizza

‚Ä¢ Golmaal : Dessert. Chocolate ball filled with chocolate mousse. Hot sauce is poured so that the ball breaks open to show the mousse. Good end to the meal.

Rated so high on Zomato, I expected much more from this place. Nothing was mouth-watering or something which would bring me back. Prices are on the higher side. Bill was 2400 for 3.
One thing which has left me confused is that, I asked our server that it's my Mom's birthday, so if he could do anything with the dessert. He stopped me and said yes you don't worry I'll see to it. But alas, when the dessert came nothing was written/ no candles or anything. And the guy seemed to have forgotten what he had told me. It was embarrassing of me to ask him in front of my Mom to do so,so venting it out here instead.

The very 'filmy' ambience is equally complimented by the delectable food fare and the cordiality of the staff. Highly recommend the chicken Potli kebabs and the warqi paranthas.  The best experience was however reserved for the last when we were served a dessert appropriately named ' Dhoom Machale' when a chocolate ball was covered in vapours of nitrogen before being smashed and coated in dollops of mango syrups. A truly ' filmy' visual treat!

It was a wish come true when me and my friends decided to hop in to the gabbar's den (actually). The ambience was exactly the replica of what I expected. Sober, tranquil and filmy evening with friends is what one can estimate to receive. The place was quite into solace, may be due to Durga Puja. The place is well lit and service is very nice. We were attended by everyone starting from escorting us to our table to ordering our menu for the eve. We had lat-me-kai and pan fried chilli fish along with the bucket of five. The wall on the right of entrance to restaurant is painted with epic caricatures of bollywood along with some memorable quotes like "nathulal ki moonchein" "rishtey mein to hum tumhare baap" and some more. Out of the box idea is to serve the bill is in a damage box on a toy cot which is actually as I term "inside the box". The place is the very first to introduce molecular gastronomy food but alas, we could not chill our tastebuds due to our tight schedule though we wanted to stay longer and eat more. So that's it, but as we used to say "its just the beginning". Hope to visit again soon.

So, we got to know about this place from a friend. Great food, good ambience and Decent drinks was what we were looking for and this turned out to be the perfect place.
The place has a good ambience, Bollywood themed decor and music and the staff was interestingly dressed(refer to the pictures :p).
We were welcomed with a unique complimentary dish prepared by them which was mango shots in Coconut Water. Interestingly spread out in the form of eggs in a birds nest. 
For starters we ordered 
1) Pan fried chilli chicken(one of the best I have had) - perfectly cooked with onion rings, medium spicy.
2) Dahi seekh kababs - the taste was good but it was too tender and used to break between the journey from the place to your mouth
3) Cheese Balls (tu cheez badi Hai masstt masst-yeah funny name) - good but very filling obviously, accompanied by two amazing dips.
4) Sangria
5) Beer cocktail- beer + gib + lemon and honey.
Both the drinks were decent.
6) crispy fried potatoes - aptly cut, perfectly crispy.
Overall the food quantity was good and prices were reasonable as well.
For dessert, my friends ordered Golmaal which was chocolate syrup poured on a Chocolate Ball filled with Chocolate mouse. Yeah so too much chocolate.
The staff was very courteous and friendly. 5/5
A Must visit place if great food is what you are looking out for in a quiet place.

Visited this place on a dry day just to try out their food. But to our dismay they weren't serving their Indian delicacies. We had to make do with their chinese and italian menu. The chicken wings we ordered were no doubt delicious, but I hope to explore this place more in the future. Looking to visit this quirky place again.

So five of us went to Gabbar's for a lunch after seeing their insanely high rating on Zomata. Being a theme restaurant, it was nice to see that everything was set up according to its filmy theme; from the wall graffiti and pictures hanging on the walls to the name of the items in the menu. Although, the area was not very big, we liked the ambiance very much.

Next we come to the food. First we ordered some hard drinks. And what we really found amusing was that the soda was brought to us in a laboratory beaker. The bubbles inside made it look like it was some kind of a chemical solution. Next we ordered the starters; Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup, Murgh Malai Nazakath, Murgh Tikka Dilam and Pan fried Chilli Fish. All of them were fantastic. In the main course we ordered Butter Naan, Makhan Singh's Butter Chicken and Murgh Tikka Labaddar, Mixed Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken. We had no complain at all. Every dish was finger licking good. In starters we ordered only one item and it was Hazaron Khawaishein Aisi. We really liked the unconventional way that it was brought to us. It came in a flower pot, with a twig of Pudina standing in the middle. At first we were skeptical whether it would be any good at all. But after digging deep into the pot we realized that it had three layers, on the top there was choco wafers, in the middle there was was choco-vanilla ice-cream and at the bottom there was choco-brownie. We enjoyed it a lot.

Overall, we had a memorable experience at Gabbar's Bar and Kitchen and it rightfully deserves a 5 out of 5 starts.

Mostly I rate 4 or 4.5 üåü out of Five, due to lack of poor quality of food or staffs behaviour, but this is something different, a place you want to be every occasion.. staffs are very well behaved, foods quality are mind-blowing... Will be there soon, and will recommend my friends and relatives for sure
Thank you Gabbar's :)

One of the very few places in Kolkata that serves not just delicious but also awesome looking food.. We ordered Balam Puchkari, Molecular papdi chaat, LIT, and hazaron khwaishein aisi.. All of them were good.. The dessert was the best part according to me though. The staff is polite.. The interiors are pretty good always.. Overall a must visit..

Gabbar's ( as the name suggests ), a bollywood themed restaurant presents everything in a gabbar style starting from the wall decorations to the names of the dishes.
It was not just once but twice I visited this place to try their various delicacies and it was an amazing experience.
Some dishes of my personal choice which is a must try are:
1) Balam pichkari
2) Galouti Kebab
3) Pasta Alfredo
4) Chelo Kebab

A special mention to the couteous staff present there.

Been on the wish list for a long time, finally checked In to the much hyped bolly themed restaurant in camac street.
Its located just opposite to the US consulate embassy (just in the lane opposite to pantaloons camac street).
The walls are displayed by variety of posters from different bolly movies with catchy themes.
The waiters are prompt and well knowledgeable about the different food items.
Among the starters had Balam Puchkari- Phuchka served with a twist.(5/5)@
Murgh malai nazakath- chicken kababs in cheese and coriander.. (4.5/5)
To cheese badi hai mast mast - cheesy balls with dip (4/5)
Penne paprika cream - penne in parmesan sauce which was too tasty (4.5/5)
Chicken babumoshai - boneless and bone pieces in richly medium spicy gravy(4/5)
Garlic naan and paratha
The mocktails we had..litchi and Kaffir lime mojito(4/5) and Italian itch(5/5)
The best was the at last..molecular paan(5/5)- a hugely popular item served in molecular style with the starch of potato ..a must try

Definitely visiting again to try out the variety of cocktails and drinks
Do drop in to taste some awesome gastronomic foods

Gabbar's was on my wishlist for a long time. Finally checked into this much talked about place on Sashthi night. We were damn tired after pandal hopping and they didn't keep us waiting. I just loved their peppy and fun filled interior. We ordered drums of heaven and pan fried chilli fish in starter with a bucket of beer. My friend ordered virgin mojito and it was very refreshing. Both the starters were tasty though we didn't find them extraordinary. In main course we took chicken babumoshai, gosht rarah with tandoori roti. We also took 6 shots of la chica gold. The mutton dish was just out of the world. Chicken was also properly cooked and delicious. Gosht rarah actually had 3 pieces but they managed to give an extra piece on our request. Thumbs up for that. Though the pricing was on a higher side the restaurant made us happy with their welcoming gesture. 
Overall experience-

This filmy restaurant portraying "gabbar" as it's theme is located in Camac Street. A small bar cum restaurant it is. Took screwdriver which was quite good, antiquity blue, gin and a beer bucket.
For food we took lat me kai which was good. Pan fried chilli fish which was spicy and was very tasty.
We also took Crispy chilly baby corn , pan fried chicken and masala papad. All these were quite good.
The best part was the dessert. I took Nutella Cigars which was just awesome. There were four baked crispy pastry cigars filled with nutella which was drool worthy. I would recommend everyone to try this desert for once.

We decided to go after getting a recommendation from one our friends. The place was heaven to us. The ambience was bollywoodish style. The staff especially Hero No 1 was courtageous enough to guide us through the menu. Amongst the drinks Kala khatta and luchi and Kaffir lime mocktails was pure heaven. Amongst the starters Potli kebab was pure bliss. This is a must go place for the bongos.

I went here in the night of Saptami. 
To my surprise it comes out to be far more higher standard than I expected. 
Food quality, presentation, ambience, environment, staff's behavior in every aspect it touched my heart. It is kind of a theme restaurant based on old bollywood movies and mostly emphasized on our super villain Gabbar Singh. 

The menu card is super interesting. 
The presentation of food is out of the box and innovative 
I liked very much Gabbar's Galouti, Pan fried chilli fish, dry cooked fish finger, Gabbar's Galouti, Mogambo Khus Hua Kebab platter, Murgh Tikka Dilman. 

You should try Lambi Race Ki Ghoda Long Island Iced Tea. 
The last but not the least.. The owner and staffs are always smiling when they speak to you.

I was here basically for a treat so I didn't go for much for and it mostly comprised of desserts.
But then these tiny titbits have left me awestruck.
The interiors, full marks on that, then the staff, a nice one. And at last comes the Food, mind blowing! Hazaaron Khwayishein aisi, yes that's what they call a mudpie there, was delicious. There was some puchka, I forgot the name, that was delicious too. And at last comes, Andaaz apna apna, it was a complimentary dish for us and which surely did leave us wanting for more. Hat's off to the Molecular Gastronomy foods!

Located in the lane opposite Camac Street Pantaloons, Gabbar's is the perfect destination if you are a foodie and Bollywood fan. Those quirky wall posters with movie quotes and the upbeat music will keep you entertained. The service is prompt as well. For drinks we ordered the kala khatta rum and mehbooba me dooba which is tequila based. Both had great flavours. For starters we had chicken potli kabab and mutton galouti kebab. Both are a must try. The galouti kebab just melts in your mouth. For main course we had babumoshai chicken, cheese chili olive naan and masala kulcha. The olive naan is a speciality and again a must try because of its awesome taste. The babumoshai chicken is somewhat similar to bengali mangsher jhol with a thick gravy. Overall it was a great experience with the perfect ambience for a fun outing and equally delightful for the taste buds. Hoping to visit again!

Today I visited Gabbars again. Lot of water has flowed down the Hooghly. They served inverted Vada Pav which was stale, smelling and must be more than  24 hrs old. Really sad.

To start with the decor is spledid with all the bollywood griffiti and one liners n ambience is sober 
I like the mongolian very much even though spring rolls were okayish and the mud pie was out of the world with uniue style of presentation served by hero number 1. Unique way of presentation truly a treat for the eyes.  The desserts are a must if you visit this wonderful place. In all it is was a lovely experience being here and thanks for the complimentary dessert. üòä

Kolkata has a new theme based spot for adda.. Gabbar's.. üòä
From the name it's quite understable that it's a Bollywood theme based restaurant. It was a long awaited place to be visited .
Now come to the main part. When you enter the place, itz cozy and filled with old and new movie posters in their brick wall(to create effect). Trust me it looks good.
Ambience-5/5

Nothing is there to complain about.
The foods have their own unique names and presentations.. u don't wanna miss. (i.e. Andazz apna apna- a complimentary drink in a egg shell like container). 
Price is reasonable.
It's highly recommended. üòç‚ù§

The staff is very friendly and courteous indeed.
Coming to the food I savored all the items I had, starting from the kebabs to the biryani.
And the drinks one better than the other among which Itilian Itch is a must try.
I also liked a cocktail from their special drinks menu but Im unable to recall the name, it was made out of lychee.
Finally they gave us a complimentary dessert. Thanks for it.

This one had been on the bucket list for long,and I'm glad to have finally checked it out. The filmy theme ,the quirky yet comfortable interiors,and the polite staff- all add up to an enjoyable experience. 
We ordered: Italian itch( the best mocktail on their menu I'd say), L'affaire Paris, Litchi drink with kafir lime,and virjin mojito. Their cocktails didn't particularly appeal to me, although Mirchi Munni is worth a try. Chicken drumsticks, murgh malai nazakath,and lasooni kebabs made for perfect starters.
Main course consisted of Masala kulcha, olive cheese naan, garlic naan, peas pulao, schezwan rice teamed with Chicken Babumoshai,and murgh tikka lababdar. Everything tasted perfect!
 The desserts you must try here are : Hazaaron khwaishein Aisi, jangal mein Mangal, and jalebis. 
Ending with their Molecular paan. This place is a MUST TRY!

First thing first.This place is a must go!In terms of location,staff quality,decor & mainly food GBK is a clear winner.Bollywood is the theme here with wall art,posters & photographs of our matinee idols adorn every corner.In terms of food decoration this place deserves a special mention.That is complimented with the brilliant taste of almost every dish.Though they serve Italian & Chinese also but we preferred to stick to the Indian dishes.A number of veg options are also there.We started with the lovely Litchi & Kaffir Lime Mojito that came in a glass pot with cold smoke bellowing from the top.Juicy Chicken potli kabab & a melt-in-the mouth galauti kabab,named quirkily as Hum Kaale Hain To Kya Hua? were brilliant.In the main courses we ordered the wow combination of Cheese chilli olive naan & Warqi paratha along with Makkhan Singh's butter chicken & Gosht rahra.Each one was superb.We signed off with some interesting desserts,the molecular gastronomy dish Ye Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan,the kulfi & Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi,choco mudpie with vanilla ice cream & oreo crumble that came as a small plant pot on the table.The loud music is the only complaint I have.For the rest,a big thumbs up!

Well growing up as a fan of Bollywood movies my favourite super villain was Gabbar. And this restaurant is about my favourite super villain. So, I will definitely keep it in my "A" list of themed restaurants. The walls are full of funny dialogues and graffiti of old super hit bolly classics. This restaurant serves a variety of delicious cocktails.
We ordered four cocktails. 
1. Bijli Blast - Spicy Guava Cocktail, Vodka base
2. Mirchi Munni - Super spicy white rum base mango flavoured cocktail. Contains chilly pieces.
3. Kala Khatta Rum - Rum in kala khatta flavour
4. Capriosca - Classic cocktail, u all knw wht it is.
The Food we ordered.
1. Hum Kale Hain Toh - Super delicious Galwati Mutton Kebab in small buns and infused in charcoal smoke. Awesome and juicy.
2. Chicken Potly - Chicken leg kebabs with chicken keema filling.
Ratings- 
Food 5/5
Cocktails 5/5

Gabbar's - the name itself creates the expectation of a Bollywood touch and all the expectations has been duely reached üòÇ

This place is located in Camac Street Area. It is approximately a 5 minute drive from the Maidan Metro station. The moment you enter the place,you start getting Bollywood vibes.On one side , there is a full wall dedicated for funny popular bollywood dialogues.On the other side,there is a full fledged bar arrangement.Even the staff was wearing t-shirts with specific character names from bollywood. Overall,the ambience was totally amazing.

Coming to the food,we tried the following :

|| Mocktails ||

‚àö Andaaz Apna Apna : This was a complimentary mocktail .It was basically three small containers,which look like egg shells, and they had a small quantity of mango flavoured drink in them. The presentation was unique and it tasted amazing.‚ô•‚ô•

‚àö Italian Itch : This is a refreshing fruit drink which was a blend of orange,peach,mango,apricot and vanilla. This was really superb.

|| Starters ||

‚àö Chicken Potli Kebab : This was an amazing dish.It had three big chicken legs which were soft and succulent and melted smoothly in our mouths. It was awesome. Highly recommended !!

‚àö Murgh Malai Nazakath : This had 6 pieces of kebabs.This dish was quite ordinary but again,not worthy of any complaint.

|| Main Course ||

‚àö Chicken Babumoshai : The gravy was delicious.It had around 7 pieces which tasted superb - it had the typical taste of bengali home made chicken !!

‚àö Cheese Chilli Olive Naan : This naan was a speciality of the house. It was really good,almost like a pizza crust.

‚àö Butter Naan : It was good enough,loaded with butter which was really appreciated from our side.

‚àö Tandoori Roti : This was decent too.

|| Desserts ||

‚àö Hazaro Khwaishein Aisi : Again another dish with unique presentation.It came in a pot filled with brownie and vanilla ice cream and had oreo crumbles on top . It looked like a small tulsi plant. The dish stole our heart with both its presentation as well as taste. ‚ô•‚ô•

‚àö Jalebi Bai : This was the showstopper of the day.A molecular gastronomy dish which had jalebi balls and rabri - it tasted so amazing that we pounced on the dish once it came and we were done with it in 2-3 minutes. I can go to Gabbar's again and again just for this dish only !! Highly recommended !!

The staff was really courteous and helpful.

Overall,it was an amazing experience.Gabbar's Bar and Kitchen is one of the best restaurants of Kolkata,I must say !! ‚ô•‚ô•

It is perhaps a conversion gone wrong. This place was previously called Amigos and served really good Tex Mex stuff....now a place serving Indian food along with some other options. They are serving some "molecular" food which is perhaps their speciality. Well, I am not a fan of this molecular business....food with weird combination served with some nitrogen does not exite me. Whatever we ate here just fid not appeal to me. The ambience is pathetic and noisy....too much clutter for comfort. The pricing is steep and does not justify either the taste or the setting. The inly plus point is the valet parking....if this can attract you to visit.

So Gabbar ghotala stole the show and as has been pointed out by many, one of the best mutton dishes it was. Please do not try any neon-ified indian cusine like papri chat, if you like original flavour. It just ruins it. Go for the coktails they are all cool and good even. The quality of food and the thier make-over definitely makes it a much visit place. Go and enjoy the evening..!!

Ambience : 
This place have been in my wishlist for a long.
So finally i had a great experience too while visiting it.The place was themed with the special character of Gabbar on the movie Sholay.The walls interior of this place has photo frame of movie stars which enhances the beauty of the place more. You will find grafitee of Gabbar and thakur(Famous character from sholay) on the walls.

Food:
Ordered for 
1. Balam puchkari.
2. Murgh malai dilmani.
3. Gabbar ghotala.
4. Bijli blast (cocktail).
5. Choco ball.

Food was extremely innovative.You can find from their names on the menu list.All special themed on Gabbar.Their service was good.The serviceman was well versed with the item categories and they even gives you better options on asking for which one could be better in taste.
One recommendation try out their special menu .
They are mouthwatering and lip smacking. That will make you order for one more.

The Balam Puchkari concept was of gastronomic food. You'll find how innovation they have done with a simple Puchka that we are fond of totally . The liquid Nitrogen fumes adding more innovations to the dish.

Murgh Dilamani was murgh kebabs.I must say the kebabs were soft from inside too and well cooked. Spices inside were not raw . 

Bijli Blast is a punch of Vodka and Guava juice. Thats what the cocktail goes.

The Chocolate ball was nothing other than Heaven.

Gabbar ghotala was Stir Fried Mutton keema with pao's along with an egg poach on top. The mutton keema was too tasty for making it tastes last for one day .

Overall it was a great experience. 
Loved the place.
Service was swift i must say.
Ambience was totally a Themed one well done with the interior decoration.

Well what do I say about this place. It's an absolute delight to gorge on to anything and everything that they serve. I would firstly say, I love the ambience and the entire decor of this place to suit the name. All the posters, pictures and wall graffiti brings life to it. Moving on to the main part which is food...!! If you reach this place before 7-7:30 you will not be able to have the tandoor portion. So your palate needs to be happy with the Italian or the Continental that they offer. 
Well don't be disheartened because their pastas are equally good so I'm sure all of you will indeed enjoy trying it out for yourself. What I really loved was their Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito. This brings out the gastronomic flavours altogether. Their desserts are also worth mentioning. Be it the - Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi which is a gooey mudpie topped with crumbled Oreo and Vanilla Ice Cream.  Or you have their Golmaal, I must say it's for all chocolate lovers. It's a ball of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse and when they pour the hot chocolate over it the ball pops open! Go ahead and indulge your tastebuds!

The food , the decor and the ambience was all very good. We ordered chilli honey prawn which is a must try. We also ordered lat me kai which is a chicken preparation and is pretty good. For our main course we ordered pan fried noodles, chilli garlic noodles and kung pao chicken . Of the two noodles preparation pan fried noodles was better. It was Kind of disappointing that when we arrived the Indian section was closed otherwise I really wanted to try their kebabs. The two drinks we ordered was boozy doll and mirchi Munni and both of them was really awesome.

Gabbar cut the hands of Thakur!! Thank God this Gabbar doesn't believe in that as a punishment otherwise how could we have tasted the delectable food that was on offer üòù

It was my birthday treat and the place had to be perfect for a group of three to go. We changed our venue at the last moment to this and thank God we did. 
The ambiance is too good. If you're a Bollywood fan, this place will make you nostalgic. Posters of your favourite movies, dialogues, and pics of stars and legends. Too much happiness in one place!!

Coming to drinks and food. There were many choices for both drinks and food. In drinks we ordered a bottle of rose wine for two of us and a Capriosca cocktail for another friend. I tried rose wine for the first time and it was damn tasty!!! A must try!

Food Section- I am a vegetarian and other two Non Vegetarians. So we ordered one fish ajwaini tikka, Mac and cheese balls and American Corn. 

Fish tikka was soft and quite tasty. 
Mac and Cheese balls- absolute delight. Comes with a creamy side dip which compliments it perfectly. Amount of cheese inside was just right and didn't drip. The crispiness was heavenly. 
American Corn as usual the typical CHAKHNA material. Here they were extra garlicky which I like. 
Then there was the Amitabh Bachchan platter of assorted veg kebabs. Includes paneer, potato, mushroom and dahi ke kabab. Paneer and Potato were great, mushroom and dahi kebab not that good. 
This dish can be missed. There are many other dishes to try. 

Absolutely worth visiting this place! I am coming for sure.

This place is too familiar to me and my friends just because it's near to my office. But their offerings are tasty. Best thing I like here is Kothu Paratha aka Jai thalaiva. A must thing to try. Been eating the same dish for the last 5 visits without fail. In dessert Hazaron Khwaisein aisi which is a chocolate mudpie wins the game. 

One thing though- their service is slow and has a lot of scope of improvement. Prices are okay only because they are located in Park Street area- Ho chi Minh sarani to be particular.

Great experience.  The food journey begins with a mouth freshener in shape of eggs and yolks.  We ordered the kulcha and channa which was served on trucks with balti of onion and tomato mince.  Then we ordered the roomalii roti pizza,  amazing as it was and crisp.  Then came the pan fried noodles which was delicious And generous in terms of gravy.  The final ending was with pan which slightly was disappointing for the size but presentation was great.  I am usually more inclined on taste but here was the place that blew my mind for the taste and amazing presentation.  The menu is also creative.  The place is on park Street and slightly off track.  But the taste and service will make up for it.  Mocktails could be a little better.  But great experience overall.

Delightful Food Presentation 
Pros :
1.Out of the box names of the dishes. 
2.Food Quality was good.
3.We got a pretty good service including the waiter serving everyone after giving us time to Instagram the food. 
4. Complementary Instragramable drink.

Cons :
1.Price would have been justified for the aesthetic presentation but the additional service charge of 8% is totally unnecessary and since its non taxable you can ask for them to remove it if you get unacceptable service. 
2.Quantity was a little sad for price range. That cud be improved upon.
3.Daylight is limited, and they have only one wall on which you can take pics. Since good lighting shud have been a must have for such good instagram worthy dishes, low lighting dint help. 
4.The theme is limited to the named of the dishes nothing incorporated in the dishes.

Must try:
1. Balam puchkari aka puchka
2. Spinach kofta
3. Warqi Paratha
4. Chocolate Ball
5. Watermelon Basil mojito

Avoid :
1.Chilli Cheese Olive Naan- it was so thin and burnt.
2. Molecular paan - Its fun to try out the transparent wraps but its a one time try worthy.
3. Kulfi
4. Lichi mocktail

Heard a lot about this place. Finally made it here. First look, nice painted walls with Bollywood all over the place. Even waiters have Bollywood character names on their t-shirts. A bit cramped up place with too much light for a bar.
          Staff are very courteous and helping with choosing food. Service is really good out here
          Coming to the drinks, the best of all, Chintoo, Mehbooba mein dooba, Luscious Laila, Mirchi Munni, beer's knees all were innovative and amazing individually. A 5/5 for the presentation.
            The food- Started of with a complementary Andaz Apna Apna. Starters- Gabbar Ghotala was too good, chicken potli kebab was quite good. The main course- makkhan singh's butter chicken, chicken babumoshai, warqi paratha, cheese chilli olive nan fell bit below our expectations. The dessert- chocolate globe with hot chocolate sauce also was a disappointment. The chocolate globe was too thick a layer of chocolate.
            Yes, a bit high priced place. Would love to visit the place again, highly recommend it. But would advice a bit on cost reduction.

Service is damn quick.
Kolkata was missing the presentation of the dish compared to the other cities.
For reference check the pictures and you will simply love the outstanding presentation. 
Waiting‚Äã time is common everywhere these days but fortunately i booked a table in the evening on Zomato itself. So i would recommend you to book a table before coming :)

Location- Opposite American Centre. Barely a 10 minute walk from Maidan Metro. 

Ambience- Pretty chill. Liked the decor. Loved the Bollywood-ish wall. The bar could have looked better though. Also, being a family restaurant on a crowded Saturday night, it was too loud with the cacophony of children around. 

Cocktails- Chintoo, Mirchi Munni, Luscious Laila,  Beer's knees and Mehbooba Mein Dooba. Beer's knees was the best followed by Chintoo. 
Mirchi Munni and Luscious Laila were okay.  Mehbooba Mein Dooba was pretty good so we ordered another one. The presentation of Beer's knees was amazing! 

Starters- Gabbar's Ghotala and Chicken Potli Kebab. 
Again, hats off to the presentation of the Kebabs. They came with tiny little pressure cookers! Very cute!  Gabbar's Ghotala. Definitely the MUST HAVE dish here. The bhaji of the pao was spectacular. I'd say I have given 3 out of 4 stars for this dish alone. 

Mains- Chicken Babumoshai, Makkhan Singh's Chicken butter Masala, Warqi paratha and cheese chilli olive naan. The babumoshai dish was the best! Disappointed with the rest though as they failed to make a mark. 

Dessert- Golmaal. I had heard so much about this dish, about the hot chocolate sauce being poured and the sphere melting. Had our cameras ready to boomerang capture the same but sadly, the boomerang was over and the sphere was anything but molten. Later, we took a bite and realised the sphere was too thick. The dish tasted okay. I really expected something magnificent so it is safe to say i was let down.

The pocket pinch was around 4.5K. 
Would love to visit again!

My rating is primarily for the quality of food served here and its presentation. However, I was a bit disappointed with the ambiance, which I found to be unpleasantly loud. Staffs are courteous and they also keep experimenting with the menu. I would recommend nachos and kulfi for the taste and experience respectively. Overall, it was a time well spent.

This place will remind you of the movie sholay. Named on one of the greatest villans of all time Gabbar. You'll love it if you're a fan of sholay. Great ambience,courteous staff and food. If you visit this place you must order a desert. Presentation of desert was somehow unique and beautiful. It's a must visit place for a desert lover too and it'll definitely satisfy your sweet tooth.

The place has a really great decor, the pictures from Sholey and miniature objects depicting the movie decorated the bar table. The people serving were very courteous. The food amazing. Mogambo Khush hua, assorted nonveg kebabs just melted in our mouths. The galauti kebab was the showstopper. Must try. Then comes the mac and cheese coins. Those are kinda heavy on tummy because of cheese. The deserts were very unique. Haazaro khawaishe aise was a mudpie with chocolate sauce topped with oreo biscuits(crushed). The way they presented it was awsome. So was Mumbai meri jaan. I have added the pic of Mumbai meri jaan because explaining it is beyond words. :)

Well heard of Gabbar's but could not make due to time constraints and ultimately I can make myself into Gabbar's. It's a Bollywood themed gastropub. Ambience is good, but most of the things are basically photo frames and eye catching graffiti on the wall. But their servings in children's play sized balti, cookers and batis will make you funny. 

The place is not very big, but it's not a small area. Rather not putting any extra on the floor, they utilize the whole area for dining. 

Coming to the food, I find that they have somehow keep the veg:non veg ratio at 60:40 on the menu, which I can't appreciate. But the Gabbar's men are very helpful and serve quite fast. They rock in the uniqueness of the service. 

I tasted their Chicken potli kebab - stuffed chicken tangri kebab which is superb on taste buds. And they have 2 beer cocktails both are great but Beer Knees is bit sweeter. Next time I would go for their desserts served with liquid nitrogen.

And oh yes it can be your get together or romantic dine out destination as music is never loud and you can enjoy drinks and great foods while gossiping.

The servers are helpful to suggest dishes and drinks as per your tastes and preferences. The overall presentation of each item was unique in its own way. It's difficult to point out one thing that you should try here.

The prices are a bit steep than normal, else everything is nice and would like to visit them Often..!

Been to this place with friends. Experience was a total positive one!
Ambiance was Very nice and pleasant. The staff were all adequately trained and served us really well.
The complimentary stuff in the beginning caught the eye at the first place.
Food was worth a try especially the Chinese cuisine.
Reason of 4/5 is the overall food quality as we did not try drinks at all except soup, which was good.

Really quirky menu names. Surely will make you look twice and laugh.
A complimentary welcome shot was really surprising as well as tasty. Really beautiful presentation.
We tried the Azwain fish tikka and Potli chicken kabab. No complaints there. Again kudos for the presentation.
Finally we tried the dessert special, Dhoom Macha Le. They really hit this one out of the park. Beautiful on table preparation with lots of zing to say the least. 
Just look at the photos below to get an idea of their own jhakkas style.

Went for a team lunch. For entree ordered a non veg platter which had galaoti kebab, fish and chicken tikka. All the kebab were pretty nice. Then came the main course. Ordered garlic nun, butter nun, warqi paratha in breads. The warqi paratha is a must try extremly delicate and flaky in texture, the nuns were also pretty great. For sides we had murg babumoshai, murg tikka lababdar and rahra gosht. Loved everyone of them but my favourite was the rahra gosht. Then  came the time for some theatre in the dessert section where we ordered Hazaro khwahishein, golmaal, jangal mein mangal. Their presentation was superb but somewhere I found them to be quite average in terms of taste. Nothing too much spectacular in terms of taste. Rated it an extra 0.5 for the presentation, decor and funky names of the dishes.

We need more places like this. A totally new concept they made emphasis to the presentation which itself is the first eye catching thing. Interior was Ohkay not that much good, but food is 5/5 presentation and quality wise both. Highly recommendable their papri chat with frozen nitrogen, puchkas, the cholle bhaye, pizzas. I am surely if you are not a foodie it will turn you into one.

Ambience :
This place has movie star's photo frames all over the walls with one wall having graffiti related to Sholay and Gabbar theme. This place won't woo you with the interiors much but the presentation of the food will make you try them all.
Food :
Coming to the food, the taste is above outstanding. Delicious would be an understatement. We had Balaam puchkari, Gabbar's Galouti, potli Kebab, warqi paratha, garlic Naan, butter Naan, murg Tikka lababdar and panner Tikka and luscious Laila. Presentation of the food was a delightful surprise. They have a lot veg options. Must try is Gabbar's Galouti and potli Kebab. It's a five star from me for the food.
Service :
The service was also extremely good. They would help you out to choose the food and serve them with real good care which would please. Their service would make you feel that they are actually happy to have you at their place.
Budget :
The taste would make up for the price. This is must try place in the city according to me . This is the first time I wouldn't have to think twice before giving it a five star.

What to say about this restaurant. Any review will not be able to describe this restaurant. Starting from the name itself. The name perfectly coincides with the Desi theme. The ambience has a filmy touch matching with the name. Each & every dish too has a filmy tag line. The dishes are being presented in the best dramatic way possible. Saying it all, they never compromise with the taste & quality of the food. The staff are so friendly & helpful. The place can be marked for any occasion, whether it's a dinner date or a family dine. Will definitely pay a visit soon. Looking forward for some more mesmerising dishes along with presentation.
Great work. Keep it up. Best wishes.

It was in my wish list from couple of months. Last Saturday I got a chance to visit this amazing restaurant. This is truely a great place to spend some time with friends and families. Ambience is very good and staffs are very polite. Now coming to food.
We got Andaz apna apna as complementary which just look like raw egg. It is actually mango bubble served in coconut water. We ordered Chicken Potli Kebab and gabbar Ghotala as starter. 

Chicken potli kebab is tandoori kebab staffed with chicken keema and presented very nicely. This is really a good innovative idea. It was nice and juicy but I think chicken keema could have been little more tasty. 

Gabbar Ghotala is something I would like to try again and again. This is mutton Keema served with egg poach and butter toasted Pav. It is just flawless.

We took kaffir litchi mojito and virgin classic Mojito both were very refreshing.

We ordered chicken babumoshai and warqi Paratha. Warqi Paratha is very tasty. I could not even think a partha can be this much tasty. But it is so rich that you can not have more than one.
Chicken babumoshai gravy was just outstanding.

Our waiter suggested us Dhoom macha le as desert. I must say it was a perfect end of our meal. Presentation with liquid nitrogen was very unusual. Mango and chocolate combination we liked very much. Mango was so refreshing that it was making sure that desert is not over sweetened.
This is really a must visit place. 

Only one thing they charged 5% as service charge but I think this should be completely voluntary not mandatory. Their   Hospitality and food is so good that everybody will be paying a good tip but making it mandatory is not good thing as per my view.

We ordered food like 2min spring rolls which was okish sweet chilly prwn same okish..Cheese balls except the potli kabab it was delicious .As compared to the other 2 items..3 mocktalis and 3three food items and one cocktails which they bill around 3k like no use it's not at all worth full of 3k..!

While the food may look deceptively decent, you would want to check the quality before eating. And I mean at a clinical laboratory. A friend and I were there over lunch on Wed, and we have been regretting immensely since. Massive food poisoning - both of us. And we were recommended most of the stuff we had. I'd suggest steer clear of the non-veg stuff. In fact steer very clear of the place - there are so many better places to go to in the neighborhood. And yes, the service wasn't that great either.

With the famous villain in Bollywood history.. may be the most famous one, comes a resto bar is enough to attract your attention. And when goes by the reviews, it is enough provoking. So, gabbar was in wishlist for a while.
And at last we decided to put our step there on a special day, as it was one of our friends birthday.

Location:
_____________

It's located in Ho Chi Min sarani, very near to the American centre.

Decoration and Ambiance:
_____________________________

It's environment it's pretty decent, wall are decorated with famous Bollywood dialogue. And yes you will have the graphiti of the Sholay characters. On the other walls you will find the different picture and frames of Bollywood.

Food and beverages:
_______________________

Now coming to the main section, yes food. Let me tell you one thing, they come with some out of the box preparation and presentation. The fusion of food and drink and presentation will surely blow your mind.

¬© Starters:
‚úì Balam Puchkari : this is the gabbar style fuchka. Owsum presentation. It is basically the suji fuchka. And the chatni is presented in two tubes in a flux having dry ice in it. So it was a thrilling experience visually. It taste good but not that fantastic.

‚úì Gabbar's Ghotala : this is basically paw bhaji with mutton keema. It taste fantastic.

‚úì Papdi Chat v 2.0 : this is just insane. Owssum. Papdi chat with liquid nitrogen twist. Freeze smokey Papdi chat.

‚úì Gabbar's Galuti Kebab : presentation is owssum again. Three galauti kebab wrapped in shreemal paratha presented on a baking oven. The kebab itself was good. But I didn't like the taste of the paratha. So little disappointment. If you want to try their galauti kebab just opted for plain galauti kebab.

Beverages:
_____________

This section is surely needed a special mention. Every items we tested from cocktail to mocktail is something to be appreciated.

‚úì Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito : Kaffir Lime crushed with litchi with ice and soda. This one just fantastic. Refreshing. The presentation will blow your mind 1st of all when you see a kettle and smoke ( from dry ice. ) Coming out of it. It's nothing to remind you the aladin. And then when took a sip of it, we just felt this is the best I can ask for in a warm, humid weather.

‚úì watermelon Basil Mojito: watermelon with perfectly Fusion with Basil leaf. Another super mojito.
Just owssum.

‚úì Mehebooba Main Dooba (cocktail) - this one is presented in a bottle with cutting glass. Yes, gives you total daru presentation :D
And the taste is just owssum. Tequila presented with lychee and lemon grass. Superb one.

‚úì Santa Banta vodka shikanji ( cocktail) - Another great fusion. As the name suggests it is Vodka with nimbu and masala. Not Extraorvdinary but pretty good.

‚úì Mirchi Munni : white rum along with the curry leaf and green chili. The falvour of green chili and curry leaf was going just amazing with the drink. Amazing one.

¬© Main Courses:
__________________

We were mostly full with so many items. So tasted only a few items in main courses.

‚úì Gabbar's ki ma ki Dal - in simple it's Dal Makhani. And it taste just superb.

‚úì Ghost Rara: mutton dish. Taste very good. 3 pieces of mutton , well cooked.

‚úì Chicken Babumosai : this one is just owssum. When chicken taste superb after having Mutton, that means this dish has the X factor in taste for sure. This dish having the with bone and bonless pieces together.

Along with that we took 2 nun.

¬© Desserts:
_______________
Honestly we planned to taste lot of their desserts. But the stomach was full enough by that time. So, just one in this section.

‚úì Goolmaal : it's a choclate ball. Okay it is not the only thing. There is a goolmaal, let's put some hot chocolate on the ball and let that mold. Visual treat and that taste equally superb.

That is all we had in food. But wait the presented a complimentary dish. Egg cage. So, you have a nest with three broken egg. And you need to eat it in a shot. Superb one. By the way it just look like a replica of egg, it is actually coconut water with a mango bubble. And that just extract when you have it in mouth. üëå

---------------------------------

As I mentioned there we celebrated our friend birthday there. And the hospitality of all the person there was really good. Thanks for that :)

--------------------------------
All that cost 5200 for 4 people. Little bit expensive.

To all : it's an experience to be there. To taste the out of the box unique dish. So give it a try.

And btw this visit was after GST applicable.

To management:
------------------------------
you guys are doing superb. Amazing presentation, hospitality and taste of food.

Now a question: is the service charge was earlier there or you guys started to put it in bill after GST?

Gabbar's has been on my wishlist since a very long time. Finally could tick that off with a heavy three course lunch this Sunday at this place. One word for the aura and architecture this place provides: Fun! Be it a shawl clad Sholay's Thakur on the wall, the angry young man Amitabh, the glamorous Kareena or the all-about-bollywood top music going on..It plays with your pet ka keera and the filmy keera as well.
In the drinks we went for L'affair Paris, Virgin Mojito Mirchi maar ke and the Watermelon Basil mojito. All three of them were high on flavour, chilled and perfect summer escape you can ask for. L'affair paris having a strong cranberry & pomegranate flavour with just the perfect amount of Ice would be the winner.
In the appetizers I was totally blown by their Chicken Potli Kebab. Please whenever at Gabbar's don't forget to try this dish. Juicy delicious tandoored chicken with minced chicken stuffing inside, falling off the bones. Simply mouthwatering. We also tried their molecular gastronomy special Balam Pichkari. They have done good work with the Phuchkas with a very tasty imli & green chatni, but I would prefer our good old roadside unhealthy Kolkata phuchka anyday.
Coming to the main course, their Murgh Tawaa Biriyani was quite tasty, had a different taste of it's own than normal handi biriyani with small chicken pieces, fairly sufficient for two. The best of the main course would be the buttery delicious Chicken Babumoshai. Accompanied with lovely Warqi Parathas, the gravy was to die for. Loved the dish. This would surely be my choice again the next time I visit them.
Ended our meal with two of their famous desserts, Hazaroon Khwaishein Aisi and Golmaal. The Golmaal was lovely, and is a paradise for a chocolate lover. Dark chocolate outside and rich chocolate mousse inside, Golmaal would surely make a foodie's world go round. I found the Hazaron Khwaishein aisi a bit overrated, the presentation was lovely, had an ordinary taste as far as the brownie was concerned.
The staff here does the best they can for you. They are warm, courteous, asking for your feedback after each meal and even recommending dishes according to your taste, I would give them a clear thumbs up in this department. 
All in all Gabbar was lovely, the service the food the ambience all make your experience worthwhile. The hype is totally justified and your taste buds are satisfied like anything. Do visit. I will soon!

Ambiance - unique. 4
Not too loud, can take your family along with kids though it is a bar. Nice decor with Bollywood theme.

Food - tasty, really good. 5
We had rara mutton. Best mutton i had in a restaurant. Murg malai kebab was very good. Even it tasted good when it was cold. This is rare for any kind of kebab. The tequila drink was so good and refreshing. The fish kebab in the migambo platter has scope for improvement. And don't miss the welcome drino

Presentation - thoughtful. 5
From welcome drink in eggshell, to presenting galau to kebab in. A truck to chicken drumstick in a Brocken bottle to mint chutney in small pressure cooker we kept amused in each menu item. And the bottle for drinks worth mentioning, it had bollywood touch.

Behaviour - best I have seen to far. 5
Talks to kids like real, no formality. Always smiling face. Even if I correct something, it was accepted as a younger brother. Amazing. Not sure how can they manage it.

Tips, book in advance if planning post 9 pm

The rating of 4.4 is what made me check out this place near Russle Street Area. For people who are looking for value for money places, this restaurant is not for you. The rates are way too high for simplest of dishes. A masala papad for Rs.195 plus taxes because it is made fancy by giving the masala separate and adding a mayo dip in extras. ¬†

Location and Parking:

______________

Located near Russle Street and to my pleasant surprise they have valet parking available, which is not the case which 90% restaurants in the area.

Ambiance and decorations:

_____________________________

A hardcore Bollywood theme Decor and a 5 on 5 for the decor. Very chic, creative and gives you a feel of sitting in a film studio. Seating is however very very congested. My elbow kept rubbing with the handbag a lady on the next table had hung on her chair. A big downside is the excessive noise due to the congested seating. Our entire dining experience was spoiled because of the noise and either a customer or a service person continuously being inches away from the table.¬†

Now coming to food:

____________________________________

They have a good range of items in the menu. The presentation is unique and very creative. We tried the below things.

‚úì DIY Papad: Okiesh. Nothing great, nothing bad. As i mentioned earlier, its a regular masala papad made fancy by giving the masala separate and adding a mayo dip. Out of the 3 topping options, we had the same salad repeated in 2. May be they ran out of the 3rd item.
‚úì Galouti Kebabs : Nicely made. Soft and tender meat.
‚úì Pao Bhaji Founde: This was the winning dish of the evening. Presented like a cheese fondue with Bhaji in the bowl and small paos for dipping 
in the Bhaji. Very tasty and a must have when you go.
‚úì Yellow Dal : Nothing special. It was ok.
‚úì Paneer Butter Masala : Disappointing as the flavor of Elachi was too pungent.
‚úì Roam Ali Pizza : Decent in taste. Toppings were good. 

Dessert:

_____________

Jalebi Bai - They changed the shape of the jalebi like that of Boondi. Small balls of jalebi served with some delicious rabri. Another must have when you dine there.

To sum up the review - Decent Food, people who can afford it may try it out. But go only with the purpose of eating a coming back. Do not go expect a comfortable dining experience.

Andaz apna apna was a complimentary mouth freshner which is basically mango with coconut water. We tried the Gabbar's drumstick which was crisp on the outside and juicy inside, perfectly tossed in basil chilli sauce. Then we tried tandoori roti and chicken babumoshai. Chicken babumosai was amazing and very much recommended, it comes in a mix of boneless and bone piece, very well cooked and tasty. For the dessert section first we tried "jalebi bai", it was basically jalebi with rabdi but with a twist. Amazing presentation. We also tried the hazaron khawashein aisi..which is a chocolate mudpie with ice-cream and oreo. The presentation was something very new. Also, try the molecular pan. A must visit to treat your taste buds and eyes.

Finally got a chance to visit this place.....simply loved it! It was such a super experience from the ambience to d food to the entire presentation everything was lovely!
The starters were great specially the gabbars galouti, chilli honey prawns and the chicken makhmali. Definitely can't forget the paani Puri served in style but the taste was great too. The other galouti was nothing great thought the paratha that came with it was very hard.
The main course we ordered Warqi paratha which was too good along with naans and pudina paratha. The ghosht rarah was simply superb. Not too masaledar yet full of flavours and the same with chicken makhni.
The chicken Biryani was also yummy in its own way can't compare it to d kolkata Biryani but it has its own flavours which was a refreshing change!
Went their with our family n everyone enjoyed the food. Definitely going bk soon!

Totally worth it !! Our order was sumptuous! They welcomed us with a mango shot that was placed in a half open egg like container, talk about being innovative in presentation the starter named gabbar's galouti kebab was served on mini paranthas which melts inside your mouth! Next the chelo kebab is also really mouth watering served in an innovative manner. Last but not the least the molecular paan tops it! The person named Deepak who served us was equally courteous and welcoming .

Heard a very mixed review about this place. No honestly went with an open mind.

Was served the complimentary mango pulp in a bird nest... nice presentation.. more to come..

Paneer Tikka - was nice and juicy.

Bacchan Sahab Ke Kabab platter - was just okay

For the mains, 

1. paneer butter masala was just pathetic and over cooked

2. Maa ki Daal - was nice and fresh

3. Chinese - both vegetable coin in Manchurian sauce and Hakka noodles were quite a drag. 

Desserts - Hazaaro khwahish aise made the day and was really nice...

Overall it was an okay place with the interiors and presentation saving the day.

I visited this place few days ago at 4 pm.They didnot serve indian food during this period 3-7pm.so we ordered luscious laila and kala khatta from drinks section. kala khatta was good but luscious laila was overhanged with strong pan flavour which destroys the taste of watermelon. They served us one complimentary drink which looks like eggshell tastes like orange mouse in coconut water.. Then, we ate starters- golden fried baby corn and devils chicken... both was good and tasty.. specially golden fried baby corn was supersoft and the presentation was classic.At last we ate main course pasta alfredo which was mouth watering and best of all.. overall experience was good.

Frankly, an ovehyped and over rated place! We ordered Balam Puchkari with the expectation of having a different "gastronomic" experience. Turned out to be such an excruciating task to even eat more than 2 pieces.
The Mac gold coin is a deceiving name. It's more like cheese and carrot croquette.

Everything was fine with the service until the server just placed the bill on the table when we had just started eating our dessert and had not even asked for the bill... What a wonderful way to shoo customers away quickly in order to accommodate more customers.

The only thing that tasted good was the complementary "andaz apna apna"

P.s - the prices charged are for photos and not for quality food.

Dekho mujhe befizool.batein karne ki adaat to hai nai..To baat yeh hai ki Gabbar jaisa koi nai..I am a fan of their Mojito so we began with a pitcher of the lemon chilli mojito followed by a bucket of carlsberg. Our server helped us with our choice of starters.

1.Chicken potli kebab
2.Gabbar ghotala
3.Mogambo khush hua
2.Truffle Mushroom Kulcha

The chicken potli kebab was big juicy succulent chicken pieces stuffed and presented with a side of a green chutney.Gabbar ghotala came in a tiffin box with a sunny side up sitting right on top of a spicy keema curry with golden toasted pavs.Just dip and enjoy.Mogambo khush hua was an assorted kebab platter with quite a few varieties.Lastly my love for mushroom didn't dissapointed‚Äã me as the truffle oil kulchas were the star of the evening.The soft kulchas with mushroom and truffle oil filling accompanied by daal makhani as a side ---who said vegetarian food cannot be delicious

Main course was next.Our orders

1.Cheese olive garlic naan
2.Ghosht Rara
3.Masala Kulcha
4.Makkhan singh butter chicken

Loaded with black olives and garlic the naan made a pretty picture sitting in the bread basket.Paired with the spicy mutton gravy it tasted heavenly .Flavour explosions in my mouth and a happy tummy.My friend mentioned that his butter chicken was okay as well as the Kulcha.

Finally the "Akhri Manzil " included Hazaron khawaishi hai aisi which came as a potted plant.As u dig in the first layer of oreo sil you discover a layers of icecream and finaly a moist chocolate cake at the bottom.Gooey and moist this chocolate dish could make you go gaga.Akhri manzil was a complement from the chef which had mango pulp spheres in coconut reduction --Intruiged as always with Gabbar.As the next tray approached we could see fumes coming out of the beaker.Dhoom macha le is a dessert that would make your palette go swinging.A chocolate dome filled with cubes of mangoes and ice cream and sponge cake deconstructed and plated artistically . Team Gabbars you revived old classics in the utmost innovative molecular gastronomical way possible and we love what we see.

I am writing this review after my second visit to Gabbar's. I was invited by a friend for a blogger's meet on the occasion of their new menu launch which resulted in my second visit.
The comfortable seatings and filmy overdose all around just add to its chilled out ambience. With movie quotes plastered on the walls to dishes being named after movies, Gabbar's is an ode to the extravaganza that is Bollywood!
One of the stand out restaurants with molecular gastronomy as their theme, the innovation and presentation of food and drinks here is at its peak.
A quick rundown of the new menu will give you additions like
Gabbar's galouti: awadhi galouti served on mini sheermals abs baked in the oven. An absolute favorite.
Chand ka tukra paneer: crescent shaped malai paneer baked to perfection!
Mezze platter: comprising of falafel, hummus, pita and much more!
Andaaz apna apna: No word will be good enough to describe this dessert. A beautiful dessert compromising of mango pulp and coconut water served in the most creative way possible in ceramic eggs!
Yeh Dil maange more: Yet another masterpiece from Gabbar's. Fresh raspberry mousse covered in chocolate truffle and glazed with edible gold dust!

Other additions include the Bollywood themed new menu for cocktails and mocktails named as the Anarkali menu.
The menu is specially curated for summers using summer fruits and fresh herbs and the names, the names does not get anymore filmy with Luscious Laila and Chamatki chameli.

A huge thumbs up and is a must visit with friends and family.

First meal ever in Calcutta, and I must thank Gabbar's for making it special. 
The food here is on point. Large quantities, which makes it 6/5 on the value for money scale + absolutely delectable food.

We had galouti kebabs for starters, and not only was it reminiscent of UP, but the presentation was quirky - to a level I'd never seen before. Do hit me up if you find any other place that serves chutney in a mini pressure cooker.

The drinks went well with the Bollywood theme. Cool and refreshing, just what you need in the humid Calcutta weather. 

There was some problem in the gas, which made it a bit difficult to cook Chinese and Indian. They told us it would be difficult, and the food would take a little longer than expected. They recommended we take Italian, since the gas pipe might take longer than usual to fix, but their technicians were on it pronto. In the interim, we got shots on the house to compensate for the delay, which was a really sweet gesture.

The cherry on the cake was the dessert however. (I dont want to allow Zomato to access my entire gallery, but will attempt to describe it). It was a small piece of cake, with 'sorry' written in chocolate sauce below it. You beautiful people at Gabbar's, you sure know how to make customer experience count. This is by far the most memorable meal I've ever had, in all the cities I've visited in India and abroad. I love this place. Will definitely send all foodies your way <3

Ordered an inordinate number of dishes off the menu considering there were just two of us sticking only to the recommendations. The food in terms of purely how good it tasted was up there with any place I have dined at. And there was the added bit to it. There was a surprise with every single dish. And every one of the savoury dishes were perfect. If I could ever talk about not meeting up to the standards you set for yourself, then perhaps the desserts were a bit too one dimensional. But if I don't nitpick, amazing food. Wont go into the details of every dish, but all of them kept surprising us with how good it tasted. You can have all the gimmicks in the world, but it eventually does boil down to taste. And Gabbar delivered. Lovely service as well. Enough suggestions to be informative without being persuasive.

Kolkata.. my love is flourishing with lounges and pubs all around.. some are really intersting .. Gabbars is one of such lounges. While my short stay in kolkata i decided to explore a new place and i came across the name "Gabbar's" in zomato.. This place surely serves the raunchy bollywood style cocktails with super intersting name... as the name suggests, the decor is quintesntially bollywood.. we ordered for some cocktails and starters. I went by the most interestin name in the menu. üòâ so we opted for mirchi munni, chamakti chameli, boozy doll in in the cocktails. Mirchi munni is a perfect combination of teekha and khatta with rum in it to tickle ur senses.. chamakti chameli is refreshing with cucumber essence and vodka.. boozy doll is equally tantalising .. for food we went by the recommendation of the staff and ordered for chicken potli kebab and lat me kai. The potli kebab is really something new which is a must try.. the kebab was soft with an enriched taste with stuffing inside.. lat me kai was a chinese preparation which was equally good.. The mention of the staff is quite important here who takes personal care of the customers and helps in suggesting the right food. The staffs are cordial, helpful and prompt. A special thanks to Nabil and Ekbal who took all the care to serve us the right food and the drinks. So this place ia a must try for people who are in a mood to explore an intersting new bar and kitchen which the city has to offer.

Had reserved my table in advance through Zomato, so, I would also like to thank Zomato for enabling me reserve the table.
The restaurant‚Äã has a neat and calm ambience.
The decor is also catchy with cool quotes from various bollywood movies.
The service staff were extremely calm and assisting.
The service was smooth and quick.
The food served was nicely dressed and was also delicious.
However, the only let down was the air conditioning as it wasn't operational.
Looking forward to a better experience in my next visit.

Brother in arms to other molecular-gastronomy joints around park Street & Camac street, Gabbar has its own charm added to the food by its ever-smiling-service and nostalgia of Hindi cinema. The food is old wine served in Absolutely new bottle. The Maggi spring roll, rumali roti pizza and and Mac & cheese gold coin are all.known comfort food but served in a very unique manner. The cocktails were also well made, very researched on taste combinations and served quirkily. If Luscious Laila, Mirchi Munni & Boozy doll was not enough Gabbar has a drink on its menu on my pet name, Chintoo. I so loved it. Even the mirchi mar ke mojito was not bad. They even served a molecular mango mocktail with lychee, on the house, which u need to see to believe. The Bollywood nostalgia coupled with great food and cocktails make it a 9/10 for me. It's a complete value for money. Parking may be an issue, so enquire before hand.

'Molecular Gastronomic Preparations', sounds attractive isn't it?? Well that was the sole reason of our visit to Gabbar's. Their popular dishes are made up of using liquid nitrogens. The ambiance is perfect with a Bollywood touch to it. Slow music is played at the background of popular Bollywood Hits.The place is tightly packed and quite noisy. The service is slow due to the rush.
Coming to the food we opted for :
Starters
BALAM PUCHKARI :  Presentation was pretty enough to impress but the taste fail to impress me. The
Sweet chutney with it was good.
MURGH MALAI NAZAKATH: It was delicious in taste and the chicken pieces were tender.

Main Course
PEAS PULAO : Quantity was good and good in taste
CHICKEN BABUMOSHAI :Very tasty.RECOMMENDED

KOCHU PATAR JHOL: Mutton curry with steamed rice 

Dessert : 
MANGO CIGARS : (4/5)
HAZARON KHWAISHEN AISI : (5/5)
Both the desserts‚Äã were presented amazingly.

The pocket pinch was high. The behaviour of the staff is good. Last but not the least the BEER'S KNEES was the best COCKTAIL I had.
RECOMMENDED

It was an absolutely unique experience at Gabbar's. The concept of fusion food is taken at a different level; be it the ingredients, be it the presentation or the taste, everything was precise. We were served by a very friendly and helpful guy named Mohammed Suraj who ensured that we were explained about the dish before it was served. Just one little catch; if the air-conditioner would have worked with the same precision with which the food was prepared I would have given them a perfect score.

The place is extremely well decked up. The food and alcohol is served with the personal touch, which is a plus. I had ordered these prawns and was not satisfied with the frying layer. I was extremely satisfied with the service staff who had the serving replaced with the way we expected it to be done.
The light setup is a little flawed as it begins to hurt the eye given its direct glare. I hope that could be taken in note when the place is up for makeover.

So we basically visited Gabbar's to try their molecular gastronomic preparations using liquid nitrogens,some of their popular dishes.
I was really excited as well as skeptical about how the taste will be.
Pictures on zomato show that presentation is perfect and we had already chosen the dishes we will try.
Its a beautiful place with bollywood dialogues scribbled on wall and thats totally cool.

The gastronomic items we tried are-Litchi Kaafir Mojito,Balam Phuchkari and Jalebi bai.

‚Ä¢Litchi Kaafir Mojito-The taste of this mocktail is very nice and served with crushed ice.Its refreshing.Serves two.Comes in a pot with liquid nitrogen,chilled and a treat to the eyes.

‚Ä¢Balam Phuchkari-Eight phuckas served on scoops.Presentation is beautiful.The phuckas have green emulsified tamarind molecules on it.Served with tamarind water and sweet chutney in a glass pot of steamy liquid nitrogen.Recommended.

‚Ä¢Jalebi Bai-Since nolen gur cigars were unavailable,we tried this.And we were not at all disappointed.Tiny jalebi boondes soaked in syrup,served in a beaker with liquid nitrigen below.It comes with a glass full of rabri.This tastes heavenly.

Now coming to the "Gabbar Recomends" food we tried-Khow Suey Mela and Murg Malai Nizakat Kebab.

‚Ä¢Khow Suey Mela-A ferris wheel never being used in such an innovative way.This is basically a Burmese dish.Khwa suey is a yellow broth with coconut milk and vegetables.Comes with 4 spring rolls filled with noodles.And the buckets in the wheel has the add ons require.The ultimate thing tasted so delicious.

‚Ä¢Murg Malai Nizakat Kebab-6 pieces of supertasty,succulent chicken pieces which melts in the mouth and kept us wanting for more.I am a fan of their kebab now.Highly recommended.

It was an amazing experience here.
Prices are high but its absolutely worth it.
They levy almost 27% taxes.
Service is prompt.
If you are visiting this place,surely try their gastronomic preparations and kebabs.
Staffs are friendly.
The rocking bollywood music will add to the happy mood.

1. The ambience of this place gives a look of old bollywood. Fully Filmy... 
2. The presentation is really good.
3. The menu of this place is different so you will be interested with the new names.
4. The dessert of this place is just amazing.
5. The staff are really helpful and you could rely to their suggestions just like I relied on Muhammad Iqbal.
So if you want to try something amazing then you should surely come here. 
Gabbar and samba are waiting for new customers.

A much talked about place, so went with a lot of anticipation. Definitely not disappointed. The warm quirky decor depicting Bollywood pictures & the popular Bollywood songs playing in the background was very welcoming. The staff were very friendly & the molecular gastronomy was a real treat. 
Each item was presented in a unique way which was an art in itself. This is one of those restaurants where all items starting from the cocktails, mocktails & ending in desserts tasted equally awesome. 
The complimentary Caramel Lollypop was great. The Chelo Kebab came in a truck & leaves no room for any kind of competition. The Galouti Kebab melted in the mouth & loved the taste of the sweetish biscuit like tiny parathas that came along with it. The Mushroom Risotto was yummy & Rome Ali Pizza is a must try. Chand ka Tukda Paneer was soft & delicious. Must try the cocktail Mirchi Munni.
Though there was hardly any place for desserts, still couldn't resist the temptation of Golmaal. It will transport you to heaven. It's a chocolate ball filled with mousse covered in chocolate sauce.
Would surely go back again n again to try each & every item in their menu.

Nice decor ....
Wanted to taste the molecular gastronomy - Starting off with the Pao Bhaji Fondue - small cheddar buns with hot sizzling bhaji - served in style - only i felt the Bhaji was a little too sour according to my tastebuds .
Loved the Tsing Hoi Potatoes which was very tangy ,¬†
The American Chopseuy had the perfect sweet and sour vegetable . Did not have any place for deserts .... In between we were served a Mango Coconut refreshment ¬†molecular drink ¬†- pretty good .

Gabbar is my go to place for excellent food that is easy on the pocket. The Mirchi marke mojito is innovative and delicious in cocktails. Have tried many of their special starters, pav bhaji fondue and balam puchkari stand out. Such great food which is a fest to not only the eyes but the tongue also is rare to find. Loved the Mongolian rice, garlic fried rice and gabbar ki ma ki dal. The desserts are really tasty n innovative. The mango cigars and hazaro khwahishei aisi are a must try. Special mention to Md. Suraj who suggested good dishes to us and served us well.

If only the decor and the fancy sounding menu could translate into good food. But alas it did not. Ordered a basic butter chicken and naan to take it for a spin and it failed and how. Sadly Makkhan Singh did not get the recipe right for the butter chicken, from whoever's mother he took the recipe from. It was no where close to a butter chicken - in fact I had a good mind to ask them if they had served me the better chicken, but the bill said so. It seemed like pieces of chicken thrown in a "ready mix curry". The last time I had had something so synthetic was in an Indian restaurant in Israel. But they can be excused, but here, it is unforgivable. The naan was "stretchy".

I guess you needed to down a few of their fancy drinks to enjoy their food - but I alas, had gone there hungry and hoping for a good lunch - but it failed to deliver.

Gabbar - I won't be seeing you in a hurry!

Inspired by the ever popular Hindi movie Sholay, Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen is known for its quirky innovative food presentations and molecular gastronomy.

Right from the kitschy graffiti on the brick-styled walls, framed classic Hindi film posters, photographs of old and contemporary Bollywood movie stars, to the quaint light bulb chandeliers, everything about this place spells 'Bollywood.'

The staff were very efficient and polite enough to seat us at our table. Hospitality and warmth of reception is to be specially noted.

Coming to the food, apart from the Antiquity Blue whiskey, I personally ordered the L' Affaire Paris mocktail as suggested by the server, which was this absolutely mindblowing fruity concoction of cranberry, pomegranate and lime. Served in an attractive cocktail glass the drink was very refreshing after the summer heat in the dim cool interior, for we'd visited it for lunch.

They also presented us with a complimentary drink called Andaz Apna Apna that can be used as mouth-freshener. Made of mango and coconut water, it was served in tiny eggshell-shaped cups presented in a nest, and the drink too looked like that of the liquid circular yellowish-orange yolk floating inside the shell.

We ordered their newly launched Chelo Kabab (the Iranian national dish popularised by Peter Cat), which was this amazing dish of rice, egg, and delicious mouthwatering kebabs.
Presented in a steaming hot colourful box painted with the word 'Lockup' on its sides, two platefuls of Chelow Kababs were enough to replete our hungry stomachs, such that we declined any offer to try out their new dessert items.

Lastly the bill came in a cute tin box on a cute little mock charpoy! Quite an out-of-the-box concept indeed!

Fans of Sholay/Bollywood, and those fond of North Indian cuisine would surely love this Bollywood-themed casual dining restaurant, to enjoy a gastronomic journey of lip-smacking dishes amidst Desi beats and their favourite Bolly music.

Went there with two of my friends.It is a restaurant with a bollywood theme.So they took every effort to give that restaurant look in a certain way.They have a wide space inside. There were full of posters and frames of bollywood celebrities. Bollywood songs were played in the background. So it was fun.
Coming to food they have long recipe list and I found each of those name quite funnyüòÅ.Anyway we ordered kebab platter along with some amazing drinks.There were Italian itch, LA fai're and also we took their signature drink Ab Gola kha.It was a cocktail. Then we took Balam Puchkari. And I must say that they know the Art of Presenting.Their presentation is 10/10.You will feel keeping their food as showpiece instead of eating it.Anyway lastly we took chocolate bomb.It blew my mind completely. 
So, here you can have the total entertainment be it their unique names of the dishes or their styles of presenting food.You will be satisfied.

Food - that became the sad part yesterday on our visit! This is my 2nd visit to Gabbar's and we had ordered DIY Masala Papad in which the papad weren't properly roasted..we had also ordered mini kulcha with pindi chana on top of that (highway di shaan...as the name of the dish goes) but to our surprise it had pieces of nails in that which was bought to the notice of the staff members and they were very sorry that this thing happened to their guests but the chef was nowhere to be seen!!! Surely this was the last visit to this place...

The place is done in happy colours and art. The staff are quite hospitable. We had ordered for sangria, shots and starters. The food is quite good, the drinks better. 
They also offer their caramel lollipop dessert and appetisers during your stay at the restaurant, which is a nice and happy touch.

We had heard a lot about Gabbar's so we decided to give it a visited,it is located in Ho Chi Minh Sarani,the lane just opposite to the WestSide Building in Camac Street.As we entered we found the ambience to be quite noisy as there were a lot of customers,the music and the pictures on the wall gave a bollywood feel.Coming to the food for starters we ordered the Balam Puchkari about which we were very excited and it really was a treat to the eyes but the taste of it was nothing great,really bland,roadside vendors sell much better pani puris,the other starter we ordered were Murgh Malai Nazakath which were really very tasty and tender,coming to the main course we ordered the peas pulao,chicken babumoshai and kochu patar jhol (mutton curry with steamed rice) all the dishes were good specially the chicken babumoshai had a very tasty gravy and then the desserts which were my favorite part we opted for Mango Cigars as Nolen Gur Cigars were not available and Hazaron Khwaishen Aisi (Chocolate Mud Pie With Oreo Soil) both were great and the Hazaros Khwaishem Aisi was a perfect end to a meal.The service was good but they were a little slow with a few of the dishes maybe because of the rush and the pocket pinch was a little high but it was worth it
P.S. Beer's Knees was one of the best beer cocktail I have had,really refreshing.

I have been meaning to go to this place for a long time now, and Yesterday when I finally did, I was more than just happy!! 
My undying love for food took me to this place and it surely was worth it. 

Resonating with its name, this Restaurant has a full firmly, masaledaar, Sholay themed decor ( cz obviously) , with just the perfect amount of lighti@ng and music they play was also fully bollywood! 

Coming to food, with the advent of the molecular gastronomy, every food is now an art presentation and I particularly believe in the idea that a food has to be appealing to the eyes! 

We ordered for Papri chat which was superb as it was literally cold ( like it just came out of the freezer) all thanks to the liquid nitrogen technique! 
With the correct balance of sweet, spicy and tangy it was definitely a great try! 
Next we ordered for Dahi seekh kebab and it was superb too. Being a fan of the tandoori items I loved how it was so soft that it melting in my mouth, and it was served along with a yoghurt dip and green chutney! 
We also tried for Wanton salt and pepper and it wasn't disappointing at all. Fried wanton tossed in pepper and salt with the schezwan sauce for just super! (I'm a foodie, I love Chinese tooo) 
After all this we dint have space for main course so I m gonna try that again sometime soon. (CZ u gotta save space for desserts) 

Drinks- We ordered for A beer, a Virgin Mohito mirchi maar ke which had green chillies in it also the spicy flavour was fresh, and Litchi and Kaafir lime which is their signature drink ! All of them were super yum and refreshing to beat the heat! 
Also they gave us complimentary Andaz apna apna shots which were basically egg cup like shot glasses filled with coconut water and mango sphere ( made again by the molecular gastronomy technique) 

For desserts- I was almost going to order 2 (why not?) But finally decided to have one- Hazaro Khawaishe Aisi- which is gooey chocolate mudpie served with chocolate sauce and oreo soil.
Take my word for it, the dessert will not disappoint u and just leave you hungry for more. It easy so goood. Super yummy points for that!! 

Pricing- I would say a tad bit overpriced but at the cost of the presentation and molecular gastronomy and the taste, you can just waiver that off!! 
Go with your family or friends you won't regret it for sure! 

Service- extra points for that because the service is seriously commendable and the staff is very attentive, warm and they suggest you their best food! 5/5. 

Thankyou Gabbars for a great time!! Hoping to come back soon for another gastronomic experience!

If you love all things filmi and want to enjoy a great meal at a Bollywood themed restaurant in the heart of Kolkata, this is where you need to be! First the ambience - pretty much the same as when it was amigos with a lot of Bollywood paraphernalia added. But somehow it works pretty well with the theme and adds a nice bit of character to the place.

Next the grub - As we were just three of us, we ordered simply - one garlic nan, two butter nans, gabbar ki Maa ki dal (their take on dal makhani) and one makkhan singh's butter chicken. The food was nice, with a decent dal makhani that was not the best in town but pretty good nonetheless. I always prefer to go purist on my first visit to any restaurant to see how it stacks up against contemporaries... Anyways, the butter chicken was rich with a thick orange tomato gravy served to us in style by MD. Suraj. Well done on the presentation and quantity; was more than sufficient for three of us.

Now for the best part of the meal, the dessert. I can safely tell you that this restaurant serves excellent desserts that are gastronomic delights for any foodie to enjoy. We tried the Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, which was one of the most beautifully crafted chocolate mud pie that we have ever seen or tasted anywhere (see pics below for more details and you'll understand what I mean)!

I am now dying to try the other favourites here like Golmaal, jalebi bai and their nitrogen powered jungle mein mangal! Next time for sure! Well worth a visit.

First things first, let's talk about the ambience. It was nothing short of impressive. Rustic decor spotted with vintage film posters and dialogues make it complete. The food was top-notch. Makkhan Singh's Butter Chicken and Chicken Babumoshai are two culinary masterpieces. The staff was quite friendly and offered us complimentary Mojito spheres, not one but two servings per person (photo attached). If you happen to visit Gabbar's, this mojito sphere is a must try. 

All in all, it was a great experience. Nothing extraordinary but the quality of food was unmatched. 

P..S. They lack a secondary power supply. We had to sit in this heat without lighting/cooling.

great "thoda hatke" ambience. felling of sitting in a movie set. mixture of traditional  and retro look. foods r slight overpriced but delicious. not so much of variety but real testy food . murgh tawa  biriyni and makkhan Singh butter chicken was awesome . kebabs here are also good. staffs are very polite and we'll behaved. restaurant decor is the excellent.

"Get your cameras out", said the server, as he got ready to serve up the Papri Chat version 2, and immediately I and my big band of five brothers - all of whom had landed up at Gabbar's to splurge the loots from a family wedding - got our camera phones out in lightnening speed. The party is about to begin we thought - and soon, after a lot of fancy smoke bellowing out from cans and all - we dug into our food  -  ice-cold papri chat, inadequately seasoned, and dry and what a bummer it was !  This should be renamed as Papri Chat Inedible Version Minus Zero Wannabe Molecular Gastronomy for the sake of Molecular Gastronomy, served for 300 bucks plus tax, by totally slaughtering the wonderfully flavoursome road-side Papri Chaat with gruesome culinary cruelty. 

The uninspiring mirchi mojito we had ordered wasn't enough to gulp it down. The two non-fancy items we ordered - a chilli potato something and one chill chicken something were both sweet and ordinary, a style remniscent of the gujarati everything I had during my stay in Gujarat. 

As we wrapped up the evening to move the party elsewhere, I couldn't help but notice other than me and my truant brothers, every other table was occupied with happy diners of smiling families. 

Probably this type of fancy food by introducing a new concept (albeit badly executed) and a lot of sweet palletted food, works well for the market that Gabbar caters to, and that seems like a very interesting study to do (but not to eat out, personally).

This is a gastronomic food restaurant in Kolkata; it's a good thing! However the food here was not as per the expectation - the use of techniques are very poor. The execution isn't flawless & they charge you same as any other restaurant serving such food. 
We had ordered
 papdi chaat - it was freezing cold and taste couldn't be enjoyed at all,
blue cheese kulcha - menu said it will be served with some dips; but they served it with Kali dal now that's not any dip for sure!
Paneer tikka - just okay
Aloo do pyaza - average
Paneer masala something- too spicy and tangy 
Rotis (Tandoori, Naan & laccha parantha) - all were quite hard despite mentioning to make it soft 
Desserts were my biggest disappointment- asked for jalebi with Rabri and got to know jalebi is something prepared with boondi (who does that), ordered Parsi kulfi - 30-40 bucks Kulfi tastes better than what was served and finally flower pot of dessert which was suppose to be major attraction. Looks were quite attractive but inside the pot wasn't as exciting.

Overall if you have already experienced some authentic molecular gastronomy pub or cafe; don't think this place is same! It's a half-hearted copied concept and they need to improve on quality especially food.

My first visit to this place...üòÑ
The first thing that attracted my eyes is the ambiance..soothing music at background sets ur mood for the day. 
And I am just mesmerized by the ambiance..reminds me the whole bollywood films that we watched growing up. 
The stuffs are very courteous and well behaved.. A guy named Dipak,welcomed us...and helped us in every way possible to what to order as we mentioned that this is our first visit....He descried their special signature dishes..how the food is cooked,and asked everytime if the food is ok..how are we enjoying it.. 
Their service is fast too..we ordered papdi chat and chicken potli kabab fr starter. Butter chicken and plain nan for maincourse and chclt mud pie for dessert. 
Their service is way too fast than other restros i hv visited. 
Loved the papdi chat and the kababs with a twist.
The butter chkn was so tasty..that the chicken just melts in your mouth.Hot ..mild spicy gravy with the big nun was enough fr two of us. 
And the  best part was the desert...served in a tub..with the mud pie at below and oreo soil..it tasted just heaven. 
I have just fallen in love with this place,the food..the ambiance and will visit soon. ü§ó

On the rife, restaurants are trying to be as much unique as they can, and Gabbar's is no exception. I visited Gabbar's around 15 days back. Talking turkey, I was mesmerised by the ambience. Every alcove of Gabbar's was dripping with the charm of Bollywood. We ordered Chintoo (the small LIIT), Nalen Gurer Cigar, Murgh Malai Nazaquat, Makkhan Singh's Butter  Chicken and Warqi Parantha. Chintoo was great, in fact it did give us a kick üòõ The murgh malai nazaquat was delicious with succulent pieces of chicken. The warqi parantha was light, yet rich in taste, and complemented amazingly with the absolutely delicious butter chicken. Bur, the nalen gurer cigar was the show stopper, served over dry ice, it gave a mystical feeling and we had imminent craving for a second helping. In between our dishes, we were also served complimentary mini spoon chaat and a superbly tasty caramel lolly lop. Our experience here at Gabbar's was extremely satiating, and I look forward to indulge more into the unique dishes of this place. The staffs were prompt, helpful and amicable. Indeed, Gabbar' Bar & Kitchen is highly recommended!!

Very good place with a very nostalgic decor specially for the 'Sholay' movie fans. But then again don't consider the food to be of that old days. Very good food and prices perfectly. The LIIT was one the best LIIT I had. Besides this the other items like the Kali dal, the special kebab platter whose name I don't remember was very good.
As for the decor part it was very much clean and tidy. For the pricing part yes it's a bit on the higher side but then again if you consider the quality of food then the price is worth paying.

I would give an average rating to this joint. The food was good but not extraordinary. You walk into any average North Indian restaurant and you would get similar quality. The dishes were named quite nicely and the ambience was good. Seemed a bit crammed but it was okay.We tried the Italian Itch mocktail and my son liked it a lot! The non veg kebab platter was nice but quantity wasn't much. Makkhan Singh's butter chicken was average. Overall I would say food was average and not something that would encourage you to return to that place again. What can improve is service quality - as the staff simply had no clue which table needs what. So you had to look out for a waiter to get you spoons, to order the food, to serve you food, to get you water....That is at every step you would have to try and catch the attention of the staff. The pricing needs a re-look by the owners as it seemed over-priced. And finally I noticed the next day that a service charge of 5% was included in the bill. I suggest that they check with customers if one really wants to pay the service charge and then prepare the bill accordingly. I would have definitely given a thought regarding paying a service charge for this quality of service.
In summary, an okay kind of place for one time visit.

Me and my friends ordered L'Affair Paris which was okayish &  We had their khowsuey mela which was unique & a total delight. Their hazaron khwaishein aisi was to die for. I was completely gobsmacked.

This place is where a Gabbar comments the rest of the pic characters of Bollywood. A place full of drama on the walls. The place is compact though. And the Bollywood songs that ring in your ears is also so old- just a warning for those not really impressed by em.

The food is great. We began with Keema Pav- Gabbar's Ghotala which still makes my mouth water. I could not click a picture of it though we ordered it twice because the impact of that keema blanketed in half boiled egg was so tempting your priority becomes to savour that tender meat.

There was a chicken potli kebab which really had surprises packed in those little pockets, murgh malai Nazakath which was a normal dish, fish ajwaini tikka- with nothing great about it and some spicy ginger prawns. 

Long Island Iced Tea- my friend chose the chintoo(try it if you like your drink sour and tangy) and for the non-alcoholics you have the virgin mojito, L'Affaire Paris, and some mango squash which you can see in the pictures (trust me when I say you this tastes like slice/Maaza -avoid it) it is called the Italian Itch.

The main course was penne pasta in Alfredo sauce which was just what I wanted that night. We also ordered this spicy spaghetti which set our tongue on fire- Spaghetti Olio pepperonica. Spice lovers, this is the dish for you. A few of my friends went desi with Naan and Makkhan Singh's Butter chicken which was served in a sauce pan.

I really have to appreciate their food designer, not one matches the other. You are putting in some great effort. Well done.

The menu was of great help. You can always choose the Gabbar's favourite. I would strongly recommend to follow these little Gabbar icons. The cartoons are too good I personally enjoyed a few of em.

I hope Gabbar's does fix their chandelier before our next visit to your place. You guys have some creative architecture up there. I really wanted a picture of that.

The cost for two people is around 1800 just wanted to correct what was mentioned above and the portion of the food for most of the items is very less so order accordingly.

However, I noticed they are charging more for MRP products. Packaged water bottle of 20/- has been charged @ 95/- + taxes. MRP products are inclusive of all taxes as well.

Paying 70/- bucks more doesn't matter to anyone, but what matters is these illegal practices.

Molecular food being the new thing in trend, this place is definitely a must visit. The food tastes exceedingly good, especially Gabbar's Ghotala - Soft, juicy, perfect! However what gives the added charm is the cute way in which each dish is presented. The staffs are highly courteous. Had this smiling and amiable gentleman Mr. Arghya who guided us to the gastronomic best. Totally loved the overall experience.

The very concept of molecular gastronomy and out of the box presentation thrills me. So I made my visit to this place in search of some excitement and I was not at all disappointed!

Coming to the ambience, it's quite spacious with various "filmi" posters hung on the wall. The huge couches with huge comfy cushions are sure to make you feel comfortable enough. And yes, the fact that I found mentionworthy was the soothing bollywood numbers playing. They made me feel really good. Not too loud, not too low. Just the right music!

Food- The menu guides us with symbols beside individual foods indicating what "Gabbar recommends" and what involves molecular gastronomy. So it's not difficult to choose what you like as the recipes are also given.
From mocktails I chose the litchi and kaffir lime mojito and Iced tea! Both of them were fantabulous! Though I loved the kaffir lime mojito a bit more.
From the starters section I selected the fish ajwaini tikka and two minutes spring rolls. The rolls are simply awesome and a must try for anyone who visits here. These are masala maggi stuffed spring rolls served with loads of fried onions, garlic and spring onions. Just the right choice for Chinese lovers, everyone should try this.
The fish ajwaini tikka was out of the world and made with pure Kolkata bhetki. The flavour of the fish itself was alluring enough and dish was just as it should be. I would recommend this to my fellow foodies too.
For main course I chose the murgh tawa biryani which came with a bowl of raita. This was nice too.
And finally from desserts section, I had taken the day's speciality which was a strawberry chocolate dome and "yeh hai mumbai meri jaan" , the kulfi which had a molecular gastronomic presentation. The strawberry and chocolate cake was awesome served with slices of fresh strawberries and the kulfi is MUST try for all foodies. It had the original taste of a rich, quality milk.

Staffs: the staffs are helpful and courteous. They make you feel pretty comfortable.

The only minus point I felt is the quantity of food they serve as compared to the price. It can increase more!

Apart from that everything's extremely good here and it's worth your try!‚ò∫

Went to this place with a lot of expectations after going through some great reviews on Zomato. But to be honest I was bit disappointed. I went with some guests & was going to place an order for a Bucket of Budweiser 5 Beer Pints. Surprisingly they told that they are not getting supplies of Pint beers & they could only offer Kingfisher Blue & Premium Beers of 650 ml. (Which was not on the Menu even). Not getting supplies of Pint beers was really surprising as you easily get those in any Spencer or other outlets. Anyway going ahead I ordered a Spicy Mojito (named Mirchi Maar ke). Presentation was ok. For food we ordered Pan Fried Chilli Chicken & Dahi Kebab. The Chilli Chicken was ok. I heard if great presentations but couldn't find one. Maybe we chose the wrong items. It will be nice if there are any recommendations from the management.

Bored with normal food presentations? Need some hungama in your life? Gabbar's is the perfect place for you! :D
Where you can play with your order, get spiced up with their lip-smacking flavours and get quirky with their filmy preparation names! Along with the brilliantly Bollywood interior and the warm ambience, Gabbar's is both pleasing and fun to be at. But, honestly, the management services can do better. 
MUST TRY:
1. Chicken Potli Kebab- Soft and tender Chicken legs with amazing filling inside.
2. Gabbar Ghotala- Pav Bhaji but better! 
3. Makkhan Singh Butter Chicken- The chicken melts in your mouth and probably the first orange gravy that I loved.
4. Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi- TRY THIS AMAZING CHOCOLATE MUDPIE presented in an innovative way.
5. Ab Gola Kha- go and try this. I'll not describe this. It's enjoyable. Have fun!

(Complementary; as we went to review)

A great place to enjoy a romantic dining.. food taste and quality is awesome.. quantity is also very good.. we tried 1.pav bhaji fondue: perfect street food taste
2.worky paratha nd garlic naan: bith tasted fabulous nd crunch was perfect.
3.paneer tikka lababdar was good
4. Jalebi bai: the most amazing dish.. rabdi was perfect nd chilled
P.s: ranveer singh's photo should be kept in the wall of currebt actors. -0.5 for this.

The named sounded quirky so expected a bit more in terms of decor but overall it was Gud as the theme was total filmy.The experience was also heartwarming along with the food.Really like the starters specially vegetables in cilantro sauce.A must eat.Wide variety of main course was on menu.We had Chinese and it didn't disappoint us either.Only thing is about the quantity which is a little disproportionate to the price.
Overall it was a fulfilling dining experience.

For many of us, our first tryst with molecular gastronomy was perhaps through Heston Blumenthal on Masterchef. With the advent of molecular gastronomy, meals have become nothing short of performance arts and the chefs nothing less than Picassos of food!. Gabbar‚Äôs (earlier the well loved Amigos Tex Mex) was one of the first places in the city to bring forth molecular gastronomy to its plates albeit a bit of Bollywood tadka and the show has become all the more exciting with each passing day.

The lights¬†and the wall paintings was quite soothing to look at. It is made in the Desi way with quotes written like ‚Äòjo dar gaya so mar gaya‚Äô, ‚Äònayak nahi khalnayak hu main‚Äô ‚Äòmogambo khush hua‚Äô and so on and so forth. The items which were being served to us were left as a surprise to us till the time we visited there.

Kitney "items" thei....??!!!
..and the legendary villain from Bollywood demands his position in your plates. He is there to satisfy your palate.
This Bollywood themed restaurant is hardly one and a half yrs old but is creating the right buzz.
Decor and ambience- The quirky Bollywood style decor instantly transcends you to the retro era. The posters, the wall graphite are from the old Hindi potboilers.
Service - The service is good, with the waiters serving the rightful portions. We never got a chance to complain.
Cuisine- The restaurant serves Italian, Indian and Chinese items. But what makes them class apart is the infusion of molecular gastronomy in many of their  dishes, where they use the term, served in "Gabbar style".
Some of the dishes which left a mark and hit me like Gabbar's goli are-
Papdi Chaat V 2.0- the name itself suggest that it is our indigenous papdi chaat but with a touch of modernisation. A touch of molecular gastronomy makes the chaat crunchier and tastier.
Vada Pao Salad - It's something unique when our own  vada Pao is served as a salad. 
Khowsuey Mela -I was totally bowled over by the presentation.
Gabbar Ghotala- This dish is  stir fried minced meat with buttery paos. A must try.
Chicken Potli Kabaab-  The presentation makes this dish a departure from the mundane.
Desserts
Jangal Mei Mangal- This is a deconstructed black Forest cake, with generous helping of cherries and chocolate sauce. Molecular gastronomy takes this dish to a different level, adding a crunch to the "oh so soft "black Forest. A must have.
Jalebi Bai - Jalebi the favourite Indian sweet gets a makeover, and served with kheer.
Cocktails
They have also included so innovative cocktails like Bollywood bhang, Ab goli Kha, Expression Sangria.
Picture Abhi Baki Hai
This is where our Bengal.paan gets a total makeover. Presented on an edible plastic sheet the pan is a befitting way to conclude a culinary adventure.
If you love food and if you love to rediscover our indeginous food in a new light do drop in at Gabbar's.
In conclusion I want to thank Saurabh Rana for the invite and

Welcome to the place where food meets bollywood. The quirky one-liners the filmy references and the beautiful lighting makes this place one of a kind. A must visit if you are looking for a place to dine and be amazed at the presentation. This place has mastered the art of using liquid nitrogen and some of their deserts will surely make you gape in awe. The best dishes in the menu for me are Gabbar Ghotala (Mutton Keema) and Mogambo Khush Huya (Non-Veg Kebab Platter). Jai Thalaiva (Kotthu Paratha) and the black burger failed to impress. Now coming to the must haves, look for the molecular gastronomy sign next to the dishes, order, sit back and get ready to be amazed. My personal favorites are Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi, Mango Cigars and Jalebi Bai. Highly recommended.

I went there on a Sunday evening and they were playing the perfect songs for a Sunday evening. As we entered the place. the staff very politely greeted us and the hospitality was top notch throughout.
As far the ambiance is concerned, I have mixed reviews there. Although some of the interiors is well done, but doesn't really live up to the name as one would perceive with " Gabbar". But then there is yet ample of place and am sure they can work on it.
Now coming back to the core --FOOD. The starters were good and the Nomenclature will definitely tickle you. Cocktail was a little on the expensive side and you might not order one more. The quantity which they serve is great, infact I had th best Tomato Basil Soup there but yet I believe somewhere the taste of the food can be improved. I was very dejected with the Mongolian.

The best part was the staff caring to ask if we didn't like the food when we had some leftovers in the plate.

All in all, must go once.

Well the experience was quite a disappointment for us. It started with the Beer where Gabbar didn't seem to have variety. The food was good in phases. Some of them like Keema were superb while some of them like Mutton tikki were awful to say the least. The dessert too was okayish and most of the items were unavailable. The place is hugely overpriced. The ambience is like some roadside dhaba with loud music and commotion. Not at all what an overly priced place should look like. Reiterating: The place doesn't have any kind of ambience so to speak, but charges as if it is the best in town.

A beautiful place with the most wonderful food!Amazing ambience with prompt service.

We were served by Mr. Bharat Biswas who ensured a tremendous experience. 

We ordered
1. Pav bhaji fondue
2. Dahi seekh kebab
3. Penne arrabiata
4. Chilli garlic noodles
 The food is served piping hot, with bursts of flavour. Definitely go there for the the entrees-which are innovative and downright scrumptious. 

The desserts were the real cherry on top, though. We ordered 
1. Golmaal: a chocolate sphere filled with mousse and hot chocolate. 
2. Pan mousse: a liquid nitrogen immersed paan filled with soft and creamy mousse inside. 
3. Jungle Mein Mangal: a deconstructed Black Forest cake, again immersed in liquid nitrogen. 

In short, be here because this is the place that shall entertain you and your taste buds like no other.

To start with i am totally satiated with this place! the usp of this place is the presentation offcourse, the food itself too tastes good. Ajwaini fish tikka was juicy on the inside not dried out. Among the two drinks, La'faire Paris and Litchi and Kaffir lime, the kaffir lime stood out. its refreshing and not much sweet. the rumali pizza and the highway dhaba di shaaan lookwise and tastewise are appealing. but the best part maybe because i am a bong and our eternal love for nolen gur is insatiable, the nolen gur cigars...gawwwdd yummmmmmmmmm...
the price and the portion might be a little misfit, but overall i wud visit this place yet again!

The interiors and concept do not work for me. However the real problem is the food. They rely on their presentation, basking in the glory of molecular gastronomy. Yes, it is fascinating, but there is no proof in the pudding. The mushroom soup lacked depth in flavour. Their appetisers are really filling. Their drinks are good (read strong).

Desserts are the main attractions here; so this review should start with the same.i think every dessert item in the menu would taste as great as our order hazaron khwaishein aisi.taste and presentation both were excellent.for starters there were mogambo khush hua,chicken potli kebab and murgh malai nazakath.personally didnt like potli kebab that much.butter naan,garlic naan,gosth rahra and butter chicken were the next.loved the dhaba style mutton.there was also an italian itch which is a fruit punch and that too was good.staffs were friendly and the interior of the restaurant was unique.
Lastly,seriously the bill should always be given to the customer in that damage box as the pocket pinch is very high and they even add service charge which increases the burden certainly more.

This is definitely one of  the most talked about restaurants in kolkata. The Moment you enter you get greeted by Big B... before you get excited...it's actually all the movie posters of Amitabh bacchan. The decor is quite quirky... and an ideal place for any movie buff.
Have been there twice and I think it's better to order Indian cuisine and not oriental for sure. 
I like the kala Khatta martini... quite neat. I enjoyed the Papri chaat... more than the taste I enjoyed the drama around it. The puchka was ok.. not really worth the hype. I quite enjoyed the mini amritsari kulchas. They have very good kuclchas specially the cheese and olive one.. super. Do try! Also had the Mongolian noodle.. and didn't like it at all! 
Coming to deserts .. again the drama around the dessert is very interesting. I loved the nalen gur cigar and the jalebi Bai as they call it. 
Overall a great place definitely worth a try!

I Visited the place the third time. The place is good. We ordered for the much trending khawsuey ka mela, which was not as expected but was good. Rajma galouti kebab is my fave but did not meet my expectation. We were served by suraj and bharat. They were good at their job. At a whole the food was good. The deserts are amazing.

Went to this restaurant a few weeks ago. The ambience of this place is really good. The restaurant has a bollywood theme and the decor is quite nice. Coming to the food, we ordered two types of risottos- mushroom and sun dried tomato. The mushroom Risotto was average but the sun-dried tomato Risotto were quite good. The Rome-Ali pizza was delicious. We even ordered the Indian platter but it was nothing great. The mushroom naan and blue cheese naan was not very appetising. The Kali daal and paneer were average. The mudpie was really good and it's presentation is fabulous. However, one of the waiters was quite weird and not at all courteous. Also I found this place to be a little overpriced considering the quality and quantity of the food.

Gabbar‚Äôs Bar & Kitchen is located just next to ICCR on Ho Chi Minh Sarani. This place has curved a niche for itself on Kolkata‚Äôs food streets within a very short span of time specially because of its molecular gastronomic food & it‚Äôs awesome food presentation. Keeping with the name, the decor & the menu keeps up with the filmy quotient. Coming to the food, we have ordered for the Italian Itch, Balam Puchkari, Murg Malai Nazakath & Cheese Chilli Olive naan & Butter Chicken for the main course & Jangal mein Mangal for dessert.

1.	Italian Itch- This mocktail was a blend of orange,mango,peach ,apricot & vanilla & tasted very pleasant.

2.	Balam Puchkari- This dish deserves a special mention for its presentation. Being one of the most talked about dish of Gabbar‚Äôs it lived upto it‚Äôs reputation  with the phucka‚Äôs being crispy & the stuffing was also a perfect mixture of spices.¬†
3.	Murg Malai Nazakath- The kebabs were melt in the mouth & perfectly soothed the tastebuds.

4.	Cheese Chilli Olive Naan- I would definitely recommend this as a must try & it went perfect with the Butter Chicken.

5.	Butter Chicken- the Butter chicken had the typical taste of the thick tomato based gravy with soft & succulent chicken pieces.

6.	Jangal Mein Mangal- This is a deconstructed version of Black Forest Cake with mashed cake base, crunchy chocolate bites, cherry, loads of chocolate sauce & vanilla ice cream.
 The way this dish is served is an experience in itself.

Jangal Mein Mangal & the Cheese Chilli Olive Naan is absolute try. All in all it is a good food experience.

May be tis the season,may be tis magic,may be tis the people,maybe tis the food.Its actually all.You eat good food,you meet good people.But Gabbar's experience was completely everything.In eons of months,I have not been to such a place.Since their opening,I so wanted to visit this place,and finally made it yesterday.And the 3 hours that I spent there,I had a constant smile on my face.The smiling,enthusiastic & the friendly employees,to the scrumptuous delicacies,to the out of the world presentations with the simple things,make you feel absolutely happily spoiled,and specially when you are treated to some sweet caramel lollipos & some molecular gastronomical mouth freshners.It was my mistake I didn't take a note of the people their,apart from Arif,but everyone working their is giving their 200 percent.It was like taking a Hogwart's express to your childhood.Would love to be back again soon!! Loved the Mirchi Madke Mojito,the Pan Mousse and the Kulchas.

Perfect place for starters and a hearty meal. What immediately catches your attention is the inspiring bollywood themed interiors. Then you give in to the awesome presentation of the food. We went on 25th so the rush and the waiting time was anticipated but must say they totally made up for it. We ordered Mogambo Khush Hua (Non-veg kabab platter) and beer sangria for starters. The latter had a refreshing feel to it than your regular Sangria. Then we moved on to Expresso Sangria (unique in taste but not as good as the beer version) and DIY Masala Papad. The kababs were just right and soft to the core. Mains were regular fare. But the show stealer was the desserts in which we went for the specials of the day, Nolen Gur Cigars which were crisp and melt-in-your-mouth delectable. All in all, a special place for special occasions. Definitely would suggest others I know who don't mind to spend that extra bucks for an evening filled with experience. A word of wisdom for the tipple lovers... The small LIIT doesn't give you the kick you were seeking (even if you down a couple of glasses), for the wholesome feel go for the "Lambi Race Ka Ghoda" ;)

Kebabs were very very tasty soft and succulent. Drums of heaven were very good and with the beer we had a lovely evening in Gabbar's. Would love to visit more. :)

This fine eatery sits quietly  great place to hang out, very courteous staff. The food not extremely out of the ordinary, however boasts of finesse! 

The Mutton Keema Pav was ordered as a starter. The Keema was cooked with Mutton fat and the juices were present in the mutton Keema. 

Next arrived the malai Broccoli, the a little on the blunt side, but had the ginger flavour. 
For the main course, we ordered Cheese and Olive Paratha, had a sweet yet less tangy flavour from the Olives. The butter chicken was the finest I ever tasted! Great stuff.

I visited this place on 1st of Jan 2016 and I have plans to again visit this place on 31st. As it's said our fate all throughout the year depends on what we do on 1st of Jan. And this place really made my new years special. :) Gabbars is famous for complicated fancy good food. The very menu is attractive and unique highlighting items like maa ki daal etc. Ambience is hilarious with funny memes from Sholay movie. And the idea of presenting the bill on "damage" box is perfect because pocket pinch is little high but once in a year, itna toh chalta hai :D  however I have lost all the pics of the day but I am gonna soon visit here with my dad.  I would suggest ppl to treat their father's here because I am sure all Indian dad's are great fan of Sholay!

So after a lot of debate.. we gals landed at gabbar's kitchen for dinner. The place is quirky and upbeat with a menu packed with entertainment. Amidst the amusement, we sought our tender's help. Bharat Biswas a model employee of the restaurant helped us order a perfect sumptuous meal. The smile on his face remained all the while we contemplated our order in confusion. Thanks to him we had food which was tasty and amusing (gastronomy foodgasms ofcourse) as well. Thank you Bharat Biswas for making our evening so memorable. :)

We luckily got a seat at the Gabbar's restuarant after being turned down once because the place was over booked. That aroused our curiosity and we just had to go the second time.
Well the interiors are cozy with bollywood themed walls and the ambience looks nice.
We didnt order anything that was on the gastronomic menu . We went for the regular kulchas...sabzis...the veg platter and soups. I wouldn't say that it was mindblowing. It was just ok. I didnt like the mixed veg preperation. The paneer masala was good though.
The staff was curteous.
Its good for a visit but nothing to attract you to be a regular there.

In a country,flooded with imponderable variety of cuisines, food is an EMOTION, and Gabbar brings drama to your table. They decorate the delicacies in innovative ways and not just for the sake of presenting it in an ostentatious manner. We had the following-
1- Two minute Spring rolls- Nice. Light. Spicy.
2- Highway De Dhabe Di Shaan- Excellent presentation. A bit overpriced.
3- Gabbar ki ma ki Dal- A must try.Amazing.
4-Paneer butter masala- Neat n Nice.
5- Crispy chili potato- Hardly any different from crispy chili babycorn but still leaves you wanting for more.
6- Warqi paratha- In case you want to try something new...soft and a sweet aftertaste.
Apart from the much talked about presentation, the food tastes good but the menu looks a little overpriced and the servings are just about sufficient.
Food- 3.5/5
Presentation- 4/5
Value for money- 3/5
Ambience- 3.5/5

When I was looking for some place to have a quick dinner after shopping, zomato pointed me to this place. And I was in for some surprise. Everything little thing spoke volumes about the kind of thoughts that went in behind it. Every small thing contributed to building up of a truly gastronomic experience. The decor leaned heavily on "Sholay" with a quirky take on this timeless Bollywood classic.¬† Even the menu card too added to the feel and made for a good laugh. The presentation of the food is fabulous and definitely worth¬† a mention with everything being served in a different manner which suited the dish. You definitely should have a look at the blackboard which tells you what not to do. 
The only suggestion is to provide some snacks alongwith the drinks served.
¬†Definitely a great experience¬† and would like to go back for more.

There's no doubt that Sholay is a legendary film. The actors, the script, and most importantly, the dialogues of this Rohan Sippy movie have left an indelible mark on the Indian audience. And the owner of this outlet clearly had been a big fan of this badass villain, which is reflected not only in the interiors, but also in the naming of the different dishes.

Located right beside the ICCR, opposite to the American Embassy, this restaurant has carved a name for itself within a very short span, mostly due to the molecular gastronomic food and the phenomenal presentation of the same. The decor too, is bound to catch your eye. The insides scream of Bollywood, and an entire wall has been dedicated to the catchy dialogues and character names of Sholay. The Bollywood numbers that go on in a loop add the final touch.

Coming to the food, they leave hardly any scope of complaining. One thing about the menu that grabbed my attention was the number of vegetarian items they offer, which is quite a long one compared to most restaurants. However, being a strict non-vegetarian, I have mostly neglected them on both my visits (though I hope to try them out soon enough). So, here goes my review about the items I have tried.

Accompaniments:
1. Classic Cosmopolitan: There's nothing to say about this popular drink. Not much different from the knee served elsewhere.

2. Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito: You need to taste this to believe how good and refreshing this is. Served in a pot, and enough for two, this combines the taste of Litchi, and gondhoraj lime, served with ice. The smell itself is so absorbing that you might not want to savour it till the very end!

Starters:
1. Chicken Potli Kabab: It is the typical melt-in your mouth kabab, and never fails to impress.

2. Hum kaale he toh kya huya: This is Galwati kabab sandwiched between pao bhaji breads, cooked in tandoori style. This dish is highly disappointing because of the "black" bread, which even the Galwati can't save.

3. Murgh Malai Nazakat: This is another typical mughlai kabab dish that can never go wrong. The chicken done in cream and cheese, accompanied by the pudina chutney is a combination that will leave anyone licking their fingers.

Main Course:
1. Butter Chicken: They serve this in a saucepan, which is quirky. But this place is all about quirkiness, and the sheer goodness of the taste. The utterly butterly chicken is a treat to the taste buds, which goes all too well with the accompanying parathas.

2. Warqi Paratha: These come in numbers of eight, and are stuffed sweet parathas. Being a bengali and lover of all things sweet, I liked this a lot and I make it a point to order this for main course everytime I go!

3. Pudina Paratha: This wasn't that satisfying, though the taste of Butter Chicken can make up for its deficit.

Desserts:
It's the dessert section where Gabbars absolutely kills it. Starting from the innovation to the presentation, everything is pitch perfect, and honestly, I never can have enough of the desserts at this place.

1. Mango Cigars: This is hands down their best. Frozen Mango MI ed with mascarpone cheese stuffed and rolled into crisp filo pastry cigars, it has foam coming out of the accompanying syrup when served. Not only is it visually appealing, but the taste will make you want more and more.

2. Golmaal : This is a round magical ball of chocolate. Magical why? Because no sooner than you drop hot chocolate over it than it starts melting and pouring out yummy liquid chocolate. A delight for the chocolate lovers!

3. Jalebi Bai : Unlike the usual jalebi that we are accustomed to, these are small balls of jalebi served hot with Rabdi. The combination is too good to be true and it lives up to its name - You absolutely fall in love with this one, especially the finely done Rabdi.

4. Paan Mousse: Again, another quirky innovation. This dish serves mousse with all the regular toppings of paan in.. A betel leaf! I was confused in the beginning whether they are actually serving me molecular paan or paan mousse. Even though I have an aversion for paans, I appreciate the sheer brilliance with which they have come up with the dish.

Overall, Gabbars is a concept in itself. It defines molecular gastronomy like no other. With the increasing popularity of the restaurant, am sure most people have already paid a visit here. This who haven't, rush in as soon as you can just to experience food coma for both the eyes and the stomach. And DO try the desserts!

Visiting my hometown for a quick holiday, my friends suggested this place where not only you get the most wanted "Booze" but along with good food and the essential Bollywood ambience. Thanks to Gabbars for making my holiday complete. Special mention to Mohammed Iqbal for his awesome service to us. Cheers! :-)

if you think that with Normal Food you add Nitrogen then it becomes a dish to die for is the most ridicules thought.You have the Normal Papri chat with Nitrogen added and voila the price is 325 + , Small Pau baji served with Cheese and the rate taken is 295/-. Some puchkas and the price is 295/-,the list is endless .It is Classic Cheating with the prices. I remember there was another restaurant with some other name at the same venue and their prices were also very high and then it closed down. If one has to eat normal food with abnormal rates i would never again visit this place.People forget that there is so many choice these days and so many restaurants to go to that if one is not innovative along with pricing then God only help them. They serve the very normal food with fancy plating and take the most ridicules prices.

Gab-bar's bar and kitchen is a great place to chill out and enjoy. The bollywood based theme is refreshing and creates a great ambience. We were impressed with the service provided to us by Mr Bharat. The food and drinks are very good. We had a host of veg & non-veg dishes. We tried the indian menu and all items were very delicious. We tried the crispy chilli babycorn, murg malai  nazakath kabab. The main course with rarha gost and devils choice was pretty good as well. One should try the beers knees as it is quite brilliant.

I loved the decor of this bollywood themed restaurant with dialogues written in the wall from the movie Sholay. One of the walls is filled with rare pictures of the present day films star. I loved vive in the restaurant. The menu list also consist the name and dialogues from the movie. We ordered truffled mushroom kulcha and gabbar ghotala and kochi pathar jhol along with a beer. the cocktails were also amazing. The food was delicious and would definitely visit again.

The beer sangria was also upto the mark. The service was quick and prompt by Nadeem. Would consider a visit again soon.

Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen is located at Ho Chi Min Sarani just crossing of Little Russel Street & Ho Chi Min Sarani.Yesterday I've visited here with my friends for lunch.First of all ambience is good,Fully filmy decorated ambience,but seating arrangements are less.We ordered here 'Litchi & Kaffir Lime Mojito' & 'Virgin Mojito - Orange' as Mocktails & 'Mojitos - Orange' as Cocktail.All items are mind blowing,specially ¬†Virgin Mojito - Orange Mocktail.Then We ordered Chinese Starter - 'Pan-fried Chilli Chicken',it is delicious & ¬†two plates North Indian Starter - 'Chicken Potli Kebab',it tastes awesome,but only 3 pieces chicken in one plate kebab.Then we ordered Main Course - 'Cheese Chilli Olive Naan','Waqi Paratha' with 'Makkhan Singh's Butter Chicken' & 'Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles' with 'Kung Pao Chicken'.Waqi Paratha is little sweet,otherwise rest of items are tasty.Atlast we ordered DESSERT - 'Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi' & 'Golmaal',both are amazing presentation with lip smacking tastes.At the end we took 'Molecular Paan',it just melts our mouth.Overall amazing experience.Waiters are very friendly.They took extra 5% service charge.

I have been meaning to write a review for this place for quite a few months now.. In fact its criminal to have taken this long to review what is currently my favourite Indian cuisine restaurant in Kolkata.. Have already been here around 5 times and still can't get enough of this place..
The decor is loud and quirky with Bollywood photos and filmy dialogues adorning the walls. The washrooms are also decked with fun posters.. I love the idea of the blackboard featuring a list of what not to do - downright hilarious!!
The gentleman at the reception is the manager/owner I presume and he is a very amiable person. The waiters are also all polite and we'll versed regarding the menu. The crockery especially the small pressure cookers containing dips are adorable..

Now coming to the food... I am literally spellbound here.. Every dish is a beauty in itself - the presentation speaks volumes of the planning and preparation that goes behind every item on the menu. Each dish also has a rather quirky name making the menu rather fun to go through.. Molecular gastronomy is the unique highlight of this place and Gabbars is one of the first places to introduce this concept to us Kolkattans..

I never say this for any restaurant, but you can go ahead and blindly order any random dish on from the menu- and you won't be disappointed.. Such is my faith in this establishment.

Nevertheless my personal favourites include the Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito - as beautiful to behold as to taste..
Coming to the appetisers, the melt in your mouth Murgh Malai Nazakath and the Mutton Galouti kabab are my favourites - if you too are a kabab fan you can opt for the non veg kabab platter ie Mogambo Khush Hua.. Among veg the Tandoori Mushrooms and Inverted Vada Pao are ordinary but tasty.. The Blue Cheese Kulcha with Dal Makhani also didn't live upto expectations.. However I absolutely adore the Highway Dhabe Ki Shaan - cute little cars stuffed with mini Kulchas and Chana with an onion salsa alongside.. I also liked their Manchow Soup (the only Chinese Dish that I have tried here till date)..
Main course may not score high on the presentation but they have nailed the taste. The Maa Ki Dal and Makkhan Singh's Butter Chicken are finger licking good.. Couple them with the crispy Warqi Parathas instead of the usual Butter Naan and you will find yourself in foodie heaven!! Also good is the Spinach Kofta and Penne Pasta in Paprika Sauce..
However be careful not to gorge on the main course and fill yourself as Gabbars has saved the best for the last. The desserts here are a class apart.. Must order is Golmaal - the caramel mousse filled chocolate sphere that gradually melts as the server pours hot chocolate over it -- just sit back and watch the magic unfold.. Gooey and sinful - it is ultimate bliss.. Next opt for Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi - and you will be baffled by what they place before you - a potted plant indeed... Dig into it for the mud pie - as yummylicious to eat as deceptive it is to look at.. For those who are not chocolate lovers (huh??), the Chai Biskoot or Strawberry Cigars with Strawberry Foam are novel desserts to try.. The only dessert i didn't like at all was the Kulfi (Mumbai Meri Jaan). It was teeth-breaking hard and icy and felt flavourless to me, wouldn't recommend it.

A fun thing is the palate cleanser that they serve you between courses.. Its like a wobbly blob that bursts in your mouth with a minty flavour.. I love it!!

A great thing about Gabbars is that they keep updating the menu regularly - a sure way to keep old customers coming back. Recently they added a deconstructed black forest dessert and a paan mousse and I was dying to try them out.. Sadly however when I visited on Dashami, they had run out of Liquid Nitrogen and could not serve me any of the two. It was disappointing as they had been advertising these two dishes a lot on Facebook and frankly a restaurant that is known for its molecular gastronomy, just can't afford to run out of liquid N. Apart from that my only other complain regarding this joint is that it is a tad too loud.. However that is a small thing to overlook once you start eating- from then on, it's a sheer gastrorgasmic journey.

P.S. I would like to recount an incident here when my dad discovered a hair in the Naan that he was served. I was aghast as my parents had come here on my suggestion and I felt like my favourite restaurant had badly let me down.. The manager not only apologised profusely, he served us a complimentary chocolate pastry with a "Sorry" written in chocolate.. It was such a cute gesture.. And more than made up for the fiasco.. These little intricacies are what keeps Gabbar way ahead of its contemporaries..

Kudos to the team behind this lovely place!! Keep it up.. I will be back very soon!!

The kindness of the staff was something which made it all the more better. Bunking lounge food and visiting this place was really worth it! Everything was amazing. I would give this place a five star on the basis of everything, be it food, be it management and staff. Please visit this place.

Me and my restro-hopper friends visited this place after receiving a lot of updates on the amazing representation of food we saw on facebook and I am happy to say the posts couldn't have done more justice to the amazing creative touch they added on all of their food/drink serving. 

The place is a fullon Bollywood themed restaurant which specialises on their presentation... the food is good and the cocktails were lip smacking. 

Amicable staff who were willing to answer any of our food related queries... unlike many of the places. The ambience is good and pleasant and as the theme suggests it plays only bolly music. 

Pricing ...fairly high ..but can be accepted considering the other aspects.

Went there on Ashtami night ( 9th oct) for dinner.. We got a seat within 10 mins . The ambience and theme decor is bollywood as the name suggests and the feel is quite "happyish"!!¬†
We ordered the popular Chicken Potli Kebab, pan fried chilli fish for starters and Makhan Singh's butter chicken with butter naan for the mains. The Potli kebab is true to its name, with chicken wrapped around minced chicken and plated beautifully.. taste is great too! The pan fried chilli fish is a bit spicy and hence kills the flavour of the fish.. But the piece de resistance is the butter chicken, its true delhi style and the flavour and consistency of the smooth gravy alongwith the soft chicken just nails it.. I have tasted similar butter chicken at Moti mahal deluxe at GK II - Delhi ( which i consider the best in India).
The staff is polite, cheerful and well behaved!! I loved the experience here and would love to be back.

Ok...so finally I went to Gabbar's. It has been in my list for some past few months. Situated in a very proper location, near to ICCR/ Metro Plaza/ Tata center(whichever u know), this place offers a range of  great foods with even greater presentation. The decor ,the walls with posters & frames regarding Bollywood stuffs and those favourite bollywood numbers in the background are sure to woo you..now comes the food.. AMAZING is the word..from kebabs to the desert all were just great. We had chicken potli kebab, warqi Paratha and Makhan Singh's butter chicken - all from their recommended ones... every single item was cooked perfectly,their presentation was like some artwork and taste was kind of almost perfect..then comes the signature 'GOLMAL' - the desert. I loved every bit of it...and am surely going again to have the rest of the menu.

Gabbar's Turns One..! Molecular Gastronomy Rediscovered.!

One of the most talked about restaurants ever since it started its operation, Gabbar has succesfully completed one year of service by providing amazing and innovative food and by earmarking a standard of its own, when it comes to Molecular Gastronomy. A brand new menu has thus been unvelied, which features some very exciting and mouthwatering dishes, Carefully constructed and designed, all of these are awaiting to tantalize your tastebuds.¬† I couldn‚Äôt wait to munch on them as soon as I heard about these beauties

Reason for my rating is simply because Kolkata was for long yearning for an Out of the Box joint with a quirky menu. I have been to similar contemporaries like Social and Farzi in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, and can gladly say, this one goes very close to both.

Nice decor within the limited space they have. The food is as good as it looks on the menu. We sampled many a dish and loved each and every one of the creative dishes. The kababs are a superb.

A special mention for Deepak who made sure we are treated really well. All the best!

As the name suggests this place has gone crazy with the retro Bollywood theme with a special partiality towards Sholay. A friend and I went their for a quick chat one evening and liked the ambiance. In spite of the name, it seemed to comprise of several family parties with little kids on tow.
We had the Mogambo Khush Hua kebab platter and the lemon and kaafir mojito. The mojito was served in a glass teapot with dry ice creating a lovely smoky effect. We were given two chai glasses to pour the drinks and it tasted so good, we ordered another! The kebab platter consisted of galawati kebab, achari fish, murgh malai and sheekh kababs. It was quite a big platter and each of them were extremely delicious and the meat was soft and succulent. My personal favorite was the murgh malai kebab.
The staff were friendly and prompt with their service. The food was presented very well. The dips for the kebabs came in little play pressure cookers that all little girls have possessed back in their 'ranna-bati' (or house-house) playing days. I did not try out their special molecular gastronomy platter that time and hope to go back someday and do that.

Having experimented with their food presentations, they have not compromised on the food quality at all. The main thing is food quality - and here you'll find finger licking dishes. Even the simple Chole and Amritsari Kulche were extremely sumptuous. All the dishes we had not only looked good but also tasted good. 
And the interiors and ambience is also nice with the Bollywood theme. The name of the dishes were one of the most entertaining things with all weird filmy names.
Must visit.

1st things 1st. It was a Sunday afternoon and when we entered the place, there was nobody at the front desk to attend us or write our names on the waiting list.
We tried to address few waiters but they just nodded and left. Finally somebody attended us and after 15 minutes we got a table.

The interior is interesting with Gabbar themed wall decorations. Seating arrangements are quite comfortable.

Coming to the food part. The Chinese section of the menu could have offered more choices.
We ordered Lat Me Kai, Pan Fried Chilli Fish as starters, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice and Hunan Chicken for main course. Also, we ordered a mocktail - Virgin Mojito and a cocktail - Orange Mojito.
Both the drinks were as refreshing as they could be.
The starters were finger licking. Especially the Pan Fried Chilli Fish. It was just perfect.
The Hunan Chicken could have tasted better.
Chicken Fried Rice was decent. Chicken Hakka Noodles was great!

Service: There is room for improvement. They weren't serving the dishes unless we were asking for it. The staff were courteous and well behaved though.

Price: Bit too high. They charge hefty taxes.

Recommended only for the excellent food!

So after hearing good things about the ambience and food,I finally managed to visit them . Gabbar's is the brainchild of the owner of 'Amigos' who decided to change to Indian and international cuisines as opposed to the Mexican they served earlier.
Personally I loved the decor of the place. The walls had a really colorful look and were adorned with images of famous characters from Bollywood movies and some well known dialogues . Its not like they have spent a fortune on the decor but its still very attractive.
From the appetizers we had the Bacchan Saab ke kebab platter . The kebabs were well marinated and had beautiful flavours.
Coming to the food we had ordered the the gabbar ki maa ki daal,Munni k Badnaam Kofte and Paneer butter masala.

The Maa ki Daal certainly tasted the best among the 3 .It was a thick,creamy daal with wonderful flavours.

The Munni ke Badnaam Kofte were delicious.They were basically Kofte stuffed with spinach.However the quantity could be increased.

The paneer butter masala was highly disappointing.It was kind of bland.

We wanted to have something from the molecular menu for desserts so we opted for the deconstructed black forest ( not the exact name) .I expected more from this. The black forest was covered in liquid nitrogen and all the fancy plating looked very beautiful.However the taste was nothing to write home about.You could get a better black forest pastry in any decent bakery in the city.

The service was quick and responsive even in a busy hour.

Overall, I expected more from this place.I will surely return to try out some of their non veg kebabs soon.

This is going to be a strange review but let‚Äôs just say Gabbar‚Äôs has earned every bit of it. If I was feeling funny I would have made a pun on how I would have preferred it if Gabbar had actually owned the eponymous restaurant but this was anything but fun.¬†

Gabbar‚Äôs has been a big hit with the zomato folks for well over a year and I had been dying to go for a long time. I finally managed to get some time off today and off I went to get me some molecular gastronomy food. They close at 4 PM and after navigating rain and an emergency ryle‚Äôs tube insertion, we reached around 3:40. We were relieved to find that their kitchen doesn‚Äôt close before 3:45 and quickly ordered some of what our waiter recommended. 

The Ambience is great, the food was okay, their mocktail was nice but‚Ä¶ it was the most disturbing experience I‚Äôve ever had in a restaurant. Everything pales into insignificance because of what happened when we were having our dessert. We were the ONLY customers at 4:15 PM and were enjoying the ‚Äòhazaaron khwaishey aisi‚Äô when we heard a commotion near the entrance. We weren‚Äôt really concerned right then until‚Ä¶we heard what can be only described as ‚Äúclaps‚Äù. Very typical claps that most Indians are accustomed to when they are travelling in a long distance train or stuck in traffic.  I was sharing curious glances with my girlfriend wondering whether to be worried or amused. From what we heard it became clear that a group of eunuchs had somehow gained entry into the restaurant and were having some sort of a disagreement with the hotel staff. I wasn‚Äôt particularly concerned because I assumed that it was a fairly regular occurrence and they were probably well equipped to deal with it. HOW WRONG I WAS BECAME CLEAR WHEN A COUPLE OF THEM ENTERED AND STARTED MAKING A RUCKUS RIGHT BEHIND US.

They entered and pretty much acted the way they usually do. They were directing obscenities towards the staff who had apparently refused to pay them. Now we aren‚Äôt strangers to this behaviour but we were slightly taken aback to see this interrupting a meal inside a respectable establishment like this. I mean, why else do we keep security, right? Then I spotted their security guard hiding near the kitchen door, smiling sheepishly. The staff at this point were deeply uncomfortable and were trying to reason with them and furtively looking at the couple of us from time to time. 

I sat there gobsmacked. I didn‚Äôt really know how to react to this because I haven‚Äôt been in a situation like this! I mean which one of us have?! We decided to quietly concentrate on our dessert hoping that they‚Äôd leave us alone. The last thing I wanted was them to involve me in this exchange. Thankfully, they didn‚Äôt but they did something worse. To make her point, one of the eunuch proceeded to strip. Yes, she took off her kurti/salwar to reveal her/his body. I concentrated hard on my dessert trying to ignore everything going on 6 feet behind me. It was the MOST uncomfortable I have ever felt having a dessert that I‚Äôd have given a glowing review under ANY other situation.

I was already angry at the staff. One would expect the staff to handle a situation like this with some tact but they were far from capable. They huddled near the kitchen door like a bunch of scared kittens. None of them lifted a finger or even raised their voice at this intrusion. The ineptitude on display was seriously mind boggling.

Eager to leave, I asked for the bill. Sharing my enthusiasm, one of the staff appeared with the bill within seconds. The speed of their service is the only thing I give them credit for.

But one of the eunuchs decided that letting us leave would undermine their position. We were the leverage that they wanted. She/he jumped forwards and tried to snatch the bill away from the guy. He ran away. She/He made it clear that she won‚Äôt let us pay the bill. Or let us leave. Yes, that's right, she/he decided to hold us hostage. And frankly, I wasn‚Äôt feeling like fighting 4 eunuchs just to go back to work.

The staff apologised to me again but did nothing to solve the problem. Meanwhile the obscenities were still flowing at an alarming rate. The insults now involved the parents and several other generations of the ancestors of the staff. But still, we witnessed an alarming lack of any meaningful reaction from the staff. They were pleading with the eunuchs to let us, the customers, leave while they call the owner to decide the payment.

In between all this, I saw an opportunity to go to an adjoining room and pay the bill. I cleared the bill with my card and returned to my table to leave. The eunuch who had till now restricted herself/himself to insulting the staff now decided to target me. Yes, make no mistake about it, I was insulted by that eunuch in front of all the staff because I paid the bill and all they did was giggle/apologise/make grumpy faces. I looked hard at that eunuch who probably decided insulting a customer wasn‚Äôt helping her cause and proceeded once again to directing her profanities at the staff.

They were not at all keen on letting us go until 5:00, when I finally went up and told them that I needed to go back to work in my hospital and then it was one of the eunuchs guarding the entrance who finally decided to let us go. 

I know that we are probably the ONLY customer among to thousands to have visited Gabbar‚Äôs and come back with a tale like this. But we have and we are not pleased. We aren‚Äôt going back ever.

One of its kind restaurant with something more to offer than just the theme. Dont miss out on their litchi based mocktail and paan mousse (chilled by nitrogen) right on the table. Warm and friendly staff. Tandoor items were great but yet to come up to the mark with the same offered at the age old legendary kebab places in the city.

Gabbar's is situated in a great location. The only cons I found were that the joint is too small for a restaurant of it's repertoire and resembles more of a college canteen. 

The service is very good and attentive though there is a waiting line to get in. 

We ordered a Garlic & Pepper Chicken, Stuffed Mushrooms Pepper Salt and Chicken Malai Nazakath kebab for starters. All the starters were equally good. 

The main course consisted of Warqi Parathas, Daal Makhni and Murgh Tikka Lababdar which were excellent! The Warqi parathas were exceptional.

We tried their 'Ab Gola Kha' cocktail. Quirky and fun. I would love to visit this place when it's a bit less crowded and try more items on their menu. 

Highly recommended!

The walls covered with Bollywood paraphernalia and the angry young vibe of the place sets the mood for a Amitabh Bachchan Movie marathon starting with Sholay!!!!
But one thing that remains constant is the good food and innovative yet delicious drinks that they serve here!!!!
We ordered the Mogambo khush hua platter and hum bhi bohut khush huen... the Gawlawti kebab was delish and it was certainly better then one we tasted in a posh restaurant in the city.... and the others which included the achari fish, the sheek and the malai kebab were melt in the mouth tasty and succulent!
But the real star of the evening was Lichi and Kafir lime Mojitos.... served in a teapot this non alcoholic mojito will make you want to give up drinking.... the taste was as unique as the presentation... it came in a glass teapot with dry ice and two dhaba walla chai glass... stacked with ice and a lime leaf.... yummmmm!!!
PS: I had come here once before when it was Tex mex restaurant and they had a margarita sampler.... that I missed on the menu... please bring it back!!!

I went to this place with family for my wife's birthday on a weekday! Had heard good reviews about it...upon reaching I realised that it was the rebirth of this place which I had visited a year back..anyways inspite of being a normal weekday I found the place was completely occupied with people on almost every table! That says a lot about it!

We ordered many vegetarian dishes and were not disappointed with either ones...they also prepared some dishes in Jain prep without any onion & garlic...

But yes only downside is the pocket pinch...I found it expensive compared to the ambience and the interiors of the restaurant and the overall quality..also with the crowded state you cant really cut down the noise so but difficult to talk amongst...

They do have some innovative way of presenting the food though which gives it a different touch altogether... Overall a must try place with good taste...

Gabbar‚Äôs Bar and Kitchen , Kolkata‚Äôs one of known molecular gastronomic destination turned one recently and launched their new menu to celebrate the birthday! Like the name of the restaurant Gabbar‚Äôs interior is unique with the filmy decor, more than filmy food and drinks and obviously their innovativeness with molecular gastronomy. It was my first visit there at Gabbar‚Äôs Bar and Kitchen and my experience ¬†of sampling food and drinks there starting from Ab Gola Kha (an orange margarita) to the mysterious liquid nitrogen-fied Papri Chat V 2.0 to the platter of South Indian Paratha and a side of Mutton, Jai Thalaiva as they call it to the innovative Khowsuey served with the condiments on a Wheel and even a Paan Mousse (Betel leave cone filled with Gulkand flavor Mousse) was nothing but spicy like a Bollywood movie!

I went there on my Birthday viz was on 13th September. It is a Bollywood themed restaurant. We tried Italian Itch & Sangrita Seca in Mocktail. Both were so refreshing.. but I found that Sangrita Seca is nothing but Bloody Mary( Tomato juice with seasonings) . After that we ordered crispy chilli babycorn.. nothing was special in this item. I was hoping some Gabbar's style in this appetizer. But it was like regular crispy chilli babycorn which you can get in any other restuarant. For Main course we ordered Cheese chilli olive naan and Munni k Badnaam kofte which was spinach kofta in white gravy. It was delicious and taste was perfect for us.
After finishing our Main course we asked for bill, then our server Mr. Deepak told us to review in Zomato on the spot to get complimentary dessert. Who doesn't like complimentary food and that too in a fine dine in restaurant.
After reviewing, Mr. Deepak got us a dessert which named Hazaaro khwaishein Aisi. It was a chocolate mud pie with crushed Oreo and vanilla scoop on the top.. It was super delicious.. As per me it was the Hero of our entire lunch menu. If Mr. Deepak didn't gave us this complimentary dessert then I think we would surely miss a yummilicious dessert.
Lastly I want to say about Gabbar's-
1. Good & Efficient service.
2. Delicious food.
3. Some foods are overpriced.
4.  Thumbs up for the Concept of Complimentary food item.

The food is good. Though the molecular gastronomy dishes i tried only involved pouring liquid nitrogen over it. Loved the dessert hazaaron khwaishen aisi. Clever dessert plated to look like a plant! Kala khaatta margarita was good. Though the sangria was average. The molecular gastronomy paapdi chaat is a miss. Liquid nitrogen does not alone elevate a dish. Staff were courteous. Worth a visit.

My all favourite "Gabbar's" turns one. And Gabbar feels hungry again. To appease Gabbar‚Äôs gastronomic urge, Gabbars ‚Äì the restro pub at Camac Street , launches its new innovative range of dishes curated to its perfection.¬†

The new menu includes:.¬†

1. Vada Pao Salad ‚Äì The favourite Mumbaiya snack with leafy base is a sheer delight. The tangy twist outshining the crisp vadas is appreciable.
            

2.  Papri Chaat V20 ‚Äì The  bewildering molecular gastronomic touch to the popular street food-papri chaat with a liquid nitrogen twist is surely to take your taste buds on a ride.

3. Kya cheez? Blue cheese! ‚Äì The engaging name with the beguiling sharp taste is quite enticing. The Danish blue cheese had a sharp taste and that stuffed in a kulcha served with three dips is definitely something to long for.

4. Truffle Mushroom kulchas ‚Äì Mushroom kulchas dunked with truffle oil will definitely emerge to be one of your favourite breads.
                                          ...

I had gone to Gabbar s for lunch with my family and was really pleased with my experience  here. 
The new menu was the main reason I decided to come down to.  And I was very happy with what was presented to me.  
We went with a few traditional favorites from the old menu and paired that with a few items from the new menu.  The Gabbar Ghotala and n the Jai Thaliva  blew my mind away.  
The taste and presentation were brilliant as expected
And as per usual I had Arghya as my waiter who did his best to ensure we were having the  best meal we could have; prompting us to try new items, suggesting not to order a few others based on our taste buds, etc.

I have been waiting for long to write its review. Visited this restaurant on 30 August. Their hospitality and the manager is super pathetic. I don't know about the food because I did not get to try it.¬†
Me and my friend entered the restaurant wearing traditional clothes. We were first asked to wait for seating despite the fact that only a few people were inside and many chairs were empty. After 10-15 mins the manager came and told us that the kitchen is closed and we cannot be seated. I was furious. People were inside having dinner but they said the¬†kitchen is closed. I was denied any explanation and asked to leave. Such restaurants should be banned. They did not allow entry only because we were wearing traditional¬†Indian Clothes and I guess they thought it wouldn't go with the restaurant.

This place z 1 of the worst ones I've ever had been...to start with
1.the online menu pics showed a lot many items like fisherman's dream...nd having a craving for fishes...upon arrival there were no such listings..as if the pages had disappeared!!!
2.although the ambience was unique but if the food z not nice...what r we supposed to do?? Scratch off the ambience nd have that for food!!!!
3.the potion size was extremely small...we barely had our stomachs filled
4.the place z extremely OVERPRICED...I mean c'mon...we pay such huge price..obviously expecting some very great nd unique taste as well as enough food...but this crushed all our bare minimum expectations
5.the service z Poor...all the other restaurants I've been to,they change the cutlery minimum 2 times...here they didn't even change once
6.Personally i don't understand why the"hazaaron khwayishein aise"z such a big dealing!!! I mean i can make that whole stuff in a price of 60Rs...why pay 225Rs gor that...not so great taste also???
7.Overall very bad experience...GO ONLY IF U WISH TO SPEND UR BUCKS WITH BARELY EATING AGAINST A BACKDROP OF SO CALLED"BOLLYWOOD STUDIO"

Finally I walked into Gabbar's with my bro today and had a hearty meal.
We were attended by Jawed mainly. But then all d other staff members were equally attentive. Very polite.
We ordered pan fried chilly fish....chicken hakka noodles.... kung Pao chicken.... fresh lime soda and finally d awesome jalebi bai...

Loved d pan fried chilly fish...do try this dish
Was bowled by their taste and by their presentation of jalebi bai.
They were liberal with the chicken chunks in d noodle... was happy seeing dat
I feel d fresh lime soda for abt 125/-was a bit too pricey... doesn't justify at all.
Well a gud experience. Definitely recommend.

Which could have been an experience to cherrish, turned out to be a disastrous evening thanks to the staff and the management of this place. It was very much embarrassing for us when we were asked to leave the table as we were seated, in middle of us friends having dinner at this place. The staff along with their manager don't know how to behave with the customer. They bluntly came up and asked us to move out so that they can give the table to some other customer.
Pathetic service, people are not courteous and whatever happened with us, I would suggest people to opt for this place at your own risk. You might get your butts kicked out by the staff in midst of you having your food.
@Zomato, if possible, please add a report button so that we can use it appropriately when required.

As the name suggests the place is very FILMY and the ambeiance deco will remind u..
The best thing was the MENu..great work to the designer..The names of the dishes is really KUDos..
MA KI DAL AND BALAM PICHKARI WERE MY FAVOURITES ..
we ordered penne and mangolian rice...I loved the rice well cooked and had the smoky flavour with well filled vegetables and spices...
The mocktail was totally the one of my taste...ITALIAN LITCH ..its all fruits miked with vanila icecream...
This review is totally unbiased and not forbthe waiver of my desert ..I would anyway had reviewed it...
Would visit again for more options on the menu...

Gabbar's, without a doubt, is one of my favourite places in town, be it for full meals or for something in between. So it was a pleasure to drop in during their first birthday celebrations, where they introduced a new menu, on an invitation to KFB.¬†

The new menu sounds as cool as liquid nitrogen, which by the way, they use very liberally. I love their presentation, decor and staff behaviour and knowledge. But what I love most about Gabbar's is certainly the food.¬†

I tried the PapdiChaat Version 2.0, which does justice to my expectation. The Papdi and sev were crisp, and the balance of the chutneys were on spot. Babumoshai from Mexico was a real heart-stealer, and clearly there's nothing not to love about gorgeous tandoori fish, in incredibly soft tacos. For people like me, hopelessly in love with fish, this is a must-have.¬†

And then I had the Ab Gola Kha (how I love the names of everything they serve here!). We are used to having ice in our drinks, so it was lovely to have drink in my ice! One sharp blow of the hammer on the enticing orange sphere, and my drink was ready to be sipped. Aaaah, the beauty!

Located in a largely official place , gabbar's is the right place to go if you are looking to go out for lunch with some important clients .
Has a very uptown vibe about it . The portions are well presented , tasty and yes TINY. 
As expected , its not your everyday hangout place , very expensive but then again being exotic comes with a price tag . 
The service is top notch . 
I had a pani puri kinda thing served to me in test tubes and i had a big kick out of it . 
Definitely try the cocktail menu for it is very creative .

With all the new spots coming up in the city I was really excited about venturing to a new place on a Sunday afternoon with family. I was fairly impressed with the decor and the service and hospitality. Our server was top notch and paid attention to what we wanted. I am a starters person and the variety on offer with the different names was too good to resist. So we ordered for an inverted vada pav which was awesome.Love the twist to the traditional vada pav. Bang on flavors and great munching.

The pav bhaji fondue was also superb. We ordered for a papri chaat which followed the very in vogue concept of molecular gastronomy but failed to deliver and kind of ruined the palette and freshness of the earlier two dishes. The high point of the starter journey was the amrita right kulcha chhola and the dahi seekh kebab. Amazingly served and to die for taste.

The very nicely served hazaro khawaish aisi aka oreo mudpie pudding WAS a perfect end to the food. The food presentation is excellent and quite unique. Can't talk about the value for money for I did not foot the bill but would definitely recommend it to others and hope to visit it again during my next visit to the city.

Why the hell I went to this place? Just wasted money. I relied on zomato & after reading such excellent reviews I went there. But now I understand these reviewers are paid by this restaurant. The only good thing is the ambience & interior decoration. Otherwise, its a place to be ignored.
1) The service is pathetic. The staff are unwilling to serve & you have to ask for salt & pepper and water. They give you food but you have to ask for the cutlery.
2) The quality & taste of food is so poor. The food is so expensive but still your taste buds do not get any satisfaction. The quantity is also very less.
I think the above two points are enough for me to hate this restaurant. I had a very bad experience & loss of money.

We ordered corn cakes and pan fried chilli chicken, both delicious preparations! For mains, we had burritto rolls. This mexican dish especially appealed to us, which was our pick of the lot! The best part..one of the waiters, Akbar Ali offered us a complimentary dessert, hazaron khwaishein aisi, a chocolate mud pie which floored us! We also loved jalebi bai, especially the innovative presentation of  the desserts! The staff are very friendly and service excellent! Love to come here again! üòäüòä

Visited this place trusting the ratings and reviews given in Zomato and most pleased to say that it didn't disappoint. Was amazed by the classic Bollywood theme and the service provided. One word for the place Flamboyant!! 
Would especially like to mention the name of Mr Akbar Ali, the guy who was in Bangalore for more than 10 years. A friendly yet quite professional waiter, who provided us with great service and left us nothing short of "tummy full satisfaction". 
Would definitely recommend this place for young adults. Drinks and food are unbelievable. Dig deep into the appetizers, they are nonpareil.

In an interesting turn of events and after an hour long debate on where to go for lunch on the special day of 25th July, we decided to visit Gabbar's after I won the debate by providing certain facts and figures for the outlet. Zomato says that the restro closes down at 4 PM, and hence I called up the place at 3 PM to have a reservation for 2 at around 3.30 PM. They readily accepted our reservation and jovially welcomed us.

The place is an easy find and is located at the lane which leads to the Pantaloons, Camac Street. Upon entering the place, we were escorted to a seat in the main dining hall, which was almost empty by that time. The place has a "Rampuri" feel and gives a vibe that you are at a "Desi Theka". The walls and the set up was very nice and aptly suited the name of the place. However, I personally felt that some of the photos from the portfolio shoots of the Bollywood actors and actresses were too modern and glamorous to go with the theme of the place.

¬†

We took our seats by 3.40 PM and were planing to order for some Indian dishes when the attendant blatantly told that they wont be serving Indian cuisines for now as the Indian kitchen is closed ! That was a bad stinker for us, as we decided to head towards Gabbar's for having a feel of their Indian expertise and moreover we were there before the closing time too. Beside, they had not revealed while taking reservation that the Indian cuisine wont be available. Saddened by the unavailability and exhausted enough to come out and search for another place, we decided to have a go at Chinese and Italian only.

We ordered for Pan Fried Chilli Chicken which was very ordinary yet tasty, a Penne Paprika Cream which was again nothing out of the box yet very yummy and creamy. The best of the lot however was a mocktail with a brilliant combination of Kaafir Lime and Lichi. It probably refreshed all the senses for the rest of the day ! But that was it and we thought of stopping the meal there only.

Coming to the service, it is in one word NOT DONE ! For an example, after we ordered, an attendant came to us with a Sphagetti dish and insisted on the fact that it was Penne Paprika Cream till we could convince him that "Mere bhai, this is not Penne. This is Sphagetti". And then they could discover that it was an order from the other table that was present at that time. Also, closing up the flagship cuisine before the closing time was not justified to us and the only answer they could give is a blunt face with no expressions. So, I would recommend them to work on the service and the management part of the restaurant to really stand tall in the Kolkata Food scene. Until then, it will all be surprises due to the vast gap of the Zomato ratings and the real-time experience.

It is definitely one of the better places in Kolkata. It is slightly tucked away a km away from Park Street and can be difficult to locate. The service is excellent and they have a large offering on their menu. Most of the dishes are avant garde and the ambiance also adds to the overall experience. Skip the other legacy restaurants on Park Street and head to this place.

Whatever the ambience and service. In an eating joint the food must be good. 
Food was pathetic and portions small. 
Mans were good but most gravies were high on salt. 
Koftas refuse to go down.
Could do with some fumigation.

We entered the place on a rainy afternoon. It was a cosy place with posters of Bollywood actors and movies from yesteryears. One wall dedicated to sholay. Bollywood songs were playing in the background, the seating was comfortable and staff were quite courteous. 


We ordered a Fish Ajwaini Tikka and Virjin Mojito to go with it. The starter was great though the fish could be a tad bit softer. The mocktail was a perfect blend of fresh mint and lime. 

Next we ordered butter naan and Murgh Tikka Lababdar ....the chicken side dish was quite spicy and went perfectly well with the naan. 


Overall ...a nice place to hangout. Recommend.

Finally made it after a failed attempt once earlier from a possible hour long wait on a Sunday evening. But I'm afraid cannot rate it more than what I have. For Bollywood themed decor I would rate Mirch Masala's way ahead. ¬†Music was too loud, stressing conversation. The service was good, waiters friendly and cooperative enough.¬†
I guess the presentation of food and beverages is the usp; that is supposed to be at the heart of the 'experience'. Well, innovative definitely but once the novelty value wears off the food somehow didn't measure up to the hoo haa.¬†
We tried the Potli Kebab - I found the portion size of 3 pieces a bit odd. They were good chicken pieces with stuffing of mince - I could detect of faint odor that at times linger in refrigerated red meat - if you know what I am talking about.¬†
The Papri chat was novel, with whisked foam of the chutneys but that turned the bhujiya soggy robbing the chat its crispy note. A bitter aftertaste permeated the whole thing, I guess some bad chemistry between the ingredients.¬†
Drums of heaven was a mistake in hindsight - I guess oriental is not their forte. Too salty and gingery for my taste.
The dessert was the highlight - Golmaal - a globe of choco encased mouse that melts once the hot chocolate sauce is poured on it. At least a good parting shot.
I won't comment on the prices as that was known in advance. But value for money? well drop in and decide for yourself.

Gabbar is a fun place to dine in with it's quirky decor. The service is brisk and our table manager MD Akbar Ali was really attentive and spot on with the recommendations. The Indian food harks back to memories of eating at the best road side dhabas while the desserts are spectacular with the theatre of molecular gastronomy and other fun playful elements. I would recommend the golmaal where the only golmaal would be making room for another one!

Located conveniently near the Park Street, the restaurant offers an amazing experience for a North Indian who had a struggle finding good Dal Makhani in Kolkata. They offer Italian and Chinese options as well (I could not experience both of these cuisines)
There are enough and (needless to mention) good options for Vegetarians and Non Vegetarians.¬†

Go there with an Empty stomach :D

They lose half a point, being a bit heavier on the pockets.¬†

P.S. You would want to visit there in a larger group to taste a range of starters and main courses. And yeah, who can forget Desserts (Jalebi Bai was an amazing Showstopper)

The place is conveniently located and has chic interiors..The menu is elaborate and patrons can have veg as well as non-veg and drinks are also available..The pricing is on the higher side and will burn a hole in your pocket but for a one time visit, This place is good. Taste wise the food isn't extraordinary but is served in innovative styles which make it look good. The desserts though only 4, will make your heart melt. Specially the mudpie and Golmaal (Chocolate ball). All in all this place is ok for a one time visit. You're sure to go bankrupt if you keep coming back. Laul.

This place is ideally located and quite easy to find. The food, ambiance is quite amazing. The staff is congenial. The food and presentation, both are excellent. I would recommend their Inverted Kheema Pav to everyone, who visits the place. But what surprised me the most was their dessert which came in the form of a plant! It is called Hazaron Khwayishein Aisi - a must try! It was delectable, to say the least. It is a haven for all chocolate lovers. Also, my friend loved the Chai Biskoot - another lip smacking dessert! These two desserts are our favourite and we order them, everytime we visit the place.

It is a decent option for dining but appears over rated.

LOCATION - Easily to locate the location.. Gabbar's is just beside American consulate in camac street,to be more precise just the opposite lane of Camac street Pantaloons.

DECOR & AMBIANCE -  Bollywood theme restaurant with a bright and fun interior. The famous Hindi film poster to Famous Gabbar's character imprint at the wall gives you a warm cozy feeling. Definitely a place to try out with friends ... but not a place for romantic setting or dates.

SERVICE - Won't say it's great.. but obviously it was fast..The most irritating part was that servers were standing in front...so sometimes is uncomfortable to talk. 

FOOD - Food is pretty decent with a Bollywood style names in the menu's will surely gives a twist and fun element while ordering. 
ESPECIALLY THE PRESENTATION OF THE FOOD NEED APPRECIATION.. 
MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY IS A BANG ON HIT IN GABBAR'S BAR & KITCHEN. 
I simply love their offers in happy hours and even in terms of food you get 1:1.

CONCLUSION - Gabbar's is a unique place to try out when people are bored with the same old dinning pattern. But the place needs to improve it's service and should actually try to make their staff bit more professional.

We ordered quite a few drinks and their presentation was an absolute delight to see !! Started with Lychee & Kaffir lime Mojito and Margarita with strawberry Ice lolly along with Garlic pepper prawns(Really Good!) and tandoori momo's(Ok-Ok). The drinks were amazing and so was the prawn.Followed by Garlic noodles(Pretty Good!) with coriander fish which was okay.. nothing exceptional but decent.
The service although was really nice and Akbar who served us was sweet and attentive. They also treated us with a complimentary Dessert - Jalebi with Rabri served with a twist ! It was reallyyyy good !!  Overall had a great time. üòÉüòÉ Would definitely love to come back again!!

Hands down Gabbar's strength is presentation. We ordered Balam puchkari, Lat me kai, Penne paprika cream, Hazaro khawaise jaisi and molecular paan. All of those were tasty but the serving size was average. Jawed was taking care of our table and he was very attentive. 

P.S. They didn't accept cards as their server was down. We should have been informed in the beginning upon entering rather than at the end while paying. There was some inconvenience caused as I had to go out to locate an ATM and take out cash.

It was a long time since I went hogging. Went there yesterday, with a group of 8 for my sister's birthday. Coincidentally, there were around 5 groups in the restaurant indulging in birthday celebrations. 

We reached in late at around 21.45. It was way crowded. But we, anyway, had our place reserved well in advance. 

The decor was pretty amazing with well lit lights and quirky designs and quotes on the wall which featured some of the popular dialogues from Sr. Bachchan's movie. The menu was pretty vibrant as well. It included an array of Indian and Chinese delicacies. Although they were pretty short on Italian dishes with only 6 items( 2 soups and 4 mains).
 
To start off, for the entrees, we went for the kebab platter. The galouti kebab was mesmerising. It just melted inside our mouth. Spellbinding, it was. The alcohol was well accounted for, as well. For someone reasons, I went for Italian instead of Indian and boy, I was amazed. Few people in my group, went for Indian and they were equally satisfied. The butter naan, the sides, pulao were all well accounted for. The portions were more than enough and we all were stoked at the end of the meal. 

For desserts, we went for a mud pie and jalebi bar. Now, I never had an inkling of how a jalebi bar would be and I absolutely loved the theatre associated with it. 

I loved the decor in there. The place was pretty well lit. This place had a rustic charm associated with it. The only thing, I did not like is the music was a bit loud and it was getting to difficult to conversate. 

Now, we had the esteem opportunity of paying a tax of ‚Çπ2000. The alcohol had a cess of 27% for which I can't say it is at all reasonable.

But, it is definitely a place where I would visit once again. Below, are few pictures which features few of the dishes as well as the decor. One can even see, the theatre associated with the Jalebi Bar.

An out-an-out Bollywood themed resto bar set on the background of what runs in the veins of all Hindi movie addicts. The bold and bright one liners painted on the walls quite sets the mood for a dramatic showdown. We were 2 people yet had to wait for 45mins to grab a seat, but when we did, we didn't regret the wait.
Set off with inverted vada paos which was not only innovative but also gobsmackingly tasty. The tanduri potlis, legs of chicken piped with spiced lamb mousse and tandooried(I couldn't resist using this word) to perfection.
The curry leaf infused lemon drink was good and the ooze of cool smoke from below did add a theatre to the drink if not taste.
Mango cigars, again a gastronomic adventure, serving wafer thin pastry cylinders filled with mango flavored mascarpone cream along with thinly diced fresh mango - the quantity of the dish was saddening though.
The place is great, the food is too but the portions can be bit more generous for the cost.

Finally visited this place on last Friday night! It had been on my must visit list since forever, mainly because of the beautiful Molecular Gastronomic dishes it offers...and their wonderful pictures on Zomato.

Honestly, I felt the place was missing the "X" factor. The ambiance is good and so are the food and the drinks. But for some reason I just had an almost there feeling, and not completely there.

The Ambience is really great. It has a bar in the waiting area which I really like and is quite unusual also in restaurants in Kolkata. The rest of the place is divided into two sections with good warm lighting and lots of tables, spread with a lot of spacing in between. It was Friday evening and as expected the place was full. After a couple of minutes of waiting we found a table in the first section from entrance after the waiting area. It had a single TV screen which was telecasting euro 2016. There was a lot of noise in the area partly from the Murmur of the crowd and partly from the loud music being played in the section further down.

We ordered Balam Puckhari, Pav Bhaji Fondue, Inverted Keema Pav and Highway de Dhaabe di Shaam (Chhole Kulcha) along with Lambi Race ka Ghoda LIIT with red bull, Cosmopolitan and Kala Khatta Margarita. From the reviews that I had thread I really had a lot of expectations from the dishes and drinks. And they lived up to them as far as the presentation was concerned. 11 on 10 for the food preparation and presentation. Keema pav was decent and so was chole kulche. Balam Pichkari again was decent to taste. The Pav Bhaji foundue was really spectacular!!
That drinks were quite strong, which I really liked. Kala Khatta Margarita was the unique drink we ordered here as it turned out to be so so. There was just a slight hint of Kala Khatta with strong on Tequila base.

The service was fast, in fact faster than it should have been. They cleared the puchka and the fondue before we were finished. In terms of quantity the dishes were alright actually good for their prices. The service staff was all right. Nothing to complaint about and also nothing that sets it apart. In terms of cost it sure is expensive but also worth the value you derive from it.

For improvements I would suggest they can make the service a lot more friendly and they can also improve on the taste of the food. I Would Still recommend this place to anyone because of its food and good drinks. if you are a fan of molecular gastronomy then you definitely have got to try this place out!

Visited Gabbar's one fine evening, and fortunately it was the Last Jumma Night before Eid, 2016. Heard a lot about this place from friends, family and acquaintances. Never knew that The City Of Joy could have such a place where eating could have been a lot more than just walking to a fine dining. Also, Mr. Jawed, has been very kind while serving us. A must visit for all those who love Bollywood and its endless drama!

Good presentation of starters and good service by Aman. We had Papri Chat, Mushroom Tea, Chola Kulcha and Chinese food. Must try the Mud pie which has a new style of presenting it with an astonishing look.

Molecular gastronomy. Period. When Heston Blumenthal is your culinary God that's one reason good enough to pay a visit. Was meeting a friend after a year almost and this place proved to be the best pick considering our love for Bollywood, food and anything out-of-the-box.

We tried to order all the items which had "molecular gastronomy" and "Gabbar recommends" to it. We had Corn cakes and Gabbar style papdi Chaat for starters. Corn cakes was a big miss for me - over priced, lack of flavour and extremely oily. Papdi Chaat was the extreme opposite - must order for its appeal and bang on flavours. For the mains we had Mongolian noodles which was like any gravy noodles. The mocktails stole the show completely - one with curry leaves and the other with litchi. For desserts we ordered the dessert of the day - mango cigars which gave the best finishing touch to our meal - sweet and simple. Loved the part where they served us the bill in a miniature metal trunk saying #damage. Surprises never end here!

The service is quick and staff is courteous too. They even customise few things if we have specifications. Special heads up if you plan to visit over the weekends - make sure you make prior reservation or reach before 7pm for dinner. It gets extremely crowded in no time. Only reason I am not giving it a perfect 5 is because of the dishes that are not Gabbar recommended and do not give good value for money.

Must visit for every foodie out there!

A too hype restaurant. Felt that could have been better had the food quality been maintained. We ordered for "Balam Pichkari" but it was tasteless. But the presentation was impressive. Then came the Dhaba de Shaan which was average. The evening had been spoilt and the main course, the signature dal , paneer and mix veg with breads could not lift the mood. So a pocket pinching 
dinner.

I went to this place in Happy hours hoping to have a nice evening with my friends, and then left with a disappointing experience. The Food was average, ambiance was also average, worst of all is the logic that you have to finish the food within a certain amount of time if u order in happy hours. I don't mind paying for food that is worth it. But for this kind of quality and shit quantity, I would rather go to a different place next time. Also they charge u with 4 kinds of tax. Found that amusing. ¬†P.S : The happy hours is just a facade, they divide the 1 plate food to 2 plates and claim them to be 1+1

The food was delicious to be honest. We went there during their special happy hours time which is from 5pm-7pm. Now this is where the fun begins.

The happy hour offer is 1+1 on alcohol and appetizers, you buy 1 get one free. We order 2 chicken dishes for Rs. 325 each, and they served us 5 pcs of drums of heaven on each plate which totals to 10. While exiting after paying the bill, we saw the same dish in a larger plate with 10 pcs being served to non- happy hour customers. So the trick is, even though they say its 1+1 you actually get 1 plate worth starters. Great scam indeed.

Also, the food cost us 1630, to which they added a Rs. 600 tax resulting in a total bill of Rs. 2200.

Never again.

Alongwith a drink chintoo which was a small LIIT... Perfect.

The saga of 2nd year treats continue.

We wanted to try something new and heard of this chic place. The 1st thing that we noticed when we entered this place was the bar just beside the entrance called the Cocktail Kitchen. The seating area for the place is quite small for a place promoting itself as a chic bar. The ambiance of the place was nice. One of the walls was filled with graffiti's from the movie Sholay, which was the only Gabbar connection of the place. The decor in terms of the lights and all were unique, as compared to Kolkata standards.

Regarding the service, they served us fast but not as courteous as one can expect them to be. I am still not sure as to why they served normal water in used mineral water bottles.

Regarding food and beverages, we started off with the following
1. Bailey's
2. Grilled Prawn
3. Fish fry
4. Kung Pao chicken
5. Chicken Hakka Noodles
6. Kulfi desserts

These are the non-vegetarian food that was on the table. Similarly we had a gamut of vegetarian food on the table. The portions were big enough and were filling. They also had quite a good offering of drinks from the classic JDs, Glen to funky Chintus, Kamakazie.

The crowd was nice too and looked as they were having a nice time.

I had heard and read too much about Gabbar‚Äôs to not pay a visit and check out for myself whether it‚Äôs worth the hype or not.I ordered almost all the things on the menu with the Molecular Gastronomy tag, and the theatrical quotient in all of them were amazing. Be it the Paani-puri, the Spinach Chaat or the Makai Roti-Sarson Da Saag, all of these humble things have been deconstructed and jazzed up enough to induce awe. However, taste wise, they can be bettered in parts.
                                                                ...

I heard about Gabbar's from a friend and had been dying to visit this place. And tonight I got the chance! Must say, it was an awesome experience! 

Ambiance was lovely. The Bollywood theme was lovely - for a film buff like me 

The music as peppy, but a teeny weeny bit loud

Service was quick and prompt. And Akbar was very helpful with suggestions. He even got us a complimentary dessert! Shoutout to Akbar!

Lovely experience on a Friday evening with good friends!

Located opposite Jyoti Vihar..near the US Consulate..Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen is a Bollywood theme based restaurant serving food in an innovative way with a touch of molecular gastronomy..
It's a nice and catchy theme..but they could have done a better job with the decor..
The menu was really engaging though..good job with that..
Overpriced for sure!
Bachchan Saabs kabab Platter - loved it..presentation was average..
Papdi Chat- it's one of Gabbar's specials..well..honestly we did not like it all..
Something was not with the curd..
Service was really slow..need to work on that a bit..
Loved the way they presented us the bill..
Overall a good experience..

At Gabbar‚Äôs what I love is the fun combination of good food with a bit of molecular gastronomy from time to time to keep things interesting. Once inside the place, quotes from villains and funny dialogues would stand out from time to time. Identifying your way through Sholay to Andaaz Apna Apna, the place is an ode to the vibrancy of Bollywood, and we were seated at the private room, which was the ‚Äòkingpin‚Äôs den‚Äô.

The name in itself suggests and describes hoe the ambience of the restaurant is going to be.The place is good except that the tables could have been places more spaciously.Coming to the food,we tried panipuri which was good,papri chat also tasty yummy.However bajirao bhel was a major disappointment, as it was cooked on a stove and a blend of khichdi and muri.It did not appeal to us at all.The desserts were good.The jalebi bai is a must try,and so is the mango cigar.Mango cigar was a today's special item and was very delicious. Paw bhaji fondue is also a good innovation and is a must try.It is served hot and leaves us craving for more.On a scale of ten I would rate it as 8.5.A good place for all of the family!

We had lichi mojitto and beer for drinks...for starters we took murg malai nazaaqat which was soft amd delicious...for main course we had cheese chilli olive nan which had a very unique and pleasant taste...warqi paratha which was excellently delicious and crispy along with makhan singhs butter chicken amd gost rana...the mutton main course was better than the chicken one
The best part was their well known dessert "hazaaron khwaishen aisin" which is a mouthwatering mudpie topped wid oreo soil with vanilla icecream sandwitched in between designed to hav the appearance of a plant pot...
The bill was a bit exorbitant bt afterall the food was worth it...would lik to visit this place again

Gabbar as the name says it a hype restaurant with no rules and pattern. Even after booking they take 45 mins to give the table... Then to welcome the guests on the tables they have cockroach  on the table loitering around  to haunt you and make you feel as if you are sitting in a road side dhaba. When you call the waiter to order the food they don't know the ingredients of the menu. For starters they suggest us to have pav bhaji and nan n roti .... The crispy babycorns we ordered had no crispiness and it was sweet rather than spicy. Then the cheese balls served to you were as if they have called us for the menu tasting round n not dinner. The drinks being served were like u are drinking 10ml drinks rather than a 60 ml ones. Last but not the least food was below average as per the amount we paid for the hype restaurant in town...

Awesome food experience @Gabbar's. Was on the list for a long time.  We had heard a lot about the place and their experiments with food. And with superb results I must say!! Each and every dish will blow your senses and challenge your taste buds!! Special mention may be made of Balam Puchkari, Makkhan Singh's Butter Chicken, Cheese Olive Naan (Yummilicious) and Oh my God, the desserts!! Hazaron khwaishein aisi (mud pie served like a potted plant) and mango cigars!! It was truly a mind blowing gastronomical experience. Special mention may be made of Mr. Deepak who gave us very nice suggestions while ordering. Will definitely come back for more and recommend to my friends and family.

Dropped in at around 7.30 pm. The staff is warm and will make you feel comfortable. The walls will definitely draw your attention. The place is nice and cozy, feels like more of a family restaurant. Started with Sangria(Red), it was more on the sweeter side. The food portions are small and you will get over it before you can even get the taste of it. If you are a big fan of cocktails then you can drop in here. Also, if you don't have a clue about what gastronomical thing is then you can try it out for once.

Its a movie themed restuarant so from menu card to wall decor, food name to ambiance you will that you're in somewhere different. Quite likeable.

‚óèDrinks‚óè
Drinks we had Orange Mojito and L'AFFAIR Paris.
Orange mojito was awesome and L'AFFAIR Paris was decent moctail made of Pomegranate merged with cranberry juice (not syrup).

‚óèAppetizers‚óè
In appetizers we would like to have all the kebabs from there menu but we were only two person so that's why our server suggest us to go for "Mogambo Khush Hua" which is basically consisted of all of four special kebab they had pc of two each.

Fish Ajwani Tikka was really a great dish.. excellent taste and a must try.

Chicken reshmi was also good.

Chicken tikka was decent.

Galouti Kebab was okeish..

Also we tried Pan Fried Chilli Fish which was good.

‚óèMain Course‚óè
Makhmali Butter chicken was good but the flavour is less buttery and had taste of tomato.

Chicken Biryani was decent, sufficient for one people. It had 4 soft pcs of boneless chicken.

Chilli Cheese olive naan was just great.

‚óèDesserts‚óè
Mumbai meri jaan- is molecular koolfi, very good and presentation was awesome.

Mango cigars is also a molecular desert. Also good

‚óèService‚óè
Service was not excellent but good and there are seriously a scope for improvement.
Staffs behaviour was polite and gentle.
They are charging 5% of Service Charge instead of 10% which is really appreciated. 

‚óèVerdict‚óè
If you want to try a themed restuarant with variety of unique presentable food just go for this.

Very nice theatrical aspect to this place. Must try the dishes which have a chef hat tag on them. They are the specials and are really worth trying. I ordered Mogambo Khush Hua on just reading the name, and seeing that it was the non veg kebab platter. It was just great, and mogambo sach me khush ho gya. Nice experience. Decent service and decent prices can make it a frequent visit for many,

We were 3 couples, expected good food apart from ambience but all of us disappointed. Place is over hyped for sure. There are better places to eat for sure as far as food is concerned. Service, they tried hard but few not up to the mark..may be due to weekend and overcrowding. Overall one time experience is good enough to think about other places. Food at this price need serious improvements.

This place was there in my bucket list for a long time. I came here on 3rd June. Located near the American Consulate Office, you have to walk 300 m passing the place and reach a gated compound building. That is where the place is located for this restro.
The place is pretty big with a much Bollywood feeling. The walls are quirked up with graffitis of Bollywood movies of different times. There were walls dedicated to each era. I also liked the song quotes or teasers of different films all put up on a wall with silhouettes of many characters from all genres of films. The ambiance was much filmy with a flavour of Bollywood. Music was being played keeping that in mind creating an aura of perfect filminess.
It was pretty late in the afternoon. They were almost about to close the kitchen. So we had to order everything together. We went by

The place is well located in the heart of city. Perfect location to go for office luncheons. The Indian food collection is really tasty and also gave very good offers on beer. The ambience is very new and fresh for Kolkata. Service overall is good with little hiccuping here and there which you can well ignore after you taste the food. 3.5 out of 5 for the delicious food and amazing ambience. Service needs a little more attention.

Amazing.... That's the word which strikes my mind the moment I think about the experience I had here.
Molecular Gastronomy, a concept pretty new in the city has been brilliantly adopted here (MG is about having the taste of all the ingredients in a dish, with flavors mingling with each other).
The ambience of the restaurant is amazing with Bollywood dialogues n pictures all across the place. The staffs are amazing n help a lot while ordering new dishes.
Coming to food, it has the best presentation of food in the city. We had Puchka n Papdi chat in starters which was served in a unique way. Then we ordered pav bhaji fondoe, amritsari kulcha n chhola and Maggie spring roll in dinner. We went on to have mango cigars, mudpie and molecular pan in desserts. Also we ordered Lambhi race ka ghoda (LIIT) and Orange Mojito. Both were very well prepared.
The list is too long to explain all the items. I am putting the pics of all of them. My readers can have a look to feel how excited i would have been when they were served.
Also, the bill was served in a tiffin box on a Khatiya.
Amazing experience, a must visit for all.

Unexpectedly landed up here and ended up having the best and the 1st ever vegetarian meal of my life. The place serves non veg,don't get me wrong. But the fun and the molecular gastronomy lies is the veg range..
1. Balam puchkari: looks out of the world. Tastes almost as good.
2. Tomato and Basil soup: the basil is in the form of slimy cylinders. melt in your mouth
3. Mushroom tea: this was easily my dish of the day. The experience of making it was novel and with every sip I went WOOooooW!
But warning, the taste is subtle, so prepare your tongue
4. Creamy penne: Mixed sauce,no nonsense pasta,filling and heart warming
Extremely quick service and the staff pays good attention to you without being pushy! 
A must visit for everyone, experimenter or not.

I went to gabbars kitchen by chance but ended up having a fantastic experience. They hav this very innovative concepts of molecular gastronomy which is brilliant. Tried it with their puchkas . Something very different. They had innovation in something as simple as a soup in the form of mushroom chai. And the paprika pasta was out of the world. The way they served the items are also so creative and nice. Excellent service , excellent food , excellent restaurant.

‚ÄúKitne aadmi they?‚Äù

Who can forget this iconic dialogue of one of the most iconic villains from one of the most iconic films of Bollywood? I guess no-one. In a similar fashion one cannot just forget the inimitable tastes of the dishes after having food from the Bollywood themed restaurant of Kolkata- Gabbar‚Äôs Bar & Kitchen. Maybe that has something to do with the quirky names given to the dishes, or may be because of using ‚Äòmolecular gastronomy‚Äô principles to the traditional methods of serving. How much the outlet fares in quality of the food let‚Äôs find out.

Recently team PanchPhoron was invited over for a dinner at Gabbar‚Äôs. Finding the restaurant was pretty easy. Located on Russel street, it‚Äôs situated where the erstwhile Mexican joint ‚Äòamigos‚Äô used to be. From the outside it seems a bit small, specially the waiting area is too congested to let you even imagine what sort of things wait for you inside. Nonetheless the waiting area also houses the bar, & has some quirky one liners written on small placards which you can use for those group selfies as you wait for your turn at the tables. As we entered the main dining area we were quite surprised by the size of it. It truly is spacious. The walls are adorned with graffiti‚Äôs & quotes from Bollywood films. Looked quite good. Great for a family dinner or lunch, or even hanging out with friends. The tables & chairs were quite formal though. We were welcomed by Harsh, the owner who gave us a brief intro about how the concept of Bolly-theme came, & how the idea of serving molecular gastronomy emerged. Finally the food started arriving at the tables. The brief review of items that were served is given below.

Drinks:

Litchi & kaffir lime Mojito:
The scent of the lime mixed with the sweetness of litchi made this combination a refreshing welcome drink. Even the idea of serving it in pouch packs with straws was quite unfamiliar.

Watermelon Basil Mojito:
Fresh watermelon puree mixed with crushed basil leaves. Another great drink to have in the summer.

Both the mojitos were served in alcoholic & non-alcoholic versions. The virgin mojitos were good, but no point for guessing that they tasted better with alcohol.

Curry Apple Foamtini:
The drink with a twist in the presentation. The glass of apple juice & blended curry leaves were placed inside a bowl containing dry ice. Fuming & looking like smoking hot, this was a chilled refresher.

Lambi Race ka Ghoda:
One of their innovative cocktails. A mix of White Rum, Vodka, Gin, Cointreau & Thums up this one was served in a one litre measuring cylinder you find in chemistry labs.Just imagine so many types of alcohol in a singles serving, that too in such a huge quantity. The long vessel looked intimidating & inviting , the concoction quite strong. Actually ended up liking it & drinking half of it in one go!

Raspberry & Kala Khatta Daiquiri:
These two rum & lime based cocktails with ample crushed ice were good too. But well, after having Lambi Race ka Ghoda , surely any other drink feels pale.

Appetisers:

Rome Ali Pizza:
Giving a subcontinental twist to the Italian delicacy, this one was basically a super thin crust pizza (rumali roti) , with chunks of chicken & loads of cheese. Not too much of non-sensical veggies, this one was a no-nonsense bang on point meal starter.

Chicken Potli Kebab:
A double dose of chicken, minced chicken or keema stuffed inside chicken drumsticks, this one was well appreciated by all. Although the keema was a bit bland compared to the outer drumstick, all in all it was another great starter.

Tandoori Momos:
This one is fairly common nowadays. The familiar dumplings instead of being steamed/fried are being coated with marinade & roasted in a tandoor. Looks like a Kebab, tastes more than momos is all I can say.

Balam Puchkari:
This thing (can't call it a dish, really), when arrived at the table, it was a total attention grabber. Eight pieces of crisp phuchka/golgsppa lying inside their own spoon, resting on a bed of artificial grass in a tray which looked like a small English garden complete with a set of miniature table & chair. It was a sheer delight to look at the presentation. Also present was a bowl of fuming vapours which housed test tubes of Pudina & Imli water. Can give a 10/5 for this unique presentation. Sadly the pudina & Imli water were a bit dilute & lacked the punch one would normally expect.

Inverted Pav (keema/Vada):
The name says it all. Instead of slicing the Pav & stuffing it with the filling, it's done the other way round. The Pav here was covered with the 'filling' (which should now be called coating to be precise) & batter fried. A twist to a much loved dish, yet maintaining great taste.
The visual treat here were the condiments & sauces being served in mini hawkins pressure-cookers no more than small cups in size. They looked so much in place & perfect for the Indian theme of gabbars.

Highway de Dhaabe di Shaan: Amritsari Kulche served Gabbar's style:
To honour the Amritsari flavour infusion, the high way ki shaan kulchas actually arrived in jeeps. Actually toy jeeps, but those looked cute as hell. Palm sized fluffy kulchas, preloaded with chole ke bhature. Beside the jeeps were small steel pails which contained the salads.
Another interesting presentation . Taste great as well.

Main Course:

Gabbar ki maa ki daal:
Fancy name aside this would be daal makhani, I.e. Black lentils cooked with select spices. Served in aluminium sauce pan, this was quite average in taste.

Paneer Tikka Masala:
Thank God that this one did not come with a weird name. This too was served in an aluminium sauce pan. The flavour was good.

Lasooni Palak:
Spinach puree cooked with lots of garlic, this was a bit better tasting dish, blame it on my partiality to garlics, be it garlic bread or lasooni naan!

Makhan Singh Butter Chicken:
Grilled Chicken tikka simmered in rich tomato butter gravy. This one was a perfect dish among the side dishes of the evening. The lightly grilled kebabs were soft while the gravy rich in taste as well texture. It was a pleasure to have these with the parathas.

Kochi pathar jhol:
No. Don't. Just please don't. Although I'm not a huge lover of pathar jhol, as a Bengali I know how that tastes. The rich aroma of the pathar jhol is a quintessential part of Bengali cuisine along with sorshe ilish & murighontos. When you try to twist it in whatever way you try, if you fail, you come crashing bad, real bad. This was an disappointment to say the least. The gravy was watery, the spices were missing. Even the perfectly cooked muttons couldn't save the show.

Accompaniments:

Warqi Parathas:
Crisp flakey parathas best enjoyed with the butter chicken. This one was the best of the parathas served.

Garlic nan:
As I said earlier, this one I loved too, specially the extra dose of garlic.

Masala kulchas:
Minced vegetables stuffed into soft flour dough baked in tandoor. Soft & tasty.

Steamed rice:
The rice was a bit dry, may be because of being prepared in bulk & reheated as per order. Could be looked after.

Desserts:

Hazaron Khwahishein Aisi:
Order this, & they'll hand you a clay pot with a green sapling. Dig into the 'mud' & you'll find its actually a mix of crumbled choco brownie topped with a mix of vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce & Oreo biscuit. Each ingredient is great by itself. & It can't go wrong when you have all of them at once. This one was just amazing. & Extra marks for the presentation.

Golmaal:
Again a deceiving item, initially it will look like a dark coloured cricket ball, obviously which it isn't. It's actually made of dark chocolate, which gradually melted off as hot chocolate sauce was poured over it revealing the inner ball of chocolate ice cream. Chocolate , chocolate & chocolate. Actually it was an overdose of chocolate. I for one would like to have the same dish, but the chocolate ice cream replaced with some crunchy non-chocoltey ice cream.

Jalabi Bai:
Jalabi caviar soaked in saffron sugar syrup, topped with chopped pistachios served with rabdi foam. The description seemed interesting, even the recipe too. But I've had better jalabi & rabdi at other places.

Mango Cigars:
This too arrived in a great getup. Smoking light coloured cigars placed in an ashtray . The cigars were actually very thin cream rolls. Where the usual cream had been replaced with a blend of macaroons cheese & mango pulp. The outer dry flakey texture hid the soft tangy yet sweet filling inside. Delightful to look at & also to eat.

Molecular paan:
Here the twist was that the traditional betel leaves were replaced with edible potato starch sheets, with a mix of pan masala & shredded betel leaves on top. Well the presentation was a bit innovative , specially anyone will confuse the starch sheet for thin plastic, but in reality those are edible, & the whole thing tasted as good as a normal masala paan.

To say the truth this was as much a gastronomic delights as much it was a visual delight. The Bollywood themed ambience were equally complemented by the quirkily named dishes. The innovative style of servings came as another treat to the eyes. The drinks , sides & desserts get full scores from me, though some of the mains do need attention.
The service was great, staff polite. Mr. Harsh, the manager was ever present to look after us & explaining to us various details of the dishes that were being served.
Surely our group had a gala time tasting the dishes, taking pics & doing what not.
If not for the mains & sides I'm surely going back for the drinks & desserts. They were just too good.
Till then
Happy eating
Cheers!
                                          ...

"Kitne aadmi they?"

The answer :

We were a huge group of food lovers who hurled into Gabbar's. The first time with a gang of new foodies of Zomato. Thanks Samridhi and the team Zomato. The second time of course, the owner himself , Mr. Harsh, called us for a food tasting session.

A long coveted dineout at the Bollywood themed eatery as suggested by the name has been on my wishlist from the time Amigos has been replaced. The star attraction? An experience of molecular gastronomy at affordable rates.Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen is a Bollywood themed restaurant which serves Indian, Chinese, Mexican & Italian.

Location : Gabbar‚Äôs is very strategically positioned in Ho Chi Minh SaraniKankaria Estate, Park Street area. The best way to reach is to avail the Maidaan metro , walk straight through Ho Chi Minh towards Metro plaza, and straight towards ICCR and there stands Gabbars on the left.

Decor and ambience : Gabbar's surely stands out for the ambience it has created with aesthetic and imaginative d√©cor, design and art work all blended to bring out a beautiful whole.

Gabbar Singh is spread across the entire space of the restaurant from the naming through the d√©cor with posters from different films alongside big drawings and sketches from Sholay and famous dialoguem The bottom line of the restaurant is that it celebrates villainy in mainstream Hindi cinema. The space is divided into two sections ‚Äì the main hall with tables backgrounded by a beautiful brick-painted wall with slogans and titles of different films and sketches of Vijay Dinanath Chouhan of Agneepath, Thakur of Sholay and Gabbar drawn in simple lines and filled out in solid colours. There is an inner section called Hideout. ‚ÄúHideout‚Äô is themed around the villains of Bollywood. It can accommodate 24 guests. It has low-level sofas and couches. The walls almost look like the inside of a prison with posters. The cutlery and crockery are a treat to watch and make their own fashion statements.

Mogambo Khush Hua appears several times across the walls with one poster of Amrish Puri in his famous Mogambo get-up . More modern variations of the filmy villain are introduced through slogans like Teja Main Hoon, Main Hoon Teja (Tezaab), or, Nayak Nahin Khalnayak Hoon Main (Khalnayak) and many more.
It feels as if you walking down the lanes of bollywood with myriads of movie scenes flashing past you.

Staff: The staffs were amazing. They exactly knew what they did serve. They were hospitable, welcoming. The owner himself, Mr. Harsh , wae ever ready to serve us. The food served was hot and was served with love and care.

Food and Beverages : to accompany us in our foodway journey, we had a series of the mouth-watering dishes which have intriguing names along with imaginative concoctions inspired from the lyrics of the Bollywood songs and character. Their out of box presentation incorporating molecular gastronomy deserves a special mention.

Cocktails and Mocktails :
1. Litchi anr Kaffir Lime Mojito- kaffir lime leaves muddled with litchi crush,topped with soda was really amazing. The fumes added to the mysticism. However, I feel the litchi flavour was marred away by the staunch kaffir lime.

2. Watermelon basil mojito- fresh watermelon puree infused with crushed basil leaves. This was indeed very refreshing. Served in inverted electric bulbs.

3. Curry Apple Foamtini- apple juice and curry leaves blended together topped with foam. This was served in cute cutting chai glass and indeed was amazing.

4. Lambi race ki ghoda - a typical LIIT otherwise named bollywood style. This contains white rum, vodka, gin, cointreau and tequila mixed together and topped with thumbs up. This is rightly named, you have to be a strong player to win the race.

5. Strawberry and kalakhatta daiquiri -
The strawberry daiquiri was decent with the right amount of sweetness. However the kalkakhatta flavour was a real surprise as we Indians are too accustomed to these Indian flavours. A must try.

Appetisers:
1. Rome Ali Pizza - roomali roti topped with sauce and cheese, baked and served as a pizza. This was thin crust, soft and really nice.

2. Chicken potli kebab- spicy chicken keema filled in chicken drumstick, baked in tandoor. This was served with a mint chutney which was out of the world.

3. Tandoori chicken momos - regular momos stuffed with a filling, steamed and then baked in tandoor. This was one of the better momos that I have tasted in my recent past.

4. Balam Puchkari- now this is in a truest sense the USP of the restro. The crisp semolina puris filled with spicy potato filling topped with mint chutney spheres. The presentation fetches the rest of the mark, where the khatta paani comes in test tube laid on green carpet enabling you to become nostalgic about the phuchkas near deshapriya park. Definitely one of the recommdations.

5. Inverted Keema Pao- pav buns covered with spicy mutton keema mixture batter fried. This is a Mumbai special, cooked in just the right way..

6. Highway de dhabe di shaan - amritsari kulcha chhole served Gabbar's style. This was the baap of all presentation. The highway feel was brought in by the wood cutout of a truck written good carriage..a small truck bore the kulcha along with the chhole along with the garlic and onion chutney just nailed it.

Palate cleanser:
Served between the Appetisers and the mains was Mojito Sphere which is a gastronomic delight.

Mains:

1. Gabbar ki Maa ki daal - black lentils cooked with spices Dal makhani style. This was basically the tadka markey daal.

2. Paneer tikka masala- cottage cheese cubes marinated with spices and charcoal grilled. The gravy tasted amazing. I nearly finished half of the breads with this.

3. Munni ke badnaam kofte - spinach balls deep fried and simmered in cashewnut gravy. This was yet another veggie delight.

4. Makhan Singh Butter chicken- grilled chicken tikka simmered in rich tomato butter gravy. This was again one of the USP of the mains. This along with the parathas were amazing an affair.

5. Kochi pathar jhol - tender mutton pieces pressure cooked in a semo dry spicy gravy was served with steamed rice. This was however a major turn off. Being a bong myself, I will not ask for the Kochi pathar jhol. A kind suggestion for improving this.

Accompaniments:

1. Warqi Paratha - flaky griddle roasted paratha was amazing an affair

2. Garlic naan - naan overloaded with chopped garlic and baked in tandoor was great.

3. Steame rice - soft fluffy boiled basmati rice.

4. Masala kulcha- finely grated vegetables stuffed in refined flour dough baked in tandoor. The kulcha had become hard when it was being served

Desserts: the desserts are presumably the heriones of the restro as all the guys were hunting for the desserts.

1. Hazaron Khwahishen aisi - crumbled chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream,chocolate sauce and crushed oreo biscuits. The portion is served in a pot presumably to make it look like it. The soil is basically the dessert topped with a mint leaf.

2. Mango cigars - The crisp filo pastry stuffed with mango and mascarpone cheese.m were amazing. The stuffing was rolled into cigar shaped . One bite and you get blown off.

3. Jalebi baai - jalebi caviars soaked in saffrom syrup, topped with chopped pistachio,served witb rabdi foam. This is molecular gastronomy to the ultimatum. The jalebi topper with rabdi is a deadly affair.

4. Molecular paan- this is one of the unique dishes of gabbars. The edible potato starch sheets topped paan masala and chopped betel leaves was a real surprise. Do not know how they make the paan using the starch paper which melts if a drop of water is even present instead of the betel leaf. Finessse to its heights.

5. Golmaal - this was the first trial with the bloggers before launching it in the menu. This is just the ultimatum. A chocolate bal appears with a chocolate sauce beside . The chocolate sauce is poured over the ball. And lo ho! The chocolate starts melting down and finally does burst to expose off the chocolate cream inside the ball. And the taste! Ummmhmmmm m- deadly is the word. So this one is a sheer recommendation for all chocolate freaks.

Value for money : Although the price appears to be on the steeper end, the concept of molecular gastronomy using liquid nitrogen is quite a new concept . And getting them at such easy rates is hard to get. So I believe gabbar's provides the best at easy rates. The portions are decent.

Gabbar stands out as the eternal villain who has lived for 40 years in the hearts of film lovers and so will Gabbar's Bar and Kitchen will live on through their concotions created through imagination that can work like magic on our taste buds and add to our culinary versatility. The taste continued to swagger on and on in the taste buds for ages to come.
Cheers guys!!

The Bollywood themed restaurant is a much-visit place located in Ho Chi Minh Sarani opposite US Consulate.
It was pretty much packed up but thankfully we had booked a table before hand. The names in the menu were unique and it took us quite a time to decide, out of the wonderfully named dishes. Finally we ordered Highway De dhaba Di shaam and Stuffed mushrooms. The kulcha and amritsari chola came in a truck shaped tray and were rolled up together. Mushrooms were filled with cheese. Next we shifted to Indian Main course which was amazing and better than we had expected. Gabbar ki Maa ki daal was excellent. Kadhai Paneer and Kashmiri Aloo dum were good too. In the end we completed our dinner with Virgin Mojito which came in a nice Glass mug. The place is specialised in decorations and presentation. The wallpaper of classic actors with their fav dialogues are worth clicking pictures for. Overall we had a wonderful experience.

Amazing mesmerizing place with a brilliant bollywood ambience. Super food aided by excellent recommendations by Deepak. Spoilt by the options in the menu. The brocolli starters were to die for. Although the cheese balls were a little dense, the light spaghetti mains made up for it. The dish of the day was hazaaron khwaishe aide hands down. A beautiful pot of chocolate mousse, vanilla ice cream and Chico flakes. 

Gabbars never disappoints. A must visit place if you are visiting park street and around.

Coming back for more soon.

This place was in my wishlist for such a long time.And the one day,my friend decided to treat me here.

This restaurant is all about BOLLYWOOD.The ambiance is exceptional.Dim lights.The walls are covered with posters of all movies,pictures of movie stars and crazy writings.Even the menu has a lott of items with bollywood names.The playlist is top notch,playing mostly Arijit Singh's soulful tracks.It's a different world altogether.

Now,coming to the food.We ordered:-

1.drums of heaven

2.crispy prawns with garlic pepper

3.peas pulao

4.Makhhan singh's butter chicken

5.Hazaaron khwahishein aisi(dessert)

6. 2 cokes

Everything tasted delicious. Aboulutely delicious.Both the appetizers cames witha garlic sauce which tasted great. I personally do not like peppercorns,that is why I did not like the prawns that much,albeit my friend seemed to love it.The peas pulao was really really good.But the butter chicken....uff ! Jawab nahi. YOU MUST TRY THIS.It's fantastic,not exaggerating at all.And the dessert...yumm.It comes in a plant pot.Fudge brownie covered in ice cream and topped with crushed oreos.Nothing can go wrong about this.

Loved the place.Food is presented in an excellent way.Service is superb.We got after 1st appetizer within 5mins of ordering.Prices are on the steeper side with 5% service tax.There is a minor issue,that is flies.But I'm sure that can be shoved aside.There was supposed to be a little concert there with Lagnajita Chakraborty and we didnt miss the opportunity to click a selfie with her.

This was on my list since a long time and finally made it with my friends a while back. Its definitely one of those few places in Calcutta who has implemented and thought of Gastronomy techniques which deserves high appreciation. Coming to the interiors which is like really well done and totally goes with the name. Choice of music and ambience goes parallel.
Ordered for Puchkas which was made out of semolina and on top of that was green pudhina chutney which was made using gastronomy technique. It was really nice and well prepared. I really liked the tamarind water which they provided with it.
Next we ordered for Black Dal,ALU do pyaza, breads and everything was upto the mark and properly made.
For desserts we ordered Chocolate dish which was again prepared using molecular gastronomy technique and was simply exquisite. What I liked most about this place is that they have worked really on the presentation. Its beautifully presented which makes it all the more tempting.

This Place Is Something Kolkata Has been waiting for long long time. The interior is nothing off the hook. But the walls have some funny n crazy stuff written. It's refreshing. When you are first handed the menu you feel lost. Believe me it's good that you don't know what to order. 
We were their for fine dinning. But the the first page of the menu took us for a spin. In all we ordered 6 different types of starters and all were off the hook. The presentation to the Taste everything was amazing. The presentation itself was so tempting we could not control. Then came the desert. " Golmal " is the name it was so chocolaty but we did not for once keep our hands away. The plate was a clean slate. Had a Lovely food experience after ages in Kolkata. Have not tried the other portion of the menu. Will soon do that too...

This is the second time I've been to Gabbar in the matter of a few months and it hasn't disappointed us at all. Their chaats which use molecular technology and their other fusion dishes such as dal chawal arancini and tandoori momo are a delightfully fresh take on our familiar favourites. One should stick to the innovative starters and desserts here and not waste their appetite on the main course which is like any other restaurant. Their recent additions which include mango cigars among other delectable desserts are definitely worth a try. Hope to see more additions to the menu the next time we visit. Our server Javed has also been very warm and hospitable. Keep up the great work! :)

Completely misleading. They never mentioned the happy ours timing. Its just mentioned that happy hours is spread all over the week. So accordingly we went with the 1:1 mindset.
Secondly it is over hyped and way too overexpensive. We had Murgh Dilman Tikka it tasted okay but nothing special. The pieces were too small compared to other restaurants. My suggestion would be DO NOT GO. Any Park Street restaurant is way better.

My brother had visited this place a few days back and since I don't live in Kolkata, he was really excited to take me to this 'not so old restaurant' in this really old city. I was excited too, as I have grown to trust his taste of restaurants.

My impression, I wasn't satisfied. 

The restaurant isn't clean. It isn't spacious either. People who ate claustrophobic will have a tough time. Germophobics, stay away. Don't visit the was rooms before your meal. Its filthy. 

Coming to the food. It was decent. Nothing out of the world. The desserts were good though. You shouldn't miss the mud pudding. The tea flavored ice cream was bland. 

This place is not cheap. Not value for money. Not fine dining. Concept isn't bad. Service isn't good either.

Also, they charge you a 5% service fee. And charge you 95 rupees for a bottle of mineral water - MRP Rs 20. I have attached the picture of the bottle and the bill. So. Not. Cool.

I just loved this place! It is a must visit for me whenever I go to Kolkata. The name suggests an ordinary Bollywood themed restaurant but as soon as you roll your eyes through the menu, you know that your dish is definitely going to be exquisite. The most important part is it has Valet Parking! In Kolkata, parking is a task and thank god for restaurants like Gabbar's!
Their mocktails/cocktails are refreshing!
Appetizers I would like to recommend:
@Pao Bhaji Fondue: The buns served are to die for!
@Dahi Seekh Kebab: Of course for the taste - they melt in the mouth. But I can't resist reacting like an overjoyed child when the dish is placed in front of me because they serve the green chutney in a toy pressure cooker (check out the picture)! It makes me go back to my childhood days! :')
@Balam Puchkari/Khaike Chaat Benaras Wala: Well, here you're in for a major surprise! Molecular gastronomy at its best - you eat the puri and the pani is served in the form of a tiny ball that bursts in the mouth! Innovation, I tell you!
Main course: Any and everything on the menu is delicious! And trust me I have been there many times so I sure have tried quite many from the list!
Desserts: The best part! You can't say no to any dish in this section! See the pictures and you will just want to grab your wallet and rush to the place to try it out!
Service: Amicable staff, quick on their toes.
Ambience: Nostalgic - takes you back to the "Sholay" days.
Overall, A must visit. A jewel in the culinary scene of good old Kolkata!

Ambience, staff - Top Notch. 
Food (Barring Indian) - Out of the world. 

Rome Ali Pizza, Dahi Seekh Kebab, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Chilli Potato, Tandoori Aloo are outstanding (simply). The Khow Suey is a major let down (perhaps I am too enthralled bythe one they serve at KAIDI Kitchen.) 

Staff is the best ever, messed up my food (first time) and made up with this (instantly). (They served a cake once again the last time I went there because I complained about the KS.) Have been there 4 times now, each experience has been better than the last one 

Ordered the mud pie, and I must say it's one of the better decisions I have taken in a while.

Kolkata's one of the best restaurants, where you should head to, if you haven't been here.
The restaurant is doing very well and has made quite a significant name amongst the foodies. Visit this place to have (and look at) food with a twist, very unusual preparation, quirkiest combinations and visual treat.

Prior reservations recommended, it can get really crowded.

Location:
Near the American embassy, in a proper location, very easy to find, used to house Amigos.

Ambience:
It's a proper Bollywood themed restaurant with posters frames of yesteryear's famous celebs. Even the dishes name on the menu are movie based. Walls done with paintings and graffitis, dialects from Sholay and one liner jokes are worth watching , Not to forget the funniest do's and dont's( do spot it)!!
Spacious, made up in two sections, can house almost 75 guests, (also they provide valet)
The place does get a bit noisy.
They also have a small waiting area right at the entrance.

Food:
Lemon Iced Tea- was awesomely served in a kettle and was chilled to tastefulness.
Virgin Mojito- my regular order, wasn't good. I asked for some sugar syrup, some lemon juice and tried to fix it. Though they were polite enough to provide it all instantly.
Sangria was regular, nothing top notch.
Cheesy Chilli Olive Naan- my first ever this kind of naan and it tasted great.
Masala Kulcha-was soft and fluffy, greatly done.
Gabbar ki Maa ki daal- was actually Dal Makhani. This is one of my favourite dish and if not good I know it. Lacked the masalas and the aroma, though well smoked.

Desserts are to die forüòç
Hazaron khwahishe aisi- Its the most beautiful dessert one can feast on. A small sapling in a tiny flower pot covered in mud looking just like a plant.
The mud is actually a mixture of crumbled chocolate brownie with crushed Oreo , chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. And I feel like having one right away. The dessert excels in both Presentation + Taste.
Golmaal- it looked like a big chocolate ball, but the fun was when the staff poured hot chocolate sauce all over it and the outer layer of the ball started melting instantly, inside It was filled with chocolate. Combination of dark and light chocolate with chocolate sauce was a sinful pleasure. ( couldn't stop filming it)

Service:
The manager welcomed us with a hearty smile and showed us to the table.
Very quick service, and great dedication. Staff here are well mannered and very very polite, ready to help you with your order. They knew their job pretty well, menu by heart, knowledge of preparation and very cheerful.
Amazing quirky cutlery, hats off to the mastermind behind it!!

Pocket pinch - a little on the higher side but convincing cause of what they serve.

Great place for people who love to click pics while out.
Since I went for a light dinner, am left with craving for more.
Gotta visit soon to taste everything else off the menu ( specially Lambu race ka ghoda)

A second visit to this place, experience made better by- Md. SURAJ (staff)..
Ordered for Dekho magar pyaar se(LIIT), average-a lil more rumüòí
Dahi seekh kebab was ok, Garlic naan, black dal, kofta good enough ...the quality has been maintained.. kudos guys.. ordered for Lambi race ka ghoda, a fine LIIT!!
And then dessert time, hazaaron khwahisein aisi-this deserves some kinda ü•á award..
Molecular Paan with a twist.. try it guys!!
The staff are all really well Trained..helpful, and service is so quick.. this place is fab as always

I was invited for a Zomato meetup on Tuesday 26th of Apr,16 along with 11 other foodies and the venue happened to be Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen. So before I write more about the place and the food I extend my heartfelt thanks to Samridhi, Diksha and their entire team from Zomato. It was also a pleasure to get acquainted with some of the top foodies of Zomato Kolkata. All in all a very pleasant evening spent in good company.

After exchanging pleasantries I could not help but dive in to the Balam Puchkari, the first appetizer of a very elaborate menu for the evening. The dish is Gabbar's take on the Kolkata puchka so the texture and taste was entirely different from the typical street-side snack. They were served with potato filling and test tubes filled with sour tamarind water and the sweet tamarind water dipped in a bowl of dry ice. Certainly grabs eyeballs and one could never have been enough. Meanwhile I had started sipping my first cocktail of the evening, the Curry Apple Foamtini. The green apple flavours, sour and sweet were really refreshing but the curry leaf infusion was lost. Harsh Sonthalia the suave owner of Gabbar's was the first to admit this and has promised me a better drink next time. Again, 6/5 for presentation. Next up was Gabbar'r version of taco trucks. The tacos were replaced by the stuffed mini kulchas and chhole. It tasted well but the presentation was brilliant. The taco trucks came on pink trays which reminds one of the back hatch of a Indian truck with two miniature stainless steel buckets with dips. Perhaps a palate cleanser was in order and the frozen mojito was just the thing for the job. Presented beautifully resembling a amouse bouche, it not only cleansed my palate it was refreshing and tasted exactly like a sip of mojito would. With a cleansed palate I moved on to the Inverted Keema Pao. A non veg vada pao (minced meat filling) but inside out. The meat ball was stuffed with bread and fried in a batter. This one really was one of my favourites. The chicken potli could not have been far behind. The soft and succulent chicken shaped like a bag was grilled to perfection. The tandoori momos however, were a totally different ball game. The normal stuffed dumplings were steamed then marinated and then grilled in a tandoor on skewers. Completely unexpected textures. 
Harsh never left our sides and patiently handled our tantrums, all the while explaining the origin and meaning of each and every dish. He offered me his favourite Kaffir Lime and Lychee Mojito. Initially it was too sweet but they did it up and then the balance of the sour lime and sweet (canned) lychees were perfect. 6/5 again for the presentation. The main courses had arrived. It consisted of three trypes of breads Warqi Parathas, garlic naan, stuffed kulchas and a rice. Gabbar ki Maa ki Daal was really good and so was Harsh's story behind how the slow cooked and slow churned daal is cooked. Makkhan Singh's Butter Chicken was cooked with generous dollops of butter. The Kochi Pnathar Jhol was perhaps found a bit wanting. It was good but nowhere close to what Bengalis know as Kochi Pnathar Jhol. The breads were all soft and delicious, even after they went cold. The king of course was the Warqi Paratha. 
After such a huge meal I had no room for desserts but I had to yield to temptation after looking at them. The Haazron Khwaishein Aisi and the Mango Cigars were not only presented brilliantly they tasted better than they looked. I could not taste the Jalebi Bai but the presentation was amazing. The Golmaal was the only dessert which looked better than it tasted but 6/5 for presentation again. The Molecular Paan was ingenious. The thin sheet was extracted out of potato starch and filled with the usual refreshing paan fillers. 
Quirky Bollywood themed decor with interesting wall art. Comfortable seating. The only aspect they could improve up on is probably their service, with Harsh showing the way I am sure they will get better soon. Highly recommended. I will be returning very soon.

Have you been to Gabbar‚Äôs, the fun Bollywood themed restaurant in Kolkata? If you haven‚Äôt, book a table right now because they are out with an all new menu.¬†From Curry Apple Martini to Rome Ali Pizza to the evergreen Kochi Pathaar Jhol to Mango Cigars, the new menu is an interesting concoction of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I was invited by Gabbar‚Äôs to sample the new dishes last week and it was one delightful gastronomic experience.

This place is supposed to be donors for its gastromilecular food. We ordered the papri chaat and Puchkas. Both were horrible. 

Other than that we ordered usual indian starters and main course and both were amazing . 

Their cocktails are good, and deserts are to die for. 

Overall a good place and reasonable priced

Gabbar's a gastronomical delight. Located near the American embassy on Russell Street, its easy to find. Make sure you check in early if you are going on weekends. It can get really crowded. 
The food is a delight. It has a fairly extensive menu mostly concentrating on Indian, Chinese a bit of Italian and Mexican. Gabbar's USP is the way it presents food. The food presentation makes the food interesting, not that it lacks any flavoring. The food there is delicious. I have 3 dishes to recommend: 1. The stuffed mushroom garlic pepper
2. Murgh malai nazakath
3. The mini kulcha with pindi chole
The mocktails are also pretty decent including the L'Afaire Paris.
The staff was also attentive and courteous. Overall a very positive experience.

There is a new trend in the town, and people call it 'Molecular Gastronomy'. A much needed change, from the usual fair of how we see foods being prepared or served to us, the innovation of this exciting concept frees us from the boredom of our regular food affairs and brings in a much new change. Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen, is one such restaurant which has made quite a name of itself by having ventured into this battle and has done fairly well to earn a lot of praise and reputation. 

Located bang opposite to American Consulate at Russel Street, this place used to house a former Italian food-heaven named as Amigos. For those, who still cannot recollect the place, take the lane beside Kenilworth Hotel, which one usually does to enter into Park Street, stop where the lane ends at the intersection of the four roads. To your right, you shall see a police barricade and a couple of paramilitary guards manning the place. Enter this lane, and the restaurant shall fall to your left. 

Not sure, if one of the most badass villain of Bollywood,; if Gabbar used to be a hardcore drinker or if he had any strong passion for food, but this namesake of its surely does know how to tickle the tastebuds of common people. The entrance leads to a fairly big room which can easily house 50 people at one go, if not more. The person standing at the reception is usually the manager, and upon his absence, may be one of his staffs. Be it whoever they might be, you are immediately escorted to your table and therein begins a gastronomical battle to make your experience memorable. 

The walls here are decorated with quirky posters, resembling the erstwhile 90's. You can even find beautiful paintings and graffiti all around. Popular quotes from Sholay, a legendary films irks your curiosity while you try to blend in this strange, yet pleasant surroundings. If you lack subtlety and they fail to manage to humor you for long, look for the 'Do's and Dont's, and some of the most ridiculous and funny punches being thrown at you. 
A lot of selfie spots for the photogenic people with the one line punchers being stuck onto all sections of the wall.

This was my second visit here. Only this time, it was a special one, a very special and memorable one. Samridhi Singhvi¬†was kind enough to invite me over for this upcoming Zomato meet for foodies in one of the most gossiping places in town, and boy, i could not refuse such a humble offer. So, I was there, with a friend, only to get much delayed and depict a negative impression among everyone else. That evening, I had to celebrate my mother's birthday, and my friend, who is a Connoisseur here at Zomato in the true self, one of the original icons to grace this very platform, had engagements elsewhere. 

But, we were quite determined to make it, and after a lot of hurdles, we finally managed to reach this place ( I should thank myself for making a visit earlier, so as to know where this place exactly was). Upon entering, we were escorted by one of the captains to a room, where Samridhi Singhvi¬†was already present, along with the owner of the restaurant Mr. Harsh and other fellow Zomato co-foodies. The party had long started by then. Many of the jokes had been cracked, formal introductions had taken place and much of the munchies were already being munched :-) After conveying our due apologies, we managed to get a seat for ourselves, and then began an endless saga of devouring ourselves into the vast ocean of 'Molecular Gastronomy'.

Cocktails and Mocktails:- 

1) Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito: Kaffir lime leaves muddled with litchi crush, topped with soda.

This has to be one of my favorites. Hot and scorching summer with the scathing humidity. What else would you prefer other than a chilled glass of litchi crush? To add to the pleasantries, you have soda being topped over the litchi crush, and kaffir lime leaves to go along with it? Thoroughly refreshing, and mostly due to the chilled texture owing to the ice, this gave immense relief as a starting drink. More like a tequila shot, I could only wish, if this was served in a much larger glass! You know, its summer afterall!

Note:- You can also opt for the alcoholic version.

2) Watermelon Basil Mojito: Fresh watermelon puree infused with fresh basil leaves.

If anyone asks me, this has to be the best dish/drink I have had at Gabbar's. Just like Litchi, Lime or Lemon, Watermelon too packs a punch and is often regarded as thirst-quencher. One may often find their parents buying off watermelon from the market and then bringing it home to serve to their children, either as a whole or as a juice. Refreshing and aromatic, Watermelon is one of the healthiest option to relieve yourself from the grooving thirst! Imagine, crushed watermelon puree infused with fresh basil leaves. The fragrance of the basil leaves, combining with the melon, enhancing the punch, the entire drink from start to the end was perhaps the most refreshing and wonderful mocktail I have ever had!

Note:- You can also opt for the alcoholic version.

3) Curry Apple Foamtini: Apple Juice and Curry leaves blended together and topped with foam. 

Someone ordered this, probably the owner, Mr. Harsh. This was served in a beautiful looking glass. Topped with all foam, the overall appearance was pretty appealing. Unfortunately, for me, I was a bit occupied with whatever was already served to me and hence missed tasting this beauty.

4) Lambi Race ka Ghoda: White Rum, Vodka, Gin, Contreau and Tequila missed together and topped with Thums Up!

There was a time when I was an alcoholic beast and I know how it to makes you feel combining all possible types of alcohol together. You have Rum, Vodka, Gin, Tequila and what not, being pushed in all together. What else do you expect? A single shot of this can make you fall down on the ground, and this was rather served inside a 'Bamboo Stick' (If I may call it), and you had to finish it right till the end.

For those, who still cannot catch my humour, do you remember seeing those gigantic, yet narrow but large looking test tubes in your Chemistry Laboratory Class? If you do, please dare and come over to this place and finish off this marvelous preparation till the last drop! If it still doesn't knock you down; well, have another one!

(Thankfully, I do not drink alcohol any more)

Appetizers:-

5) Rome Ali Pizza:- Roomali Roti topped with sauce and cheese. baked and served as a pizza.

Legends say, that Roomali Roti was first invented to clean the hands after having a hearty meal. Well, time has changed, and Roomali Roti now happens to be one of the popular ingredients to go with numerous curry. Gabbar's have advanced a step further, and actually uses Roomali Roti as a base, similar to a bread, tops it with sauce and cheese, and then bakes the entire concoction of foreign elements together to produce something lovely and marvelous, something similar to a dish to which we all are acquainted with.

The pizza (as it is referred to), was crispy and crunch, yet light on the appetite. The sauce and the cheese were delicate, and weren't muddled together. One has to remember, that the base was a thin Roomali Roti, and hence anything in excess will result in a catastrophe. 

6) Chicken Potli Kebab:- Spicy Chicken Keema filled in Chicken Drumstick, baked in Tandoor.

This was again one of the dishes, which impressed me. Although, the Keema wasn't that spicy, the entire flavor came together very well. The Keema went nice and packed wonderfully inside the Chicken Drumstick and presented together a unique flavor altogether. Talk of some Indian or Mughlai delicacy getting fusioned with a Chinese one! 

7) Tandoori Momos (Veg & Chicken): Regular Momos stuffed with a filling, steamed and then baked in a tandoor.

Tandoori Momos has been the talk of the town very recently. Haven't had the opportunity to taste this elsewhere, so this was the first time for me. A familiar shape of a Momo, which we all so adore, just prepared in an unconventional manner. You usually have Kebabs, being baked in a Tandoor, well now you have Momos. The appearance is very similar to that of a Kebab. It has the crunch and flavors of Kebab as well. Yet, its basic property and inheritance lies within the family of Momos. Truly a gastronomical experience! 

8) Balam Puchkari: Crisp semolina puris, filled with spicy potato filling topped with mint chutney spheres.

Well, do not start singing the now! But, I guess, you already did!

Crisp and fried phuchkas, served over a large spoon and an assortment of a couple of them being put together upon a tray! The tray has a green bed of grass laying upon it, perhaps resembling nature or the very simplicity which is usually depicted, considering the fact, that how Phuchkas has become a inseparable part of our life. The phuchkas are already topped with the Pudina Pani. Some separate Pudina Pani and Imli Pine are also served inside a Test Tube (Talk of innovation), and both of these tubes are placed inside a bowl filled with Nitrous Oxide fumes. 

A sheer treat to the eyes, this dish packs both the visual flavor as well as gives pleasure to your tastebuds. You, also would have a small plastic table and chair, although being depicted as a wooden one. Perhaps all trying to hint at the fact of someone sitting in a garden, in the midst of the nature upon a simple wooden table and chair and enjoying the simplicity of phuchkas.

The USP of this dish, is not what is served here to you, but how it is served to you! Think of it in this way, and nothing can stop you from appreciating the person who designed this concept and created such a wonderful presentation!

(Suggestion: Would prefer a slightly thickened version of the accompaniments, rather than the watery one)

9) Inverted Keema Pao / Inverted Vada Pao: Pav buns covered with spicy potato / mutton keema mixture, batter fried.

The term 'inverted' says it all. You do not have the usual likes of a veg or non-veg mixture being stuffed inside the pav. Instead, the pav is covered with the filling (Spicy Potato or Mutton Keema Mixture), and then it is batter fried.

Topped with a pudina chutney, this was again an example of sheer innovation.

10) Highway de Dhaabe di Shaan: Amritsari Kulcha Chole, served Gabbar's style!

I did not have the opportunity to taste this dish in my recent visit, but I did enjoyed it thoroughly in my former one! 

Crunchy, fluffy Tandoori Rotis, folded together, like a scoop, just like we would to carve out a bit of Sabji or gravy. The Kulchas are already loaded with the Chole, making your work easy. The Chole are one of their kind. Spicy, tangy and flavorful, I probably haven't had such combination of flavor elsewhere.

Although, the initial quantity may seem to be scarce and less, let me assure you, 4 little baby pieces are more than sufficient for two as a starter, unless you have just had a terrible fight with your girlfriend and you never got to eat anything since the morning. The Rotis come served over plastic structures, almost shaped like a car or a jeep. Perhaps depicting the popular song, casted by Amitabh Bacchan and Jeetendra, 'Ye Dosti, hum nehi todenge'.

There comes two such plastic structures, consisting of 4 mini kulchas. On the side, you would find three kind of salad, being loaded onto something which would appear as steel buckets. Such buckets, which is possibly used in the rural areas, mainly in the villages by the housewives to fetch water from the well.

The entire setup is colorful, vibrant and gives you a lot to think about!

Main course:- 

11) Gabbar ki Maa ki Daal: Black lentils cooked with spices, Dal Makhani style. 

I did not quite like this dish. Dal Makhani is one of the popular vegetarian staple (If I may say so) and is widely regarded as one of the tastiest dishes to try at). Once you go wrong with such dishes, people will easily spot you.

The dish did not have the flavor or the punch. The spices were missing, and the aroma of the Makhan was not hitting the tongue. The lentils were cooked just fine though, but the lack of the Masala's really made this dish an incomplete one.

12) Paneer Tikka Masala: Cottage Cheese Cubes marinated with spices and charcoal grilled.

Not exactly a Paneer lover though. Hence, opted out from trying this one.

13) Munni ke Badnaam Kofte: Spinach balls deepfried and simmered in cashewnut gravy.

Blame it on two of my immediate neighbors, I was too shy to ask when they were already being served this dish.

14) Kochi Pathar Jhol: Tender mutton pieces pressure cooked in a semi-dry spicy gravy.

A sheer disappointment. You cannot go to Assam and play around with their traditional spicy Chicken dish. Even if you do, you need to make sure the flavor do not outmatch the traditional one. Likewise, you cannot come to Bengal and play with one of the most popular dish here, Kochi Pathar Jhol. Mutton is something, which all non-vegetarian eaters love. We still have our fathers going to the market on a lovely Sunday morning, and getting us Mutton to be cooked by our lovely mother for the lunch or dinner. Although, every person has a different way of tampering the spices and combining the flavor (Including the traditional Bengali restaurants), the basic taste still stays the same and draws inheritance from the same common root.

Although, the mutton was soft, it was seriously lacking the flavor which is so known to us, right from our childhood. The gravy was lacking the tampering of the spices. Am not sure, what the chef wanted to attempt here, but this dish sadly disappointed me.

15) Makhan Singh Butter Chicken: Grilled Chicken Tikka simmered in rich tomato butter gravy.

Grilled, Baked or Fried, I could care less. This was one of the wonderful dishes I have tried on this evening. Succulent and soft kebabs, were charred at the sides, being simmered in a rich, yet succulent and buttery tomato gravy. Perfectly infused with lemon, everything was just so perfect about this dish. The very first scoop of this dish made me remember of the same dish I had tried elsewhere. Usually, it is not fair to draw comparisons, but let me take the privilege of doing it here. 

I remember feasting, one fine evening a couple of years ago at the legendary Mughlai restaurant Karim's near Jama Masjid, New Delhi. A restaurant which has made its name serving authentic Mughlai dishes since ages. And the only restaurant who could dish out a dish similar to the Butter Chicken I have had at Karim's was Gabbar's. I totally congratulate the chef for coming out with such a marvelous recipe and then combining all his ideas into this wonderful dish, one of its kind!

Accompaniments: 

16) Warqi Paratha: Flaky griddle roasted paratha.

If one has ever tried Lucknowi Paratha along with the Tunday/Galaouti Kebabs, he would know what this Paratha is all about. The closest resemblance which Warqi Paratha draws, is with the Parathas which are served with Neharis, say at popular Nehari outlets like Rahim's at Lucknow. 

Crisp and flaky, you really need to try this with the Butter Chicken. It will surely take you back to the nostalgic memories of having the parathas with Nehari and the explosion of flavors which you had enjoyed then!

17) Garlic Naan: Naan overloaded with chopped Garlic, baked in tandoor.

18) Masala Kulcha: Fine grated vegetables stuffed in refined flour dough, baked in tandoor.

Well, you make Kulchas, and then you prepare 'Kulchas'. Soft and melting in your mouth, this one of its kind Roti can alone stands as a complete dish. The filling was spiced well with flavors and did not taste bland. Another perfect companion to go along with Butter Chicken.

19) Steamed Rice: Soft fully boiled Basmati Rice.

(One Small tip: Whenever you warm up rice in an oven, please pour in some water into a microoven bowl, and put this bowl with the rice one, together at the time same inside the oven. The steam from the water would prevent the rice from drying up)

Deserts:-

20) Hazaron Khwahishe Aisi: Crumbled chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce and crushed Oreo biscuits.

I was foolish enough to take this back home for take-away the first time I had come here,, but this time I did not make the same mistake. Presented beautifully, like a small sapling covered in the mud and then made to look as a plant, this desert is a pure delight. As you dig in, you have the crumbled brownie, being mixed up with the sinful chocolate sauce and the melting vanilla ice cream. Imagine the flavors bursting up in my mouth.

This dish was equally about the presentation as it was about the delight in taste out of it.

21) Jalebi Bai: Jalebi caviar's soaked in saffron sugar syrup, topped with chopped pistachio, served with Rabdi Foam.

The presentation here was so beautiful. Unfortunately, there was an issue with the dish, hence it was replaced with another marvelous one. May be next time.

22) Molecular Paan: Edible potato starch sheets topped with Paan Masala and chopped Betel leaves.

Have an aversion for paan. Hence, did not try this one. :-)

23) Golmaal: The highlight of the night, which was brought as in lieu of replacement for Jalebi Bai.

It was a round ball, filled in with chocolate. The outer layer of the ball was supposed to crack through, as hot chocolate sauce was poured over it. The ball would then mean to crack further and eventually sediment down giving you a visual pleasure, something which you may never have seen before.

The outer layer was actually thick dark chocolate with the inner filling being a lighter version of the chocolate. So, you can imagine the ecstasy, I have had while combining the light chocolate with the dark chocolate bits, combined with the sinful chocolate sauce.

24) Mango Cigars: Crisp filo pastry stuffed with mango and mascarpone cheese.

Last, but not the least, a treat to the tastebuds. The texture of these cigars, is very similar to the cream rolls. Crunchy, yet filled with the soft and succulent cream when you dig inside. The pastry here was stuffed with mango and had a crisp texture on its outside with the tangy and sweet mango filling on its inside.

Its amazing how the mascarpone cheese combined with the mango. The cigars gave it a masculine and interesting look at the same time. The servings on the side were some diced mangoes and a spoon consisting of mango syrup, which was almost having the appearance of foam.

If you have a sweet tooth, this is one desert, you must try.

The staff members here are one of the finest. Caring, dedicated and sincere, they know the menu by heart. While, in most places you would see, not-so-knowledgeable staffs leading to utter confusion to decide which one to go for, this is one place where everyone is at their edge to help you out. The staff were attentive, and the captains were more than eager to replace the soiled plates and the utensils. The Manager did recognize me, as I have had a visit earlier and had a brief conversation with him back then trying to contribute with some of my observations.

To end, Gabbar's is not really about perfect flavors. The restaurant here is all about experimenting with food. It is about giving an entertaining and visual look, something which you may have never seen before. The flavors may taste a bit bland here and there, but that is because we have so many dishes already being tried since we were infants. It is hard to try with something we already know. Results, can either be positive or negative. But then, it would also depend on our individual taste buds. How we accept the looks and outcome of the dish.

Don't come here if have hesitations about trying the same chicken or mutton dish which you can perhaps have elsewhere as well. But, if you happen to be served in a different fashion to have your visual senses appeals to you, if you want the regular fairs to be cooked in a different way and taste different, please drop all your work and drop in here. If you want to feel an explosion in your mouth, if you want to feel a different flavor than what you are usually used to, if you want to have a completely new experience than what you would have had expected, please make Gabbar‚Äôs your next destination. You may like or may not like whatever you may have here. But rest assured, this would be like an experience which you haven't had elsewhere before.

Note: The blogger was invited to this restaurant as a part of the Zomato Kolkata meetup. 

Sincere thanks to Samridhi Singhvi¬†¬†for giving me the opportunity and many thanks to Mr. Harsh for his gracious hospitality and for ensuring our experience was a memorable one. He contributed us with his vast knowledge and made sure that the food and drinks were always filling up our tummy!

Wishing Gabbar's all the best in the coming years!

I am so happy that I visited this place before I left Kolkata. Everything about it is perfect. The ambiance, along the lines of hindi movies, is cozy and fun, the service is courteous and prompt and the food is beyond awesome. This was my first experience of gastronomy and couldn't have asked for anything more. You should definitely try the pani puri chicken potli and the pav bhaji fondue. And in the desserts, you must have the mango 4 ways special, the chocolate and oreo soil,and the chat biskit. Never thought that masala chai ice cream could taste so brilliant. A very cute thing about the place is the cutlery and the dishes used to serve. Right from the buckets and cooker with the chutney, to the truck with the chhole kulche, everything is quirky and cute. It is a MUST visit in Kolkata.

Well long post alert!! :)

I was invited for the #zomatomeetup and Gabbar's was the host. Firstly thank u zomato for the invite and of course for the opportunity to meet up some amazing foodies.¬†It was a wonderful experience.. :)

Gabbar's is located opposite to the American embassy. so very easy to locate.
As I stepped in, the manager greeted me with a smile and escorted me inside where the other foodies were already enjoying their delicious meals n chitchatting. The decor totally gives you the bollywood vibe..walls are decorated with the posters of old classics of Mr.Bachchan...very spacious..perfect for friendly hangouts.

Now coming to the food section..

We had 5 types of cocktails /Mocktails to choose from..

So tried curry apple foatini and watermelon basil mojito ..both were refreshing..but the seeds in the later one sadly made it quite unpleasant !

Now the appetizers..

1. Highway de dhabe Di shaan- Amritsari kulchas with chole served in tacos style.. It was spicy and tasty..

2.Rome Ali pizza- super thin crust pizza..(just like a roomali roti)..really light and crunchy. If you are a thin crust lover..go for this one!!!

3.Tandoori Momos- it's chicken tandoori momo...nothing can go wrong!! Just yum!

4.Chicken Potli kebab- had just one piece but it was ...bang on!! Delicious!!

5.Balam Puchkari- it's pani puri..served beautifully..Well here the puchkas are made of sooji..

6.Inverted Keema Pao- Basically a vada stuffed with mutton keema..tasted good..so no complain there.

Main course

1. Gabbar ki maa ki daal- it's kali dal..tasted good with the parathas

2. Paneer tikka masala-just one word..Yum!

3. Munni ke badnaam kofte- didn't like it..found it bland..

4.makhan singh butter chicken- This butter chicken dish is a must try!!! Soft, buttery and yummy!

5.Kochi pathar jhol- it's mutton curry..this dish lived upto it's name..mutton was soft and tender.
**Parathas and naans**

Warqi paratha¬† ¬†
Garlic naan¬† ¬†
Masala kulcha

Tried them all..masala kulcha and warqi paratha went well with all the side dishes.

Now the show stopper!! Desserts time!!

1.Hazaro khawahishe aisi- served in a flower pot...crumbled cookies and brownies, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Everything was well balanced..not too sweet at all.

2.Mango cigars- cigar shaped dessert..light and crisp. A must try!

3.Molecular Paan- I loved it!! The paan leaf was replaced by thin potato starch sheets..as soon as u put in ur mouth..it melts!! Such an innovative idea...right???

4.Jalebi bai- Was full by then so missed tasting it.

Ok there was a surprise dessert..named "Golmaal"..A round chocolate ball stuffed with chocolate ice cream.As we poured hot chocolate on the ball it started melting..
 how cool is that?? :)
An extra star for the presentation and the theatrical work with the desserts! :)

Their service needs a special mention....very quick and friendly!!

Overall this is a pretty good place for dining...so thumps up from my side.

This was one of my most anticipated restaurant visits ever, thanks to Zomato (Samridhi ) and the entire Gabbar's team for the invite and the fellow foodies at #ZomatoMeetup who made it all the more enjoyable !

This Place is situated right next to the American Consulate, and has a huge area with Valet Parking. Decor is top-notch, the theme "Sholay" , portrayed beautifully. You'll find a wall dedicated to Amitabh Bacchan right on entrance. Quirky dialogues from the movie adorn the walls. 

Upon entering, I was greeted by the restaurant manager with a warm welcome. Some of the Foodies were already there. After a bit of formalities and catching up, we were all handed the menu for the day, specially for the meetup, which had four sections. 

**Cocktails and Mocktails**

Being an alcohol lover, I ordered and tasted only the alcohol variant of the particular drinks:

*Lambi Race Ka Ghoda*: This cocktail came in a 500ml Borosil Tube, and Consisted of the five main 'knockout' alcohols- Whiskey, Vodka, Rum, Tequila and Gin , mixed with a bit of ThumsUp. This tasted like a dozed version of The Long Island Iced Tea and is enough , rather more than enough to make you  think twice about driving back home !

*Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito* : This for me, was the highlight of the drinks section. Imagine a beautifully crushed litchi drink, add some good punch of Kaffir Lime leaves and some White rum/vodka. It tasted way better than my description and I'll be coming back here for this a lotta times.

*Curry Apple Foamtini* : This contained Apple Juice and curry leaves blended together with foam. Now a specialty of this foam is that it lasts for a long time in the glass, doesn't go away with one-two sips. (Alcohol version optional).

I felt the curry leaf-taste had overpowered the drink and a bit more of the apple flavor would have been nice.

*Watermelon Basil Mojito* : Truly a summer drink, light and fresh; it had watermelon pulp crushed with basil leaves. I felt the seeds should have been taken out but the flavor is great !

**Appetizers**

*Highway De Dhabe Di Shaan*- a cute Desi rendition of the American style taco, as the amritsari kulchas with chole were served in Taco trucks. Tasted good, kulchas were soft, and the Cholle Tasty :)

*Rome Ali Pizza* ( Read Roomali Pizza)- Yes now it's easy to guess, the crust being a super thin Roomali Roti, hardened and topped with cheese, then baked as a Pizza. Delightfully crunchy . It's a lovely dish for thin crust lovers.

*Tandoori Momos* : I had the chicken Tandoori momo. I could have never guessed how good momos taste, when they are baked in a tandoor! #Gabbar Khush Hua #

*Chicken Potli Kebab* : These looked like Chicken Drumsticks, which were stuffed with Spicy Chicken Keema. End result- you get the taste of the grilled meat and the Spicy fill inside. A great dish it was !

*Balam Puchkari* : Yes basically it's a phuchka dish but a lot more innovative. The phuckas are made of 'Sooji', so that they don't get soggy when the chutney is poured. Wonderful presentation. Chutneys came in test tubes. There were small 'mint chutney' spheres on top of each Phuchka. A very fancy creation indeed. But having grown up in Kolkata, my taste buds still loyally accustomed to local phuchkas with a lotta tamarind and Jhaal! 

*Inverted Keema Pao* : These were pav buns covered with Mutton keema and batter fried. Yumm !

In Palate Cleanser we had the *Mojito Sphere* < A molecular gastronomy special> : Pop one in your mouth and you'll taste a burst of flavors !

#Picture Abhi Baaki hai mere dost !

**Main Course**

*Parathas and Nans* - We tried all three of the Warqi Paratha, Garlic Naan and the Masala Kulcha. The Warqi Paratha is a roasted paratha, and it goes very well with the other side dishes. Garlic Nan and Masala Kulchas were okay.

*Makhan Singh Butter Chicken* : Easy to understand, good old butter chicken, just like as it should be done. Soft, tender and melts in your mouth.

*Kochi Pathar Jhol* : Mutton cooked to perfection , semi spicy and went well with the Steamed Basmati Rice.

*Gabbar Ki Maa Ki Daal* : A better version of the Dal Makhani. Has a little burnt flavor which I liked.

*Paneer Tikka Masala* : A really tasty paneer dish, charcoal grilled and put in a curry. It tastes more like Achari Paneer though.

*Munni ke Badnaam kofte* : I missed out on this dish as I was too full at that moment.

Now my favorite part ::** Desserts **

*Hazaaron Khwahishe Aisi*: A really swanky name for an equally great dessert. Crumbled Oreo cookies and brownies, vanilla ice cream and Chocolate sauce. It wasn't too sweet, had brownies and ice cream in proper proportions. Add to all this, it came in a Pot, with a basil branch on top.

*Mango Cigars* : One of the best summer desserts I have had in a long time. The great texture of the mascarpone cheese complemented the Mango flavor brilliantly. The cigar-shaped pastry was fresh and Crisp. It was served with mango foam(it's a bit of an illusion really) and diced ripe mangoes. 

*A Chocolate Ball which crumbled when hot chocolate was poured on it * : This looked straight out of a TLC epsiode. I even filmed it. The dark-chocolate shell had chocolate ice-cream inside it. Nothing can go wrong with a lot of chocolate !

*Molecular Paan* : I would rather name it 'Transparent Paan'. The paan leaves being replaced with transparent potato starch sheets with Pan Masala and chopped betel leaves inside! Lovely!!

* Jalebi Bai * : I regret missing out on this one. These were Jalebi Caviars soaked in saffron sugar syrup and served with rabdi foam. 

In overall, this is a place I would like to go back to again, and taste some of their other offerings on the menu while indulging in the Litchi and Kaffir lime Mojito !

=Date of Visit=
26th April, 2016.

=Intro=
So this was actually an invitation to my first Zomato meet-up, thanks to Samridhi Singhvi and the entire Zomato team. Special thanks to the owner Harsh Sonthalia for patiently sitting through the entire event and explaining the tremendous amount of research and effort that goes into preparing molecular gastronomic food!

Note: There was an entire elaborate menu curated for the event but I'll be mentioning about the items I personally tasted.

=Beverages=
1) Mojito Sphere: This is basically a palate cleanser in the form of a burst-in-your-mouth bubble placed on a spoon. Just fancy.

2) Lambi Race Ka Ghoda: So this cocktail is served in a really long cylindrical flask, reminded me of the ones I use in my lab. It's a concoction of 5 spirits - white rum, gin, vodka, cointreau and tequila topped with your choice of flavour such as cola, cranberry, red bull. If you're feeling adventurous, order this one or else skip it, as 1. Gabbar's has better drinks to offer, 2. It is overwhelming, 3. Kind of cumbersome to drink it and 4. Tastes kinda bland after you've made halfway through the drink.

3) Litchi and Kaffir Lime Mojito: Okay, so this is hands-down the best cocktail I've tried. Yes, I don't have much experience to back my claim, but the kaffir lime made all the difference to this perfectly blended cocktail. #musttry.

=Appetizers=
1) Rome Ali Pizza: This is a Roomali Roti topped with cheese and sauce and baked and served as a Pizza. Extremely thin and crisp, but goes well with the drinks. (I really like how Gabbar's has played with the names of the dishes)

2) Chicken Potli Kebab: I found this slightly dry to my liking.

3) Tandoori Chicken Momo: Nothing special here; could be avoided.

4) Balam Puchkari: So this is another one of their molecular gastronomic dishes. These are the dishes which define this place so I would suggest to be inclined towards these only. Served in special spoons and can be gulped at one go; the mint chutney spheres really add a nice tough, in terms of both flavour and appearance. Also provided are mint chutney and tamarind in test tubes. Since it already has mint, I would suggest adding a bit of tamarind.

=Main Course=
1) Gabbar Ki Maa Ki Daal: This was a huge disappointment. Heard a lot about it and even Harsh confirmed that it is one of their top-selling items; somehow I didn't quite like it. Had better elsewhere.

2) Makhan Singh Butter Chicken: This, on the other hand, was a delight. The rich tomato butter gravy went well with the Warqi Paratha (better than the Garlic Naan)

3) Kochi Pathaar Jhol: I had this along with the Steamed Rice. The mutton pieces were tender indeed but the gravy was quite bland as not at all spicy as depicted.

=Desserts=
1) Hazaron Khwahishe Aisi: Brownie? Check. Vanilla Ice Cream? Check. Chocolate sauce? Check. Bonus? Crushed Oreo biscuits. I guess a lot has been said about this item already but still it falls short. The idea itself is brilliant; who knew soil could be edible? From the presentation to the taste, this item did not disappoint.

2) Mango Cigars: These are filo pastries stuffed with mango and mascarpone cheese. Apart from this, there were also tiny mango cubes and a spoon with a mango sphere. If you're into mango, you will love this dish. (Bonus: It also contains chocolate cigarettes)

3) Molecular Paan: So this is a normal paan but the paan leaves are replaced with transparent starch sheets. Yes, those are edible. Apart from the unique concept, nothing special in terms of flavour.

4) Golmaal: This is a chocolate sphere filled with chocolate mousse and served with hot chocolate sauce which when poured over the sphere, will break open to reveal the mousse. Completely for chocolate lovers.

=Staff=
Harsh knew in-depth about all the items, as was expected of him. But it was nice to see that the staff knew equally well and showed light humour too. They were definitely competent enough to manage such a huge crowd (approx 15 people). However, we had to wait quite a while for the main course.

=Decor=
I didn't get to check out the main dining area as were directly escorted to the private dining area, but overall, everything was very tastefully done. Gabbar's has to follow a theme but I'm glad they didn't overdo it. Also, everything was very clean and the lighting was perfect too.

=Overall verdict=
To sum it up, I would say Gabbar's justifies every Zomato Collection it is placed under. Since this was a planned event, I would be visiting again with a friend to check if my experience remains the same. If you choose your items wisely, you are bound to have a good meal too on top of the Instagram-worthy pictures. This is an upcoming field and I would love to see Gabbar's introduce more molecular gastronomic dishes as they definitely excel in that.

-Bon App√®tit. :)

Well, I have been here on 26th for the Zomato Meetup, and here I am going to share my amazing experience.
Well, starting with the location, its very easy to locate. Its located just opposite of the American Embassy. Sufficient spaces for parking, so no problem of finding a place.¬†
As you enter, the entire decor gives you a feel similar to its name. Welcome to the amazing bollywood land. The walls are very nicely done by famous dialogues of yesteryear movies and movie posters. Lods of selfie spots, and the added feature is their amazing collection of selfie tags. ¬†Enough sitting arrangements to accommodate large families.¬†
So starting with the food, We had 5 types of Mocktails. I guess those are their very best in the house.
1. Litchi and Kafir Lime Mojito- Served in a small glass. Good taste. Good for time pass options.¬†
2. Watermelon Basil Mojito- My personal favorite. Made with real, fresh watermelons. Good for healthy beverage options.
3. Curry Apple Foatini- This has got a really innovative serving style. Tastes very good. Better if you take this alcoholic option.
4. Lambi Race ka Ghoda- Served in a large glass. God bless you if you can finish it alone. Alcoholic option made a little stronger. ¬†
Now coming to the most special¬†Appetisers in the house.
1. Rome Ali Pizza- So this is a very special dish. Its the thinnest crust pizza you will ever see. Ofcourse its because its made on a Romali Roti. Tastes very good.¬†
2. Chicken Potli Kebab- This is a stuffing of chicken keema with a coating of chicken marinated in Tandoori Kebab style.
3. Tandoori Momos (Veg & Chicken)- Well, this is a simple momo marinated in tandoori masala. Tastes good. Try the chicken one.
4. Balam Puchkari- This is a must try. This is a very rare kind of phuchka made with Semolina, and its side chatnies comes with two flavours. Tastes amazing. A must try.¬†
5. Inverted Keema Pav, Inverted Vada Pav- Well, this is simply a vada (Mumbai's famous Vada Pav), which tastes good and goes well with drinks.¬†
Coming to the Main Course.
1. Gabbar Ki Maa Ki Daal- Well, this is Kali Dal. Tastes good with parathas.
2. Paneer Tikka Masala- May be the best in veg course in the house. A must try.
3. Munni Ke Badnaam Kofte- Nice accompany for Garlic Naan.
4. Makhan Singh Butter Chicken- Its made authentic to the legacy of Butter Chicken. Tastes Amazing.
5. Kochi Pathar Jhol- Well, it Mutton Curry. Its gravy is very thin. So its better to have it with Rice stuffs.¬†
Breads-¬†
Warqi Paratha
Garlic Naan
Masala Kulcha
Well, the best among the lot is Warqi Paratha.
Well now coming to the best part, Desserts.¬†
Disclaimer: All desserts are must try here. In Gabbars, desserts are itself one of a kind. When coming to desserts, they can surely give any bakery a run for its money.¬†
1. Hazaro Khawahishe Aisi- Well this comes in a pot. Surely very innovative way of serving.¬†
2. Mango Cigars- Well this has the most unique style. Its tastes amazing and actually looks like ciggars. A must try in desserts.
3. Jalebi Bai- This tastes good, but you will find better options.
4. Molecular Paan- As soon as it arrives, you surely gonna ask the guy, 'How am I suppose to have this?' Yes, because, it comes in a transparent paper which is surely edible. This is surely is a nice invention.¬†
Well, there was a surprise dessert at last for all of us. I think, this is a must must try, and is surely the Best. Its called "Golmaal". It looks like a large chocolate ball and comes with a chocolate sauce. You need to pour the chocolate sauce over it, and wait. Now the ball gonna melt, and theres a surprise ice cream inside. This is amazing, and the best.
Well, apart from the food part, the place is very appealing. The boys here are very kind and quick responsive. Very hygienic environment. The most likable part is cleanliness.¬†
You gonna surely love their out of the box presentation of all foods and their very own innovative Molecular Gastronomic inventions. An overall thumbsup from my side.

I was I invited to this restaurant on 26th April Tuesday for the first #zomatomeetup. It was mind blowing experience. Well to begin with gabbars bar & kitchen very easy to find. Just 5 mint from the metro st of maidan near metro plaza . The ambience of gabbar's was worm and welcoming. I was guided into restaurant (exact meetup place of zomato) by a staff of the restaurant. Its seems like i came to the set of "sholey movie " it self. Wer i cn meet live to that " gabbar singh " üòà
The interiors were beautifully done. I love the concept of that restaurant that they tried to convey old school cool dude main villain gabbar theme . The moment i walk in i was greeted by

The best chosen place for the Zomato meet up! Bunch of 12 foodies met up, chatted and savored the best possible food items possible! The seletec menu had their signature dishes. The litchi and kaffir lime juice, the watermelon and basil drink (alcohol could be added) were really refreshing!¬†
The tandoori momo, the balam puchkari needs special mention!
Butter chicken and pathar mangshor jhol followed....and the final touch was the awesome!
This was my second time and I was mighty impressed, again! Thanks Zomato team and Harsh, for sitting with us and giving us a vivid description of the dream items!

This was my second visit to the restaurant and i saw a marked improvement since my first visit. The gastronomy food experience as well as the quirky food presentation for each dish left me asking for more. We mainly ordered an array of starters and desserts from the new as well as old menu. Special mention goes to balam puchkari, tandoori momos, paneer tikka, hazaaron khwaishein aisi(its a brownie served in a flowerpot), and mango cigars. There is room for improvement for the mocktails though. Overall the experience left us extremely satisfied.

Now here's the stuff, the name grabs attention. It makes you wanna go there, 'Gabbar's', so we suit up and go down there, the decor and the creativity is just top notch, the Bollywood themed ambiance radiates the moment you set foot there. The place is has this old world charm to it with a slight mix and twist of moder day canvas. 
We ordered our drinks and our food, which was quick, the menu is quite frankly superb. The name of the foods is quite remarkable. 
Now this is where the restaurant lacks behind , the actual food, like I said.  Everything is great, the decor, the presentation. But the main stuff for which we went down there. It is not in the same level as the rest of the stuffs, also considering the price, the food is not that good. Go to this place if you are bored with the usual restaurant type feel. But don't keep your hopes hugh when it comes to the food. 
Hoping they would up their level of food. Because I really liked the place. 

Kudos, 
Eat with your full potential.

Had a short time visit indulging in a kind of light dinner at Gabbar's last week. The place is nice for family dining and friendly hangouts , but not for special dates, themed in bollywood style with a formal seatings and hindi music, bright lighting but nothing to go crazy about the ambience.

Tried two mocktails - CLASSIC LIME VIRGIN MOJITO  was refreshing and L'AFFAIRE PARIS , a cranberry based drink which i liked , MUTTON GALOUTI as starter and MEXICAN GRILLED PEPPER STEAK which was a special item that day and the much instagramed dessert HAZARON KHWAISHEY AAISI . The food was presented brilliantly but unfortuanately was not something to write about. Pricey .. big yes!! Good for one go :)

Amazing theme. Check. Good ambience. Check. Unique serving. Check. This restaurant has everything to be the best. The theme, the ambiance, the service. The way they serve food is the most amazing part. The sole thing for which I didn't like  this place was its food. The food was so expensive and not good at all. I was amazed when I entered. I was disappointed when I left.

Saw a few post about Gabbar's dessert and the unique way of serving food.

So the day I landed in Kolkata, the first thing I made a reservation and to my surprise it was even better than the pictures I had seen.

I just loved the Sangria and Desserts over there. Also the Decor was amazing.

Must visit place if you heading to Kolkata.

Curious about the molecular gastronomy food we get here, we headed to gabbar's with great expectations and it was worth it all. A little pricey but great experience for the delicacies they served. Had pani puri served in molecular manner, fondue pav bhaji, amristari chole served in a unique style. The presentation was spectacular and the taste won hearts. It was a great experience for the taste buds. Absolutely great food. The table guide Deepak was helpful and service was great. Peas pulao was light and aromatic. We had mudpie and parle g with Chai ice cream. Superb. Fantastic. Kudos.

Cheers.

If you're fond of Bollywood setup & want to go to a place that's lively then Gabbar's Kitchen is the place. I went with my family on Holi and the place was full with many people queued up waiting for there chance to come. It was a good experience though these were the pros & cons noted as a customer.
PROS
- Amazing ambience. Interiors were absolutely apt to the Bollywood theme. So if you want that bollywood kind a feel a must go place.
- The place was lively. Well lit up, high on energy, good bolly music were the key for a good ambience.
- Not to forget superbly amazing presentation. The way food was served was really really creative all suited to the Bollywood theme that too retro bolly theme. It's a delight to have food served & presented in this way.
- Service absolutely upto the mark. Cordial & quick service.

CONS
- The basic purpose food that we check in to a restaurant is good food. As per the food is concerned I won't say it was bad but it was ok. Not good not bad but putting up with the name it can be better.
- space crunch is an issue. The space arrangement is improper in inadequate. to reach to the main door we had to wait for the person standing mid way to move.
- Not reasonably priced.

So all in all Gabbar's is place you can try atleast fr the first timers you should go for its theme & set-up and the food is also can try types so there is a no loss situation.

And the service was equally good thanks to our attendant Mr. Deepak.
Would love to be back.

Located on Ho chi Minh, formerly Amigos. Its a nice place with quirky Bollywood tarka. 
The menu was as hatke as the theme. Been here twice and loved it both times. 
Considering both visits i have tasted 
~Litchi and Kaffir lime Mojito- Gabbar recommends and so would I 
~Highway de dhabe di Shaan- Amritsari kulcha with punjabi. It was somewhat ok nothing extraordinary, since its mentioned in the specials.
~Balam Puchkari- Looks better than it tastes. It is Delhi style pani puri with molecular chutney spheres and water injections. The taste was rather underwhelming for a Puchka lover like myself.Nothing special about these specials. 
~Khowsuey Mela- Now we are talking. What arrived on the table was a miny Ferris wheel with tiny buckets of accompaniments. Its a DIY dish that may require some assistance if you are a first timer. The end product was quite delicious. 
~Bachchan Saab‚Äôs Kebab Platter-aloo, paneer, broccoli , kebabs and Chinese corn cakes which were really nice, the latter was slightly spicy though but goes well with the sauce.
~Rome Ali Pizza- thin crust Italian pizza style toppings on a rumali roti. Bite sized goodness. 
~Hazaaron khwaishein aisi-Lil pot of gold gives a sugar high. It comes as a potted plant with chocolate mudpie and oreo as base topped with vanilla icecream and a twig of mint. Tasty but too sweet. 
~ Yeh dil maange More- Mint mousse with chocolate truffle. Good but not great! 
~Molecular Pan- Now thats a happy ending! Its a melt in your mouth take pan. moreover just a palette cleanser but must have! Its unique and the perfect finish to the meal. 
 Deepak was our server and described the dishes well. The portions are small so a large group would only get a taster if at all.
 It was no surprise that the bill arrived in a box labelled #damages on top of a khatiya since bill dekh ke khatiya khadi ho gayi.. Atleast they are forthright about it. On a serious note, please do give it a visit, it won‚Äôt disappoint and a lil indulgence doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone .

PERSONAL FAVOURITE!‚ù§‚ù§

I went for a family dinner to this beautiful bollywood themed restaurant. The place was full and the music was upbeat. The service was fast and Mr. Akbar Ali was extremely co-operative.The way they serve, definitely beauty on a plate! üòç

Virgin Mojito (classic lime) : It was not that great but worth a try.

L'affaire Paris : It was sweet and sour, both at the same time. The refreshing taste of cranberry was exceptional.üëå

Manchow Soup and Sweet Corn Soup both were excellent.

Crispy Chilli Babycorn: It was crispy, spicy and delicious.

Corn Cake: Not as expected.

The drinks are very innovative.. The way they serve their whisky in PAHUA ishhtylee is quite hatke... a good place for refreshment...

The word‚Äôs out that Gabbar‚Äôs is the new happening place in town, and of course I was not going to miss it! I checked out the restaurant on the day of my friend‚Äôs placement, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. As you might be aware, Gabbar‚Äôs is a Bollywood themed eatery and is popularly known for the latest trend of serving molecular gastronomic food in its own presentation style. Even on a Monday, this place was extremely crowded and we had to wait for around twenty minutes (at least) to get a table. Hence, I would strongly recommend reserving your table in advance. Now, let‚Äôs talk about the food, shall we?

We decided to skip the specials/appetizers (all of which seemed to be vegetarian) and ordered starters instead:

Nachos Fiesta (Mexican) ‚Äì the nachos here contained olives, jalepenos and mozzarella, with three types of dips to choose from. They were paper-thin and a little dry for my taste (I am a fan of the nachos at Chili‚Äôs), but if you like it less cheesy, then go for it. 

Lat me Kai (Chinese) ‚Äì chilli chicken with onion and capsicum that tasted as good as it looked.

Chicken kebab and corn kebab ‚Äì out of the two, I would suggest corn kebab ‚Äì it was flavoursome without being oily. 

As for the drinks, we ordered the following:

Strawberry margarita (INR 425) ‚Äì this was an absolute delight! The lime margarita was served with a strawberry iced lolly and was nicely presented in a decent sized container. 

Chintoo ‚Äì this LIIT with white spirits, sour mixes and cola was strong as LIITs should be!

Caprioska ‚Äì a vodka based classic, Caprioska was served in a tall glass with lime and sugar and a generous quantity of vodka. 

Orange Mojito ‚Äì the rum based mojito was served with lime and mint in a jar (similar in style to #Social). 

Cosmopolitan ‚Äì perhaps the prettiest looking drink out of all, this classic cocktail contained adequate amount of vodka in cranberry juice.

The restaurant played peppy Bollywood songs and had a little resemblance to the famous Social chain, what with glasses marked as ‚Äòpaani‚Äô. The drinks are highly recommended here and if you like cocktails, you would enjoy the well-made alcoholic beverages. One word for our server, Deepak - he was courteous, considerate and made sure our food arrived soon. 

Last but the most important, for dessert we had Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi, which was basically a three layered mix of chocolate mudpie, vanilla ice cream and grounded oreos served in a container that looked like a potted plant. Like I said, this place rules in the presentation department. #TotallyRecommended #InstagramWorthy

The restaurant is good with a good ambiance pretty much borrowed from it's old one "Amigos"...has a different style of food and serving dishes.

BE AWARE -¬†

1. They charge service change 10 % (Mandatory Tip) means if your bill is 2000 you have pay 200 as TIP
2. ¬†There are 27 % liquor tax additional on the rate displayed on drinks menu... Which you find in your bill as shock ...same as in Irish Pub¬†

If you get rid of above two the over all rating could be 3.5 out of 5

I have been to this place ...Gabbar's bar and kitchen twice. Today was the second time and the food as usual was as good as it was first time. It was really  nice to feel mumbaikars in kolkata with the vada pav. Also the kulcha was equally good with the extra buttery chicken for any body from chandigarh. I must admit this is one of the place to have food in kolkata and specially the decor and the service. I need to mention about two of my service providers  ARGHYA and IQBAL who made the evening mush delightful.

So we went there on a sunday evening with high expectations. Based on zomato reviews. Starting with the pros. Cool ambience. Friendly attentive staff. We were greeted with some kind of molecular mojito while we were waiting and again before dessert  which was a plus. Our drinks. The long island iced tea. And the beer were perfect. The desserts. The chocolate mudpie and the nolen gur cigars were again not only delicious but served uniquely
The cons. The place is one of the many molecular restaurants. The molecular puchkas for 300 rs was an absolute waste of money. As the puchkas were exactly like the roadside ones you get. With the only molecular thing on the plate being the foamy pitcher the chutneys were served in. The mexican styled chicken with rice. Was again while tasty. Very average. 
All in all would probably go there again but don't go there for their molecular hype. Not worth it. Also feel like its a bit expensive.

It was my birthday treat and there was no better place than this to give it. The best place and the 2nd joint in calcutta for molecular gastronomy after #spice kraft. Each and every item on the menu card is unique with a very unique presentation. The moment each dish is served it will automatically make u happy . And the feeling will enhance after you taste it.The interest for trying each and every dish made us order so many dishes and still if it would have been possible we would have ordered more. Another mention is their decor which is pure Bollywood essence with posters all over.  Now coming to  the food . We ordered #Balam Pichkari which was fuchka in molecular gastronomy way and #Highway do dhaba Di shaan which was makki roti and chole with a twist. For main course we had # Burritos which was a Mexican dosh with chutney and #warqi paratha and #murgh lababdar .The paratha had a fresh taste with a slight tinch of sweetness and it was perfect with murgh lababdar. The best thing came now in the form of # Hazaron khawaishe aisi.  They served me a pot of mud with a sapling and it was filled with brownie ,ice cream and oreo on the top of it. Loved this place to the core and will surely visit this for trying their other unique dishes.

1. We had booked a table for 10 pax for 9.30 Pm on Sunday the 13 th March 2016. on arrival we were seated on a table for 8 pax only.
2. The starters served were not edible as they were cold and not well presented. on requesting to serve hot the staff took the starters and heated them and brought them back in the same plates. They did not have the courtesy to serve freshly prepared dishes and also change the plates.¬†
3. The soft drinks served were at room temperature and we had to remind atleast 4 different staff to bring some ice but the ice never came.
4. Music was loud and so was the crowd. On requesting to reduce the volume it went on deaf years.
All of us got so disturbed that we left the place and went out to Fire and Ice to have dinner.

It was an evening after office hanging with friends, so we preferred to order Rum, Crispy Chilli Potatoes, Lamb Galauti Kebab and Pan Fried Chilli Fish. 
5 strong stars - for the serving process and the food quality ! The kebab was the star of the show.. 
All in all, a solid first go-round. Excited to eat more and update you on my next visit!

My fave restaurant in kolkata. The service is very good(served by deepak). Molecular gastronomy is the new sensation in the house. We ordered for balam puchkari that was good with molecular gastronomy. The Indian main course was better than a five star luxury dining restaurants. Maa ki daal and palak kofte was very tasty. Special mention warqi paratha that was a bit sweet but excellent and crispy. WELL DONE

Good molecular gastronomical concepts. Loved the burritos.
Virgin mojito mirchi maar ke is worth a shot. 
All in all amazing place to hang out.

So hailing from Mumbai, a Calcuttan at heart, I was really looking forward to experiencing Calcutta's version of molecular gastronomy. I had my first experience of molecular gastronomy at Masala Library in Mumbai, so my review is highly based on comparison with it.

The menu is quite regular except for some starters which have the molecular element to it. We ordered for papdi chaat, balam puchkari, pao bhaji fondue, highway de dhabe di shaan, crispy chilly potato and kumbh tandoori. Yes, that's a lot of starters to be shared in 7 people. Papdi chaat was nice with chutney in foam form and dahi in crystallised form, highway de dhaba was amritsari kulcha and chola which was surprisingly a little sweet, kumbh tandoori was good, the bhaji from the fondue was typical Mumbai ishtyle with lots of garlic. However the balam puchkari which is a puchka served with 2 different waters in a testube was too much of work, not justified by the taste- quite average.

For maincourse I stuck to my favourite from the house of Amigos- Cilantro Veggies with Corn rice- love the flavorful gravy. Rest of the table ordered for Indian- munni ke badnaam kofte, kadhai paneer, gabbar ki maa ki dal. I tasted and loved all of them. The garlic naan was also quite good.

We ended the meal with Nolen Gur cigars and Hazaro khwaishe aisi. The nolen gur cigar was not a big hit on the table, was like gur sandesh and a little on the sweet side for my palette. However the hazaro khwaishe aisi which was everyone's khwaish was a BIG HIT and although I wasn't too keen on it, I loved the taste and reached for a 2nd and a 3rd helping. 

Service was prompt and our servers Salauddin and Javed were courteous, I have complains with respect to the ambience though. Too much noise with people loudly talking at their tables, loud music was just not required. 

All in all a good food experience. This city rarely disappoints me when it comes to food!!

This place had been long pending but totally worth it. One of the best meals I have had since my time in Kolkata. 

The place is well lit, great ambiance, good music and courteous staff. Served by deepak, we ordered a Balam Puchkari, Pao Bhaji Fondue and a burrito rollo. The Balam puchkari is puchka served the molecular gastronomy way. Apart from the theatrics, the taste was awesome. The paobhaji fondue tasted authentic. Burrito rollo was okayish. Coming to maincourse,  we ordered Gabbar ke maa ki daal and jhalfrezi tarkari (on Deepak's recommendation). It all tasted awesome. The taste is too good. The warqi paratha is a must try. 

Coming to desserts, we ordered a mumbai meri jaan and golmaal. Both of them awesome. Golmaal is a must try. It is heaven.

All in all, this place is a must go. The food, the ambiance and the service is all good.

Visited Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen today. We are college students always looking for a break from the boring hostel food and what a break it was. The food, service, ambience, everything was top notch. 

We started with DIY Masala Papad, Puchka and Burrito Rolls. This set the tone for the rest of the evening. Puchkas came with a couple of test tubes containing paani to complement the puri. Papad came with pickled and masala onion and dahi. Burritos were also accompanied by standard dips. All three were excellent. 

Next up we ordered Gabbar ki Maa ki Daal and Jalfrezi (very aptly suggested by our server Deepak) along with Cheese Chilli Olive Naan, Warqi Paratha (again suggested by Deepak) and Garlic Naan. Standard stuff but the taste was something which we haven't experienced in our stay in Kolkata so far. 

They say save your best for the last and the desserts are something which are the best on the menu. We ordered Golmaal, Mumbai Meri Jaan and Hazaron Khwahishein Aisi. All 3 were different from each other but Golmaal just stole the show. I advise everyone to have it. I have just seen videos of this dish on facebook but today got to experience it as well. 

Glad we chose this place and thanks Deepak for the suggestions.

Located right opposite the US consulate, the place where Gabbar is earlier housed the Italian joint Amigos, a favourite of many of the city's Italian food lovers. Since I am not staying in Kolkata anymore, my knowledge on the food scene there has become a little rusty. In fact I was not aware of the exact location of Gabbar and neither that Amigo has shut shop. Was a little disappointed at first to see Gabbar standing tall at erstwhile Amigos location and it dawned on me that Amigos has shut shop!

A nude brick wall, another with popular sayings from Bollywood and the third a photo wall with black and white picture frames of Bollywood celebrities. Right at the entrance is the chalkboard with the Chef Recommendation and ‚ÄòDo‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts for the patrons. The do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts is a part funny and a part annoying list with prohibitions like ‚ÄòDo not pick your nose‚Äô, ‚Äòdo not throw tantrums‚Äô, ‚ÄòNo laughing loudly‚Äô. ‚ÄòNo Laughing Loudly!! Are we supposed to not crack any jokes while dining at Gabbar‚Äôs it made us wonder! ;) The place gets noisy and crowded during meals and is a good family hangout too. 

Had heard a lot of food deconstruction at Gabbar‚Äôs and had gone with a lot of expectations. Theatrical in some parts- yes but deconstruction- no.  But it does serve the regular Indian affairs with √©lan. The presentation of some of the items like the ‚ÄòBalam Phuchakri‚Äô‚Äô and the ‚ÄòHazaaron Kahweise Aisi‚Äô was great but there was no molecular gastronomy there. ¬†

The puchakas come in spoons on a tray with imli pani and pudina pani served in test tubes placed in bowl with nitrogen oxide fumes. It is a treat to the eyes and a tangy sweet song for the mouth. I would easily give dish 4.5 points. Both the pudina pani and imli pani had the required amount of tang, spice and consistency. The act of pouring them in the puchkas and then having it also gave us a childlike pleasure. This dish was a delight and the hero of my meal.

The second starter we tried was KHAIKE CHAAT BENARAS WALA- disappointing and not even remotely matching the amazing chaat scene in Beneras. We were expecting a melange of flavours here because a chaat gives you a lot of flavours to play with but this was very basic and not even delicious at that. Avoidable.

For mains we had Maa ki Dal, Spinach Koftas and an array of rotis. The WARKI PARATHA was maida parathas baked to a crunchy red and delicious though somehow the name made me want more from the paranthas. The JALEPENO OLIVE NAAN was a good and new discovery. We had never had similar naans before and were happily surprised. MASALA KULCHA was soft, fluffy and a winner with the family

A must try is their SPINACH KOFTAS which were melt in your mouth delicious soft balls with spinach and cashew. The gravy was the right amount of sweet with mild spice. Yum!! Must try for Kofta lovers

For dessert we had the much hyped about ‚ÄòHAZAARON KHWAEISE AISI‚Äô. Being an ardent chocolate and dessert lover, this dish priced at 295 felt like cheating to me. While the presentation of the dish is great and appetite inducing, the content is a letdown. Chocolate brownies topped with vanilla ice cream and oreo crunch- a simple all time favourite dessert but the brownie ruined the dish. The first few bites were delish with oreo crumbs, vanilla icecream and the brownie creating the perfect high but as we dug dip, something was amiss and we realised it was the brownie. It was neither rich nor had a good chocolaty flavour. I could taste the dough and it was a shame that four of us, all chocolate lovers together could not finish the dessert. Gabbar needs to work on this. 

An overall good experience more so because the Kolkata food scene has been gradually modernising and restaurants like Gabbar have their role to play in this. Some of the dishes are here are gems while some needs re-working.

Heard a lot about this place. Finally visited it last week and although was not disappointed but it will take more for me to visit the place again. The presentation of food is indeed novel and enjoyed the puchkas and the desert thoroughly. Would have given the place a higher rating had it not been for a couple of baby cockroaches enjoying the food underneath the dining table!

Finally visited this place today! 
I had heard a lot about this place, so was looking for an opportunity to go there Asap! The entire decor has a bollywood backdrop with beautiful songs being played. We ordered a Galouti Kabab, Steamed Rice, Prawn Malai Curry and the super-famous dessert Hazar Khawayishen! All of them were simply amazing and the garnishing was also done very nicely!
The dessert was the best part, its themed like a flower lot, with oreo and vanilla icecream forming the top layer and hot chocolate being the base!
Plus, the staff were very friendly, they made sure we were comfortable, our waitor, Deepak helped us choose the best from the menu, I am really impressed with this place, the only flaw is that the quantity is less. Other than I would love to go again!

Let's start from the very beginning..as you enter, they give you a glass of mojhito with a mint ball. That's superb! You are well seated and the staff and ambience is good. Food did not reach my expectations. The food, somehow, I found was stale. It was not freshly prepared and happened to be very very oily. Mushroom salt and pepper was one dish which I loved. Rest was not So good. Not a very appealing and pleasing experience.

But their was an asshole waiter, who said his name is deepak, he kept interupting during our meal, said if we give review on zomato right away then our dessert will be complimentary, he came again and asked to mention his name as it will be complimentary from his side. I gave the review before the dessert and later nothing was given complimentary, and told us their was some confusion, although we did got a baby Cockroach on our table as complimentary which nobody cared much to remove immediately.

Who would have thought the Gabbar‚Äôs being a Bollywood style/themed restaurant would be able to dish out the most styling Molecular Gastronomic items off its menu! Bitten by the bug and utter crave to try out some gastronomic dishes, I have been waiting for my chance and here I was entering Gabbar‚Äôs in the infamous Russell Street area of Kolkata along with my family for a long-due dinner.

As many would know, Gabbar‚Äôs has sprung up in place of the lovely Mexican joint ‚ÄòAmigos‚Äô, and all who know would agree, no-one thought the replacement would be so much better ‚Äì in terms of food and experience. Sheer delight it is.

Already awed by the d√©cor and interiors (a little upset with the loud music, keeping it a tad lower would have helped the overall scheme of things), my family is much spirited when I explain to them what‚Äôs coming our way when we order some from the molecular menu. A small waiting area right opposite the small bar right at the entrance and then a large seating area (with capacity of around 50) and the incandescent lighting was a good enough setup. The seating table area has a wall dedicated to graffiti in form of the most popular Bollywood film dialogs and other two walls adorning posters/frames of some of the yesteryears‚Äô most popular actors.

As we get settled having absorbed the ambiance and understood the concept menu, we move on to order some appetizers. Choice of the day turns out to be ‚ÄòBalam Puchkari‚Äô and ‚ÄòKhaike Chaat Benaras Wala‚Äô.

Balam Puchkari
Well if it were not for the Bollywood theme who would have thought that it were Kolkata‚Äôs most infamous Puchkas or Pani-Puri as they call in Mumbai or Gol-Gappa as they call it in North was coming our way. Served in most unexpected style, laid out on a faux grass, each portion came atop a spoon with the teekha/pudina and meetha pani served in test-tubes which were dipped inside a laboratory flask from which vapours kept oozing out! The scene was captivating enough for my family to already like what was at the table.

Khaike Chaat Benaras Wala
For a family that loves the good ole street chaats of India, Benaras holds a special place (No, not only for the Holy nature, but for the lovely chaat scene there!). While we were all too happy with the Puchkari we were anticipating another magic to happen soon and thus arrives the next serving. While the presentation looks average, we left it to the taste buds. And how disappointed were we, sadly. The very basic aloo chaat (sliced boiled potato topped with some sweet-spicy chutney and diced onions) and palak bhajiya topped with chutney was such a shame when the dish tries to reckon itself with Benaras. I get that you‚Äôre signifying Spinach/Palak when you mention Popeye, but why Benaras? ÔÅå

Moving on, we started deliberating what should we try for the Mains when we stumbled on two very obvious choices when it comes to Vegan North Indian cuisine ‚Äì Dal Makhani and Kofta (trust me, the bias is bound to creep in, especially when you‚Äôre with family. Also, Gabbar‚Äôs at this point, doesn‚Äôt have a very wide variety here). So we go by the round, take consensus, and settle on ‚ÄòGabbar Ki Maa Ki Dal‚Äô and a new variant of Kofta introduced as a part of Winter Menu (name I am forgetting).

Gabbar Ki Maa Ki Dal
Recipe they claim to have been borrowed from Gabbar ki Maa, ok, then let‚Äôs find her and thank her for the giving us the good ole taste of Dal Makhani with her recipe. Perfectly rich and creamy and smoked at the same time, the dal tasted well. Not a hint of sweetness which many restaurants now adopt and I hate when it comes to Dal Makhani.

Palak Kofta
This new entrant to the Menu is spinach Kofta in rich and creamy white gravy and tastes simply amazing. The kofta is soft and succulent with the spinach filling well minced and battered to secrete any bitterness of spinach. Neither sweet nor spicy, this moderate gravy is absolute winner.

Breads - Cheese Chill Olive Naan, Warqi Paratha, Garlic Naan, Masala Kulcha
As you may see, we intended to try the most appealing names off the Menu and succeeded too, not in terms of ordering listed breads off the menu, but in liking what we ordered for ÔÅä The Masala Kulcha was the real winner, the dough so soft that it stole everyone‚Äôs heart and the filling so well balanced with spices. Warqi Paratha is the good ole laccha paratha which was baked to amazing reddish crispiness with strong aroma of butter. Cheese Chilli Olive Naan and Garlic Naan were pretty much average/regular, nothing special worth mention.

Pretty much ending the meal on an overall happy note, how could we have left without trying at least one of the many well-presented desserts off the menu. With the seniors deciding to call it off a day, we went ahead with ‚ÄòHazaron Khwaishein Aisi‚Äô primarily because it is a crime to prefer any dessert above anything that‚Äôs chocolate based ;)

Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi
Served beautifully in a clay pot shaped in form of an earthenware flower pot and topped with fake greens, folks were again awed with the presentation of the dessert. As captivating the look, so was the taste. Layered beautifully with gooey chocolate brownie beaten with loads of chocolate syrup giving it a mudpie nature at the bottom followed by vanilla ice cream in middle, followed up by Oreo soil/crumbs on the top! Wow! A perfect sin to end the meal ÔÅä

Overall, Gabbar‚Äôs is a promising start to Kolkata‚Äôs molecular gastronomy scene and I signed off craving for soo much more. Look forward to trying other cuisines off the menu as well.

We also tried warqi paratha and cheese, olive and jalapeno naans, which turned out to be surprisingly amazing. Chicken tikka masala was pretty good too. I didn't try their mexican and other cuisines, but the food and ambiance has excited me enough to come back again and try more food there. Keep up the good work.

I visited this restaurant for dinner and boy they were awesome!  It is expensive! I will not deny that but the food was worth it. For starters we ordered chicken kebab with cheese and mock tails. The best mocktail was the one with ice cream.  I have forgotten the dishes names hence the review is not really a justified one. but this much I will say they sure know how to win customer's brownie points. The biriyani rice used was little aged so it had this weird taste to it and when asked how the food was I said so. They promptly gave a apology pastry. Which I really loved. The desserts for us were the winners of the night. Be it haazaro khwaishe aisi or the melt in your mouth strawberry cigars with strawberry foam.

Molecular Gastronomy in Kolkata?

'nuff said!

Gabbar's was a fun experience through and through. Add to that the good service and the pleasant ambience, and it was a night to remember.

The restaurant is very conveniently located opposite the American Consulate, at the ground floor of the well known Jubilee court. The restaurant seats about 75 comfortably, including a small private room for events. The decor is fun Bollywood kitsch - with pictures and quotes from iconic Bollywood movies - everything from "kitne aadmi the?" to "ek chutki sindoor" and posters of Mr and Mrs 55 to photographs from the sets of Sholay. The lighting is muted - there is a terrific retro looking chandelier made out of naked light bulbs and various tungsten lights over the bar.

Coming to the food - we missed the mexican options that evening, but the molecular gastronomy section did not disappoint!

we made it a point to try the Mushroom chai, the Tomato Basil soup and the Balam Phuchkari for starters. The mushroom chai was just what we needed for a chilly evening - the sachet of herbs and truffle salt which instantly dissolved in the broth were add-ons. The tomato soup got cold too soon. The Balam Phuchkari was great fun - the spicy gelee in the rava phuchkas was yummy and so was the tamarind and mint water served in test tubes and a smoking dry ice bath!

We opted for non-adventurous mains - but even here, the standard of food did not disappoint. The Warqi paratha was light and immensely flavorful. The olive naan was nice and filling. We had it with a vegetarian spinach kofta in a tasty saffron gravy and the murg lababdaar.

Desserts were excellent - we tried the Yeh hain Mumbai meri Jaan kulfi (parsee kulfis with a hint of rose water), the strawberry cigars (our version of the cannoli?) and the Hazaron Khwahishein Aisi (chocolate mudpie with Oreo soil).

The bill, when it finally arrived, was in a small steel box labelled "damage" and it was nestled on a miniature khatiya! The "damage" was a bit on the higher side, but, it was totally on the money and we were happy with the food. 

We met one of the owners at the door and he was very warm too.

Overall, loved the place and would definitely be back for more.

The only disappointment was the unavailability of some of the interesting items on the menu - especially the Mexican ones. Hope that's rectified soon.

It has been a more than a year since I had shared my last gastronomic outing with the ever increasing family of Zomato - part of this hiatus was due to health and travel reasons, but more due to boredom and maybe a lack of imagination in the menus. Thanks to

Well this was my third attempt to visit this place. Because earlier twice I came to the restaurant and they said the kitchen is closed come down later. Though we had called prior before visiting and they said that the restaurant was open and serving. These to instances were very offending though. However, today we were passing by little Russell street and thought of giving it a try again to this place. Fortunately it was open. I was much excited to this place because they had the thing of Molecular Gastronomy which has always amused me! 

The service of the staffs were quite pleasant. We had ordered for the Balam- Pichkari which is Puchka served in a very innovative way! It looked fabulous! The plating and presentation was mind blowing.  Within minutes they served our orders which impressed me. In Starters we had ordered for Rajama e galauti kabab which was also one of its own kind. For main course we ordered for kofta malai maarke and butter nan! The Koftas were soft and yummy! The Beer Sangria was something really different! Overall it was a good experience! The ambiance , service really good! Looking forward to visit the place again üòâ

Quirky is the word. Located in Russell street near the American consulate it's downplayed exterior is in stark contrast to it's 90s inspired bollywood interior. This place is small and cozy which again might be a bit of a damper if you are seated next to an unfortunately loud crowd (like us)! The menu immediately draws you in with dishes named "balam phuchkari" etc which will make you chuckle inwardly. We tried the lat me kai chicken and kebab platter for startes. Both the dishes were delicious and on point. I will suggest the latter for its variety! A special mention about the goulati kebabs which were simply melt in the mouths. Next we tried the pav bhaji fondue i felt that the bite sized pavs were a good appetizer before rounding off to the main course with chipotle chicken that for me was the star of the day! Chicken breast cooked perfectly and stuffed with delicious mushrooms served with a side of flavored rice and mashed potatoes! It was a good gastronomical experience!

A very good family restaurant. Nice ambiance, good music, great service and most importantly, delicious food. An amazing place to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, etc. A fine-dining experience where emphasis is on customer satisfaction. Very well managed.
Always go by making reservations in advance because it's difficult to get a table, more so on a weekend.¬†
The only thing i felt was the quantity of food could be a bit more when served.
Rest, Thumps up guys.
 Thanks for the amazing food. Will come back again soon.

Aftr waiting fr so long finally I came here. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with photos of "Sholay" and some of the eminent actors of the Bollywood industry.
Now, let's talk about the food. Well, for starters, we went with the Gabbar's so-called Phuckas "Balam Phuckaris" n Galeouti Kebabs. The Phuckas weren't any xclusive Bt the lamb kebabs were too yummy. Then we had butter naan with some chicken curry. Can't remember the dish xactly. And following by that we had Chiploti Chicken which is a Mexican main course, which was utterly delicious as well. It was a dish with some rice, chiken pieces n smashed potato with a special sauce.
And for the desert we had "Yeh hain Mumbai meri jaan", a kulfi ice cream.
Well the food was very delicious and the presentation was brilliant, totally out of the box.. Totally satisfied with the staff n the food..
We'll be coming soon here...

Today went to this restaurant and had a very good time. Ambiance is cool, waiters are well informed and friendly, serving time is quick, presentation of food is excellent. Bit costly but rest of the goodness make up for it. Ordered non veg kabab platter  called mogambo khush hua and for main course ordered butter chicken, chicken lababdar, mexican fish fry, warqi paratha, garlic naan and for mocktail ordered virgin mojito and for dessert ordered their signature dish hazaro khawaishe aisi. All the items were great , special mention goes to the dessert item hazaro khawaishe aisi, it is too good. Per head cost was 1200. Overall had a satisfactory experience..

You have to keep visiting this place over and over again to actually explore all the delicacies in their widespread menu. Everything looks so intriguing and the presentation is wow ! The taste of the food is finger licking good although some of the breads were not up to the mark. Must tries are the butter chicken, warghi paratha and specially recommended virgin mojito shots (mouth freshner). Great interiors with bad music choice. All in all, a good place for foodies.

Gabbar's is pricely located in Russel Street, right opposite the US Consulate. Its an old legacy building ground floor that has been converted into this very-interestingly decorated restaurant. The theme is of course Bollywood and every thought has been put into it to call out the theme. 

Prices are quite on the upper side here so be prepared to witness a lower quantity vs price ratio here. A great part of the restaurant is also their menu-card - which itself should be an item of attraction. 

We had several items. Though the starter - Mutton Golouti Kabab was average on taste and low in terms of quantity, I would rate the other items higher. We had Gosht Rahra and Naan. The Rahra was great in taste - two pieces though for a 445/- dish. We also tried Chinese and was pleasantly surprised. Reasonably priced, they can very well give the chinese joints in Park Street a run for their money. The American Chopsuey was perfect and so were the Kung Pao chicken and Fish in Coriander sauce. But the best in my opinion would be the Chicken Pan-Fried Noodles, which came with the pan itself. 

Be pleasantly surprised when you order your desserts. You would get some lovely paans which are ice-cold and served on a thin potato wafer. Also they use nitrogen-di-oxide to create the smoke-effect while serving phhuchkas etc. 

Overall, I would recommend a visit. One thing to note is that there are a plethora of Veg dishes here - for example the Italian/Mexican section disappointed me as they offer only one non-Veg dish there. 

Also, I felt they'd do good if they reduced the price a bit to offer greater value for money.

Yes , its more of a Bar than a dessert place but then there are always exceptions !!! If u wanna indulge in some sinful desserts which are full of drama as much as its name - Gabbar's is the place to be . Hazaro khwaishe aisi is a must have and if you want your kulfi sinked in a smokey delight amchi mumbai is a great option . Not a chocholate person you have great options with strawberries too ! A gang of friends lotsa gossip some beer food and dessert - Gabbar's is a place to be !!! ( Ahem - might Pinch ur Pocket a wee bit !!! )

After a series of planning and cancelling I  finally went to Gabbar-the much hyped restaurant of Kolkata-and it was everything I had hoped for if not better.
The place's ambience will enchant you at first sight. The theme is classy iconic Bollywood and the hanging frames are assured to draw eyeballs.
We had ordered Balam Puchkari,Mutton Nazakat for starters. Never had I imagined that I will have panipuris in a test tube and pudina chutney from a toy pressure cooker. But Gabbar gave me that and floored me with their imaginative presentation. For our mains we had ordered Gabbar Ma ki Dal, Cheese Garlic Naan, Tandoori Naan. Served in aluminum saucepans, the two mains were just exquisite. For dessert we had ordered 'Hazaron Khwahishen Aisi' and the gooey chocolate dessert scores high on presentation and taste. 
Overall Gabbar was splendid, my only complaint was that the service was a tad bit slow. For foodies and restaurant enthusiasts this place is a must!!!

Its a perfect place for drinks ! Its famous for its north indian too! We ordered spring rolls and white penne pasta ! The spring rolls were good. But the pasta was not at all good. It was pathetic ! However, the place is a bit expensive too. The excitement which we had after entering the place by looking at the decor and ambience , it was all ruined by the food . The pasta was so bad that it wasn't even worth taking the photo!

The ambiance and interiors are same as it was before, when the place was called Amigos. The food, in my personal opinion has not been kept the same. We ordered mostly of what our waiter suggested and regretted as soon as the first dish was served. Very plain and average food with smart dressing and high prices. 
Not recommending this place to anybody.

All of it was good, but don't ever miss three items when you go there - the cheese olive naan, Gabbar's ma ki daal and Golmaal. The service was good too. The only nitpicking that I can do is about the space and the noisy crowd, but the food more than made up for it. Had a satisfying dinner outside home after a long time.

Bollywood Theme based restaurant with good interiors and spacious. Can easily cum up with our family and frnds in group.
Food was delicious especially Starters.. We tried Punjabi Veg Starters which were a bit different from others as in mini Makki ki roti n Sarso da saag, Chole and Paratha YES as a starter, cheese balls, crispy Baby corn and Paneer Tikka all were lovely and presentation was also a bit different... Main course was normal but good.. Daal and paneer butter masala one should try... among Desserts there are few items as in brownie vanilla ice cream with oreo biscuits served in a plant pot was good and must try...
Service was good and price will be around 1k with the drinks for a person... Definitely must visit this place at least once....

Great ambience and unparallel hospitality. Enjoyed food immensely. No reason why you should not visit with friends and family. If you wish to meet mini Gabbar, you must look out for Deepak who looks like Gabbar but nature wise, he is just GREAT.

Went to Gabbars this weekend with friends. Disappointed......... The quantity of dishes are very less whereas price is on the higher side. The happy hour starts at 10:00 pm onwards but they have not mentioned that it is till 11:00 as told by the staff. Happy hour menu is seperate which is OK but they dont have those items in stock and you are forced to choose the liquor as per their availability. We placed a running order for 1 Nan and rice at 11:10 and they told the kitchen is closed. Which was ridiculous. Since they must at least inform us for last order before closing the kitchen and as well as happy hour. The rating which i am giving is for decor and food presentation only which is out of box and appreciable.

This restaurant was a surprise to me as I never noticed it on Ho Chi Minh Sarani. Had heard about it though. Took a couple of guests there today and I am happy with my decision. The food was really good and the presentation was all the more unique. It is themed on Bollywood from their interiors to Restroom Signs to Menu etc. etc. They served us a complimentary serving of Molecular Gastronomy Mojito shots and WOW they were. So refreshing. 

Overall an amazing experience with a higher side of Pocket Pinch.

Visited this place a couple of weeks ago,had to wait for almost 45 minutes before we could get a table...so the place was nicely themed we wer there to celebrate on of my friends birthday...had few drinks...
We ordered paneer tikka which was absolutely gr8, Mongolian rice which was also really nice,punjabi beat  was just a waste,pasta was okiesh...overall we had a fun time...staff wer gr8 and top of it there was a complimentary dessert hazaro khwahishe aissi...it was just a piece of art... ;) .
Overall had a gr8 evening.
Would recommend for a prior reservation on weekends.
If u people can do then play some of the dialogue on background for a change :)

Right from the ambience to hospitable, helpful waiters. Salaudin and Bidan attending our table were courteous and ever present with their smiling faces. Balam puchkari, Gabar ki maa ki daal and Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi are as amazing and different as the names sound and must be tried.

The decor to start with is lovely. Looks quite like what one would expect at a Social, but they have their own theme of Bollywood which is quite interesting. The food was presented spectacularly and they have some really creative stuff going on with the menu so you can see some effort going into the overall look and feel! 
Coming to the meat of the matter, the food, superb. The Mutton Handi was outstanding. I only docked half a point because the chicken dish we ordered on recommendation (Dum Ka Murg) was surely not their best dish.
Overall a lovely experience.

The decor is very quirky and it's a great place to chill out with your friends. The food tastes good but their creative presentation is something you don't get to see very often. Among other items, I liked the Chipotle chicken, better than what I had at Chili's. But the clear winner was the dessert Golmaal.. haven't tasted anything as heavenly!

The ambience was excellent but was optimistic about the food. The service was impeccable and the servers were always keen to attend to any requests & finally the most importantly the menu was very diverse so i was very sceptical about the Mexican & Chinese items.. However we were happily surprised that the Daal makhni, Murg Tikka Lababdaar, Dam ka Murgh & Dream of Fisherman was amazing. For a change we packed up our leftover food. You can happily or proudly bring your guests to flaunt kolkata Food Scene !! 

Mr. Deepak made sure service was spot on & attended to any requests very promptly. Have to be back to try out the rest of the menu !!

I'm giving 4.5* as i want to see a consistency of this experience, id love to come back give a 5* for Next time !!!

Every person of the staff attends you with a smile.
The food- Well I couldn't have much. Ordered Makkhan Singh's Butter Chicken , butter nan and tandoori roti. Chicken was delicious ! Nan was good but both the breads could be more soft.
Do taste the desert named #Golmaal it's a choclate ball filled with chocolate mousse and caramel , cracked with warm choclate sauce. #heaven

So I walked into the sooo trending place of Kolkata on a Sunday afternoon. The ambiance was lively, with a Bollywood theme. The walls are splashed with graffiti, old Bollywood posters and framed contemporary pictures of current Bollywood actors. They have a list of funny advice at the corner, scribbled on a black board with chalk.¬†
The food - amazing presentation! Loved it and yes it does taste good. They really take care to present it well by adding up to every detail, that strikes a foodtastic impression. Kudos to the creativity!
The service is also worth appreciating, the manager is ever smiling and cordial and personally attends to the tables.
The pricing is on the high end but its worth trying.
This is a perfect place for all occasions, one can come here with family, friends and even dates-if you want to blow them off with the presentation of food. They play good music too. My experience was a positive one and I will go back again to try more dishes.
I recommend this place to one and all.

Since they eat without onion garlic food for starters we had ordered the dal chawal a charity balls & palak ka chat for my son.the starters were very good especially the plating. Javed,the server was especially very helpful in giving details abt non onion garlic food. For main course we got a wide variety of veggies.the chef in fact made ali jeers esp for my Mil since she is a hardcore aloo fan.thnks gabbar's & Javed for making our family dinner a memorable experience.

Tried Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Paneer Tikka, Bhaji Fondue( Pav Bhaji), Nachos, Tomato Basil Soup( with basil spaghetti- new style) Gabbar Dal  with garlic naan and Lacha.
Different way of serving, small cooker & pans for serving dips...
The service is good, overall a great place to enjoy meal.

Usually when we are in Calcutta, Dhaba and street food are the only things on our radar.  This time there was a lot of buzz around this newly opened place and we decided to give it a try.  It's a nicely done up place, fairly big and the service is good.  We visited on a weekday afternoon and there were quite a few tables occupied.  Now the food,  it was good but I have eaten much better at a lot many places. We ordered dahi seekh kebab, paneer Tikka and nachos.  Good portions and nicely presented. For main course,  it was Maa ki dal ,  lasooni Palak and paneer tikka lababdar. While the rest were OK,  the lasooni Palak stole the show.  A must try here! We also liked the cheese chili  olive Nan and Warqi parantha. We ordered parsi dairy kulfi,  served with a lot of theatre of liquid nitrogen fumes.  The taste however was strictly OK.  Overall a nice place to eat at in Calcutta.

Visited the place today(28/11/2016) being a Saturday had to wait for over half hour but that's something expected on a weekend.
Coming to the ambience and feel of the place it's made completely in a filmy andaaz and pretty well maintained...
Now the food, our order was completely vegetarian and the quality was very good, even the portion size is maintained quite well only one complain there gravy content needs to increased and thus making their food a little dry. But overall an amazing experience with our table attendant Javed courteous and helpful in every manner.

Visited Gabbar's with the family to celebrate our anniversary. I am always wary of places which "specialise" in Indian, Chinese etc etc. Gabbar's, though generically, belongs to that category, the food is not essentially a part of that bandwagon. We had the Murg Nazakath kebab & nachos as starter. Main course included Butter Chicken, Dum ka Murgh, Yellow dal, Gabbar ki Ma ki dal, Chipotle Chicken & Dream of fisherman. The Indian dishes are well crafted. The Chicken Chipotle was also delectable & sumptous. The Fish preparation had a foul whiff & was promptly replaced. But their USP is the Happy Hour from 10 pm, though would prefer more choices in the Happy Hour menu. Service is prompt & courteous. The caricatures on the wall are interesting and would love to see more Gabbar dialogues there.

Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen, located in Ho Chih Minh Sarani, is one of the places I wanted to visit since a long time which I finally did on a Thursday. The two things which i liked the most about the place are its innovative presentation of food and the courteous staff. We ordered babycorn and paneer tikka which was absolutely delicious. The main course included Black Dal, Naan and Kadhai Paneer which was also good. But the cherry on the cake was the mudpie and the orange sangria. We were served very well by Jawad & Fazal. Thumbs Up to them & to Gabbar's üòÄüòÄ

Coming to the food the starters were decent, main course dishes were remotely warm and breads bit burnt. Service is ok but nothing to deserve a mention ....The food quantity did not justify the price, given similar restaurants...

I had heard mixed reviews about Gabbar's, so it was after months of dithering that we finally made it there. After a more than sumptuous meal of chicken tikka kebab, galauti kebab, black and yellow daal, prawn malai curry, chicken biryani and lasuni palak, along with an array of rotis and parathas, I can unequivocally say that Gabbar's hit all the right spots. The galauti kebab, maa ki daal and lasuni palak were particularly excellent, as were the warqi paratha and cheese olive naan. Wish we had tried Gabbar's earlier.

but for a sunday night when the place is super crowded the service gets very bad..the table is so small and close to each other that there is hardly any privacy..the place also becomes very noisy.¬†

No complaints about the food but the place needs to be better managed in terms of staff, service and seating place. And please take bookings so that you can better allocate the place.

I found this place very Average. Loved the interiors  to be honest. Ordered for a crispy baby corn, quantity was too less to suffice two people. Also, the mud pie served in a pot was way too hyped. It was a merely a combination of vanilla ice cream, crushed Oreo and brownie which could be easily prepared at home. Though the presentation was very impressive. 

Would want to try out the North Indian cuisine there the next time I visit.

So.. Finally caught Gabbar on 12th Nov 2015 .. ;-)

Location: Not very user friendly..  Xing of Little Russel Street and Ho Chi Minh Sarani. Opp U.S. Consulate.

Ambience: I personally liked it.. All those bollywood posters with sholay dialogues and other quirky texts. Brick walls. Nice and neat interiors. Calcutta needs these types of one of a kind molecular gastronomy restros.. 

Service: Prompt. Very courteous and well informed servers. 

Food: We ordered Sangria, stuffed mushroom garlic pepper, drums of heaven for the starts and for the main we had paneer kadai and tandoori roti as the server suggested that Indian menu are good here.  And it was indeed good. Didn't try many dishes but would surely return soon to tickle my taste buds with some other innovative items. 

All the food items ordered were lip smacking. 

Overall a wonderful experience.  Am totally satisfied. Thumbs up..

Another restaurant finally ticked off the wishlist- a long coveted lunch at the Bollywood themed eatery( the name says it all) giving us kolkatans an experience of molecular gastronomy.
The first thing which impressed me apart from the warm welcome by the staff was the airy ambience; tasteful lighting created a perfect chiaroscuro, the textured walls flaunting black and white pics of our Bollywood glitterati and ofcourse the standout frescoed wall! From cheeky to melodramatic, an assembly of dialogues is sure to brighten up your mood.
Ask the server for the gastronomy specials and they will illustrate it perfectly. 
For starter we had Pav Bhaji Fondu√©, buttery paos, tasty tangy bhaji. The awe factor? The bhaji is served in a ceramic bowl and a candle lit underneath to keep it hot. Cocktail was a regular lime mojito- the usual taste, again presentation is the standout point. Chicken chipotl√© was our main: The grilling was bang on- the mushroom cheese and chicken each could be made out distinctly. The accompanying rice was a classic reminder of the quintessential Mexican flavours- acidic, hot, spicy but in good harmony. And the mashed potato was passable.
The star of the lunch- Chocolate globe. The fone specimen of molecular gastronomy isn't on the menu so be sure to ask for it. A chocolate globe( liquid nitrogen is the secret) filled with caramel, nuts and chocolate( will remind you of the childhood favourite- nutties!) accompanied with nutella soil and to top it, gooey chocolate sauce is poured at your table. I had died and gone to heaven after a taste of this!
Yes the food will burn a hole in your pocket. But for a once a month fine dining affair, totally worth it.

The only good thing about this restaurant is the ambience which again isn't good enough to pay as much as they charge . The much talked about dessert called hazaaron khwaishein is not good enough. There's a mismatch between the description and the dishes actually served. Perhaps the 'fusion' is taken at a dangerous level. Too experimental to survive .

Located in the same place where Amigo's was, Gabbar's ambience has not changed much. They have just added few Bollywood posters. The food is average. Along with their original amigo's Mexican cuisine they have added the North Indian and the Chinese cuisine. Today we tried very few of the North Indian dishes. We tried the chicken lababdar, gabbar Ki Maa Ki daal (black daal) and the rotis; which were pretty decent. For dessert we tried the much hyped parle biscuit with chai ice-cream and we were not disappointed. On the whole a decent experience and I must say that one should try the restaurant at least once.

The food was really good. We absolutely enjoyed it. We had gone on a Saturday evening and therefore a huge crowd is obviously expected , but it was too much noise . very less space between the tables . It was like people are walking on our heads. But thankfully the food and presentations particularly was amazing . the nachos are a perfect start and mudpie in a vase was a perfect end (photo attached) . it's a definitely again go for me to relish the food .

This place was on my wish list for a long time because I had heard of extremely good reviews. But honestly it is just an average place. The place is way too noisy and the music that was played was really sad! The food was decent. Gabbar ki maa K√≠ daal was something which stood out. Warqi Partha was too oily. The one dish that I had heard a lot about and was looking forward to was hazaroon kwaishein aisi. But was extremely dissatisfied with it. it is only presented in a different (weird) way. That's it. It tastes nothing great. It is a combination of Oreo, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce and chocolate sponge cake. The place was packed and we had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table. But the service was very quick.

Location - Easy to locate. This restaurant is just beside IICR Hall.

Ambiance - Justifies the name of the restaurant. The wall paintings and writings are absolutely fun to watch and makes you feel sitting at Gabbar's kitchen. :D Music was good too.

Staff Management - Excellent!

Food - We ordered their mongolian rice, ginger capsicum fried rice and kung pao chicken. They tasted amazing but the quantity was less as compared to their prices.

Pocket-pinch - Costly.

Read most of the reviews before going and as mentioned in a few the place is quite loud and a little crowded. There was no one to guide us to our seat and we had to wait 4-5 minutes at the gate to finally get someone to attend to us. As such the first impression was not that good. 

However when the food was served the impression changed to a great extent. The Pav Bhaji fondue and the ulta vada pav were quite interesting. The Mexican rice and Burritos were truly a delight and the Indian food ordered by rest of our group was also to their liking. The manner in which the Hazaar Khwahishein Aisi dessert was served was something new and the dessert which was in the shape of a globe was unique. However the shell can be a little thinner and easier to eat. 

No complaints with the food. For a higher rating the overall feel of being welcomed and made comfortable is to be focused on.

I paid a visit to Gabbar's den on saptami that was 21/10/2015 at around 8pm. The restaurant is a descent place to hangout with friends nd family. The menu card is not so friendly nd is a bit expensive but if you choose items carefully you can have a good bite. The theme is not so elegant with only the paintings of Gabbar, the Inspector, Mogambo on the wall and various other movie photoframes like Gangs of Waseypur etc. I had like to mention that Kaidi Kitchen in Mani Square Mall is better in theme as compared over here. As about the food items, one particular item on the second page of the menu card will definitely be the centre of attraction. The restaurant has named it Gabbar Ki Maa Ki Dal. It will definitely bring smile to your face because of the way it has been named. It is nothing but indeed Dal Makhani. I had ordered Masala Kulcha, Paneer Butter Masala, Gabbar Ki Maa Ki Dal and Fresh Lime Soda Sweet. The food was brilliant and you might forget your table manners and start licking it till the last bite gets over. The staff was also good and the food was served in sufficient time keeping in mind it was puja time. Now the question goes that if everything was good I had rather given a 4.5 instead of a 4. Well you cannot book a table. The restaurant authorities will say that 'ohkay sir you come to our place but we cannot confirm the booking' which is a bit annoying. I mean what if you don't get a place to sit, will you wait? So I had like to suggest that booking should be taken in advance.

The dining place is fairly small, probably 1000 square feet. Lots of tables have been put in  and lots of waiters fast moving here and there. You would feel you have come to Shiv Sagar on a Sunday! It is chaotic to say the least!

Regarding the service, it felt that their objective was to do business quickly, take order and present the food and ensure that the table gets vacated fast!! Forks were not present on 2 occasions, one when Fondue was presented and later when Chinese was presented. We asked them whats good in appetisers, and we were told to try the Paw Bhaji Fondue, Papdi chat and one more chat! I was disappointed. I had not gone there to have chat!! Pasta was served in its big but small Amigos saucer !!

The food was okay, North Indian food was good and the portions were decent. That is probably the only good thing about the place. Appetisers were just about okay, Chilli Babycorn you can probably count. 

 The bottom line is, YOU CAN NEITHER HAVE GOOD FOOD OR GOOD TIME WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY!! The Restaurant wants to serve regular ordinary food in a designer way in a chaotic place and charge exorbitant rates. They first tried with Amigos and failed and now experimenting with this. Result, time will tell !!

My suggestion to the Management is that Kolkata customers want good food, decent portion size at reasonable price. The first year of the Restaurant is generally good in Kolkata because of the limited options Kolkata has and so most customers go to the new place in town as there is nothing else to boast of, except a new dining place!!

Molecular gastronomy was something I'd just heard of before I saw a one half of a deuce sized chocolate ball melt when hot chocolate was poured over it, before some balloon-ish sort of a thing they called the molecular virgin mojito popped into my mouth giving a great lime after taste. A round of applause for Gabbar's to be one of those few restaurants that experiment with niche concepts and turn them into an experience worth having for their diners! Bravo for such food entrepreneurship!
Having said that, the other regulars on the menu seemed too ordinary to be ordered after the tryst with the science behind the mojito and the dessert - we stuck to burrito rollo's and arrabiata, but ended up ordering two of those massive chocolate balls & a mudpie-in-a-plant. Great experiment, great taste, great pioneering in Kolkata, guys!
For the value diner, you may find it overpriced and the portions suitable for one person or two at the most and not too many molecular options to choose from (but definitely worth trying).
Ambiance, again, nice bollywood wall, nice lighting and family decor feeling.
In brief, one of the few must-visit places in Kolkata for someone who's up for a sophisticated taste in food.

This Restaurant Amigos Turned Gabbar's. I had good reviews about this restaurant before today's experience. I have been to this place numerous times and today happened to be one horrible experience.

Hello so called ( manager ) firstly you are one of the weirdest human beings I've come across. Secondly , I don't think I saw you around this restaurant ever before in last 3 years. 
Most importantly you have Zero Knowledge about the hospitality industry.
On a Sunday 6.30Pm entire restaurant was  empty and we chose to sit on a table , every waiter is asking me to wait for a minute or two , and after this , I was been introduced by Mr Ketan, he asked us to come out once and first give him the details , for which I disagreed as I wasn't keen on sharing my personal details. He then asked me to sit at a table next to billing counter for which I wasn't keen. He asked me he didn't have a choice but to not offer us any other tables in the empty restaurant. I left with no choice but to leave , I then asked him is he the manager over here. I have never seen such Lame Things happening at any restaurant before this. I regret going to this place and spoiling my Saturday mood. 
I made up my mind that very time , the next time I go this place , I wouldn't want to see his Face !! 
Don't spoilt the reputation of the place , for such UnCultured Managers at the Gate ! 
Hope to have better Experiences in the future. Cheers !

Okay went to this place yesterday with my office colleagues. First things first, the theme of the restuarant is extremely nice. Bollywood posters and dialouges written on the walls plus the atmospherics of a run down jail come 70's style bolly set is simply amazing. Now next comes the food, the starters are pretty good both veg & non-veg and the presentation of the dishes is nice, for instance the non-veg kebab platter is called Mocambo Khush Hua. However the Veg main course is a let down. The Non-Veg main course is satisfactory. Now I have not tried the booze there as yet so wont comment on that. However if u are looking for a place to go with friends and do not mind the extra pinch on the pocket. The place is definitely worth a visit...

Finally visited gabbar..had been longing to try this place for quite sometime now. Ths place is located a minutes walk from metro plaza in maidan.

Reached there around 1 when they were just opening up. Not a big place but nicely decorated with pictures of all the bolly actors on the wall and a sholay grafitti. Nice ambience allover.

Now comes the food. We ordered dal chawal arcini. Warqi paratha..cheese chilli naan , kadai paneer and gabbar ki ma ki dal. Taste wise all were good but not exceptional.. I was so full didnt try desserts.. Will try the potted plant nxt time..

Price is on the higher side ..all of ths costs around 1500/-.

Overall good..food expected bttr .

Trailer : The best in town as far as molecular gastronomy is concerned, esp in case of indian cuisine. What is molecular gastronomy? While most of us have simply heard and made up our own explanations but in fact it refers to the process where scientific applications are applied to the preparation of food. Eg: Balam puchkari served here - puchka- the owners have gone through a lot of R&D to convert the water into a jelly form. Benefit? This ensures no matter how long they are left for, puchkas won't get soggy and no issues of water dripping all over . Eg 2: Molecular Paan ( pic attached) the base of the Paan is almost transparent with the masala on top of it . One would wonder if the base is edible but it indeed is! It's made cleverly out of starch . Eg 3: jalebi Bai : jalebis in common term: it's a tedious process to convert the round jalebis into small ball shaped ones filled with the jalebi fluid. All in all , fascinating and commendable to see the owners putting in such hard work to apply this global trend to our very own desi dishes! Loved the indian preparation, esp since there are handful of places with such extensive vegetarian menu! This was part of a wonderful zomato foodie meet up and hence I would let the review of each dish be since my fellow reviewers have already indulged in that, I felt more light needed to be shown to this particular aspect of it ! The owner was one passionate person, and was quite patient with our never ending questions ! Lovely meal with lovely ppl -

Although being a new addition to the city, it has already gained much popularity. I reached here at 7pm & there was a long waiting list before me with a wait time of 1hr. 

About the food: Okayish.. I had come for a quick bite so didn't try much dishes. I had ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Chilli Garlic Noodles. The Babycorn was good but the noodles was just ok. They give a complimentary Garlic Sauce which was a bit tasteless. 

Service was quick. Although the place has a bar too, but it looks more of a family restaurant. Prices are a bit expensive.

They have tried hard in giving a themed look to the place such as the title on the cover page of the menu, names of dishes (Gabbar Ki Maa Ki Dal), etc.

One of the newest locations in kolkata and it lives up to the hype created . Located in ho chi min sarani , one of the posh locations in kolkata. We visited the place on 3rd of october and had an amazing dinner. Had to wait for around 30 mins due to the weekend rush. The ambience is really beautiful with beautiful lights and posters and quotes from sholay and amitabh bachan movies.

We ordered for a

Lambi race ka ghoda-  long island iced tea served in a long cylindrical tube. You got to drink it with a pipe. Initially it may be difficult to drink and you may spill a little but then you will get used to it. 

Paw bbhaji fondue- i got to say one of the best paw bhajis that i have tasted in kolkata. The buns are really small and are perfectly shaped. The quantity really good and a the taste so perfect.

Pasta- the pasta was just ok. I didnt find anything special in it and was just like any other pasta you find anywhere else. The quantity too was really less.

Dal chawal arachini- frankly i have never heard of the dish before . It was marked as one of their specialities and i ordered it not knowing what will come. The food when served was not at all a dissapoinment. Tiny balls will small rolls of papad on top served with two chutnies. 

Hazaron khawaishen aisi- mudpie oreo cake. The best thing that i tasted today. Served in a small flower pot with a pudina plant on top. It seriously looks like a plant. The desert was a delight to the taste buds. If you ever visit the place this is one thing that you defenitely should order.

Moreover gabbar has started with molecular gastronomy. For those who do not know about it , it is a food science in which the chef innovates different type of foods in order to provide a all together different taste to the mouth.

Coming to the staff. Very polite and curteous. Resturants should really learn from the staff here. They constantly monitored their customers and on facing any problem they themselves came over without you having to call them . A waiter always at your disposal anytime and the service really quick although the resturant was pack jam.

I must say you really have to visit the place . It surely will be a perfect dinner experience.

P.s- they dont take reservations on weekends so you may have to wait for hours to get a table. So if you aren't a person with patience then do visit the place early or else stay away from the place on weekends.

I hope you like my review and do follow me.
BON APPETIT.

We had heard a lot about this place and eventually landed here to celebrate the birthday of our friend. That was her wish and she wishes to be there and dine.

The name and looks are what seems good and from literal terms looks like a good concept. The decor looks like the setting of old times where there are unpainted walls and the whole setting is in yellow lights. Old dialogues and pictures show up like old bollywood movies.

When the place is crowded it looks worst and noisy than the Howrah Station itself. It looks horrible. There is noise everywhere. When it is not crowded it looks sober and good. I happen to be there when it was damn crowded and there were people everywhere.

We had two toddlers with us and no one cooperated with us to give us the couch seats. But then not every place people care. We have been to so many restaurants, new and old this matter was always looked up with great priority but then like the original Gabbar never had a heart so it was the same with all at the Gabbar's.

They were so over confused with so much of crowd that they forgot to give us Molecular Gastronomy which they say on Facebook that they serve before the meal. We had seen the page hence we demanded and they got it for us. Thats the use of having know how of things. Whatever be it Molecular Gastronomy was a great and unique thing which you will want to have again and again. Such a fresh lime feeling it had. Simply blows off your mind. Must try. If they do not serve you ask for it.

We ordered starters Nachos and babycorn and something of paneer. We did not like them. Not upto the mark. Then we ordered the main course. We did not like them either. Very below average and sub-standard. not what normally it should be, leave apart our expectations.

We wanted Thums up they said no but then after sometime we saw them serving the same to other tables. We complained about various things along with the couch one and the thumbs up on but the manager just listened and tried to do nothing. Why would he? His restaurant was full till the end of day. Why would he at all care? That's business and thats how things run in this world for new places and startups.'

Finally we ordered a new name dessert thing Hararo Khwaishien Aisi which was actually termed right seeing our condition. We had hazaro Khwaishien for the evening dinner but all was ruined with such average food that we really wanted something to make our taste buds right in place. And this did. It was a blend and mix of chocolate mudpie, vanilla ice and oreo soil. All this made up to the great dessert which you will simply die for. We all loved it.

The service was slow and that was obvious. The waiters and servers were all shabby and worn out and hell tired and ultimately confused. Not upto the mark at all. The cost is also not reasonable for the type they serve. Customers are not the first priority leave apart thinking about their comfort and wishes. Not everyone can do that you know.

This is the lowest ever rating I have ever given to any restaurant. It has scored half because of the amazing things in the start and at the end. And some for the decor too.

You can visit it once but not at all recommended by me when you have some expectations. Go there because it is new and to enjoy the various unique drinks and desserts. Rest nothing else is good. You can miss this. There are a lot of other restaurants in Kolkata to try.

I don't rate usually. But this place is so overrated and bad it has compelled me to warn fellow foodies. In short the food is average. The trademark dishes are good but mostly gimmicky. The ambience is absymal. The service is a huge let down. And the prices are the only thing high in this place.

I'll give 1.5/3 for food. 0/1 for VFM and 0/.5 for ambiance and service quality.

Putting it in categories:

1. Food - the food is most average. The tex mex food at erstwhile Amigo's was quite good and they continue to have that menu as well. Amongst the new introductions I tried only the Indian menu and it was quite disappointing. Some starters are good but most of it looks gimmicky. The main course is average and doesn't stand out in any way.

2. Ambience - this was the most disappointing part. This place is loud. By loud I mean an echo chamber. They Should really get someone re do their acoustics. The noise of people talking clubbed with their incessant and loud Bollywood music (a poor attempt at getting close to their theme of Bollywood) is torture. Even the place looks a little shabby and unkempt. The erstwhile Amigos was well themed and had a more upscale look. This place already looks fatigued and theming looks like patchwork on a small budget.

3. Service - The waiters seem confused and probably disinterested. And it's not like they have dozens of tables to serve. The waiter to tables ratio actually looks quite high. But to no avail. The service is slow. They need to be asked repeatedly to serve the food they bring. And they don't have a proper system of table management in place yet.

4. VFM / Price - don't go by the Zomatos per head guess. Easily expect this place to cost you 800-1000 bucks a head without alcohol. Probably the least VFM place I've visited recently. It's very expensive especially taking in to consideration what you're getting for it.

We had Chocolate Golmaal (read heaven made of chocolate), Phil Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani ( Nolen Gur ice cream), and Chai Biscoot ( tea flavored ice cream between parle g).. Sugar rush anyone?

I am so happy with this place that I have been there back-to-back for three weekends. There is hardly any place in Cal which gives this type of fun, free-wheeling atmosphere much like Cafe Mondegar in Bombay. You are welcomed into Posters of blockbusters of the 70's think Sholay and Kalia. Next to that is the Gab-BAR! They really make a great cocktails. Not to miss is the Lambi Race ka Ghoda- a great concoction of every spirit you love.
We were 2 vegetarians and 3 non-veg. I had done my research and ordered dishes recommended by the top food bloggers of Cal. Pls try the Papdi Chat and Veg platter. The Gabbar ki Ma ki Dal was superb! I thoroughly enjoyed Omar's Chicken and the Mogambo Khush Hua Platter of N-Veg kebabs. I loved the quirky detailing with 'pani' embossed on glasses, chutney served in mimi pressure cookers we played with as a child, lovely famous one-liners on the wall across. All in all Great food, good service, terribly packed on weekends so reserve in adavance!

New place in town. As the name suggests it's based on Bollywood characters where you find pictures of different actors and their famous dialogues movies. Ambience is some what different then normal other places. Their presentations of certain drinks and dishes is something to look for. Food is good and has good variety. They have good options in cocktails. Service is average. Weekend is bit too packed.

I had the pleasure of visiting Gabbar's as a part of Kolkata Food Fanatics, which ensured awesome food and company, both at the same time. I ordered the lambe race ka Ghoda (extra large LIT) as my poison, and tasted a million other appetizers and main courses, the names of all of which O don't even recall now. But the ones I absolutely loved still remain with me. These have to be - the fish kebabs, the pav Bhaji, the bread platter, and the jhinga malaikari. In word, these were IMPECCABLE. I loved the idea of the chai biscoot ice cream and the pan served at the end of of the meal. But if you ask me what I LOVE about the place, and have already been gaga over, it has to be the ambience and the lambe race ka Ghoda. When they were renaming the menu, the one who thought about the cocktail name definitely meant it  by each and every word! The perky atmosphere obviously adds on, and I am waiting for the day Harsh decides to come with his own brand of gabbar's accessories!!! :D

After my second visit I'm likely to change my opinion. This one was a full blown North Indian affair and neither did the starters nor the main course disappointed. Don't remember the dishes but the taste still remains in the mouth. Let's see what the third visit holds for me.

 the name sets quite a few expectations given how "scandalous" and "iconic" it is but apart from a caricature of the real gabbar on one of the walls and "pani" written in hindi on glasses, nothing justified the choice.
Coming to the business end, ordered American corn, nachos and Mexican garlic bread. Apart from the corn the other items were quite ordinary with the dips for nachos being especially poor in taste. 
Ordered manchurian and fried rice with the manchurian being quite tasteless. They didn't have pizza on a saturday evening when the crowd is supposed to be at its peak.
Less then ordinary food at exorbitant prices. 
At restaurant working times, a guy with cartons of liquor on his shoulder was walking past us, stacking them up in the possible store room. Not a good sight for diners, something that could have been managed at better hours before guests came in. 
Unlikely to come again and not recommended.

Celebrated my wife's bday at Gabbar . our first time here......had to wait ... Its natural on a weekend but the wait was justified.... Tried both Indian n Chinese cuisine ....both were fabulous. They don't boast a long list of items on the menu but wot ever they do they r real good in it. Qudos to the chef. The chicken tikaa was very well marinated n cooked to perfection. Dum murg was a different taste in itself n the burnt ginger fried rice leaves a fantastic aroma in your mouth. N above all they served complementary dessert ...five star to gabbar ....

We waited for long because we knew it would be worth it. And it was. Nothing works better than bollywood classic movies /dialogues and yumm food to munch on. Food is pretty to look at and delicious to eat. Ashok our server helped all the way to make the correct choices. DIY PAPAD , pav bhaji fondue ,dal chawal arancini are a must. Galouti and Mexican garlic Bread were a bit disappointing!!but gabbar ki Maa ki dal , olive chilli naan brought Gabbar back to our good graces!!
Dessert presentation again only suggests what great a dessert were to follow.
Mud Pie in a pot , Bikimax got a spohisticated sister with masala ice cream sandwich with Parle -G biscuits and all the theatre of dry ice!!! Worth it!!

Gabbar's is a fun place to be - from quirky decor to the smartly designed interiors, there is a chilled out vibe to this place, and one gulp of my Kala Khatta Margarita was enough for me to start wishing for more alcohol. After a Lambi Race ka Ghoda, I was slightly floored, and tripping on the inverted Vada Paos. There's plenty to explore in the menu - the non-vegetarian dishes score higher in my ratings though. They also make a rather excellent Warqi Paratha, and I loved the Chai Biskoot for dessert, as well as the Hazaron Khwahishein Aisi, where I wished for more ice cream though. It might have been the drinks talking by then.

Went for family lunch on a sunday afternoon with solid expectations but alas !!
Full marks for ambience and service but food was just average. Except for a thing or two none of the dishes appealed to our tastebuds leaving us heavily disappointed.
A big NO for the north indian cuisine because it is simply gross. The breads were all dried and stiff whereas the vegetables and curries tasted alike. The chinese and mexican starters were just decent and eatable.
The only classic and delicious item of the food menu was Celantro Veggies which saved our lunch after the horrifying north indian main course. Lastly, one thing which you all need to try if u happen to visit Gabbar's is the Mirchi Mar Ke Mojito. It is simply amazing but recommended only for mirchi lovers.

Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen is an gastronomic delight. The routine stuff that we have been having since childhood gets a new life... the masterchef type. The twists that they give to a Pav Bhaji or a Papri Chat is beyond imagination. You have to experience it first hand. And Royd made our experience special by recommending the best of their lot. I can't wait to come back to Gabbar's.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the refreshing and cool ambience. The place offers a fresh approach on traditional dishes in Calcutta. Some of the dishes which I liked here were a ripoff from a few of my fav restaurants in Mumbai. But I would recommend the inverted vada pav, pavbhaji fondue and the beer sangria.

Wanted to visit gabbar's badly. Finally got time. Ordered for chinese starters (lAt me kai)  and we went 4 the same old amigos type main course! Spaghetti and chipotle chicken! I liked the fact that though they only had spaghetti aglio olio they made arabiatta on our request! The food was good enough! The lambi race ka ghora was too lamba 4 the two of us. And the chai biskoooot and hazaro khwaishe aisi was delicious. Good ambience. Good food. Unique presentarion.

Interesting decor and theme that they have going on. But it just seems like they've extended Amigos to include other cuisines and just jazzed up the place a bit. The names are funny and interesting. Though hats off to certain dishes on the menu like the chai biskoot dessert and some of the molecular gastronomy items(though these were not clearly pointed out in the menu). Also. Nice take on the fondue pav bhaji.

Gabbar's. Couldn't spend a long time here to comment much about it, but for the time I spent, it was great. It was a national holiday so obviously crises, but somehow it didn't feel so, thanks to the quick service here. Too many options to choose for. You'll surely get confused as to what to order and what not. Too many cuisines to try out. Needs more than a visit to completely say anything about it. Mocktail and desserts were tempting and amazing. Can't forget the taste of the mocktail. Was so engrossed that don't remember it's name.. Something La Paris Affair. 
Can't wait to visit again

Went to Gabbar's 4 Mondays back and the place was entirely empty. Not wanting to drink ina a dead place, we gave it a pass.

One month down the line, yesterday night, we had to wait outside for our turn! Didnt expect it would pickup this fast.

Its located in HCM Saraini opposite the US consulate and the best relief is the parking space. As you enter, you're greeted by yesteryears' Bachchan movie posters. The Bollywood theme has been nicely done throughout the place.

Had Lambi Race Ka Ghoda which was 2 LIITs in one loooong thin beaker with a long pipe to sip it from which can be a little tricky the first couple of sips. Then you learn how to handle it.

If the appetizers were good, the Chinese main course was amazing. Chai Biskoot, one of the dessert options, was had a dramatic presentation but wasn't something extraordinary: tea flavored icecream sandwich with Parle G biscuits.

The place was full of families having a noisy-ish dinner. Kids roaming everywhere across tables stacked by pretty close. So, its not really a party place per se but it has a vibe of its own.

Gabbar's is most definitely one of the cooler looking restaurants I have been to. Pretty popular too, I take it; was surprised at having to wait for a table at 10:30pm! We were ravenous party and ordered a bunch of stuff (we stuck to Indian). DIY papad, dal chawal arancini, lasooni palak - loved it all. I wasn't a fan of the taftan, finding it too sweet to be a main course bread. The desserts were delightful. Its base was dry but do not miss the chocolate mudpie. The chai biskoot had a nice cinnamony flavor. And who doesn't love rabri/shahi tukda! Special mention to the innovation on offer. It's rare especially when fairly well done. Slight dampener was our waiter who kept reminding us of the time one too many times (eventually we were well on our way before closing time).¬†

All in all, this was good fun.

we a group of 4 couple decided to go there for a dinner

Since it was sunday expectedly the restaurant was fully occupied.. luckily we got the table as we went their a bit early..

The worst thing about this restaurant are their waiters. They never looked trained and roaming here and there without having any clue how to serve the guests.There were no condiments served complimentary with the drinks.They did not even served water with the foods.. We had to ask twice thrice for the same...
No mouthfreshners at all after paying the bill...

Food quality and taste was OK. Ambience was also OK type.

A very bad experience at Gabbar's.

Far over priced and over hyped. A can of Pepsi is Rs. 125.00. From this you can approximate how expensive it is. An OKAY ambience, nothing great. Quality of food is OKAY, but when you compare the quantity, it is like they are favouring us by serving and not vise-versa. We asked for a basket of roasted papad at the end, we got the same BUT it had "hair" stuck in it. Twice it happened.¬†

Calcutta has far better restaurant than this over-priced and over-hyped one. Seriously, I am not considering going their again.

A very poor experience.

I have had mixed experiences at Gabbar's.

First thing first, the place looks fab! A changed look from that of Amigos. And the best thing about them is how they present their food. Nothing can beat that!

While after my first visit I would have rated it around 4.5, the second visit made me change my mind a bit.

It's always a good sign if a restaurant is packed. That reinstates the faith that it won't be bad. But that's also worry for the restaurant management, coz that means they need to be extremely careful about their efforts - food & service. And on my second visit, it was the service that was a problem.

The waiters were lost and extremely busy with dealing so many guests, that at times we needed to wait for long to draw their attention. That might also be the reason why we got cold rotis!!

Now coming to the food, some items are excellent, Gabbar ki Maa ki Daal, etc. The cocktails are a killer! Some are good and not something extraordinary. Good to see that the taste of their old Mexican dishes have remained the same, else it would have been really sad for a once-Amigos-fan.

Suggestion: The service team needs to be really alert and well-trained, and this is where Gabbar's is lacking even when compared to its ownself which was called Amigos.

Gabbar, the dacoit, was a loud mouthed, boorish, dirty, grizzled and ferocious! 
Gabbar, the bar and kitchen, is boisterous, stylish, brightly lit, clean, new kid off the block in Kolkata, albeit taking a few cues from another film theme based restaurant in the city. 
Now that we know Gabbar, the beast of a dacoit, probably has no role to play in managing this bar and kitchen, we realise the reason for the board that hangs on one of wall inside which says, among many other things-" No spitting, No poking nose and no belching!
At the outset, thanks is due to Gabbar for bringing molecular gastronomy to Kolkata. Not sure whether there are others in Kolkata who provide such food. The presentation of the ubiquitous chaat that we had ordered, was a visual delight what with the colours splashed and sprayed on the plate at Chef's will. In terms of taste the dish tasted same as it would if prepared by the vendors at Vivekananda park! The concept of serving the mohito drink shrinking it to fit and be served by the spoonful was however, quite a revelation. When the globule of semi liquid drink burst as soon as it came in contact with the tongue, my eyes almost popped out-both in amazement as well as owing to the fact that I nearly choked on the liquid let loose all of a sudden inside the mouth.  
As if this was not enough to surprise, the dish named ulta pao arrived- looking like cricket balls that had been painted brown instead of red and served with a green chilli at the top. Reminded me of the bread pakora, only that there was just that sliver of a piece inside, the rest being all potato. 
Gabbar is cool, the walls inside are adorned with caricatures and catchy dialogues from the films, as if Gabbar the dacoit had made an attempt to keep himself engaged during his spare time and had engaged in some wall painting activity. I loved the overall ambiance of the place and had an enjoyable evening, thanks to the presence of our good friends who had hosted us that evening. The mud pie served in an earthen flower pot at the end of the meal was also very unique and added to the happiness quotient. 
As I was leaving, there was just that wee bit of thought that kept nagging my mind like a piece of meat stuck between the teeth. Would it have added to the overall ambiance if the servers had been dressed in green and with bandoliers strung across their torso, instead of black?

Did not have the best of experiences here on our first visit. We were made to wait for over an hour on the premise that it would take twenty minutes. When seated, the staff was on the verge of being rude. They looked hassled. The food, completely vegetarian by choice, was bland and lacked flavour that would merit a second visit. The breads were served way after the vegetables and we were left playing catch up. The only redeeming feature was the ambience and decor, which you would appreciate only if you were a die hard Bollywood fan.

Gabbars comes like a breath of fresh air . I love quirky places and this was just needed in this city . Catchy graphics and off beat presentations both perfect . Good use of innovation as well.

I simply loved the kebabs . And the DIY Masala papad was awesome . The cocktails are quite whacky . Especially the margaritas that come with an ice lolly in them

The inverted wada paw is a must try too. The gabbar ki maa ki daal is delicious as is the kadai paneer. Non veg mains could have been better.

I did not wait for dessert but I'm hearing good things about them.

If you are here do take a khalnayak selfie

Cheers !!!

It was my first time with a car in that american consulate restricted area, was a bit nervous..
The restaurant has a dedicated parking area. The name brings in a curiosity and doubt about what the restaurant serves. On my visit i found that a wall graffiti on bollywood tags & quotes is the only reason for its name.
I found few irritating things at the restaurant
1- smoke from the oven kept open
2- dripping water from Ac vent on your food
3- confused restaurant staff, a bit unorganized
It is a multi cuisine restaurant serving Indian, Chinese, Mexkcan, Italian.
We only tried the Italian.. And it was decent..

The erstwhile Amigos returns as Gabbar. And I  must say that they are back with a bang. First of all a big thank you by remaining open on a bandh day and providing us a reason to cheer something about. The topping of course is the brand new bar menu which we were missing at amigos. Everything we ordered was good right from the soup, the starters viz. Nachos Fiesta and potato skins were specially noteworthy. Same with the main course. As far as desserts are concerned I have never had anything like chai biskoot. Superb.

Now this is a place which actually serves modern food.. The modern presentation of  the quick bites makes it intruigiung and always leaves u wanting for more.  The Inverted Vada Pav ans the Paw Bhaji Fondue is a very smart creation and scores a 10 on their presentation. The Main course lives upto its expectations but the dessert throws the ball out of the park. Be it the chai biscuit or the hazaron khawishein aisi, all are presented  with a modern twist which makes it all the more appealing.. Your love for basic things you eat every day has been presented to you in a silver platter. Overall the experience is lovely and i would come back for more again....

This bollywood-themed restaurant is situated in a lane right opposite to Camac Square. In tune with the theme, here you framed photographs of your favourite bolly actors and actresses hung on the walls, including your heroes and heroines from the 80s. On one particular wall you have these quirky caricatures and age-old famous bollywood sayings and your favourite dialogues from your favourite evergreen movies, that will make you helplessly nostalgic. Even the menu does justice to the theme, names of dishes such as Mocambo khush hua, Gabbar ki Ma ki dal, Phunsuk Wangdu's sizzling chicken and Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi will make you wonder what a lot of thought has been put into planning all these!! We started off with Chicken Manchow Soup, Lat me Kai and Chicken Taco crunch. Their chinese cuisine is as good as their mexican ( I couldnt try out their Indian cuisine!! ). Our main course consisted of ginger capsicum fried rice, Phunsuk Wangdu's sizzling chicken and Texas Fajitas. The sizzling chicken was top-notch and the fajitas served with cilantro rice was another winner. Now coming to the desserts, the Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi is a must-try, it resembles a potted plant (mint) but the 'soil' is actually the best chocolate mud pie I have ever tasted in my life. Full points for the innovative presentation and lip-smacking finger-licking taste. I also loved the chocolate darsaan. However, I was not really satisfied with the service. The waiters are very lazy and reluctant, I had to constantly call for them to refill our glasses and I swear one of them was grumbling, also they mixed up our orders and initially served us veg fajitas instead of chicken fajitas. Otherwise, both the food and the ambience are perfect, they have a playlist alternating between bollywood oldies, some soothing and foot-tapping groovy tracks and Coldplay(that was a pleasant surprise) !! The pocket pinch was 3335 bucks for 4. Looking forward to trying out the Indian cuisine next time! Keep up the good work!

Well! Well! Well! The first thing which caught my eyes when I was scrolling through zomato's "trending this week" section was Gabbar's Bar & Kitchen, their eye catching presentation was something I wanted to check right away! 
This place is pretty easy to locate, right beside ICCR in Ho Chi Min Sarani, opposite to American visa office! 
It's a fun place alright! Old film posters adorn the wall, the theme is Bollywood starting from an evening to Paris poster to a portrait of alia Bhatt they have it all! 
The menu and the names of the dishes are quirky and fun. 
We ordered for a Papdi Chaat, Gabbar Ki Ma Ki Dal ( Dal Makhani ) one butter nun and spaghetti Aglio olio. 
The Papdi chat had a creative presentation and the taste was tangy and full of interesting flavours. They had small curd balls which bursts in your mouth like small balloons! It's a carnival of innovative taste inside your mouth alright!
The Dal Makhani was rich (as it should be ) , creamy and had a nice texture- one of the best dals I have ever had in Kolkata, butter nun was good too! The spaghetti was amazing! Just the right amount of seasoning! 
If you ever come to this place please keep ample space for desserts! They have a good variety of desserts and the presentation is awesome! We ordered for a dessert called "Hazaro Khawashein Aisi" and "Chai Biscuit". Chai biscuit was just about okay, simple use of Parle G biscuits filled with elaichi chai flavoured ice cream ( not quite to my liking ) but the Hazaro Khawashein Aisi dessert was mouth watering, rich creamy chocolate cake topped with vanilla ice cream and oodles of crunchy oreos- this one is a MUST TRY dessert! 

The ambience is young and peppy, they do play some terrible music ( Irritation Overdrive ) and the waiters are slow and clueless! You have to remind them constantly to bring you paper napkins, to take your order, to bring your bill. In fact the person who was serving us, brought us some other table's bill, which I paid without checking it at first, but then good sense prevailed and I told them about their mistake! The person did not apologise just took the extra cash and scooted away. The only bad thing about this place is of course their STAFF, supremely slow ( not in serving food, but attitude wise ) they have an irritated and lazy look pasted on their faces and they serve people mechanically, which is a huge turn off (whatever happened to good old hospitality?! ) will also have to mention how bad the music was, but I guess if the food is this good I don't mind bringing my iPod along! Highly recommended! But as I said don't expect much from the staff, they have the attention span of a three year old.

The new molecular food introduction at gabbars is a must try..esp the paper chat and the inside out vada paw...the service has improved remarkably..we were done with all the courses within 1 hour..the alternative crockery is fun and the location is great. U get parking inside the premises..definitely a must go ..

One word, brilliant. A fun and lively ambience for the bollywood lovers. The food menu is crafted so intelligently. Talking about the food, it is  very good. We tried the regular crispy chilli babycorn and a Bachchan saab kebab platter, which had pieces of panner tikka, potato tikka, mushroom and seek kebab. For main course we tried chimichangas which was fried tortilla wraps with yogurt dip, mango dip and bean dip. This was something very new i tried. For desserts we tried chai biscoot, that was chai flavored icecram betwwen sheets of parle-g biscuits, and hazaaron khwaishein aisi that is chocolate mudpie with vanilla icecream and orea crumbs. The presentation of the desserts deserves a special mention. The service is fast and the staff is humble. Overall a superb experience.

Gabbar is located near to American embassy, Russel street. Had a lovely experience here. Food was fantabulous. Service was fast. Staffs were cordial and friendly. If u just enter it just seems that you are entering to film city. It has different types of cuisine. Ambience is great. It is newly opened. If you review on zomato your dessert would be free here, but the offer stands only for today. Worth visiting.
Was impressed by its complimentary molecular pan, it was just awesome, all must try. 

Cheers!

I was a little apprehensive when this place changed from Amigos to Gabbar's, especially because in Amigos I found the best Mexican in the city in a moderate budget. So as I stepped in the newly themed decor really pleased the senses. There is a great sense of humor with which everything has been designed. The owner takes active interest in the place as he moves around tables asking for suggestions; which is surely a bonus. Coming to the food, we had a mix of kebabs as appetisers  (mixed non veg platter and galauti kebabs) -- not an iota of complaint about the melt in the mouth kebabs. For the main course however we resorted to our old Mexican favourite the Chicken Fajitas. The owner suggested the desserts for us -- golmaal and mumbai meri jaan -- there is twist in both of them, and they are both sinful. We are planning to visit again soon!

Awesome sauce! The ambience and the menu is oh-so-filmy. We had fun trying everything that Mr Gabbar recommended - starting with the pav bhaji fondue, followed by galoti kebab with chutney served in a miniature pressure cooker. Our hazaron khwahishhe were fulfilled with a large serving of the oreo mud pie that was served in a flower pot! Topped it off with Parsi kulfi from Aamchi Mumbai. Gabbar's is a must visit if you love experimenting with your food and of course love bollywood! However, the prices are on the higher side which is why they rightly give you the bill placed inside a box with '#DAMAGE' written on top of it üòâ

Absolutely loved the experience in GABBARS , starting from the strawberry margaritas and orange margarita,continuing with amuse-bouche which was a totally surprise to ones mouth, the frozen kala khatta which get ones nostalgic and the mirchi maar ke as expected 'spicy', to the food the pav bhaji fondue which was soo soft, the nachos which was very well baked. In total the experience was really really delicious. 
Ending up with the dessert which was very well presented and tasted equally good. Must try GABBARS.

Amazed that a restaurant can have such audacity of behaviour. We went on a wed evening, empty place. We are first made  to sit on a table for four. Its hardly a few sec and a really rude staff comes upto us and with absent sense of politeness says-do u have a reservation. We denied so he points at a table at the corner and says you wil 'have' to sit there then. The tone was near hostile. They have pizza in the menu but they dont serve anymore. When asked for the speciality the waiter says aap soch lijiye fir bulaiye.
We order for drums of heaven with a beer cocktail and an LIIT. And thr version of shahi tukda. Yuck is all i can say. Fried insect with drums of heaven, oily shahu tukda.
D 1 point is only coz cant rate lower here in zomato
Noway going back to this place

Starting about the good things abt this place i wud say i would recommend Gabbars only bcoz of its art of presenting Food. So the credit of its popularity goes to the Chef only. If i come to point the hospitality i would say its the worst i hv cm accross. Me n my 4 frens visited thr on 25th aug 15 for dinner. Mind it its a wkday n not that rushy. We got the worst behaviour ever. The staffs r not at all friendly and we were so disgusted by thr delay in service that we had to atlast write our wants on a tissue paper and give to them!!!
To add more the very worst thing was that thr dis respect towards woman. Can u imagine eve teasing at a hi class restaurant. Yes it was done by a staff wen we got up to leave one of the staff ensured that he desirably push us and get a chance to touch. When the incident was reported to the manager what he gave us in return was a SORRY Mam!!!
Disgusting ppl. DISGUSTING SERVICE.
one may say Gabbar is good for food but its just the credit to the Chef. So its just the chef that shud b appreciated. Otherwise these ppl sucks!!!
Gals nvr plan to go alone here. U nvr knw wt cud happen!!!

This is a fresh take on fresh food. 

For creative Indian food it is your only option in the city. 
Ask for there Mexican menu too if you feel like mixing it up. They have a very elaborate one and do them well.

What I recommend for sure is there deserts. Once you see the waiter carrying a flower put towards you you will understand what I meant about the creative Indian bit.

Bon meal:-)

Visited this restaurant a couple of days ago for a quick lunch. But sadly it turned out to be anything but quick. Really disappointed with the service. Had to call waiter thrice to place my order and then food came at its equally slow pace. Being a weekday they said they were under staffed :(
Didnt try much dishes. Had pao bhaji fondue which i enjoyed having. Garlic bread was also nyce but quisedellas were very average. 
Liked t wall graphitti and the bar area. 
While still go one more tym as want to try their other dishes. But I seriously hope the ervice standards improve

Dessert: The Chocolate Mudpie was presented fantastically and was delicious. (Also the Chai Biscuit)
The service is very good and a very friendly atmosphere.
Ambience is also pretty good.

The first attraction was the name...and true to it, the place offered a quirky fun ambience with food being the surprise. Though we started dining with the conventional items like kebabs etc., we thought the place has more to offer. So while discussing a few things with the key person behind the restaurant we explored molecular gastronomy. A completely new experience in food for people in Kolkata and is a must try. The explosion of flavours with the bubbled up mojito with foam was a revelation so was the Parsi dairy kulfi served on dry ice. Would recommend the place to friends and definitely go back for newer experiences. Good luck and cheers to the team!

It was a good experience at Gabbar's . The ambience there is pure Bollywood with pictures of Bollywood stars on the walls.Also there is Bollywood graffiti. The food experience was mixed....some items were really good while others were ok. The starters...Chinese salad and American pepper corn were good.Tacos were excellent served with tasty salsa and sour cream. The skin potatoes were average as was the spaghetti. But the dessert was just wow! We were surprised when a potted plant was placed on our table and amazingly we were expected to dig into the soil with our spoons! This was our desert....Mud Pie....heavenly and yummy. Overall a good experience. I think I'll go back to try some of their signature dishes like fondue pao bhaji,inverted vada pao,papri chat and other desserts....which I didn't have this time.

Think "Gabbar" and you instantly start envisioning characters and dialogues from the film "Ramgarh ke Sholay".¬† It is this curiosity to come face to face with the Bollywood Swag that leads one to "Gabbar's Bar and Kitchen.
Previously known as Amigos Tex Mex, it's ironic how my Valentines Day tryst at Amigos transformed into a villainous avatar like Gabbar, pretty much like my relationship status. Twist of Fate I suppose. Then again the awesome experience made up for everything else.

Gabbar's reeks anything and everything Bollywood so if you detest the genre, bad luck because it's right on your face. From old film posters, coasters, graffiti, hec even the item names on the menu is B.-O-L-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D.

That doesn't stop there. The presentation is as quirky and as shamelessly "Nautanki", be it their Mojito and "Paani" inscribed glasses or their brownie served like mud in a flowerpot (It's called "Hazaaron Khwahishein Aisi" by the way!)

Coming to their food, their starters like Daal Chawal Arcini is a must try. It's basically a typical Dal Chawal stuffing in a crispy fried ball! Yes it's true! As a part of the food blogger's group, we were catered to a set menu that comprised of Gabbar Ki Ma Ki Dal (the name more unusual than the taste), Aloo-do-piyaza and Kadhai Paneer. However in terms of taste, it could honestly work up on their flavour pallet for the same didn't seem anything out of the ordinary. Food should not just be eye candy but soul touching is what I believe. The Omar Khayyam Chicken¬† and The Jhinga Malai curry were the saving graces, not to mention their exquisite array of bread baskets.

Desserts like "Chai Biscuit" reminds you of the "Biki Max" days in school, but the consumption leaves a messy affair so keep that table cloth handy.

All in all, not to praise such a wonderful establishment would be "Bahut naainsaafi" on my part!

We visit the new avatar of Amigos some weeks ago, as part of our foodie group KFF. We were treated to a rather lavish and generous range of goodies.

The place has ample and easy parking on the compound. Upon entering the thankfully not-too-loud interiors, I was intrigued by the very unusual incandescent bulbs used to light up the places. The walls were adorned with mostly Bollywood graffiti. The seating was comfortable and the mood soft!

Started with the Lambi Race Ka Ghoda, one of their speciality drinks. The rather large tumbler (more like a gigantic test tube) proved difficult to handle for me and I did manage to spill a bit. The taste was not to my personal preference, but was generally liked by most.

Various starters were served. The Dal Chawal Arancini was surprisingly not bad at all (something I would not have ordered :) The Pau Bhaji Fondue was nothing special really. I preferred the Vada Pav and more so the Papri Chaat withj the curd globules. They were a real nice surprise, especially when the curd melted in the mouth with an unexpected flavour. The chicken tikka found more favour, being non-vegetarian :). Even better was the Fish Ajwaini.. well seasoned and flavourful.

The mains comprised of Gabbar Ki Ma Ki Dal (the name more unusual than the taste), Aloo-do-piyaza and Kadhai Paneer. They latter two were as expected. The Omar Khayyam Chicken was perhaps the king here with its more developed taste. The Jhinga Malai curry was not terribly Bengali.

Dessert was in the form of their speciality Chai Biskoot... essentially Glucose biscuit sandwich with chai flavoured icecream filling. Innovate for sure, but one needs to consume immediately as it tends to start melting the moment you set your eyes on it. The Hazaron Khwaishain Aisi was a mudpie that resembled a potted plant, but was mediocre on taste... perhaps not gooey enough.

The plating is rather interesting, with most items served rather innovatively. Cannot comment on the service as we did not visit as regular customers. Keep it up Gabbar, and keep innovating.

Went to Gabbar's last week and were hosting my parents friends. We had booked the PDR which seated 20 of us comfortably. The service was prompt and waiters were attentive. We filled ourselves with innumerable starters and skipped the main course. The papdi chaat and paneer tikka were really good. The wanton too was delicious. Orange mojitos pitchers in both the cocktail and mocktail versions were worth the price. All in all it was a great experience and people were delighted and amused. The desserts and the pan didn't fail either and continued surprising us. Hazaaron khwashein aisi is a must have among desserts.

Amigos renovated to form Gabbar's!
The ambience Is fine..not that they could do much to spruce up the old restaurant look except for few eye catching graffiti! A problem caused due to their less space ! Their seating arrangement seemed very compact with more number of chairs than it could accommodate! We were a group of 12 and even on a weekday it caused them trouble to create a relaxed dinner table for a large group despite the pre ~ reservation! 
We did have troubles as we were crammed in a corner finding it difficult to dine comfortably!
Coming to food.. We ordered Pav bhaji fondue which was served in obviously the fondue style n therefore different..otherwise it's jus the usual Pav bhaji with smaller buns to be dipped into bhaji.
Dahi kebab n paneer tikka were nice. Mexican cheese Garlic bread was pretty good! I therefore recommend it! 
Mocktails I tried were lime n orange mojito which were lil extra tangy coz it lacked the right amount of sugar syrup! Had to call for extra sugar syrup n remake it !
For main course we had North Indian.
Gabbar ki maa ki daal , paneer butter masala , 
Jhaal farezi tarkaari n pindi chana which were nice . But daal was the dish which was perfect!
Chilli cheese olive naan was pretty nice! 
One disappointment was that they couldn't serve any of their pizzas listed in their menu as they said  they were unavailable!
The staff too seemed to be very confused and were inefficient to handle large groups due to which they had to be given repeated instructions till they could get an order to the table! 
Overall Gabbar's has been an average experience after all the over hype about this place :-/

I seriously don't know what all the hype for this place is about.  Yes they serve some good food and drinks but so do many other places in town !

The first and foremost rule of opening a restaurant is knowing how to treat your customers. Its called hospitality industry for a reason - you need to be hospitable. The staff here is borderline rude and undertrained. 

The place is located near metro plaza and is difficult to miss. The theme of the place is obviously bollywood and the interiors are well done. 

In drinks we ordered for the lambi race ka ghoda which is essentially 500 ml of liit. The taste of good though it could have been a little stronger. We had also ordered for a margarita which was supposed to be served with an ice lolly which they did not give. After complaining about the same they took the drink back and alternatively we ordered for the beer sangria. It was good.

In food we ordered for chipotle chicken which tasted good. It should have been a little more spicy as it tasted quite bland and i expect mexican food to be spicy.

Their service was slow and they took so much time to get the food drinks and the bill to the table. 

The bill was about 3000 which is again on the higher side.

Not visiting the place anytime soon and i would recommend you to steer clear as well if you dont want to be treated as if you arent paying for the but they are doing you a favour !!

Visited the restaurant today with friends. It is a very suitably located place with adequate parking space which is very difficult to find in this area. The restaurant interiors are really nice.
Coming to the food, we ordered three starters. Pav bhaji fondue, kebab platter and dal chawal aranchini. Pav bhaji fondue is just simple pav bhaji I don't know why it is has been so highly spoken of by others. The kebab platter and aranchini were good. (A must try)
We ordered Indian in our main course. We ordered lasooni palak, mix jhall frezi and gabbar ki dal with a lot of breads. The main course was good, but it wasn't great. Everything about the main course was just good but not anything which would make you come back.
The prices are as per zomato estimates. Overall it's a nice place, but trust me instead of their pav bhaji fondue try the agarwal's pav bhaji near vardaan.

Worst restaurant ever. Just overhyped fr the concept. Not worth the price at all. Arrogant staff. Won't be visiting again ever. Food is not at all edible.

We had gone to Gabbar's on Sunday, 16.08.205, at 12:55pm, I had called on Saturday, 15.08.2015 to make a booking , we were told that they don't take booking on Saturday and Sunday, we were 6 of us, 3 people were coming a bit later , so the manager Mr. Ketan said we can't give you the seat till the time 6 people are not there as we can't block the table. Neither the tables were occupied, when I asked if I could speak to the owner , he plainly refused saying I can't give the owners number neither I can make him speak... Is this hospitality we are talking about??? There were 4 people who entered they had booking for 1pm, then I just asked the manager how come you taking bookings??? When you told me we don't take bookings..... Anyways this is the last time I am visiting such a restaurant which has such a hospitality..... Amazing !!!!! Can restaurants afford to give this kind of service?

Best part is owner himself said that on weekends they don't take bookings when I confronted him that Infront of me there were four people who came and said they had booking, he was like ya they must have booked 3-4 days back , I said even I called 4 days back also to find they take booking or not, and I was told in weekends it's walk-in (first come first)?? How come dual words by the manager and the owner ???

The place rates high on hospitality. The theme and the ambience is good with lovely music. The food is good but misses the wow factor. However their mocktails are pretty godod.

The food was absolutely smashing, fresh and super delicious . Each and every starter had its own distinct taste and the accompanying achari Mayo added the extra zing. A meal at Gabbar is incomplete without tasting their fantabulous desserts ... The chai biscuit literally sang of tea and left our taste buds wanting more ... A sure shot pleaser for tea lovers....the gol mal awed us with the spherical chocolate bomb melting when we poured the hot chocolate and the best thing was the Mudpie the hazaron khwaishaein aise was the best thing I've ever had . The desert was heavenly . An absolutely brilliant restraunte and a must try definitely !

Refreshing is the word that popped into mah head moment i stepped in-in terms of ambience food they serve and most importantly drinks they serve..papdi chat with foam chutneys and frozen yoghurt ball-molecular gastronomy was good but papdis sized to big for you to pop them in your mouth to burst yoghurt..
We also tried their kebab platter delicious classic..for mains we went to mexican territory with chimichanga-good just mind that tortillas are fried..mongolian noodles were good too..place has yummy cocktails, i wld love to try more..i m a dessert person and live to try something new everytime and this time it was parleg biscuits with masala chai icecream served dramatically with smoke-parleg makes it too sweet,icecream yumm yumm..

I visited this restro with a high hope...cause  I have heard off a series of appraisal before I visit this one...so oneday I landed up into it...what I got...utter disappointment...first if all they have said at 3o clock they won't able to serve Indian dishes...so I have to choose some Chinese dishes and I choose one of the safest dish drumstick...its not at all juicy its even worse than roadside restro...
Ambience: good with a essence of contemporary and old charm of Bollywood cinema...
Reception: good
Food: utter disappointment
Price: a bit high
Still I will say trust others and visit this one..

When I first saw the sign of Gabbar‚Äôs on one of my regular visits to Jyoti Vihar I wondered with a name like Gabbar‚Äôs would I ever enter the place. I wouldn‚Äôt be ashamed to say I was proven so, so wrong. From the time you enter the place till the time you leave, you are just surprised by every element of the restaurant.

Be it the redone interiors or the wall graffiti or the unique food presentation, everything is just outstanding. The piece I loved the most was hidden in the hallway to the loos ‚Äì Different versions of Amir Khan in various movies shown graphically through his hairstyles. The open tungsten bulbs and the brick walls add their own industrial flavour. All in all the interiors are very tastefully done, but then nothing less was expected from those who created Amigo‚Äôs and Villa 19.

Coming to the food. Each dish is uniquely named and even more absurdly presented. We ordered for the following in appetisers:

Pau Bhaji Fondue
Dal Chawal Arancini
Galouti Kebab

The Pau Bhaji Fondue and Dal Chawal Arancini were fabulous. The texture was just right, the masala just right and flavours were oozing through. The beauty of the Arancini was that the slight flavour of daal kept coming in waves despite the cheese and crumby texture. The disappointment was however the Galouti Kebab. The warqi paratha supporting galouti was a bit too sweet and the Galouti a tad bit coarse. Just tweaking these two just a slight bit I think we can have Galouti Kebab to rival those of Dum Pukht & Oudh.¬†

For the mains we stuck to Indian. We ordered:
Gabbar Ki Maa ki Daal
Murgh Tikka Lababdar
Omar Khayyam Ka Murgh
Vegetable Biryani
Butter Naan
Garlic Naan
Cheese Chilli Olive Naan

The daal was just right and the rotis were crisp without even asking for it. The Murgh Tikka Lababdar arrived a bit too late so we just tasted it. The tomato flavouring was a tad sweet but the texture was smooth and went well with the rotis. However, the Omar Khayyam Ka Murgh stole the show but I‚Äôm guessing its because of the mutton keema stuffing inside.¬†

For desserts we ordered:
Chai Biskoot (Masala Chai flavoured ice cream sandwich)
Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi (Oreo and Vanilla based chocolate pudding)
Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan (Kulfi)
Molecular Paan

The presentation of each of these desserts I think outdid the taste. The novelty of it all was too much to take in one go. The Chai biskoot and Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan came in a bowl oozing fake steam. Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi came in a mud pot with basil leaves stem which we took home for our pet turtle.  And the Molecular Paan was bite-sized gulkand with shreds of paan leaves on a sugar paper. All-in-all innovative, disruptive and simply flavourful.¬†

Coming to the drinks, I had my regular beer, while the boys shifted to whisky. The whisky came in hip flask kind of glass bottles which was intriguing. With complements, we got mojito spheres with lemon foam on soup spoons. And god those were lovely. Thankfully for me, two of the other girls were pregnant and one of the boys didn‚Äôt care much for lemon!

All in all, Gabbar‚Äôs is a great experience. It overpowers your senses, visually. The cost per couple came around Rs 3,000 inclusive of taxes. But then we drank a lot, ate a lot.

Just as you enter, BIG B greets you with all his hit film posters and Bollywood music introducing Indian as it transitioned from Amigos to Gabbars. 

A right switch with the addition of Indian should make this place more happening now. The furnitures and interiors is totally Bollywood and shall attract all the movie buffs psychologically , but once or twice at the most. To me it's a little too much and loud. 

Nevertheless, the food is outstanding in taste and the flavours are right. Bread sizes are good but felt that portions of veggies could have been slightly more. If you do order for mocktails, don't hesitate to ask them to add more flavour. I called for both the Virgin mojito and the lime bitters to which I had to get the bitters and mint flavour added respectively. That's when the taste came up eventually. Desserts are served very stylishly and makes you order when you see the table next to yours order one. 

Reserving for other cuisines for the moment until I try them.

The theme of the restaurant - bollywood based - is a unique draw. The interiors are very well done and for a movie buff it is a treat. The caricatures of famous characters (Gabbar, Jai, Veeru and Thakur from Sholay, Raj from DDLJ, Gogo and Teja from Andaz Apna Apna, etc. ) are an instant hit¬†
The drinks are very good - I had the Lime Mojito and a Caprioska - both were very good indeed
The food, however was an average affair - we ordered the crispy chilly babycorn, sauteed mushroom, aglio olio, and for dessert the Chai Biskoot - the problem is that the serving dish is very big but the quantity served is very little - this was a problem at Amigos also
They have a private dining area that looks like the living room of a house for about 12 people - this is a good place to host a private get together. The villain wall is an attraction and gives an opportunity to get a picture clicked with the greatest badasses of the hindi film industry

Went there this afternoon for lunch with colleagues. This place is where amigos used to be. When you enter this place you would be expecting a total makeover of the place but sadly the interiors have not changed much. Coming to the food we ordered. The kababs were great. Though they served some different dip with the kababs but sadly the mint dip was missing. For main course we called for noodles and devil's choice. Instead they served us some potatoes in gravy dish. When we asked the waiter he said it is devil's choice. But all we could obviously see were potatoes and potatoes and more potatoes. We called the waiter and told him that devil's choice with "exotic vegetables" were missing. So he got the dish changed. The dish arrived after we've were done with our lunch and to add to our disappointment we saw that in the same old dish the chef had just added carrots and peas. It was highly disappointing. The only USP of this place is the fancy way in which they serve the food.

Went to gabbar's a couple of weeks back.....1st of all whenever i telephoned and asked for a table reservation their only answer was we are totally sold out. Finally took the risk of walking in and asking a table and luckily the restaurant was empty though their telephone answer was the same 'sold out'. Just had soup and a kebab platter but not upto the standard. The paneer tikkas in the platter was all chewy and rubbery. Even the other kebabs were not so great. Overall experience was BAD. GUESS  they should concentrate more on the food than changing the name of the RESTAURANT.

Rotis we ordered :
Warki paratha 10/5. Could give infinite rating to this yummy paratha.

The dessert hazaro khwahishe aisi : 5/5.

The best thing i liked was the edible starch sheet  based paan. Loved it. Very small in size but a big burst in mouth.

Overall a nice place and decent food. Would surely visit again.

After hearing a lot of good reviews about Gabbar, my friends and me decided to go there for lunch on a Saturday at around 2pm. We were met with disappointment minutes after walking into the restaurant when we saw water dropping from the ceiling on our table.¬†
Not paying much heed to it, we started browsing through the menu. Their menu is basically an extension to what Amigos offered, with the addition of various Indian and Chinese items to their original Mexican and Italian dishes. We ordered Papdi Chaat, Dal Chawal Arancini, and Texas fajitas based on the menu highlights and the waiter's recommendations. For drinks we ordered a Beer Sangria and a Lime Maragarita with an orange Lolly.¬†
The appetizers were served pretty quickly and looked quite appetizing. While the papdi chaat was just average tasting with an underwhelming molecular gastronomy twist, the arancini was a little better tasting in spite of its filling being a little dry. We were also trying to fight our share of the appetizers from various kinds of mosquitoes and other insects that were really tempted to try our food.¬†¬†
Our drinks finally arrived and had nice presentations. Both the drinks tasted okay. I personally liked their presentations a lot more than the taste. Visiting their restroom made the not so great experience we were having so far, a lot worse than anticipated. The restroom was filthy beyond explanation. We finally decided to bring all this to the knowledge of the staff there (their manager was apparently not available to talk to us) , they told us they would look into the matter and moved us to a table where there was no water leaking on it.¬†
After waiting for about forty minutes for our fajita to arrive, on enquiring the waiter said that it should not take much longer. After waiting for a another fifteen minutes and having completely given up by the restaurant, we asked the waiter to cancel the order. He did so, we payed the bill and left being extremely let down. There was no kind of apology or regret shown by any member of the staff.¬†
The only good thing about this restaurant was the presentation, which is in no way enough to make up for the kind of service, food and ambience it offers. Having a lot more waiters than customers, this is perhaps one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had. The most shocking part of the experience was the kind of hygiene Gabbar's had with the leaking ceiling, insects everywhere and the unhygienic restrooms. Don't be fooled by molecular gastronomy and the presentation, because you will only be disappointed once you visit this place!

Yesterday we had an amazing experience at Gabbar's. Makeover of Amigo's to Gabbar's is really mesmerizing and praiseworthy. The outstanding ambiance at Gabbar's is simply out of the world. The lipsmacking Indian food was delicious in which the inverted vada paw, Bhatti ke Aloo and Maa ke Haath ki Dal requires a special mention. To top it all the well mannered and courteous staff should be really appreciated for making us feel at home and all their efforts which they made throughout.

Happened to visit this place with my family a couple of days back over lunch. Not much to talk about their ambiance. My first impression was, they are understaffed and untrained! We had to ask for water, cutleries and what not. Starter plates werent changed when main course was served on the table; there were no quarter plates as well. Vinegar onions were stale and were served on an underliner. Music could have been in sync with the environment. Talking about their food, the starters were good with plenty of options to choose. We ordered for Tandoori aloo and inverted vada pav. North Indian main course requires improvement. Garlic naan didnt have any taste of garlic.

The prices are abit on the higher side, but it wont be noticed if they improve their hospitality/service.

I have been there three times since it has opened doors and each time I have had a great experience. Starting from the appetizers to the desserts- all are presented in most unique ways which adds to the overall experience. Loved the private seating arrangement for family and friends in larger groups...looking forward to an opportunity to enjoy that as well..!!¬†

Yesterday, at around 2:00pm, I visited the establishment that used to house my favourite Mexican joint, Amigos, along with a friend. Gabbar, has received decent reviews from my fellow journalist friends and I was keen to check out the place. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were given a look-over by a surly bartender who answered with a non-committal grunt when we asked him if we could get a table for two. Undeterred, we went to the captain of the restaurant, who was probably in some sort of a competition with his bartender colleague (who-will-drive-away-more-customers). "Our staff hasnt (sic) turned up today" he snarled, without an apology. This, when we ¬†could clearly see two tables full of customers digging into their meals. As a journalist, i have been subjected to my share of brush-offs but this undoubtedly takes the cake.

on saturday at around 7.45pm landed at the doors of Gabbar's. The gentleman at the gate instead of ushering us told us on our face that he has no vacancy and we should go away. On prodding him to recheck his bookings, he curtly told us on our face....."round 2 shall start from 9.15 pm and i hve NO place in that also for you.¬†

Even then i asked him to recheck by calling the persons against whom reservations have been reserved as i saw a few tables empty. He replied...."these bookings i have personally taken and are of my special guests. There is no need to call them up"

Keeping this experience in mind, i would not think twice before giving them a -5.0 (if possible) rating. ¬†
would be publishing this review on my facebook page also

There are restaurants and then there are restaurants and then there Gabbar. Just to call Gabbar a restaurant would be injustice to the kind of class and showmanship it brings to its offerings. Be it the borosil glassware in which the alcohol is served, the miniature pressure cookers by the side of the kebabs or the use of liquid nitrogen for showmanship, everything work together to create what Gabbar is.
The decor of the place is quirky but not without a sense of class. Original posters of 70s Bollywood, the Gab-BAR , the walls with graffiti inspired from famous movie lines. You get my point.
The food here is a bit experimental and some of it does need some polishing. The dal chawal aranchini is beautiful but it needs to be smaller or it gets monotonous, the pav bhaji fondue doesn't deliver as much as it promises and the inverted vada pav is not good. The chaat on the other hand is subtle and beautiful. The chicken tikka dilman is delicious and soft but the star of the starters is definitely the Ajwani fish tikka. Its beautifully done with the right amount of seasoning. The DIY papad is fun.
The mains have quite a few beautiful dishes. The gabbar ki ma ki daal, kadhai paneer, aloo do pyaza, Omar Khayyam ka murg and jhinga malai curry are all tasty and come in various quirky utensils.
The dessert packs a punch in the show department but lacks a bit on the taste. Have the Chai bishkoot . A more awe inspiring dessert this city doesn't serve. The hazaraon khawaishyen aisi looks like a potted plant but actually is mud pie.
A meal at Gabbar is incomplete without their cocktails. If you want to get, well, "tipsy" lambi race ka ghoda is for u. The kachha aam margarita is beautiful too.
So, head to Gabbar if you like your food to not be defined only by the parameters of food. 
P.S. The previous avatar of Gabbar, Amigos TeX Mex is still there on the background as that menu is still available. Also I hear some Chinese has been added to the menu. Cheers to that.

After reading such great reviews about this place, I went there yesterday with my office colleagues. The experience was very disappointing to say the least. The ceiling was leaking with water droplets falling on both ends of our table, the staff appeared clueless about the menu, half the stuff¬† on the menu was not available..my colleague had to ask for chilli sauce at least 5 times before it was brought..they didn't serve any complimentary snacks with the drinks..service was a big let down..they messed up most of our orders.. pricing was extremely high with respect to the quantity & quality served. The place really needs to pull-up its sock especially with respect to service. Until then my advice to all is not to waste money on this eating joint.

After hearing so much about this place, went there with the mother for lunch. We arrived at 1:30 and the restaurant was empty with just one table occupied but during the course of the meal it did get almost full. 
The decor is done up beautifully and the crockery and cutlery have a contemporary look and add to the dining experience. 
I had read a couple of reviews on zomato before going there and people had mentioned about the gabbar ki maa ki dal and Warqi paratha and so we decided to order the same. The dal was undoubtedly the best I've had in a long time and the paratha was delicious too. Though a little on the sweeter side, it complemented the dal well. We also ordered a chilli cheese olive paratha and that was extremely delicious as well. Apart from that we also ordered a lemonade and for dessert we had their chai biscoot. The ice cream used between Parle G biscuits is the chai flavoured ice cream available at Pabrai's naturalle ice cream. The presentation is similar to an earl grey cocktail presentation at The Factory Outlet. The prices are extremely reasonable and the quantity is really good. We couldn't finish all the food and had to pack it. 
The only problem is their service. The servers are lackadaisical and have to be reminded of something a number of times before it is given to you. They serve you as a favour to you.
Apart from the service problem, everything is great!

This a place every foodie would visit being in kolkata.... :) Headed here for Sunday lunch. Had a reservation so getting a seat was not a problem. We were greated by the owner who seemed to be an extremely hospitable man. The interiors suits the name. The menu card is interestingly done up with dialogues which can make u laugh. We called for beer sangaria which I totally loved though m not a beer fan. Then a hari March ka mojito which was tad spicy which they tried correcting but was almost the same. For starters we had dal chaawal balls which was nice but a little dry. Then a salt and pepper fish which was perfect. For desserts we had the Chai biscoot thing which was presented in a different manner and tasted quiet decent. The service was amazing... The owner kept attending every table to ensure if everything was good. I would love to go back for more.

Went there for lunch and more than the food, fell in love with the ambience. The paw bhaji foundue, even though, had a contemporary look, had the taste of age old conventional bhaji. The platter of papad was yum, specially the dips but, I felt that it should be served as a complimentary dish. Again the burritos and fajita that we ordered tasted good but were quite similar in taste and we expected the waiter to warn us beforehand. Though we wanted to taste the chai biscuit and the desert in the pot, we left it for our next visit. All in all a pleasant visit.

Gabbar‚Äôs has a great vibe. The place is warm, welcoming, and fun. And this fun quotient shows up in its menu as well: in drinks like Lambi Race Ka Ghoda and Kala Khatta Margharita; in such food twists as the Inverted Vada Pao (the bread is on the inside of the vada) and the Pao Bhaji Fondue.

We tried a number of different dishes here. Among the starters, I LOVED the Murg Tikka Dilman‚Äîjuicy meat, nicely spiced, an excellent side for a drunky evening. The Fish Ajwaini Tikka was quite lovely as well, especially since they use bhetki rather than basa (yay!). The Inverted Vada Pao was both tasty and innovative. As for the Pao Bhaji Fondue, I‚Äôd prefer if the pao was very very lightly toasted (this would help soak up the bhaji better). Being a lazy diner, I am not a fan of the do-it-yourself aspect of the DIY Masala Papad. But if you are eating out with kids, this could keep them busy.

Over to the mains now. The Kadhai Paneer was too high on the chilli, but Gabbar ki Ma ki Dal and Omar Khayyam ka Murg (chicken stuffed with lamb kheema) were both yummy and hit all the right notes.  Sadly, the prawns in the Jhinga Malai Curry seemed a bit overcooked and had not soaked in the gravy enough. 

Among the desserts, the Chai Bishkoot was a treat and a show. The desert comprised a Parle-G ice-cream sandwich and arrived in little clouds of smoke. Great concept, very well-executed. (But perhaps a biscuit with a lighter flavour could be used? Otherwise, the flavour of the masala chai ice cream is lost.)

Moreover, I am excited by Gabbar‚Äôs new menu. It seems to have a bit of everything. Could be a good place to go when you can‚Äôt decide on a cuisine. Plus, their service is super!  We went on a busy night but the food kept coming and the servers were very prompt.

Gabbar's is a vibrant and a desi twist to the popular restaurant amigos in Russel street. The addition to the menu is great making the customers spoilt for choice as everything in the new menu from indian to Chinese and the patent Mexican is amazing. To start with I went there on a Saturday night, the place was a little noisy but on request we were seated separated on a lesser noisier area. Coming to the food the potato skins, papri chat and the inverted vada pav is a must must try. The pav bhaji fondue and the pan fried noodles were good especially wen the staff took the efforts to customise the vegetables in the noodles. The high light is the new vibrant ambience the addition on the menu and the drink cocktail menu being very reasonable. Over all a must go for all the foodies out in kolkata. Excellent food friendly staff good location reasonable alcohol

Had visited Amigo's Tex Mex and that had been a very pleasant experience. We revisited Gabbar's as Harsh was kind enough to host us again, and was bowled over by this place. 
If you are looking for a themed restaurant this is the place to go. A very vibrant filmy decor, with posters of old Bollywood movies and Actors, lights and cool grafitti gives this place a quirky ambience. I was greeted with a plateful of DIY Masala Papad, PapdiChaat, and Daal Chawal Arancini. Masala Papad was fun with the freedom to exploit and experiment with achaars, chutneys and different kinds of Papad.  Daal Chawal Arancini was like a chop made of khichdi and the Papdi Chaat had a dollop of yoghurt on top. We also had the Inverted Vada Pav and the Pav Bhaji fondue which were quite nice to taste. The Murg Tikka Dilman was perfectly cooked chicken Kababs and they were very tasty. 
For drinks I ordered for a Lambi Race Ka Ghoda which was an extra long Long island Iced Tea came in a Long tube like beaker with a pipe to drink from. I also ordered Lime Mojito which came in a Jam Jar. The drink by itself was perfectly blended. 
For the Main Course we had Gabbar ki Ma ki Daal, Omar Khayyam ka murg and Jhinga Malai Curry, Panner Do Pyaza. The chicken had stuffed kheema inside and the Gabbar Ki Ma ki Daal was absolutely awesome to taste. My favourite however was the Jhinga Malai Curry which was subtly flavoured rich malai curry of prawns. With these we had a range of breads- Chilli Cheeae Olive Naan, Warqi Parantha, Teftan and Kheema Kulcha. All of them I must say was perfect. 
Then came the desserts - Chai Biskoot and Hazaaron Khwahishein Aisii. Chai biskoot was ice cream sandwiched in biscuits and the other was a chocolate mud with ice cream mixed. Both was delicious and mouthwatering. 
I will include a special section devoted to presentations cause Gabbar's went overboard when it came to presentation. There were tiny pressure cooker full of chutneys, drinks were served in innovative glasses and jars, with inverted bottles, long beakers, the dessert one came in a smoking glass bowl and the other as a flowering pot. I was amazed to see the detailing of the presentations and meticulousness of the dishes. 
Kudos to Gabbar's. I had a great time.
Must Haves : Gabbar ki Ma ki Dal, Jhinga Malai curry, Lambi Race ka Ghoda, Hazaron Khwahishein Aisi. 
Brilliant ambience. Must Visit.  Have fun

The worst experience ever had,overpriced though the food is good but the quantity is less,the service is realy awful and people who have all the time in the world may visit  it coz the food ordered may be served by next day to you.The cocktail  'lambi race ka ghoda' and the speciality dessert 'hazaro khwaishe aesi' is realy nice, one who visits the place by mistake must try them atleast to balance there anger against them if by chance they are served badly.The name on the menu card are appealing.The reservation system is  pathetic,if anyone wants to test their patience ,it is their golden chance to try out before this 'gabbar' gets hanged.Aside all this ,the interior is quite fascinating but the accomidation is too less which affects the waiting customers.The waiting room is like a small attic ,having one sofa sized for just three people ,so the rest customers have to  wait  in their car or roam around that area just for no reason.Basically the group who gets the table in less then 30mins will be the lucky one beause 70% of tables are reserved ,actually for no one.Customers may find the waiters nice but its difficult to understand why they  can't respond to the word 'excuse me',may be most of them are deaf. The two dishes mentioned deserves one star in the rating.As it is overpriced one can visit a 5 star hotel to enjoy the food and their time may also be saved.@Umang Shaw

Our group has always had a great time whenever we have visited this establishment. It was fun when it was Amigos and Gabbar's hasn't disappointed either. 

We started with the do-it-yourself Masala Papad, Inverted Vada Pav, Dal Chawal Arancini, Pav Bhaji Fondue and Papri Chat. While people were fumbling with the papad toppings, I tried the inverted vada pao. I don't like vada pav generally, but this version was interesting and tasty. The Dal Chawal Arancini was a tad big and bland for my tastes. If the size were smaller, it would have been easy to pop them with the drinks, rather than having to bite into them and keeping the rest aside. The Pav Bhaji Fondue was interesting, but I like my bread to be toasty yet soft; this bread was more like a crouton. The bhaji, on the other hand, was nice to taste. The Papri Chaat tasted like a papri chaat, no problems there.  We also tried the Murgh Tikka Dilman and the Fish Ajwaini Tikka. The fish was divine, cooked to perfection and, most importantly, bhetki.  

I love the way the drinks are presented at this joint. They are made well and served with a lot of drama (the good kind).  

For the mains, we started with Gabbar ki Ma ki Daal, which was one on the best daals I have tasted in the city. The Kadhai Paneer was too spicy for my taste buds, but I am not a paneer fan (I admit I have no qualms with spicy meats). The only dish that was a tad below par was the Jhinga Malai Curry and, as someone did point out, it tasted as if the prawns and the curry were made separately. All the breads that accompanied the mains were adequate. 

The dessert was a show. We were served the Chai Bishkoot and Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi. The latter was most interesting as it looked like a flowerpot with mud and a mint plant in it, the mud being ice cream and oreos in disguise. I was a tad disappointed with the Chai Bishkoot mainly because by the time it reached the table, the ice cream had melted. As I bit into it, everything oozed out and I was left only with ParleG, but the presentation was very theatrical.

I think the menu is smart and will entice people to try something new. It only gets better from here.

I would strongly recommend anybody considering a meal at this restaurant to think twice before stepping in. To begin with, we were seated at a table without proper cutlery and napkins. The starter we ordered was served after 20 minutes and presented with hair inside it. They were kind enough to replace the dish but substituted it with a cold plate of flimsily placed items. Upon asking for another pitcher of mojito, the sever told us he couldn't give us any cocktails or drinks that involved ice as they had run out of it. How can a restaurant with a bar run out of ice? After several reminders and after waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes the server brought us food, which shockingly wasn't even our order. We ordered dal, chicken and tandoori roti, and instead he brought us dal, paneer and naan. The manager upon confrontation did not seem apologetic for the lamentable presentation of food, service and ambience. This restaurant is nothing but a sheer waste of money.  The staff including the manager were inhospitable and rude.

If I had the option i would have given a rating of 0. The ambience was really bad with the kitchen doors slamming loudly! The starter which came after 25 minutes had hair in it. They had the grace to change it but just brought us colder versions of the same. They said they didn't have ice so couldn't serve us cocktails. Took them about another 1 hour to get us our mains, which sadly again wasn't what we ordered! They got us paneer instead of chicken and naan instead of paratha. The owner was unapologetic and actually screamed at my friend when she was complaining! Definitely doesn't have the chivalry to talk to a lady! We were forced to pay the bill! The 1 rating is for the vLet who got my car without a scratch and had a smile on his face! Seriously though if they continue with the "brilliant" service, it wont be long before Gabbar's face the same fate as its predecessor, amigos did. Might be touching a soft  corner for the owners but thats what i as a patron felt like!

A very interesting concept in Kolkata.. Similar to the fusion food of Indian accent and spice club in Delhi and Bombay. I ordered the pav bhaji Fondue which had an authentic Bombay taste. The papdi chaat wasn't like the one u get on the streets but still worth having. The dal chaval in a fried ball was also very tasty and satisfies all ur taste buds. The orange mojito, the masala chai ice cream is a treat. Warkhi roti is a must try along with black dal and paneer.

Hats off to the interiors of the place really well done.

Leave everythin aside, the first thing to be followed in the hospitality industry is to be atleast polite to the guests. The most arrogant and non welcoming staff. I had made a table reservation for 9 pm but due to rains was 30 mins late. I was greeted at the door by the owner, I guess sayin it was your duty to reach on time, we don't call customers before giving their table away. Then why do they take the customers phone number, if they are not goin to call them. Well, understood, it's my fault that I came 30 mins late, now what?
So the reply came, we cannot give you a table, even if their tables are empty. Since the time I entered there was a table for 6 empty which I think was reserved for me only. But I was told to wait for 30-40 mins. And only after waitin for 30 mins, I was given the same vacant table. He wanted to teach us a lesson for comin late! Oh my god! With this attitude, u wanna run a restaurant, then god only help you, mr gabbar! 
And what's the whole issue about anyway? The staff is non trained and foolish.. They cannot pronounce the names of the menu, n neither are they quick! Other than the cocktails, everythin tasted far below average! And now the owner might comment that I have no idea of taste of molecular gastronomy! I would like to let him know from before only, that I have tried food in many restaurants all over the world from Australia to gaggans in Bangkok to farzi cafe in delhi which specialise in molecular gastronomy, so please don't be fooled! 
If u cannot improve ur food or service then atleast smile and be nice to people!

Loved: All Drinks, Inverted VadaPaw, Gabbar Ki Maa Ki DalI liked the paneer warqi paratha, persian paratha. The idea of paw bhaji fondue was interesting.¬†The dal chawal appetizer was a bit dry for my taste.
Oh and the dessert - 1000 Hwahishein Aisi is a pot of oreo, brownies, ice cream etc. Chai biscuit is also a different new concept.¬†
I liked that they experiment (mostly successfully) and service is good. Will probably visit again.

On my first visit to Gabbar's, I wanted to make it a special affair for my mother's birthday. As the name suggests, the whole ambience is bold with a wall dedicated to popular Bollywood masala dialogues, while the other walls adorn passionately curated posters of the yesteryear Bollywood movies from all across the country. With so much of the movie ambience, surely the chandelier could have been revamped into something more filmy!
We'd ordered for the Lambi Race ka Ghoda, a heady concoction of five spirits, served right up in a Borosil flask. For a moment you'd surely be transported back to your chemistry lab rendezvous from school era! Other drinks included the likes of Mirchi Maar Ke Virgin Mojito that has a sizzling chilly burn sensation down the throat! A Bloody Mary was served up with a conical flask and a dropper that we assumed was a stirrer; quite a presentation it was, fitted in to a wooden tray. However, taste wise the Bloody Mary could be better than the expected standards.
Main course was predominantly Indian, but of course keeping the infamous Gabbar in mind! The Warqi Paratha which was highly recommended was excellent with the taste but way too oily for the wary foodie! Dum ka Murgh was cooked to perfection with subtle spices and tender chicken. On the Mexican front, Chicken Chimichangas was a beautiful mix of chicken stuffed envelopes, herb rice, soaked corn in orange juice base and the usual mayo base dip.
Hazaaron Khwaishey Aisi the tell tale of mudpie with crumbled Oreo cookies and vanilla ice cream served in a plant pot was a treat both to the eyes & tummies! The Molecule Paan, with an outer starch sheet envelope was something for which I'll go back!
Overall verdict: Gabbar's is a place for those who want to try out new adventurous food or even the traditional ones with interesting presentations & plating, with an assurance of quality.

Finally went to this place today , having high expectations I would say I was a lil disappointed . not that it was a bad experience but may be not up to the perfection mark . so lets go step wise , as we reached , the place was just filling up . I thought it would be filled as while making the reservation I was said that they didn't have the slot I was wanting . probably just creating artificial demand , sorry to say it doesn't work these days. As we were allotted the table we had flies welcoming us . we ordered peach ice tea , first the guy served it in a normal glass and then when we said that it was to be served in the kettle and cutting glasses then he quickly tried to cover up saying it was wrong drink . the ice tea was good . although we didn't order long island ice tea but saw it served on the other table in the long cylindrical flask , which I guess has become a patent for serving LIIT at most joints . for starters we ordered inverted vada pav , the molecular papdi chat and cruchy tacos. Inverted vada pav was something we liked its a must try . molecular papdi chat was good something new for Kolkatans . tacos took me back to amigos days . main course we had gabbar ki maa ki dal again a chefs recommendation and a must have , one of the better black dal which I have had , kadai paneer was tasteful . the chilli cheese olive nan was good , warqi paratha was nice and crisp but little on the sweeter side . deserts we ordered chai biscuit and hazaro khawish aisi . both were yum . chai biscuit was unique with the vaporized flavour of the tea added to the ice cream sandwich of parle g. The mud pie was sinful in calorie count but worth every spoon . the highlight of the place I would say is the presentation , although molecular gastronomy is a usp but its only restricted to few dishes . they have tried to present the food in an innovative manner which is new for Kolkatans . food is equally good taste wise but its more of amigos adding Indian and Chinese to its menu and nothing extra . I feel you can add more molecular foods to your menu and make it different from regular menu. Please take care of hygine and cleanliness as I found it lil compromised . the staff needs to be more attentive and courteous . Hope to come back again to try new additions to your menu . on a gabbar note - gaon valo gabbar ki ma ki ankh (daal) zaroor try karna

This place does not really deal with subtleties. If the name was not clue enough, it makes its Bollywood theme loud and clear as soon as you enter the place. One of the walls is filled up with graffiti of iconic dialogues from Hindi films over the years. The other walls are all laden with numerous pictures of yesteryear as well as the new stars. And as if that was not enough the doors are designed after the saloon doors popularized in Sholay. Well, it's called Gabbar's for a reason.Due to some odd reason they were playing Coldplay in the background. Kind of did not go with the overall feel, I'd have much rather have them play Amitabh Bacchan classics.¬†The staff were courteous and helpful but the service became kinda slow when the place filled up.¬†Plating and garnishing is where Gabbar scores. While none of the food tasted exceptional, they surely looked like.¬†We had a cranberry breezer and a virgin mojito. Standard stuff here.¬†The corn cake was really good. The batter was crispy and the filling was juicy. However they cut a raw potato in the form of a rose as a part of their plating and I confused it for something edible. They should really inform their guests about parts not to be eaten.¬†The Mexican chipotle chicken was a slight disappointment. I mean no complains really, but it seemed as if too much was being tried. The chicken was stuffed with mushrooms which were served over mexican rice filled with beans and bellpeppers and accompanied by a soup. All the flavors were fighting it out among themselves and hence there was o coherent flavor or texture to this dish.¬†The ending dessert 'Hazaro Khwaeisein Aisi' is a bit of a scene stealer. It arrives in the form of a potted plant, the twist being the mud in the pot is actually chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup mixed.¬†A satisfying experience, but I wish they take some more risk with the whole molecular gastronomy thing and bring us known dishes in never seen before avatar. :)

Had a great time here at Lunch. Started with a white wine sangria pitcher coupled with some mouth watering papri chaat and vada pau. While eating you enjoy the lovely old kind Hindi music many songs you loved during its time but now you don't listen often so reliving the memory of those times is soothing. Also visually the decor is relaxing with the wall graffiti portraying different slogans all belonging to the Gabbar theme. Also met one of the co-owners who was very courteous and showed us around including a fantastic pvt lounge section you can book for maybe upto 20 people with top villains of Bollywood on one of the walls good speakers ( you can play your own music here). Now it was time to order the main course and I couldn't stop laughing when I gave my order to the waiter saying I want one Gabba ki Maa Ki Daal haha and also aloo do pyaja along with garlic naan. It was so nicely served in a help it yourself utensils giving you a rustic old authentic feel. It was very tasty and I was told that the daal is made like the ITC Peshawri style cooked in tandoor for a long time. Ended with a kulfi and noler goor ice cream which I didnt find very great. Overall a must visit place. Going with a sibling, friend, family or group of friends or in short Kitne bhi aadmi hon ( however many people are there) Gabbar wont dissapoint.

Worst service , on your visit you will be greeted by staff who is not at all experienced and polished and is full of attitude who doesn't know how to welcome a guest. you are treated as if you have gone eat and not gone pay. Ambience is good menu is well planned with good Bollywood wording but you will land up ordering the food which you can order at any road side eatery. Well I would technically call it a polished road side joint looking at the behaviour of the staff.  Not advisable to visit this place

There are very few restaurants in Calcutta that manage to meld the aesthetics of the palate to the flavor of the food in the right proportion. Gabbar's is one such restaurant that has surpassed the bar with such ease. The ambience and decor add to the diners experience making him feel as if he's reached the heart of Bollywood.
I highly recommend it to all "stand up chaat lovers as well as sit down fork and knife diners" üòú
Must try the Inverted Vada Pav, Pav Bhaji Fondue and  chai biscuit dessert

I am back after a not so brief hiatus.

Gabbar‚Äôs Restaurant, not a place I would have visited, solely based on its name - Gaabbbbbarrrrr! So wannabe! But my Bachha Party seemed excited about it and I was just excited to go out with ALL of them. Whatever, the place be.

My first reaction was, ‚ÄúOh My God! Amigos has shut down.‚Äù Every year, since the place opened we have the ordered the Opera cake for my brother‚Äôs birthday. Well, I personally wasn‚Äôt too fond of the cake or of Amigos.

The interiors of the restaurant was pleasant and inviting with its Bollywood quirk. We reached at 8:30 and the restaurant wasn‚Äôt overcrowded but slowly it filled up.

Famished; we ordered,      
√ò  Inverted Vada Pav ‚Äì It was just Aloo Pakoda with green chilli, green chutney and dried garlic chutney. Seemed like a typical Vada Pav of Mumbai‚Äôs stall but the server forgetting to pack the Pav for you. The Vada/ Aloo Pakoda tasted good, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. But innovation on the dish was nil.

√ò  Papdi Chaat ‚Äì The dish was innovative wherein the curd was a sphere, Molecular Gastronomy style. It wasn‚Äôt the best attempt; have eaten better spheres with thinner coatings that disappear in the mouth when it bursts. The Papdi was also not crunchy. Good attempt at innovation, bad taste for the palate.

√ò  Pav Bhaji Fondue ‚Äì Tasted bitter. The forks were too short for the Fondue pot making it inconvenient to eat.
Attn: The no. of forks served should match the no. of guests on the table.

√ò  Dal Chawal Arancini ‚Äì Enjoyed the textures of the dish. Loved the tangy and sweet dip served with it. Nice!
Wish the Papad on top wasn‚Äôt soggy!

√ò  Corn Cake ‚Äì Simple dish. Good flavours. You get what you ask for.

√ò  Nachos Fiesta ‚Äì It was neither good nor bad.

√ò  Penne Paprika Pasta ‚Äì Yuck! The sauce was too liquidy. It tasted like Sunfeast Pasta gone wrong.

√ò  Warqi Paratha ‚Äì Nice and Crunchy!

√ò  Cheese Chilli Olive Naan ‚Äì I seemed to have gotten all the chillies so I found it very spicy.

√ò  Gabbar ki Maa ki Daal ‚Äì Average.

√ò  Chai Biskoot ‚Äì I was too full to concentrate on the dish. Great concept. Ice ‚Äìcream sandwiches are always nice.
Attn: Always explain dishes that are complicated and have inedible items plated.

The service started well but as the crowd started pouring in, it became messy. They waiters were all very courteous but not attentive.

As it was my cousin‚Äôs birthday, we were offered an Oreo Pot Dessert by the restaurant. Thank you for the gesture.

Mr Sonthalia, part owner of the restaurant, was present at all times and tried to keep a vigilant check on the service.

It was a pleasant experience and I would not mind visiting again.

Great food. First molecular gastronomy place in cal. Order the papdi chat and the deconstructed pav bhaji. Basically anything with the gabbar icon is great. The service is with a smile so I will give an A for effort but they need to be more efficient to deal with crowds. Some of our food took a while. The main course was so-so but the dessert and the paan was great!

Definitely will go again and recommend to others. Up your game guys - am willing to pay more for really good food.

Very nice restaurant with molecular gastronomy food... The paper chaat.. Arenchino balls as starters were excellent.. For the mains I had ordered yellow tadka dal, pudina paratha and panner butter masala( the panner was a little hard) . We got a complimentary chocolate dessert with icecream which was also nice. The pan which they served at last was very nice and unique. Overall a nice experience.

Excellent presentation. The concept of serving food in a different way was amazing. 

The icing on the cake was the complimentary paan served with what looked like edible plastic.

Keep up the good work.

I loved my experience at the newly opened Gabbar's. I am truly excited as a foodie to see Molecular Gastronomy in a stand alone restaurant in Kolkata at affordable prices so that more people can try something new and exciting. For those interested Molecular Gastronomy is described by Wikipedia as ¬†a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking.
It has a multi-cuisine format with a range of Indian , Chinese , Mexican and some Italian as well. Its a crowd pleasing selection with all the usual favorites featured so that no one would go home disappointed.Along the way you will find a few hidden gems within their signature dishes that I recommend you don't miss out on.
We started our meal with the specials DIY Masala Papad , Inverted Vada Pav , Dal Chawal Aancini , Pav Bhaji Fondue and Papri Chat all with a special twist that was delightful and tickled my taste-buds in all the right ways.The food was good very good and has that wow factor in the presentation that will make dining here an enjoyable experience for one and all.We also tried the Murgh Tikka Dilman and the Fish Ajwaini Tikka both of which were excellent both in terms of taste as well as degree of cooking and needless to say very well presented. We also tried the chinese starter Lat Me Kai which was very nice.
I must mention here that Gabbar has an excellent Bartender and we loved our drinks.¬†We settled for Iced Tea which was served in a kettle with chai glasses and went on to order Green Mango Margarita presented with a green mango flavored iced-lolly , a huge Long Island Iced Tea in a tall beaker aptly named Lambi Race ka Ghoda and a Bloody Mary also perfectly served in a small beaker with a dropper full of¬†Tabasco¬†sauce so you¬†could assemble your own drink. We were quite¬†tickled¬†about the whole¬†experience and¬†thoroughly¬†enjoyed ourselves.
For our main course though we were rather stuffed we ordered Gabbar ki Maa ki Dal , Kadhai Paneer and Warqi Paratha all of which were delicious.The paratha had a hint of sweetness which paired wonderfully with the more robust flavors of the paneer and kali dal we ate it with.
And then came literally the icing on the cake .... dessert !!!! I had already seen one that I wanted to order the Chai Biskoot which turned out to be an excellent choice. Its an ice-cream sandwich made with Parle G biscuits sandwiching a block of ice-cream in a chai flavor stacked up in a chai glass ..... sheer delight but wait there is more. We ordered a Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi as we were in the mood for chocolate .... a few minutes later a small potted plant is placed before me in a terracotta pot ¬†.... that was when the magic unfolded .... the menu described it perfectly gooey chocolate mudpie with vanilla ice-cream and oreo "soil" .... absolutely yummy and spectacular.¬†
By now we were bursting and in a food coma but what is placed in front of us is a slightly peculiar Paan that has been placed on Edible Starch Discs and chopped up which you wrap up and pop into your mouth and the disc dissolves leaving the Paan to be eaten .... made for a wonderful ending to a great meal. Gabbar's I promise to be back very very soon :-)
