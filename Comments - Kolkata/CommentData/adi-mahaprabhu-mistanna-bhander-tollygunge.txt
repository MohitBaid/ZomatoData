BEST ROSOGOLLA I HAVE EVER HAD! 

I have been there as well. its famous for "Melting Rosogolla" , “Kancha Golla” and “Mishti doi” . Just un-parallel!!.One of best sweet shops near Bansdroni. Sweets are great with reasonable prices. I loved it.

Heaven for RASGULLA and MITHA DAHI.

This is by far the best sweet (Rosogolla and Misti Doi) experience I have ever had in Adi Mahaprabhu Mistanna Bhander. Guys please there and try out the same. The shop is more than 40 year old and its quite nearer to "Masterda Surya Sen Metro Station".
