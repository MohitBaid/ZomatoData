small outlet...not huge variety...less specific crowd for selected people...too costly sweets...i hv tried parwal sweets which cost 35rs each....they claim to use desi ghee that why sweets is costly..in place where u get sweets range between 5rs to 20rs..why we spend more money but people those like typical marwari sweets must visit and try sweets and namkeens

Tiny sweetmeat shop on Theatre road... Offers flavorful Indian sweets and snacks. The shop seems to be clean and tidy. #Cheese cutlet and #Peas khasta Kachori are recommended in snacks. Price is little bit on the higher side, considering the average pricing standard of sweets in town.

Located right on Shakespeare Sarani in between Loudon Street crossing and Hungerford street crossing. This is a non bengali sweet shop. Quality and taste wise this is a good shop but priced exorbitantly high!!! Hence most clientele base of this shop are high class non bengalis. 
To give u an idea of cost a bengali style chomchom costs ₹40/- which in any decent sweet shop will not exceed 20/-. The corn puffs and the vegetable chops too are priced in the 40s range. But yes this shop has got good variety of everything.

Chhappan Bhogoban is a sweet shop located at Theatre road. It mainly sells Marwaari sweets.  a few Bengali sweets and namkeens .

Ambience is clean and nice.

Service is prompt.

Tried Chandrakala, Pista barfi & Motichur laddu. All were scrumptious and fresh.

Prices are bit high.

As the names states the shop has taken its name seriously and it serves varieties of Sweets which contain Bengali, Marwari, etc that are made up of pure ghee and a variety of namkeens too. 
Chapan Bhog is also located in Theatre Road. 

They prepare “Chandrakala” a sweet filling made up of flour and dry fruits which is one of the shop specialty . They also serve “Mango Rasogulla” but the stock hardly last for few hours and the “Motichur” laddu are made from Desi Ghee and taste really best. 

They also take Party and Marriage orders.

This is a sweet shop serving delicious Rajasthani sweets in Kolkata.The sweets were all made in ghee and were very tasty. The prices were a bit on the higher side. I liked the Pista Burfi, Badaam Burfi and Dil khushahal Burfi.

Popular for their sweets, Chhappan Bhog sells a variety that has been around since ages. Quality is pretty much up there and their service is good too. Definitely a sweet shop you should consider walking into if you're in Theatre Road.

Well, “Gond ladoos” are quite akin to the Marwari community, especially in the winters – and the Marwari sweet meats outlet – Chhappan Bhog based out of Theatre Road are really aware of this fact. Hence, they did prepare some of the best gond ladoos - I ever had outside of my house.

I never really knew that gond can be crisped so such an extent! The saffron drop on the top of the ladoos indeed made it quite presentable. I don’t generally enjoy dry fruit content in ladoos, but this time, I quite did – ohhhh - the huge pieces of almond quite adored them. The ladoos, indeed give you a feeling that winter is knocking at the doors!

Only thing which I felt could be improved was the amount of ghee used be regulated. Also, full marks for packing.

Cheers!

Have known this place since I was a kid. They used to do some of the best Indian sweets. 

But with time and competition these guys have completely lost the plot. No attention is being paid to customer satisfaction. If fact they don't even care if you have a complain. Their target clientele is not the kind that uses Zomato and therefore negative reviews don't really bother them and that's the reason they continue to be ignorant. 

By looking at their menu and pricing it's quite evident that this is premium sweet shop, but that's not true. 

Some time back we took a basket of sweets and savoury for gifting. The ladoos come at a premium of almost double the price than the market rate and yet they were dry as hell. The savoury was the highlight. After having bought them last evening they had been stored in the refrigerator as soon as it got home. When it was reheated to be eaten in the morning most of the food was rotten. The tikya-chola was smelling terrible and became gooey. The au gratin puff was sour like curd. When we called to complain the person attending the call says if it's not good don't order it.

This famous sweet shop is located near Office Linc on Theatre Road. It's a huge red coloured unmissable board on top.

We took takeaway of
Gulab patti sandesh
Laddoo
Kachoris
Cheese Cutlet
Veg Cutlet

The Gulab patti sandesh was melt in the mouth goodness. Decorated with a rose petal on top it came in a soft paper shell. I think it's the softest and most moist version available in the city.

The cutlets were ok. The veg one was a beetroot based normal cutlet and the cheese one had cheese but the cheese was quite solid ,I would prefer something more gooey.

The kachori was good.

Overall the sandesh was the clear winner. Will keep calling for it.

Located near the camac street and theatre road crossing. Quality is good no doubt, but the sweets are overpriced with no innovation or fusion. Need to bring up some innovations in order to balance with the price.

Exorbitant prices for reasons best known to them. I expected a exceptional taste which is missing. Still I manage to buy once a month. 
The best thing is that it's never stale, all stuff that I have bought in the last 3 years was fresh.
Rasmalai is a worth a try.

Couldn't convert itself to a greater delivery module like the gokuls. They always stick to some of there traditional items which is indeed very good but now a days people want something new and different.

I have passed by this joint since my college days. I remember once while passing by it with my father we chanced to glance at its display and were amused by the giant sized sweet meats available there and used to joke about it in between ourselves. A few months ago, for the first time I stepped in. The store is absolutely neat and clean. Good decoration. Medium sized outlet with no sitting arrangement. Formal staff ready to serve you but lacking the familiarity of any Bengali sweet shop.
I did not try their football sized sweets which they said are mostly for marriage occasion. There were small sized sweets too and I tried them. Typical North Indian/Rajasthani sweets with lots of dry fruits. I took home their Chandrakala. They are good, but if I dare compare them with that of Gangaur's I would say that Gangaur's wins by a small margin.

A small but select outlet for traditional Rajasthani marwari sweets and namkeens. Its been around now for over 30 years and continues to be popular with the Theatre Road crowd. The kachoris and namkeens are spicy,tasty and "khasta" . The rosogullas are very Bikaneri and different from KC Das's. The laddoos both motichur and basin are good as are some of the other selections. On order they make a great Pista barfi--a great favorite on festivals and weddings..The chandrakalas are nicely stuffed with mewa and quite scrumptous !! Overall prefer their North Indian mithais to its rivals, Gangaur and Gokul.
