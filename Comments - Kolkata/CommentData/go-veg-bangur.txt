This is our go to place to have some light dinner specially for sone chinese food, as there are hardly any dine restaurant in Bangur area. 

We have tried the Crispy chilli mushroom, chilli paneer, chilli garlic noodles, paneer tikka. Out of these the standout were mushroom and paneer tikka. Quantity is good and quality is also commendable. 

Staff is prompt and caters nicely. Overall, a nice and small family restaurant to enjoy some not so fussy dinners.

Hi there I ordered food through food panda and the food delivered to me was not fresh and smelly.Beware if you order food through online because they can give you old food and you can't do anything.

Went with friends and ordered Crispy Chilli babycorn, Daal makhani, Veg Jhalpuri, Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan, Tndoori Roti, Veg Fried Rice and fresh lime soda. As the restaurant was completely full, we had to wait for some time before we got our order, but the taste was simply good. However, Daal makhani could have been better.

Opened up at a place where there used to be a Subway is just an addition to numerous food outlets in Bangur. Prices have been kept at affordable range but still that doesn't make one to be a regular customer for food quality reason. It is much evident that prices have been given preference to the quality.

Still I found Paneer to be okayish. Dal makhani was a dish where there was no makhani and completely tasteless. Terrible !

One can go if quality is not an issue and budget matters.

I went to this place as one of my neighbours told me about the purely veg restaurant in bangur. We went there around 8:45 and after 15 minutes of waiting we got a seat there. Firstly we ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn. The Babycorn was Crispy and tasty but the quantity was extremely extremely low. We didn't expect the quantity to be so low. Then we ordered paneer Tikka and schezwan noodles. The taste was awesome. On the main course we ordered cheese naan, dal makhani, paneer punjabi, butter roti and some kulchas. The food was tasty,!  But the problem came again with the quantity of naan and sabji The quantity was very low and we kept on ordering naan as they got finished in a few bites. Lastly we ordered jeera rice and papad both of them were good with average quantity of jeera rice!. Staff is friendly and helpful. Overall an average experience I would say!

One of the most pathetic restaurant to be found around. Yesterday I have ordered  Dal Makhani, Amritaari Aloo tandoori roti and veg biryani and the order was placed thru swiggy. I was amazed when the order was delivered to me.. I received masala kulcha, aloo do pyaaza, malai kofta and to my surprise Veg biryani was missing. After I made a complaint with swiggy on cross checking they said that the restaurant has agreed that they have missed veg biryani but the items have been delivered as per the order.. after an hour of discussion with swiggy and restaurant veg biryani was delivered to me after more than a hour. I am posting some pics of the food item and the order which was placed my me for verification of the restaurant who didn't agreed on placing wrong order. The vegetables are having initials which proves that wrong order has been delivered with swiggy and restaurant veg biryani was delivered to me after more than a hour.

Have visited the restaurant 3-4 times since it's opened.Â 
Always less crowded, which i like actually ;)
Well behaved staff.
Good ambience, they always have good music on their playlist :)
Main course is of good taste except the Naans- They've always been very chewy and the Sabzis taste sweet. I liked the Masala Kulchha and Garlic Naan.
About starters, I only liked Chinese Bhel out of the dishes I've tried till now. Others need improvement.
Overall a very good experience. Will definitely recommend to friends and Family! :)

As it was a friday night ,i expected that the restaurant would be somewhat crowded but to my sheer surpries it was totally empty.So i was a bit apprehensive about this place.But i thought of giving it a try and also i was too hungry to find some other restaurant .The seating was very comfortable and the staffs were also cordial.

First visit
Ordered chilli garlic hakka noodles and vegetable manchurian .
The food arrived in less than 10mins.
Chilli garlic noodles- It had a distinct garlic flavour and i loved it .Quantity was more than enough for 1 person.
Veg manchurian-This consisted of 4 manchurian balls.Being a spicy food lover,i didnt like the taste. But yes the way it was served in a small kadhai,i loved the presentation of the dish.

Second visit-
This time we thought of trying their Indian dishes,so we ordered Veg biryani,garlic naan,paneer lahori and chilli mushroom for starters.
Their chilli mushroom is absolutely fabulous .

I loved their interiors,it was soothing and calm and the dim lighting made a great dine -in experience .
Great restaurant..Yummy food and Prices are cheap too..

They made the noodles very spicy otherwise the taste was good. Mushroom was yummy. As it is a veg place so the variety is less. Price is very reasonable. I wish they add something new and different in the menu.

This place was a true blessing. See, if I am not wrong in this right spot used to be a SUBWAY, which by the way moved up a little bit to Lake Town. So when I was around protected from the scorching heat, under the shelter of a Rickshaw, I passed by and two words were enough for me: VEG and HEALTHY. So when I had the chance I just run to this place and , no regrets. So far I have been there twice in a month for lunch and is just simply almost perfect. Is impeccable. The decoration is simple and elegant. the food is well cooked, is not greasy, is not extra spicy, is well presented, is cooked with quality and love. The staff is respectful and kind. The menu has one of my favorite things that is the preaching into being a vegetarian, something I rarely see in India, so this food is just not veg food, is evident that it does has a conscious within, that it does have a great intention, they want to feed you and feed you well, with harmless food.Â 

Please I urge you to go to this place, if I don't give the full 5 points is because it lacks publicity and without that you will not have more costumers and that will affect your business, and I really love this place grows a bit more. Â Keep up the good cuisine.
