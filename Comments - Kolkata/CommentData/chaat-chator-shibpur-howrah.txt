This is my favourite place where i go again and again just for the dahi phuchka .. They are sooo amzing to taste ..the big size puchkas with chilled dahi and mixed chaat masala is just awesome to taste ..the service is too much fast ..they serve even within 10 mins .. I love the place ..soo cheap ..soo good ..quality and quantity is also very acceptable ..

Chaat Chator is located at the food court of Avani Riverside Mall. Their Bhel Puri may be authentic and filling, but lacked enough juice and turned out quite dry. I like my Bhel Puri soaked in tangy flavored water.

I am rating them based on the only one dish I had from Chaat Chator. The Chola Batura. Sufficient for two people and really tasty. Didn't expect that. The Chola was perfectly cooked with a hint of tanginess in them and the Batura was really big.

Location-Avani Riverside mall,Kolkata.

We visit this place quite often.It is a small outlet mainly known for serving "Chaats".They have immense varieties in food and some of their combos just make the deal pocket friendly.The service is extrmely and quantity served in each dish is sufficient for two.We had-

1:Chinese bhel
2:Papdi chat
3:Chola bhatura
4:Puchka

Among them their "Chinese bhel" is a must try.

Food-4/5
Service-4.5/5

Chaat Chator is located at Avani Riverside Mall, Shibpur.

Ambience is nice with quick service.

Love their Chola Batura, well cooked and very tasty.
Also had lassi, which was thick and yummy.

Pocket pinch is reasonable with good quality food .

I always go to this mall as i like this mall a lott ....i ordered chola bhatura from this outlet and it was very tasty ..the cholas were well cooked and bhatura's were soft ..along with it they provide onion and pickles which is good to have but i must include that must change some items in thali or combos..such as chola bhatura with lassi is not a good taste for most of the people..
