Finally the place is on zomato! Had tried their Combo which consisted of rice, chinese chicken, chicken lollipop, cole chicken salad. Pretty economical I would say. Tasted okayish. Not very tasty but not on the bad side either. Wish I coud save some pictures to share.

We ordered Fried Chicken Kentucky style but it is not that so. This chicken is fried then dipped in a gravy but whatever it is made it is good in taste. the chicken was soft and tender. We also had crispy baby corn. That taste really awesome

Had ordered twice from this place on Swiggy. The place is good , food is also decent. They are very innovative with their dishes and I liked their concepts.

I had ordered the crispy chicken chowmein and the Fish Laba once, quantity and quality was good.

I have also had their Chinese Chicken Dakbunglow and Their Mixed risotto. Both were nice but the risotto could be less creamy.

All the dishes are tasty and I really hope they keep up their standards. Pricing is very practical and you can enjoy a meal for 2 at about 400 or so.

I have only orderedâ€‹ in so, can't really comment on ambience and all.

Cheers

Had ordered food from this restaurant through swiggy. The food was well packed. We ordered traditional egg and chicken fried rice, mongolian chicken fried rice, Singapore chicken fried rice, Thai chicken and sichuan chicken gravy. All the fried rice were prepared well and quantity was quiet a lot. Liked the thai chicken a lot. Flavoured nicely with lemon and butter along with a number of other condiments. The sichuan chicken was good too. The food was made visually appealing too with different colour bell peppers. Smelled buttery aromatic too. Prices are reasonable. A great variety in the menu will try the other items too.
