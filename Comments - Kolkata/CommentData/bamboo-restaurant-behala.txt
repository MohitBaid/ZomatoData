Probably the best Chinese restaurant in South Calcutta. Quality is its quantity. A perfect place to be with family. Awesome atmosphere. Just loved it.

The momos here are somewhat good. Only thing lacking in the momo would be the coating. 

Now once, for a change, I decided to order something else, so I ordered noodles and garlic chicken. The noodles was burnt to hell and I was feeling that I was being fed tree branches. The garlic chicken was no less than shit. There was hardly any chicken and there were cauliflower in it. Who the HELL adds cauliflower in chicken?! Even my maid can cook better food than this. I would recommend the chefs to learn cooking from my maid.

This restaurant was in my wish list for a long time. Never get a chance to go their. Saw some very good reviews about this place. Finally yesterday evening ordered from here via swiggy. Pan fried chicken noodles , mixed meifoon and lemon chicken and total was 530. They did not charge any additional gst and trust me that is the only good thing. Coming back to food and it was horrible. I mean pan fried noodles was like jhuribhaja with no seasoning. They send gravy in diff container and that had also no seasoning. Meifoon was not boiled properly and undercooked. It's was sticky and inedible. Worst lemon chicken I had. They had every good ingredients to be a great dishes but they failed miserably. At the end of the day no body able to eat anything it was that bad. I will surely never visit this place.

Found this restaurant all of a sudden while surfing. The picture of the dishes caught my eyes so much that I immediately ordered few starters online. Me and my friend decided to order drums of heaven and lemon grass chicken. The delivery was made really fast and the food was hot enough. The lemon grass chicken blew us away. The chicken was shredded and the quantity was really good. It smelled fabulous and the flavour of lemon grass was out of the world. Drums of heaven was very spicy but the flavours were really delicious. The chicken drumsticks were soft and juicy. The rates are reasonable enough if compared with the qiantity of food they served.

I am really looking forward to visit this restaurant in person soon.

Worst experience with my recent order. Ordered Chicken Barbeque with spring onion and sesame and Chicken Hakka Noddles. Had the most disastrous experience with Chicken Barbeque. Firstly spring onion and sesame were missing from the chicken barbeque rather they added some coriander leaves which were also not properly cleaned (felt some sand particles while eating). The chicken barbeque was way too sweet. In short a rubbish item. Hakka noodles was ok, nothing special. This would be my last order from this restaurant.

This eatery is very near to my house. This is my first visit to this restaurant and I personally feel that this restaurant is good but it have to do much better in terms of service.

Pros: Good food. Tried the Chicken Sizzler Noodles which was nice and the Golden Fried Prawn was good too. Unfortunately I felt lack of seasoning in Golden Fried Prawn but again I am not complaining since the preparation was great as a starter. 5 star for food. The service was also friendly and their response were at to the point.

Cons: The main drawback was the management. The head (maybe the owner, not sure) was yelling on the phone to a delivery staff in front of the customer was a major turn-off. Yes I do understand delivery business is not a matter of joke but still things should be handled internally, may be inside out of customers' sight.
The next problem was a little girl was roaming around in the dining room. I believe she was owner's daughter. It is very wrong thing that family members strolling around in a restaurant. Nobody was caring about her presence and she was enjoying a handful of fennel seeds & sugar cubes from a table right in front of me which was kept for the customers! I don't blame her, she just a little kid. But her parents should understand that this is a business not a family outing. I was also feeling bit awkward when she was staring at our food, once served. Management should keep an eye on it.

Lastly there is a slight problem of flies & mosquitoes in our area which affects the restaurant too. It would be nice if that can be taken care of.

My experience was not disappointing but these are few things they should keep in mind. Food, again, was at its best. Trust me, I want to come back here again. This is new restaurant and improvisation is the key. Good luck.

It is a good restaurant in this locality. I have been there twice and have taken home delivery 5-6 times. I have tried only the Chinese Cuisine. Items like Fried Rice, Hakka and Cantonese noodles, Chicken and Fish items are just ok. But an exception is the Chicken Green Bamboo momo which is really good. Other than that all types of Momos and Thukpas are also good. So I would recommend this place if you are planning to have light food or if you stay in this locality and you are planning for a sudden dinner.

Located at madanmohantala, this place is d nearest restaurant to my place.. We ordered for home delivery, peas polao, chicken tikka butter masala n chilli garlic prawn.. Food was delivered within half n hour from ordering. 2 plates of polao was sufficient for 4 of us with normal appetite, even with higher appetite 2plates is sufficient for 3people.. The polao was hot n sumptuous.. Chilli garlic prawn was mild yet tasty, chicken tikka butter masala tasted usual, the gravy was nice but the chicken was a bit hard n fibrous.. Overall the Food was good.. Would have rated 3.5 for the food, but the bill amount which came so light to the pocket made me rate them 4. Will order again in future..

There was no such eatery in this area, but bamboo has come up to please all the foodies out here. With simple, bright and elegant decor, cordial staffs and sumptous food at a pocket friendly price, it is overall a good place to dine out or take away.
I absolutely loved the chicken tandoori which was just properly cooked, big succulent chicken pieces, not over coloured but distinguished flavours. A 5 on 5 just for it.
Well we had ordered a mixture of chinese and indian dishes. 
*Kanji crispy chicken- thin strips of crispy chicken tossed in sauce and spring onnion.
* Cantonese mixed noodle- it could have been a little better, I feel they should use the thick varient of noodle, because the thin noodle give an impression of road side stalls and also the flat ones taste better. I am not sure if everyone will agree, but its my personal opinion.
*Chilli fish in oyster sauce- made with fresh basa absolutely no awful smell. I am usually concerned about the smell while ordering fish in resturants.
* Blue lagoon- it could have been presented in a better way.
They provide personal party space for small parties, also undergoing an extention to include hookah, coffee etc.
**** Only one request or suggestion for the management. As the washroom is in the dining space itself kindly keep it clean and fresh. Toilet smell and aroma of the food is not a good combination üòë. It can be a turn off for your customers.

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn - The taste was good but was not that crispy.
Thai Bamboo Chicken - This was not good at least i didn't like it may be because i had Bamboo Chicken which I had during my visit to Araku Valley in the back of my mind. Compared to that this was not good at all.

Will definitely try out other offerings of this restaurant and hopefully it will be better next time. :)

Today I ordered for some Chinese and Tibetan food. It was really delicious and yommy. From now onwards I become bamboo 'S fan. I would recommend everyone to test bamboo special rice  .

The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing, extremely pocket friendly. The ambiance is very welcoming. We especially enjoyed the Bamboo Special Sizzler. Service Staff is also great and humble. Highly recommended. Bamboo Restaurant¬†is one of the best in Behala   ¬∑for Casual Dining.

A lunch with a friend. Chicken Pakora is amazing. Other than that, Egg Fried Rice, Devil Chicken and Chicken Lemon Grass - all were as you'd expect them to be. They take a lot of care to see the customers are satisfied.
