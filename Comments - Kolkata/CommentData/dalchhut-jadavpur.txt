The stretch from Kalikapur to Jadavpore Police Station area did not have any caf√©. Instead, there are lots of heavyweight restaurants such as Wasabi.
I was naturally thrilled to discover this new outlet.
It is a cozy little place run by two ladies. A lovely lady Chandreyee took my order of black coffee and grilled sandwich of chicken and corn. While it was being prepared, I looked around. The outlet was tastefully decorated by two ladies themselves. There is an antique two faced clock on the wall adding to its uniqueness. The outlet walls were decorated with tasteful wallpapers. Chinese bamboo sticks is a novel idea. Cane chairs and tables and low stools make up for the seating arrangement. I also loved a bamboo mat wall hanging on which Chandreyee has put up one of her paintings. 
A tiny passage beautifully utilised.
Food came within appropriate time. The sandwiches were beautifully rolled up in tissue paper. The coffee came in a Tibetan mug with lid and it tasted good. All my weariness went away after tasting it. The bread used in the sandwich is, however, small, but that‚Äôs all right for me because I don‚Äôt like large sandwiches. 
All I can say is that they are trying their best. I wish them good luck and will go there again.

Perfect place for Pure Adda with friends at Dalchhut Restaurant near Jadavpur Thana ... excellent food ... excellent ambience ... artistic decoration... and all round performance by the Owner! We visited on 31st October 2017. we ordered Tea/Coffee plus dry chilli chicken and crispy chicken. It was delivered in 10 minuets and presentation was really appreciable. Food was really tasty and quality is well maintained. Only suggestion is to add small cushions on outside cane furniture to make it more comfortable. We spent there 2 hours . Definitely I recommend you to visit there and to try their food. It is 12 minutes walking distance from Jadavpur Thana towards Kalikapur or 5 minutes by auto or Bus.

I tried chicken pakora with black coffee. And the combi was delicious!! Pakora was crispy from outside and soft from inside. The presentation and overall service was very satisfactory. What I love most is the personal touch in their service. Its a must visit.
