The quality of food was good .However the decor and service was average. Tried chicken fried momos,egg fried rice ,lemon fish ,soup which were nice.For the noodles and the dry chilly chicken the quantity was less .

For the first year Chung Wahh was the best Chinese eatery in the locality. But with time, the quality has degraded tremendously. They compromise both with quality and quantity accompanied by a very high price surge. Most of the items on menu is not available. Waiters are unprofessional too. Sodepur do have better restaurants now with pocket friendly price and prompt service.

Amazing and authentic Chinese food. But most of the time a bit off beat dishes are unavailable. The can't serve max items in their menu. Theones the have taste really good. But they are few in number. Mocktails are horrible. Place us a bit overpriced as well.

If you are a pure chinese lover sugession would be not to go dis place.
Chinese dishes are not at all good.
We ordered two different chiken dishes but both are look same and taste same...

Staff behaviour is awful. Manager with no managarial skills. The restaurant immediately needs to change its set of employees if the authority is in a mood to let people feel the essence of the first served here. As of for now You can be there if you wish to spoil your mood of dining out even before you get to see the food.

Doesn't merit any review. Difficult to locate, average ambience, below average unprofessional staff and poor quality food. The same dish tastes different (read worse) everytime. As we pointed out an excess of salt in one of the dishes, rendering it impossible to eat, they neither changed nor waived the charges of the food, although we couldn't consume the serving!

This place has great ambience. For a single person, a date or a family gathering this is the place to be. The chinese is extremely delicious especially the noodles. The fishes are not the best but the chickens are just mouth watering. The only downside is you have to wait a long time for your food. Even simple dishes take a lot of time. Apart from that its a must try!

Liked the ambience. We ordered mixed fried rice, chung wah special Chowmin, American mixed chopsey, schezwan chicken, I found price a bit high as per standard. Most disappointing thing is we found a long strand of hair in our chopsey. We can not pay 300 rs for a human hair dish, they also tried to prove themselves as innocent by giving lame excuses. I am sorry...but my experience was not good.

What kicks the most about a restaurant for a middle class family is value for money.This provides it.
Hidden away in the interiors of sodepur (near to care/keyar more),this might be one of the largest restaurant in sodepur ,seating nearly 30-40 people.Done up in KFC colors of white and red,this is a nice little restaurant.
They could not serve rice noodles,because they were out of it.But it's okay.
They could not serve mixed rice or noodles,because they were not being able to source prawns in this scorching summer.But,its okay.
The chicken pieces were a little stiff.But ,its okay.
It is okay,because of value for money.
We ordered egg chicken noodles and fried rice and chilli garlic chicken and another chicken item.
The food arrived fast,and the waiters were good mannered.
This is one restaurant where you go,when you want to spend less and do not want to brave the kolkata traffic.

I had my first dining experience here last night. And it was awful. This restaurant is a disgrace in the name of original Chung Wah in central avenue. For food, the good item was fish finger, but the service was utter failure, no salad just a half cut lemon. We ordered mushroom Manchurian gravy and dry baby corn Manchurian. They served both dishes with same gravy preparation, which was quite different from what their name suggests. We asked to take back the gravy item, and give us the dry one. They just took out the baby corns from gravy and served in a plate. The mushroom tested very bad, which I think due to not frying it adequately. The service boys are like totally novice, and they were serving like in a road side dhaba, though dhaba people atleast know name of the food they are serving, but these boys had no idea.
This was my first and last day in this restaurant, don't know the authorities of central avenue Chung Wah knows about this namesake.

Tried to catch a Chinese feeling by grabbing a name. Wish they could have grabbed the authentic test also. Tried fried rice and chicken munchurian. Chicken was over spiced and hot fried rice was manageable but lacked the taste, kind of sweet, it was more like something between polao and fried rice.

Sodepur had always got its fair share or restaurants for the past 10 years and its still growing. There was no shortage of chinese cuisine here and when i saw chung wahh banner that it was opening on 14th feb, i was not that excited. Still after i went there for lunch, i was amazed with the interior, which i had never seen in sodepur before. And most importantly, the food was ama- wait for it- zing! Amazing! Now, i have become a loyal customer.

My college is at Sodepur. As it is now a part of Kolkata, big brands and big banners are must. I never heard of this place earlier as I was not a resident of West Bengal.  When I told my friend about this upcoming restaurant, she told me that it's one of the branches of Chung Wahh. I just said "So?" with a grin and she replied "Coming Sunday". 
After tuition classes, with an almost empty stomachs we entered there and took a two seated table. Now starts my review.
First, the place. The restaurant is decorated like any other authentic Chinese restaurants. We went there at day time; so don't know whether the lightings are also like the Chinese ones. But we can hope to be. After all it's Chung Wahh. The place is bit congested. Ambience is pretty good.
Now, the food. We ordered Chicken Schezwan Noodles and Chicken Soup Noodles. The quantity of the Schezwan Noodles is quite less compared to price; but taste was good. And the soup noodles, I loved it. If you are on diet but want to dine out, go for this. Though it is totally a boiled dish, but you will love it if you add little salt and pepper. THAT'S ALL.

First visited this place within a week after its opening. Been there with family and friends more than four times. The ambience is really good compared to the area,as there is no other good restaurants nearby. It's near Sodepur station and easily accessible from both Khardah n Sodepur.
I had tried their Crispy chicken and chicken spring roll from the starter section. Trust me,they tasted good,though the quantity of crispy chicken is too less.
Their Chicken Manchurian, Chilli chicken and Schezwan chicken..all tasted the same. I told them every time to make the dish spicy ,but each time they turned out to be same sweet flavoured.The Chilli Lemon Chicken was horrible, as it was just chicken and lemon in some sugary syrup,though when asked they said it was supposed to be hot n spicy.
The rice items were good. There was not much variety or any in the Dumpling section.
Staff behaviour was good and they were helpful.
Overall its a good restaurant,as we don't have much of a 'taste buds' variety in this locality.
But the food is not exactly like actual chinese food. Food quality is medium.Can be visited with family.Every time I went there it was always crowded.

I was pleasantly surprised to see a new restaurant on the block, given that there are so few around in this area. The 1st time I called, I was told that food cannot be home delivered because it was late (I had called at 9.30pm). The next time I called (around 7.30 pm) I was told that it is too early and for home deliveries I must call after 8.30pm. I did and ordered for my food. Since this was a new place for me, I wanted to try a few stuff. I ordered for their mixed fried rice, garlic chicken, and sweet n sour fish. The fried rice was decent and the only reason why I am taking the trouble of rating and reviewing this place. Both the other dishes were dismal. The garlic chicken tasted like chicken in tomato ketchup. And the lesser I speak about the fish, the better. It was fish in some sweet gravy and sweet enough to make it inedible. Yes, we had to throw it away. I have had sweet n sour dishes - both fish and chicken at quite a few places but this one was a disaster beyond repair. And btw, who puts cucumber in a sweet and sour sauce?
I was also amazed at the fact that packaging charges mention the container charge. Check out the pic of the bill. I haven't been witness to this kind of charge in any place and it is new experience for me.
I will give this place another chance and hope that I have better things to say about them by then!

Today we brought food from Chung Wahh Sodepur. Food quality is good and is of proper Chinese taste. We ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian and sweet n' sour fish for 4 people and the pocket pinch is around 1000. I really liked the Chicken preparation and the fish was good too and one thing they used pure vetki in their fish preparation. If you are fond of Chinese food then u must try Chung wahh. They have a home delivery facility too.

Sitting arrangement is good with a soothing music.

Ambiance: good..hygiene: good...food: yummy..quantity: quite filling..pocket pinch: not so much...service: not satisfying...overall a good experience and would be frequently visiting this place..apart from the inexperienced waiter everything was good..my personal favorites are crispy fried baby corn and crispy fried prawn, drums of heaven and the mixed hakka noodles. They have a long list mocktails in their menu but none of those were available :-( hope they make available when next time I visit the place

Been there for a quick pick up of some snacks. Quantity and food quality was good. Ordered chicken lollipop and that was well packed and was tasty.

Overall a go if you are at Sodepur. Of course can not be compared with standard Chinese restaurants of proper Kolkata.

Been to this restaurant yesterday. The ambiance is quite good but the quality of food isn't. This restaurant serves the worst Chinese I've ever had.

The ambiance of the restaurant is one of the finest in Sodepur. Huge crowd.

Foods are pathetic Chinese not authentic Chinese. Sweet corn chicken soup is good as desert rather than appetizer. Steamed chicken is raw chicken in sauce served cold  ( had to throw) tasteless. Mixed chow are better tasted on roadside.

Service is chaos. All running aimlessly and the customers are agape. Empty table front with lots of customers sitting. Management horrible.

Overall pathetic experience, will not recommend anyone.

I have been to this restaurant a couple of times. Worst chinese food i have ever eaten. Fried rice just just yuuks. Thai garlic chicken and chilly chicken is just ball of flour. Very small chicken pieces and tasteless. I didnt find anything of this restaurant good except the ambience. Service is poor also. There are lots of other restaurants in sodpur like penguin outlets,disha,delicious and many more.they provide mucj better dishes than this restaurant. So skip this. Dont waste your money and time here.

The interior is well decorated. The ambience is also good.
The quantity of food is good. ENOUGH for 2 people.
Pocket friendly.
Serves good quality food.
One problem is there and that is the service is very bad. The waiters are not well trained.
