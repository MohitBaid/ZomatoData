What a place! Absolutely wonderful. I went with friends but it‚Äôs so romantic and yes definitely going back with my loved one. The food was delicious especially bailey‚Äôs murgh malai. The service is a bit slow but the ambience is amazing so we can ignore that part. Recommending everyone to visit this amazing place üëçüèª

Though the place is very classy and the Ambience is great...service is just pathetic. Can't expect this kind of service from the brand it belongs to. Hookah was good though we got it after waiting for more than an hour. Food quantity is too little.

I would rate it zero if I could... The view the look and feel of d place is really good... But it's really sad as there's rarely anyone who would visit this place again beyond their first experience...
1)the food choice is limited, chances of you going hungry is high
2) even if you choose to come here only for drinks still the service is sloooowww
3) it was very evident that they cheated on the qty of alcohol too
4) staff untrained and can't resolve any issue of the diner

The only thing that works here is the view. Apart from this one should be careful about the following 

1. No Valet Parking : How can u not provide valet for customers coming to a boutique hotel ?

2. Service is very slow and lost. They seem to be untrained

3. The menu is really fancy with no proper thinking put into the dishes in sense of accompaniments. One dish is not wholesome in any way. The combination is either a hit or complete miss

4. The food that comes out of the kitchen is delayed and that's a major concern. I would wish you improve on the above. 

5. A complete lounge feel . This place reminds me of the Smoke Shack in south kolkata. Went here before New Years and will hopefully come by again in this year.
