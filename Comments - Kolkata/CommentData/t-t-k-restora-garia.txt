I have had rolls from this place many times and they were decent. I went there to have chinese cuisine and the food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Service and ambience were so-so.

FINAL VERDICT- Its a decent place but as mentioned above, nothing extraordinary about it.

For Chinese food this is best in Garia perhaps. Ambience is fabulous. Foods were too delicious. I visited many times. They take a little bit time to serve order though but that's worthy. It's good restaurant for both family and friends.

First of all,the restaurant will you give trouble to find it.Once you're inside,you may find the place not so big.But I guarantee that it has a soothing ambience and the food quality and price are at balance.During pujas,due to overcrowding,they open their top floor too.

Visited 3 times and yet they fail to impress me. Food is good. Ample quantity. Price is reasonable. But the area is poorly lit, minimal decor, poor service. Ordered Chinese and biriyani and loved it. Singapore mixed rice, schezuwan chicken and fried chicken momo was good. A good place for home delivery. Need to change the decor and services to attract more customers.

They served fish fry but did not served cold drinks even after reminding about cold drinks once again .... When I complained about the service to the owner/manager, I don't know...

Though the restaurant may not be as popular as some other local biggies, but their food really stands out. From tongue tingling Fish Pakora to Singapore Mixed Rice and Chicken Butter Masalas. This small hideout will serve you almost anything.

Location : Near Garia Andrews College, beside Khoshla Electronics.

Landmark : Dinabandhu Andrews College.

Metro : Garia, Kabi Nazrul metro station.

Food quality : They not only serve real good quality food but you can actually see their hard work in evry dish you order. Serves chinese predominantly, but their North Indian is also top notch. Voila!!! I always make it point to visit this place if i have to visit Garia for any reason. Really a hidden gem.

Ambience : Not so good. AC restaurant with cushioned seats and sofas. Dimly lit to give it a Fine dine touch, but it fails actually. 

Staff : Very well mannered. Not so well dressed, but very attentive and polite.

Food recommendation : Mutton Biriyani...Yes! Yes! I know i said its predominantly chinese, but this one dish of their's tastes so divine, heavenly, delicious and breath taking. The mutton/chicken piece is Large and coated with a never-tasted-before gravy...thats so so tasty. Chinese? I can order anything, but the Lemon Chicken...thats a no for me..sorry!! :( 

Fish fingers, Singapore Mixed Rice, Garlic Chicken and Drums of Heaven are my suggestions.

Cost : Easy on the pocket. Moderately priced. 

Serve time : Moderate.

Pros : Obviously the food, the staff management and the homely informal atmosphere.

Cons : Ambience. 

VERDICT : Good for a sudden family dinner plan, birthday treats or afternoon after-college quick snacks or lunch. Not for formal outings at all.

Soumen' Ratings :-

Food quality : 4.5/5
Ambience : 3.5/5
Serve time : 4/5

Happy Food Hunting....!! :D 
chow chow!!

Have visited dis place many-a-times due to its very near from my home. I find the food obviously certain specifics quite good here. The value for money is also good as per as the quantity and quality is concerned. Though service is a bit time consuming and the staffs are not well-learnt. Kindly check the bill because unfortunately everytime there is a wrong calculation. Try their rice noodles, fried rice collection, fried chicken momo, garlic chicken, coriander chicken, lemon chicken, virgin mojito.

This used to be one of the best food joints in the locality. But with time the quality of food has detoriated exponentially. The owner doesn't have manners at all. Came for takeaway and asked for a glass of water. They told me drink it from the bottle outside.Also the food. Quantity was very less. Mixed hakka noodles was cold. The cabbage smelt a bit stale. The chilli fish was undercooked. To be precise don't vist this restaurant EVER. Negetive points should be allowed by Zomato. Restaurants like this deserve it.

This place has been the one of the oldest eateries in Garia (another being Relish). There was a time when everybody came here (specially for their juicy chicken rolls). The noodles dishes were also prepared well.

Had there been a provision of a negative marking, I would definitely have marked them negative. The owner definitely needs to learn how to talk to his customers. The one thing he understands is money. But, money can't really buy you the amount of customers whom you've lost cause of your reluctant behavior. The outdoor seating where rolls and moghlai paranthas are served are filled with mosquitoes and when one goes inside to complain, they say deal with it. Wow!
And yes of course food. Err, I mean the food with loads of oil and dalda, tastes pathetic. The indoor seating is no good either, the person can hardly see what he/she is eating cause of the red extra dim lighting they have.
WOULD DEFINITELY NOT GO INTO THIS TRASHY PLACE AND WOULD SUGGEST THE PEOPLE TO AVOID THIS PLACE TOO!

Very affordable and good food.Ideal for the students to hang out and have a good time when having a pocket cringe.

I ordered :- 

(1) Sweet Corn Chicken Soup. 

(2) Dry Chilli Fish.

(3) Chicken Fried Rice.

(4) Chicken Gravy Noodles.

(5) Chilli Chicken. 

(6) Chicken Biryani. 

The "Sweet Corn Chicken Soup" was very tasty.It had just the right proportion of chicken cubes,egg whites and sweet corn,It was a decent soup to have.

The  "Dry Chilli Fish" wasn't very impressive.The taste was not very good either.It was a bit too dry infact.
@
The "Chicken Fried Rice" was very tasty.The authentic Chinese aroma and flavour was present in the dish.The quantity is very good and the taste is even better.

The "Chicken Gravy Noodles" was filled with veggies and ample amount of chicken shreds.Just the right soupyness to add to the flavour.

The  "Chilli Chicken" was very tasty.Not too spicy not too dry and just the right quantity.A very tasty side to go with your main dish.

The "Chicken Biryani" wasn't very impressive.The very aroma of the ator and the spices of Biryani was missing.Not something I would suggest to order.

All in all a good dining experience and good ambiance. 

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

TTK is a very pocket friendly place. quantity of food is more than satisfactory for the price. Chinese dishes taste nice with their specific aroma. Ingredients they use are fresh. A value for money restaurant. Chinese food is far better than their North Indian counter part. Though for few Chinese dishes the ingredients, preparation and presentation along with its taste and flavor may vary frequently, its a good place to visit for unplanned party/dine out/treat.

Chinese food quality is at per or better than the other restaurants of same price tag.

Service and ambiance is good.

This is a very basic restaurant just opposite to Andrews College in Garia. Ambience is okay-ish. It has a fast food counter as well where Moghlai, Rolls are available. The egg/chicken roll is better than other counterparts in the area.

I visited the main restaurant once with my wife as we wanted to have a quick lunch (we were really hungry) , and we wanted to try out this place.

Service was not good , it took 25-30 mins to serve¬† us very basic Chinese dish.Waiter did not bother to serve.

We ordered Chinese (gravy noodles and chilly chicken(semi-Gravy)). Surprisingly food was good.Noodles was almost perfect. They gave broccoli in gravy noodles at this price range.None of the other counterparts in garia serve noodles with broccoli .We asked to add green chilly spices in our chilly chicken.Most of the restaurants fails to execute this customization , but it was perfectly executed.Only problem was the chilly chicken was not semi gravy.Though I personally feel that mistake was made by the waiter, not the chef.

In short ambience average, service bad, food good(Though we tried only Chinese).

Once upon a time this was one of the first fine dine- in restaurants that had came up in garia long time back. Now a days it has lost his quality, commitments and customer satisfaction.
It is not at all value worthy for any kind of good programme to be organised also they don't have any infrastructure nor any intention to develop, but plenty of commitments can be received before finalizing any contracts.
They don't bother about customer satisfaction, except money,nor having any courtesy to admit their lagging's.
The biriyani is not at all good,rest the chineese may be so so..
It is not at all good to organise any party there..
Lastly i would say , pls try to avoid the place.......

Previously, food was really great here but now it is just good. Rolls and Mughlai are great. If you prefer dalda free ones, they will make that. Most of their Chinese food are tasty. The Momos were very big is size but I didn't like those much. Even the fish finger didn't taste that good.

The staffs think of themselves minister or vip or something like an emperor and treat like you are not paying for the food, rather begging for food... they will feel disturbed if you ask for extra onion or sauce and frown at you as if you've asked for gold or something like very precious thing! If you go to order something for parcel, you are not allowed to sit in the restaurant, no matter if the restaurant isn't full and it's raining hard or if it's scorching heat outside, you HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE! The quality of food is worst comparing to the other restaurants in garia...

First couple of months it had restored its glory, but later on due to many reasons it had detoririated from its former glory food quality wise, service wise. This is tucked into a small lane after crossing andrews college, on the opposite side. They are serving both chinese and indian. Few months back had dropped in with few friends. We got both of the cuisines, biryani and chap was not good at all given that the price they are charging. Chinese was better though the rice we took had a kind of weird smell, felt like not fresh at all. All in all this restaurant should really stop serving such bad food.
After few present visits i would like ti change my rating from 3 to 3.5 just because for the taste and quality of food i got served with at this place, off late.
Mixed gravy noodles and chicken 65 is a deadly combo! They serve pan fried noodles with a bowl full of gravy, which goes so well with the noodles. I was surprised to get such good quality food at ttk! Now these tops my chart in garia for reasonably delicious chinese.

T.T.K Restora is situated near Garia Andrews College.They serves costly food with their bad behaviour.The environment is not so bad.They also serves fast foods.The rolls are very delicious without sauce because the sauce is very tart.
Overall it is a good restaurant in Garia more.

This restaurant is known as one of the popular one near garia area. But Frankly speaking i didnot find this restaurant that much good. They arent impressive with their ambience and quality of food. Though the quantity of the food is sufficient for two. I remember having chicken gravy chowmin. I felt there was something missing in it. Anyway. I rate this 3.5

It is one of the oldest restaurants in garia. Popularly known for the Rolls they serve. Located beside Khoshla Electronics opposite to Andrews College. The food is quite affordable. Quality is nice. Ambience...not bad. Service is nice. But there is no parking slot. It is a good place for a family hangout.

What's up with the low ratings for this gem of a place?¬†
Location: Almost opposite to Andrews college, you have to enter a by-lane to enter the restaurant.¬†
Decor: The restaurant lacks the finesse of good interiors but more than makes up for it with its quality of food.¬†
Food: Chicken Kathi rolls are lip-smackingly delicious. Probably the best rolls in the entire Garia region. And it's huge in size. I've always ordered Chinese at this joint and never disappointed by the quality and quantity of the items. Chicken Fried Rice, Noodles and Chilly Chicken are a must try.¬†
Overall: Great Chinese Food and Fabulous Rolls. Pocket-friendly and a really busy place due to the proximity to the college where most youngsters love to get a quick bite.

A little restaurant tucked away in a side street of Garia. Good place to freak-out with friends and err.. sometimes with family.

Comparing the neighborhood the ambiance is good enough with a dark environment...

You may go for their Rolls ‚Äòn Chinese dishes.

Although the food was okay the customer service was not. Over the course of our meal we were constantly getting rushed. It was obvious they were trying to have a quick turnover but please don't rush your customers. For this reason I will be in no rush to go back.

The kathi rolls are absolutely heavenly ones. I have had rolls all over the city but this place wiƒ∫l always be on the top if i am considering the southern fringes of the city. The taste of their rolls is amazing, and they use less oil and masala. The service is pretty quick and location is also very convenient. Parking is the only problem.

A quite homely atmosphere indeed & serves tastier dishes to comprehend your appetite. Though the serving time taken is quite long but it adds sauce to your hunger. Try ordering Chinese delicacies since they specialise in those dishes. Seating is quite good enough to suit your bodily structures & lastly great dishes at reasonable prices. The closest landmark to reach the restaurant is just adjacent opposite to Dinabandhu Andrews College; Garia. Do visit the place & quench your thirst of having good food. Keep Zomatoing people...!!!

Ttk Restora is locates opposite Andrews college in garia. You have to get into a gali in front of which they've installed a new signboard which is quite visible from the main road. 
They have a soothing lighting theme, only to be set back by a horrible playlist , which customers repeatedly request to switch off. The restaurant is small n comfy, and the food is mediocre. Overall just a neighbourhood small scale restaurant .
Pros : 
1. They have an efficient home delivery system
2. The rolls at the outside counter are pretty tasty n cheap
Cons :
1. Horrible music
2. No parking space 
3 its mediocre. Nothing more
Items you could try :
Rolls

A restaurant located opposite Andrew's college inside a lane which is nearly impossible to find unless you see the huge sign placed on the main road pointing at the direction.
The ambiance there, is the dim lights and nothing else.
Its a ¬†place which really has a bonding with your pocket and would not rip a hole.
Be it rushing Durga Puja hours or a laid back noon on a laid back day, the restaurant doesn't disappoint..it might not serve out extraordinaire food but decent food which you gulp down real happily without thinking of throwing up.
The chow-meins,fried rice are served well in quantity as well as quality but the side dishes lacks quantity and might be insufficient for two.The biriyani is also cooked well, so is the chaap but they do tend to screw up the meat pieces so "BE EXTRA SURE TO TELL THEM TO SERVE A GOOD PIECE OF MEAT".
A decent restaurant if you want to just eat or spend less, a plate of chicken chowmein and a plate of chicken fried rice and a chicken preparation costs less than Rs. 500 and that too it is very much eatable (go figure).
Same for two plates of mutton biriyani and a mutton chaap.

Well, this restaurant did save me during the durgapuja as it was one of the few restros open near garia more.
The food they delivered are not so much a pleasure to have. Its nice if you are running on a low budget. The staff was a bit rude. I just asked him why would he take 15-20 mins to ready 3 plates of fried rice. He gave me a grave look and said that it is normal here in a harsh manner. I didn't enjoy the food back in my home. Also, the quantity was very low than any other retros of that standard.
I won't be going back I guess. Also, you have to park your car far from the place as the restro is on the busy street.

Whenever I get hungry and am near garia bus stand area, T.T.K is the place i would walk upto for a snack. There sitting arrangement is big but the furniture are not maintained like before and their lighting is shabby. But the chicken Lolipop , pan fried momos, egg chicken rolls and mutton roll surely draws me here time and again. The food here is a bit on the spicy side, the cost is harmless, it is always crowded with poeple so it takes time to make the food. They have a huge variety of snack items which are worth a shot but I am a regular of the aforementioned items only. THe Lolipop is really good, enough meat, well fried and well tossed in sauce with good amount of veggies given. Their Panfried momo is a similar version to the lolipop only in the kind of momo. their chicken egg roll is big and satisfactory and mutton rolls are also nice for palette but bad for heart (too much oil which makes the mutton tasty!). So, garia has one place to offer good snack when in need.

The ambience is good but can be far more better if the music is properly set.The food quality is great.Try the dry chili chicken dish and chicken soup. Staff is also good and the best par they dont demand for an extra tip.Its totally upto u.

Whenever I get hungry and am near garia bus stand area, T.T.K is the place i would walk upto for a snack. There sitting arrangement is big but the furniture are not maintained like before and their lighting is shabby. But the chicken Lolipop , pan fried momos, egg chicken rolls and mutton roll surely draws me here time and again. The food here is a bit on the spicy side, the cost is harmless, it is always crowded with poeple so it takes time to make the food. They have a huge variety of snack items which are worth a shot but I am a regular of the aforementioned items only. THe Lolipop is really good, enough meat, well fried and well tossed in sauce with good amount of veggies given. Their Panfried momo is a similar version to the lolipop only in the kind of momo. their chicken egg roll is big and satisfactory and mutton rolls are also nice for palette but bad for heart (too much oil which makes the mutton tasty!). So, garia has one place to offer good snack when in need.

My mother and I were strolling in Garia when we thought of eating something and my mum took me here. 
It is located in an alley and I never knew this place exists there :p
Anyway, it is a quaint little place with a few tables, dim lights and one particular very loud waiter .
We weren't much hungry, so I just ordered a paneer roll and fresh lime as masala cold drink wasn't available. 

The fresh lime came in a few minutes and it was probably the worst fresh lime I've had in my life. I mean yeah, how can someone go wrong with the fresh lime?? But well, they do. 
The paneer roll was equally bad and my mother put in after the first bite, 'bichhiri'. Indeed. 

However, I don't even know why but I'll be coming here to sample their Chinese and North Indian affair.. Guess it's because of the ambience which I found very sweet.

After visiting this restaurant only thing I can say that this is budget restaurant with a semi beautiful environment . I had ordered Chicken Bullet !! and Hariyali kebab. the Hariyali Kebab was not good at all but Chicken Bullet was something,I can not say it was awesome but can't forget the deliciousness of the dish.

Another example of how shameless and insensible a restaurant can be. Inspite of repeated complains the quality of food that are served here hasnot been improved. Moreover, on such special ocassions, like durga puja,it seldom serves stale food to its customers. With the only advantage of possessing a soothing eating environment, this restaurant is a nightmare for all the foodaholics to whom taste and quality of food matters the most.

Sometimes even a small place has lot to offer, all you need to do is discover it at the right time. This just happened to me a few months back.  Ravenously hungry, I was looking for a proper restaurant to have my dinner when I discovered this place, tucked up in a small alley, hidden from the eyes of most foodies. I was wondering how come I missed this place inspite of staying in Garia for a long time. Anyway I walked in, hoping to fill my empty stomach with a little titbit. I must say what I got here was far above my expectation.

As soon as I entered, I was greeted by a courteous waiter who showed me my place, a corner seat that was cosy and comfortable.  Casually I flipped through the pages of their menu card and ordered some chicken baby corn soup as an appetizer. The menu card displayed plenty of delicious items. I just asked the waiter to give me some time to decide. In the meantime, I enjoyed a bowlful of steaming hot soup, which was delious, and flipped through the pages for my dinner pick. After pondering a little, I settled for some chicken Manchurian rice, Cantonese chicken and hot garlic fish.

I must say food was mouthwatering! Whether it was Manchurian rice, Cantonese chicken or garlic fish, each item tasted awesome. The best part is I didn‚Äôt have to wait long. The food arrived, steaming hot and a delicious aroma filled the room, within 20 minutes.  The food was also served in good quantity. (I could not finish all the items and had to ask the waiter to pack the remaining in separate containers.) As compared to other restaurants, the price of each item is quite reasonable.  Apart from Chinese delicacies, you can also enjoy Indian cuisine here. Just try a masala kulcha, murg jugalbandi or chicken korma or some mutton curry or kadai paneer. I'm sure you'll find the food lipsmacking. So, drop in here anytime and fill your empty stomach with delicious Chinese and Indian delicacies.  

With a full stomach, I wondered how come I missed this place, though so many times I have walked past it. Anyway, it‚Äôs never too late for anything. Now that I have discovered this resturant, I‚Äôm going to enjoy many more meals here.

food is AWFUL... HORRIBLE.... ESPECIALLY IF ITS TAKE-AWAY... since you wont come back from your home with stale food, they give the worst things left from the past year maybe in your food... 2 times this has happened... the first time, it was Mutton Biriyani... the mutton was stale.... thought of giving them a second chance.... this time in chinese... the shrimp was stale... i had to throw away the whole dish.... think twice before visiting this place....

Average for a local (Para) restaurant.  The food is good, the ambiance is ok, they don't make you wait.  Try cantonese chicken.  The snacks counter serves "A" quality rolls.

Added In March 2015
Over the years the food quality of the place has improved to a good extent. ¬†The chinese dishes mainly. They also have home delivery now and the home delivery is prompt. ¬†If you are hosting a small party of 20-22 people you can try them out. ¬†The rolls still remain A class and filling.
