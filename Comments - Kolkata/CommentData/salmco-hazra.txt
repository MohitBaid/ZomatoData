Salmco is a small eatery located at Hazra, mainly sells South Indian dishes.

Service is fast.

Tried Butter coconut Masala Dosa & Masala Lassi. Dosa was very nice. Lassi was quite enjoyable.

Pocket pinch is cheap.

This is a small food joint for south Indian dishes and also lassi. The dosa is main item in the list and they make good preparation of the same. I had a butter masala cheese dosa and lassi and liked it.

Convenient location just opposite of Hazra Radha Krishna temple. Very fast service with fresh ingredients. Very reasonable price. Butter Coconut Masala Dosa is highly recommend.

This is a very small outlet right at hazra crossing. It mainly serves South Indian food along with some other breakfast items. I had lassi here which was quite delicious. Looking forward to try other items as well.

Great food, but the info given here is wrong.
Either way it is dirt cheap and the quality is also very good.
