You can't miss it's paneer paratha. Too good. I became fan instantly. Prices reasonable and at Ultadanga, such a great taste is hard to find. For me it's high five any given day.

Yesterday,ordered masala pomfret fish and rohu fish curry for lunch via Swiggy. Packing was nice and delivery was bang on time . The former was fried fully and was a bit rich in taste whereas the latter was nicely prepared containing various flavours in right proportions. Was damn hungry, so forgot to click pics in jiffy. ðŸ˜œðŸ˜›. But overall nice experience. Will try other dishes next time.

I ordered mutton biriyani and to my utter surprise I couldn't find the frigging mutton! And to add to it, ambience wasn't that good there. I wouldn't recommend any of my firends there. Sorry to say.

Quality Food with Friendly Conduct. Really Good Service. I have taken Biriyani. Quantity & Quality both are enough for an adult. Wish to come again.

When u r hard on budget this is an awesome  choice if u r around Ultadanga area. The prices are inclusive of taxes and very cheap. The location is also very easy just beside Sourav's sweet shop. Simple place. Decor is good. Staffs were non-fussy and well behaved. We ordered Chicken fried rice and Chicken 65 gravy. The side dish was good compared to the main course. Over-all good.

Multicuisine restro in ultadanga area, just 5 Min walking distance from bidhan nagar station. First time I went there with my family for lunch. Thali was good & Quantity was decent. Bt 2nd time I felt bad when I ordered home delivery over the phone. Quantity of Hakka noodles & Fried rice both were very less. Taste was so so. Chilli chicken was average. I heared that their north indian dishes are good. So I will try. Staffs are good. I am giving 2.5 Stars.

This restaurant has a branch in Howrah. We often order Chicken Tikka Butter Masala via Swiggy from the Howrah outlet. It provides 8pcs of chicken at 220 bucks in the medium-sized white containers. The quantity is sufficient for 3 people. I ordered the same dish from this outlet in person and was dumbstruck. The container was a small one. The chicken pcs were almost half compared to the Howrah outlet and even the taste was not up to the mark. Either the Ultadanga outlet is not governed by the same owner or they provide better quality when an order is placed via Swiggy. Anyway highly disappointed.

Location - few meters From the ultadanga railway station & Beside the Sourav's.
Date - 25/09/17
It was Panchami ( Durga Puja started already ),after completing our Pandel hopping , we were literally starving so we are looking for a good restuarant in a pocket friendly Price..
I searched in Zomato & Find this restaurant.
We decided to landed here for two reasons first one was this restaurant is very close to ultadanga railway station & we have to catch our next train.. and the second one was they have good options in food.
Coming to the food --- we ordered ->
1) Chicken Noodle ( 2Plate )
2) Chicken Tikka Kebab ( 1plate )
3) Chilly Chicken ( 1plate )
Chicken tikka kebab was amazing , juicy & well cooked.
Chicken noodle was average in taste, the chicken in the noodle was cold .
Chilly chicken was again Good.
Overall a mixed up experience but I think in puja season every restuarant is jam packed so that's why sometimes the quality degrades a little bit.. Never Mind !!
Interior was typical a normal AC restuarant.
Staffs were good & the service was quick..
I recommended it cause they serve good food in a pocket friendly Price range in ultadanga area..

I have tried home delivery from this place twice for both North Indian and Chinese items.Firstly the pricing is very affordable, comparing the quantities I would say the North Indian dishes are more in quantity compared to the Chinese dishes.The first time I tried some paneer butter masala and Chicken 65.The chicken 65 was very different,a mix of dry chilli chicken with curry leaves,not like the authentic 65 recipe but it tasted good.But the chicken pieces were very small and two side dishes were not enough for four people.On the second try I had masala kulcha,cheese gatlic naan,mutton kalimirch and chicken sweet and sour.For the last item I had ordered the dry version from the starters but I basically recieved a pool of gravy again with very small chicken pieces.The breads on the other hand were huge,freshly made and tasted very well.The gravy of the mutton kalimirch was really good,rich and had a strong flavour of black pepper.But the mutton pieces again were variable,two were mini sized bites and was very chewy,the other two pieces were well cooked, moderately sized and soft.

So overall after this two try,this is a place were you can definitely have nicely cooked food but this will not be a remarkable place or on the priority lists.

A decent pocket friendly place for having some quality food... It is a non AC resturent with good clean n clear decor n ambiance... Staffs are not trained but the quite courteous to attend each and every table and serving with a smile... Service was fast too... We orderd for a mixed hakka chowmin and half plate dry chilli chicken... Both were really well made and tasted very good... We also parcled a chicken biriyani... As the server said it is one of their speciality... It was also decent nothing extra ordinary... Recommended for having budget meals...

**Got it DELIVERED at Home**

Food - Ordered Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Mixed Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken.
ðŸ’¥Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was good to taste but lacked in quantity. Not value for money!
ðŸ’¥Mixed Fried Rice was okay. Quantity wise satisfying.
ðŸ’¥Garlic Chicken was just okay. The pieces were good. But the gravy tasted like all the mirchi powder dropped in. Please do look after that 

Service - It took almost an hour to get it delivered. 

Overall, you may give it a try for Home delivery. Ain't that bad ! ðŸ˜Š

I have been to this place on two occasions and I must say, I have been extremely satisfied with their quality and quantity. Â They have variety of Tandoor Item - i have tried their Pomfret Tandoori... it was good size and extremely tasty. Â They have a special item called Pomfret Malai Posto... which is a unique dish. Â Wonderful flavor!! Â Do try out this place if you have a knack for fine Indian and Tandoori food. Â I recommend this to all foodies :-)
