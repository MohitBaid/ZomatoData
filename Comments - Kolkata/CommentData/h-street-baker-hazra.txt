I had ordered a chocolate mousse cake for my brother  and bhabhi's anniversary. 
First of all the fondant creation of two elephants holding each other's trunk on a bed of lil hearts was super cute and adorable.
Secondly the cake got over within minutes of being cut!! 
Hands down the best bakery I have ordered from!! 
They also have amazing red velvet brownies,  blueberry cupcakes and their red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting is to die for.!!
I would say blindly order as their quality is supreme and budget friendly as well!!

If you are looking for a those perfect cakes which will drool your guests over, this is the place . Have tried lots of stuff from here like the red velvet brownie, chocolate brownie , m&m cake, chocolate cake, blueberry cupcakes and trust me all were delicious. The chef has been trained in taj bengal and has immense knowledge of what she does . Higly recommended .

It was pre-decided between me and Anamitraa Chakraborty to opt for sweet treats after lunch at Ammini.We pre-ordered a box of red velvet brownies(6pieces) and 4 white chocolate and cookie bar 24hrs prior to collecting the order.We collected it infront of Jain group apartment at hazra road.

•Red velvet brownie-I have never tried anything like this before..all the brownies I ever had are dark/milk chocolate based.But the moment we opened the box the excessive red hue on the brownie..bordering on a fluorescent appearance turned us off.Didn't taste good too.It was overly sweet and tasted like poor quality sondesh.Sizes were small too.Not at all worth the price we paid for it.

•White chocolate and cookie bar-Thankfully we bought this..it lifted our mood up from the sad experience we had with the brownies.The white chocolate had a silky smooth texture with oreo cookie crumbles perfectly blended in it.Loved it to the fullest.Totally worth trying!

I hope they improve on the size and more importantly taste of the brownies.Excessive use of artificial colouring agents in red velvet brownies should not be done.They should also introduce more variety in their spread of desserts.

They truly know how to make some real brownies. I had them at the KFB Bake Sale last month and they were one of the best brownies I have ever had in my entire life, no kidding. The soft crunch at the top, the fudgy centre, the chocolate coating the insides of my mouth after the first bite, it was just amazing!

Ordered a Birthday cake yesterday and it was really delicious. Seriously, it will leave your tongue an everlasting impact. I liked the packaging too. They made the design as I told them and it looked great. I ordered them at evening & picked it up next day afternoon. Keep it up..

By far the best brownies I have ever eaten. A sweet tooth's paradise. A must try for dessert and non-dessert lovers! Can't wait to be back in Calcutta and order more!
