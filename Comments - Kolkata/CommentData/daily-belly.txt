I had a sandwich with cheese and corn. I liked it very much. The price are resonable. Also my friends order smoothy and pancakes. Which are also good.

Was looking for a quick snack in office on a Friday evening, so decided to try out this new delivery outlet. I ordered Paneer Cheese Sandwich and Carrot Pancake, and the delivery was quite fast. The Carrot pancake was quite a surprise, as I expected simple flat pancakes, but instead got pancakes served in kebab styled skewers, and damn it was tasty. The sandwich was tasty and wholesome, the filling was too good, and the portions were big enough for me to skip dinner. This was a welcome surprise, and am gonna order from this place a lot.

Good, quality food delivered right at the doorstep. We tried Chicken Cheese, Chicken Mayo, Cheese and Corn sandwiches from the list of available items. Being a new food joint, I was not really expecting an expert touch but their food just proved me wrong. Amazing guys, way to go and keep up the quality. As an add on note, serving grilled sandwiches won't be a bad idea. Cheers!
