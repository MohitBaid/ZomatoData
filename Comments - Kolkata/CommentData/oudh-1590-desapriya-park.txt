This place lives to it's repute that it has created within few years time..Amongst the best Awadhi Cuisine fare spread available anywhere in Kolkata.The ambience is top notch...Service is impeccable..Staff behaviour is very cordial...And Yes the Food which is obviously the best part...Had Galawati Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha...Soft succulent melt in your mouth kebabs which is reminiscent of The World Famous "Tunday Kebabi" and yes it did bring back memories of Lucknow for me..Paratha is very flaky and less oily....The star of their menu ' Raan Biryani'...Safe to say amongst the best biryanis I have had in a long time.....Very North Indian Awadhi style....Fluffy rice...Like a Yakhni Pulao...Mutton is very tender...Quantity sumptuous...Mutton Nargisi Kofta very well prepped again...a must have too...To finish the meal had their Shahi Tukra and Firni......Heavenly...Blissfull...Condiments are great too..esprcially the Khubani Aachar.Please maintain the standards; is my earnest request.Being from the same fraternity it gives me immense pride to write this review and share my thoughts.Keep up the good work.Stay blessed! :)

It is located in the lane just beside Sharma which is on the main road. It usually stays filled as they serve one of the most authentic Awadhi cuisines in the city. The place is quite dimly lit and the ambience, crockery, interior everything is about Mughal dinning. 

My all time favorite is the Rann Biryani. This is the only biriyani I love to have even when it doesn't contain aloo. It has shredded pieces of mutton and beautiful aroma of the spices and ghee. 
The Galawati kabab is spicy and tastes best with Lucknowi paratha. The paratha is perfectly soft and thin. 
I had tried their Qalmi chicken recently and I liked it too. Juicy and tender chicken legs were great for starters.
At few occasions I had issues with their over use of spices and they replaced the dish or even suggested us to change the item. 
Overall, I like this place.

We went on the last week of December,though kebab festival was going on we opted for their few signature dishes...
#Galauti_kebab-It was delicious,tasty,yummy,well-cooked,the kebab was tender,and the smoky effect of the kebab was simply outstanding.
Coming to the main course,
#Raan_biriyani-It was made with pure ghee,zafran,n some special awadhi spices..The aroma was awesome.It was served in an earthen pot,the quantity was good, enough fr two people.The lipsmacking biriyani tasted great,the shredded lamb was soft n well cooked.A must try dish!.And it was completely different from other biriyanis of Kolkata...
#Chicken_Irani-Once again it was too good.The thick gravy was made with tomato,n other spices,it tasted great,and went really well with Raan biriyani.
The price was quite reasonable,pocket pinch for two was 1050 including GST.
Nice_ambiance
Beautiful_interiors
Staffs were well behaved,and courteous.
The music which they played was good, suited the ambiance,but the place was a bit more crowdy than usual days,may be for the festive season,besides all these I would love to go there n visit n try other dishes..

We went before New year's Eve...Though kebab festival was going on,but we chose the signature dish of Oudh 1590- Galauti kebab as starter, it was yummy, delicious, and the kebab was really tasty n tender,the smoky effect in the kebab was simply awesome, and I simply loved it,n would love to try once again.Then,in the main course we ordered Raan biriyani-it was served in an earthen pot, sufficient for 2 people,and it was made with pure ghee,jafran,n special awdhi spices,the lamb was shredded,it was soft,overall it was completely outstanding, and lipsmacking,it completely different from other places.As a side dish we took Chicken Irani-once again it was awesome.thick gravy made with tomato,n other spices,tasted great.Went well with Raan biriyani.
The staffs are well behaved,n courteous.
Loved the interiors,n the music.
But the place was a bit crowded than normal days,may be due to festive season,overall it was a great experience,pocket pinch was 1050 for two..
A place of worth visit,would like to go once again.

Oudh 1590 was in my bucket-list since the day when i read it's review in a news paper. When I finally visited this much-awaited place with my best friend, I was blown away by it's beautiful decor! And the song that was playing in the background gave us a more traditional feel. I must say, this place serves the best authentic awadhi cuisine in Kolkata. Galawati Kebab is their speciality and one must not leave the place without having a plate of it. By far, it's the best kind of Kebab that I had. Great food with a good quantity with that authentic taste and a lovely ambience, one couldnot ask for something more! It's a must-visit place for every foodie, and specially for those who love themselves to be called as 'Biriyani lovers'. I was also impressed by the great service and the hospitality by the staff members. It was a superb experience. Definitely looking forward to visit here again, and that too very soon! :)

For biryani lovers it's a paradise. Great mughlai dishes available. For those who don't like it so much, it's worthy of a visit too. Raan biriyani is simply awesome and a must try for all. Galawati kabab and lucknowi paratha in starter will be a good choice. They have an amazing aachar collection which will be present in every table. I like sweets the most.

Being a Biriyani Lover , OUDH 1590, was always there in my MUST TRY eatery List .Thought of starting the year 2k18 with Biriyani , so yesterday i was there for having dinner :) .Located at a few minute's walk from Lake Mall, this restaurant has earned eminence for its ambrosial food . Inside , its artful royal Nawabi themed designs with perfect adornments and the classical Ghazals playing in the background , surely will give a Royal feeling to an extent . 
We ordered the much talked about starter-->Galawati Kawab ,which actually managed to maintain its stature,was a delicious one (Must try) .Next we were served -->Raan Biriyani (1 is sufficient for two heads)with -->Ghost Bhuna .The biriyani was Perfectly cooked (though it was without Aloo{potato}. :(
I personally liked the Shredded Mutton concept. Actually it was a Mouthwatering one. The Ghost Bhuna was a little bit spicy and rich (may b bcz,my taste buds felt so) but the pieces given were not up to the mark and were a bit hard though it was tasty.(not recommended):(
The staffs are much courteous and amiable though we weren't given a separate table for 2 , reason being given was its a festive day and there's a huge queue waiting outside (justified enough) .
A bit overpriced , overall a very decent place to have Biriyani specially for Biriyani Lovers.. .

horrible place ...... A very simple suggestion to the management, please have basic features of phone reservations to avoid disappointment to your guests. Sometimes these small gestures and features make you a class apart from the lot of other eateries mushrooming around. I was very disappointed when I was refused a reservation on phone, however I walked in and registered  at the desk outside the Oudh @ Deshopriya park and I wasn't surprised that there was an hour waiting, again you didn't have proper arrangements to keep your guests seated ( a bench outside in the footpath under a tree..... it's a shame... that's what a local dhaba can do unless you would like to be compared in the same category). I had small kids so I requested the booking clerk to give me a call 15-20 minutes prior to availability of seats and I would pop in as I stay nearby .... I was told off that's it's against the company policy, I politely asked for them to show me the company policy and he said he doesn't have one...... thanks Mr Management of Oudh 1590 ...... I didn't realise we are not in a generation of 4G, wifi and smart phones but still in the era of 16th century. No matter how good your food is ....you will still be popular but slowly things will change weather you like or not.......

Also to add is it too much if we ask for a high chair!!!! 

The bad ordeal and poor show continues as we move to Oudh 1590 near Vivekanand park. After waiting for about 30 mins we finally get inside, but before he get time to sit and grave through the menu or before even the water is served we are forced to make a quick order. A prompt order is followed by a Horribly slow service, cold biryani ( not to mention chicken biryani served without chicken) , no nan as the tandoor has closed without telling guests that no further orders will be accepted. Horrible disgusting and a shame ...... a strict no no

It has been in my bucket list since a lomg time.Finally at the most awaited place for tasting the traditional mughlai dishes in authentic style..
As it was 31st..so there was a huge crowd.when we finally got the chance we found the place really well maintained.The decor was related to such historial views.Though the place was cozy but yet nice for lunch or dinner with family and friends.Now come to the food items.We ordered
Aam khaas
Galawti kabab
Raan biriyani
Gosht bhuna
Kulfi falooda
Aam khaas was the welcome drink.masaladar.nice.
We heard a lot about galawti kabab as their signature dish.I tasted it for the very first time.Four pc of kabab were served in one plate.I have not know the actual taste of authentic galawti kabab..but i liked it.one must try.
Now raan biriyani..it was quite different from the biriyani we usually have..mutton was smashed over here..I love the taste..Gosht bhuna..was my favourite one..awesome dish...highly recomended...
We ordered shahi tukra..but it was not here for this day..so we tasted kulfi..it was good.
Service was good..but for today as they have to manage such a huge crowd.i felt that they were in hurry while serving..
Last but not the least ; for tasting authentic mughlai dish in such a lovely flavour..one must visit Oudh 1590.

Amazing place to dine out with family and friends.. The decor takes you to the Mughal era, and it's quite spacious too. Coming to d food we ordered 
1.Mutton galawti kebab which was too good with lucknow paratha.
2. Next came Mutton raan biriyani (with no potato) which was lesser on the spicy side yet every morsel was worth drooling for, mutton pieces were really very soft.
3. We paired the biriyani with mutton rogan josh which is an all time classic and adequate for 2 persons. 
Definitely recommend this place.. we are sooooo coming back.

This is easily the best Biriyani restaurant in Kolkata and I have pretty much eaten at them all. Their Mutton Raan Biriyani is what I keep going back for. Among kebabs, I prefer their Kakori over Galawti. Staff are always polite and courteous, decor is muted and in-sync with the theme of the place. 
Reasonably priced considering the superlative quality of the food that they serve.

It is a great place to dine . The food quality is awesome. The must haves here are the Gwalatti kebabs, moist and tender ,they melt in your mouth. The biriyani here is very light and tastes really great. The other attractions on the menu card is the range of desserts available out of which the shahi tukra, gajar ka halwa and the kulfi were mouth watering.

A must visit place for biryani and Awadhi dishes. This  place which is located inside the hisdusthan park road. Though the place was at first difficult to find but  as we entered the experience made us happy. The place with their mughal period decor was really refreshing and a worthy experience. The music on the background almost transported us to the mughal period as well.Truly an wonderful experience.
Now the food, we ordered their Awadhi handi biriyani , murgh chap and tandoori roti. The food tasted great and specially the earthen pot concept was great. The taste and the aroma made us wanting for more.
The staff was courteous and dedicated and the total experience is a must visit for us and a good restaurant experience.

So It was a special day of my life so the place to had to be special...and what could be more special and royal than a restaurant that is know for its authenticity of Nawabi and Awadhi Style dishes...As soon as u enter the restaurant you are taken into a world of the royal heritages... the Nawabs ...the royalty...and you will feel like the kings nd the queen giving u a glimpse of that rich heritage...
Now moving onto the dishes..since it was our first visit we tried their signature dishes..
Starter:- Mutton galauti kabab and lucknowi paratha...it was simply yum..the mutton so soft nd tender it melts in ur mouth ...each bite is light but you can feel the burst of flavours in your mouth..the lucknowi paratha was a great choice which complimented it very well..they serve complimentary tomato chatni and pudina chatni and achar.
Main Course:- We Ordered the Raan Biriyani along with the Nehari Khas both being the signature dishes. The Raan Biriyani was served in an earthen pot and served with a complimentary raita.Let me tell you the quantity  is enough to satisfy two people.Raan biriyani was a delight it was really very tasty with the shredded lamb which was so well cooked and tasted so yum ...the dish is different from the bengali style biriyani ...its all about the flavour and the richness of texture as well with dum pukht style of cooking makes it all so delicious...the Nehari khas on the other side turned out to be equally delicious with the tasty mutton pieces which complimented the biriyani superbly.
Dessert- We were full by now..but still decided to go for the dessert to complete our hunger quest.So we ordered a Shahi tukra and Phirni ...The Shahi tukra really tasted yummy with the right amount of sweetness and so did the Phirni which hit the spot perfectly.
The bill was around 1400rs..and was worth every penny.The staff was also to the point being gentle and polite with their customers.Will definitely visit this place to try out more of their dishes.

A date with the special person calls for a dine-out at a mesmerising place to make the day even more memorable. Given that both of us are ardent foodies and we nurture a deep affinity towards Mughal cuisine, Oudh 1590 was our prioritised choice. The restaurant oozes with the classic “Nawabiana”. As you enter the restaurant, history grapples you altogether. The classical ragas playing incessantly in the background combined with the mystique lights, the impeccable wall paintings, impressive chandeliers, the touch of silky silhouettes enriched with royal colours, enticing work of embroidery on wooden facade, brass plates and cutlery and what not! It seems like each and every accessory concocts to create an ambience to bring forth the “Royal Mughlai” essence. The restaurant deserves an applause for crafting an environment that stands testimony to it’s name.

Coming on to food, we started off with Galauti Kebab and Chicken Kebab. The Galauti Kebab was a bit oily but nonetheless it was tasteful. It did remind me of the famous “Tunday Kebab” that I had had a few days back in Lucknow. The chicken kebab were served hot and the pieces were tender and succulent. From the main course we had Awadhi Biriyani. That was truly a wonder. I say this conviction that I have never had Biriyani cooked to such perfection. The long slender rice, rich aroma of a perfect blend of spices along with tender mutton pieces and eggs were something that calls for indubitable appreciation. We enjoyed it till the last grain. The raita was tasteful too. The food didn’t fail even by an inch to satisfy our palates.

After finishing the food, we had firni for dessert. That was another piece of wonder. It was enriched with the essence of saffron which made it even more alluring. I’d definitely recommend this place to everyone who’s a connoisseur of Mughlai/Awadhi delicacies. Wish to visit this place again.

Tested a wide range of biriyani's in my entire life, but Oudh 1590 stands tall between them. Heard from many sources that one should go and try Oudh at least once if he/she is a true biriyani lover. So one fine evening, got some time to go over there and it was totally worth it.
Okay, I am starting with the ambiance. As I stepped inside, I felt like I went back to some historic period. Felt myself like some kinda king 😃 The place was decorated with huge paintings and suitable lights and nice chanting type music was going on in the background.
For starter, we ordered Galawati Kebab. It was absolutely out of the world. It was so soft, as we put it into mouth, it just melted and vanished.
Then we took Rann Biryani. One handi is enough for 2. It was great. Its till in the top of the biryanis I have tasted across the city. When I asked the person who was waiting our table, he told that, the mutton used was marinated for 24-48 hours and they use some secret spices for that. Also we took Gosht Roghan Josh as side dish. That was also too delicious.
At the end I can say, our time and our money was totally worth it and waiting again for trying other dishes there.

Oudh is the place to go if you are craving authentic Lucknowi cuisine in Kolkata. The interiors are done beautifully and remind people of the era of nawabs and their manjlish. Slow gazals play in the background and the entire ambience enthralls the diners.

The food in itself is delightful but a special mention needs to be made for the kakori kebab, chicken awadhi biriyani and keema kaleji. The kakori is a special mutton kebab that just melts in your mouth. The keema kaleji is a minced liver curry and delectably spicy. The biriyani was light,oil free and came with soft, succulent chicken pieces.

The gajar ka halwa is just a little bowl of sunshine. It is creamy and fresh, with a hint of cardamom. Loved it!!!!

You are seriously missing out if you havent tried the food out here. Please visit it once and Oudh will charm you😊😊

They do justify awadhi biriyani. I belong to rare sub group of people who love their biriyani. I am extremely picky when it comes to biriyani... But thank you oudh for this biriyani, now i know awadhi biriyani is my forte. We ordered.
1. Sugandhi kabab: taste good but like nothing special, currently a kabab festival is going on, so they do not have all the kababs on menu available all the time. Here, lime and curd was evident but couldnt find any saffron here.
2. Raan biriyani: mutton is shredded and not attached to the raan itself, but tasted pretty good.
3. Awadhi handi biriyani: this was a chicken one, and i loved it. Chicken was cooked beautifully.
4. Gosht shahi quorma: i sell my soul here. Meat so tender and succulent... And the gravy.....yum!!!

Ok if you are not a fan of biriyani in general, you can give it a try here, might just work for you.

And special mention to staff, they are probably one of the best i have seen in life, courteous, smiling and ahelp you to choose menu, listening and explaining patiently. Even outside the restaurant. 

However, despite the beautiful ambience the place is little cramped up and there is a long waiting line before you get a table.

This is the place to visit for all biriyani lovers, awesome quality foods, price is a bit high but that's for a reason when you look at the ambience they provide. The place is so high rated because of the extraordinary ambience they provide. I would suggest everyone to go and try rann biriyani, it's just superb. We ordered rann biriyani, awadhi handi biriyani, sugandhi kebab, shahi tangri kebab. The foods were no doubt delicious but it's too costly.

Heard a lot about this place and finally decided to have lunch here today. Located just 5 minutes walk from Lake mall. Had sugandhi kabab and shahi tangri kabab as starters, for the main course ordered rann biriyani and awadhi handi biriyani. The decoration is royal, the dining is fine and the plates and glasses gives a royal feeling. But quantity of the food is horrible and the quality is nothing special. At the end of the day, food is all that matters, neither the decoration nor the ambience. Basically this restaurant is overhyped and overpriced. Nothing special is available here. I have had better biriyani at lower prices. Biriyani over here was nothing special, nothing to remember. The rating is solely based on ambience, and good behaviour of the staffs and nothing else. Am not going here again. No recommendations.

An absolute treat to the taste buds of mughlai lovers.
Ambience and decor are aptly complementing the delicious dishes.
Don't forget to try galawti kebab, shahi tangri kebab, awadhi biriyani, raan biriyani, shahi mutton korma, phirni, kulfi and shahi tukra.
They should've been more careful when they are taking orders as they have served a wrong dish to us.

This is probably one of the best places in Kolkata for Awadhi Cuisine lovers. Located near Lake Mall,it does not only create a Nawabi environment but also offers amazing delicacies which leaves you craving for more.

This restaurant stands as an old mansion on the roads of Southern Avenue. The interior decor and lighting will steal your heart. The music also suits the old Indian culture.

We ordered the following :

|| Drinks ||

√ Badam Sharbat : This was prepared with utmost care . The sharbat was overloaded with badam and cream. It was delicious . Recommended !!

|| Starters ||

√ Galawati Kebab : They provide 4 pieces of extremely soft mutton which brings water in your mouth. It brings the taste of Lucknow back in Kolkata. Highly recommended !!

√ Qalmi Kebab : They provide 4 legs pieces of chicken which tasted pretty good too. The pieces were tender and cooked perfectly.

|| Main Course ||

√ Raan Biriyani : One Biriyani would be enough for two. It is one of the best biriyanis I have ever tasted in Kolkata. Recommended again !

√ Butter Roti : The rotis were well cooked and laden with butter.

√ Murgh Mosallam : This was an Awadhi Speciality . They provide decent chicken pieces heavily coated with cream. It was enough to fill the stomach of all 7 of us . It tasted heavenly . You could die just for the gravy alone !! Highly recommended !!

√ Ghost Rezala : This was a pretty good side dish with good amount of spices and cashew.

The food tasted amazing. We could not take dessert , as we were full. I would go back to this place as often as I can. ♥♥

The service was pretty good. The staff could have been slightly more polite though.

Overall,it was a pretty good experience . And as I said, Oudh 1590 is one of the best places for Awadhi Cuisine in Kolkata.

This place is like a Nawabi paradise for diners. One can't talk about North Indian food in Kolkata and not mention Oudh 1590. It is the classiest Awadhi restaurant.
I have tried the following items:
☆Galawati Kebab: I just drooled over these Kebabs they were as good as the galawatis I had in Lucknow. They are soft and melt in the mouth; they were such huge pieces too.
☆Qalmi Kebab: I liked the pickled onions served with it. The Chicken legs were undoubtedly finely served and were soft, every bite filled with flavours.
☆Murgh Irani: This was uniquely flavoured, I can't describe it but can say I liked it too.
☆Lucknowi Parantha: They make it so light, flaky and delicious.
☆Phirni: This was an ideally prepared version of the popular dessert of this cuisine.
I am yet to try their Biriyani unfortunately, and would like to visit soon enough for that. This place has very few flaws. The cutlery is themed, the uniform of thw waiters is themed, even their AC is designed to go along with the theme if people don't notice the old hookah kept in the bathroom and of course the Thumri music in the background takes you to that era of Nawabs.
Of course, the pocket pinch is quite high and there is always a chance of a long queue to get in.

A well named famous place for awadhi foods, we visited the one place nearest deshapriya park.
A place well named well earned, every thing in this place is well sufficied.
Come to food we ordered

1. Galawati kebab - Four pieces of mutton kebab taste amazing and melts in mouth left us wanting more and thus we get more.

2. Raan Biriyani - Mutton biriyani in awadhi style and the mutton pieces and scattered all over the biriyani, with every bite you will find a mutton slice. This biriyani is one of the best of kolkata by taste.

3. Ghosth Bhuna - Another mutton dish, a spicy one, a delicious one. This is a great side dish i have to biriyani in a long time. This tastes reallt fantastic.

After all these amazing dishes we decided to take some Galawati kebab home, and yes will visit more frequently in future.. This a great place for lunch and dinner at it deserve the name.

Oudh 1590, undeniably one of the best restaurants to offer mughlai and awadhi food In Kolkata, without a doubt.

Finally visited this place with a friend of mine. First coming to the ambience, the decor is simply brilliant and the gazal with vintage mughal essence will surely transport you to the era of nawabs.

Now coming to the main part, the food, we ordered:

1. Galawati kabab: One of the best starters I have had. The presentation was brilliant. The mixture of spices and the tantalizing aroma, made it more appetizing. It just melted in our mouth,

2. Lucknowi Parantha: Soft and thin paranthas with the scent of ghee, went really well with the galawati kabab.

3. Raan Biryani: Signature dish, Delicious taste. The quantity was huge, enough for two people easily. Totally loved it.

4. Murgh Irani: The side dish , we opted for. Though it was quite rich, it was well cooked, tasted great.

5. Shahi Tukra: And the perfect dessert to finish. Lovely and rich in taste. We both loved it.

Prices are on the higher side, still I would recommend all the foodies to try atleast once.

The decor takes you back in time. Touted as one of the best biryani makers in Kolkata, if not the best. After visiting, I can surely vouch for it. We tried their 'raan biryani', which they happen to be so famous for, along with 'chicken irani' as a side dish. So unique in taste and flavour. Wholesome, yet light.  It was a bit pricey, but nevertheless worth every penny. Browney points for the warm and courteous service too. Go there, not just for the food, but a complete dining experience.

Rann Biryani was lip smacking...

Awadhi Biryani was almost there as well...

Mutton shahi korma was on the SWEETER side and was a bit of a disappointment in the name of a side.

What really spoilt our mood was the galawti kebab!!

It is finely pasted foul-tasting mutton meat that has a weird smell!


Firni there is soothing and strikes just right on the taste buds.


P.S. What we absolutely loved was the quality of the mutton.

However a bit heavy on the pocket but then you don’t get to taste such awesome Biriyani everyday. Rann Biriyani and Awadhi Biriyani is what they are most famous for. Along with that we tried Ghost Nalli Kebab and it just melted in our mouth.

If you say Awadhi Biryani in this city, the first thing comes in your mind is your Ultimate destination Oudh 1590. It is situated near Deshapriyo Park. The place excels in Lucknow delicacies straight from the kitchens of Nawabs. The recommended dishes that I have ordered are Galauti Kebabs, Kakori Kebabs, Raan Biryani & Nihaari Khaas. They are sooo tasty you will feel heavenly after a spoonful. The ambience is very good with low lit spaces decorsted in Nawabi theme and Ghazals playing on the music system. This place is a must try for all Biryani lovers. For me its a 5/5. Hope to visit again soon.

This place has a huge demand among everyone,and usually you have to wait for your turn if you visit during proper lunch time.The interiors are very soothing and gives you a touch of awadhi culture with a soothing music being played in the back ground.
   Now coming to food we ordered-
1.Qualmi kebab(chicken)~This is amazing and very delicious.A must try.
.Awadhi Handi chicken biriyani~ This is mainly served with mutton,as I don't eat mutton,they served us with chicken after we informed them.This is served with two pieces of chicken and two pieces of eggs.Quantity wise also its enough for two.
3.Chicken Kassa~ We opted for a bit spicy chicken dish and so we ordered this which tastes very delicious and is properly cooked.
4.Phirni~ This is just amazing and is perfect to end your meal with.This sweet dish will make your lunch complete.
   Staffs are quite polite and courteous.They will also help you to chose your dishes according to your preference.You will surely fall in love with this place.

I visited Oudh 1590 with my family today and it has been a splendid experience. The moment you enter you feel like stepping in a different era. The wooden interiors, the soft kawaali, the charcoal smell.. everything adds to the ambience. Coming to the food we had ordered Galawati Kabab, Lucknowi paratha, Raan biriyani and Nehari Khaas. I've never had more authentic Awadhi food in my life. The blend of spices, the unique flavour everything just was so amazing that you just keep hogging. To finish off we had ordered Sahi Tukda, which again was prepared extremely well with a good balance of sweetness and softness. I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. Great job guys!!!

Chicken biriyani-the taste was not good..It was blunt

Phirni and kulfi for dessert..they were amazing..One should try their kulfis..

This place transported me to an era where I could literally hear the jingling of ghungroo, could get the whiff of attar and the aroma of kebabs. Its a truly 'Nawabi' experience.
The ambience is AMAZING, ghazals by Begum Akhtar playing continuously in the background. It's a perfect place for a romantic lunch or dinner with your significant other.
The food too totally complimented the decor and ambience. My partner and I were craving dome Biryani and kebabs so we opted for the Gosht Galawati Kebab and the Gosht Awadhi Handi Biryani. The kebabs just melted in our mouths, it had the heady flavour of pure ghee and smoke. We were bowled over by it.
The Biryani too was the most delicately spiced and perfectly cooked Biryani I have ever eaten.
The waiter was also very kind to provide us with potatoes, even though this variant does not come with potatoes.
The dips and chutneys served with the food were really versatile too.
The service is topnotch and the hospitality is extremely warm.
Its a much-visit for all lovers of rich Awadhi cuisine.

1) Galawati Kebab - It does live up to its hype... absolutely melts in the mouth and goes very well with lucknowi paratha .....A must try

2) Kakori Kebab - Another great option....Comes in a sausage shape with keema mince inside...Can try

3) Nalli Gosht kebab - Listed as a kebab, this is not a kebab actually. But does not make it any less desirable. A huge leg with succulent meat is served

We also tried phirni which was good, but a lil costly

Definitely recommended...will come back

Others ordered murgh pardah biryani and moti biryani, but go for rann with your eyes closed. Nihari khas was another wonder. Not to forget awesome shahi tookra. Most of the time it is not available, but if you get it, just go for it. The cosy and dimly lit decor, thumris playing softly and the ever friendly staff make the place just perfect.
One of alltime favourite places!

Certainly one of the best restaurant to have awadhi food in Kollata. This outlet is located at Deshapriya Park, one the road just beside Banana Leaf.
It was Sunday and as usually it was fully packed. We had to wait for almost one hour before entering.
This place was really nicely decorated, also the music was going well with the ambience.
Coming to the food, we had Galwati Kebab, Raan Biryani, Bhuna Gosht. Kebab was soft and full of taste. They served biryani from a handi. It tasted really good. Proportion wise it was enough to serve two persons. I felt like, the amount of meat in the biryani is a bit less. Bhuna Gosht had a burnt flavour, going very well with biryani. Service was also pretty quick too. Overall we liked Oudh very much. Certainly one of the best destination for food lovers.

The place looks good but the food is tasteless. We ordered biryani which was bland. Kabab was not even edible. As for the dessert shahi tukra seemed so bad that it will feel you are forcing yourself to eat. And this is my feeling even when I have a sweet tooth. I would never like to come back here. Plus, the service is so bad; they literally throw the food in your plates and run.

Gentle advice : Please stop taking guests for granted, or else you are not really worth the rating displayed on Zomato.

I visited the Desapriya Park outlet of Oudh 1590 today (Sunday) for lunch with my family. We were recommended the special Kebab Festival menu. Although we went to Oudh for their famed Galawati Kebab, we thought of trying out a couple from the special menu -- Chicken Sutli Kebab and Mahi-e-Gulfam. The fish kebab, Mahi-e-Gulfam, was alright; nothing special, but the Chicken Sutli Kebab was simply a disaster. It felt like minced processed chicken wrapped in banana leaf and baked, instead of the "finely chopped chicken, marinated with spices" that they promise on the menu card. At best, the kebab was at per the regular grocery store chicken sausages, or may be, even worse. It's unbelievable that the same cook who produces the flavorful authentic Mutton Galawati Kebab could even dare to prepare this disaster. I strongly suggest every guest to stick to Oudh's regular menu, instead of trying out the so-called specials.

After reaching home, we were further shocked to notice that three of our items were double-billed. I should have checked the bill before paying; but at least a correct bill is the least that I can expect from a restaurant of this stature. We are yet to receive the refund for the over-billed amount, for which it seems that I have to visit their outlet once again. The person I communicated with over phone to report this complaint was not even apologetic, as if such an incident is normal, let alone offering to return the wrongfully charged amount in person. This is definitely far below the expectations that one would place on Oudh, or any other restaurant with similar fame.

I should probably end with a glimmer of hope -- the Raan Biryani, the Galawati Kebab, and the Nahari Khaas were really nice. Anyone visiting this outlet should try out these dishes out of their regular menu. Overall, the ambiance is quite nice too, with slow ghazal, ornated facades, and mood lighting orchestrating a romantic atmosphere of awe and royalty. We enjoyed this part for sure, and would give a 4-star rating otherwise. The Chicken Sutli Kebab and the guest treatment brought it down to 2.5. Sorry.

I was a big fan of this restaurant just because of their authentic biriyani I ever had. Recently I visited their two outlets (deshopriyo park + southern avenue) may be after a long time(about a year). The taste has changed completely. I am afraid to say I missed their old taste. I thought it might be differ from the other outlets so I tried from the another one but the taste was same. The starter was awesome, mouth melting kebabs, grt beverage but not satisfied with the taste of biriyani. The ambience and music will give you the other touch of Lucknow Gharana.

Oudh 1590 is a paradise for biriyani lovers.Gawlauti kebab with Lucknowi parantha or ulte tawe ke paranthe.The Gawlauti kebab was soft and melted in the mouth .Mist try place if you love to eat good quality tasty food direct from the recipes of the Nawabs’ kitchens. :)

Visited here once only. Tried the chicken Afghani kebab, mutton galawati kebab with the paratha and mugh pardah biriyani. While the kebabs were awesome the biriyani left a lot to be desired. It was too oily for my liking. Honestly I've had better elsewhere. But full marks to the ambience, the decor and the soothing music they play. It actually takes you to another era.

If you're a biryani lover..this place is more than perfect for you
If you aren't quite a fan of biryani or mughlai even then I'll recommend you to try out something at this place because everything simply everything about this place is Wow!
The decor,the food the Awadhi Extravaganza everything serves for a perfect 60-75 mins that you'll spend here
I probably won't mind going to this place alone to ravage the Galawati kebabs and the Rann Biryani!

Been there after Diwali, the flavour and ambience in Oudh is gradually fading from its early days.. You can have biriyani and other Mughlai dishes only with an ordinary expectation.. not such a must go destination for mughlai food lovers anymore

Unprofessional staff, reluctant service and quite average food contributed to this rating of 3. At 395/- (rann biryani), is this the quality of rice you serve? They mix cheap quality short grained rice with few long grained ones. Shredded mutton quantity is in lesser side and taste of biryani is nothing great. Kebabs and side dishes like nargisi kofta are OK. Overall I feel, Oudh has detoriated over last 1 year..may be a great debut and opening of 2 more branches made them complacent and over confident. Based on their present performance a Zomato rating of 4.3 is certainly over rated.

Had dinner with family at Oudh to celebrate my mother's birthday. I've heard so much about this place.. I had to visit it at least once!
And thank god that I did.
Amazing ambiance.. such courteousness & warm welcome.
We had-
Mutton galawati kebab
Lucknowi paratha (the best paratha I've ever had)
Awadhi handi biriyani
Gosht roghan josh
Gajar ke halwa
Fresh lime soda
Delicious food.. the biriyani is out if the world.
So is the gajar ke halwa.
I deduct 0.5 for the galawati kebab which I did not totally love owing to my taste buds.
Summing up..
Oudh 1590 is a must visit place for any foodie!!

Happy eating 😊

Planned a Saturday Lunch here. The ambience was really good in fact really different. Being a foodie nothing makes me more happily confused than a Menu. Well,  we chose to have Qalmi Kebabs. Those kebabs were really soft and tender, which worked as a true apetizer. We jumped into Main course. We ordered Lucknowi Paratha, Chicken Irani and Raan Biriyani. Parathas were very tasty. Chicken Irani tasted little sweeter side and not really tasted as signature dish. Raan Biriyani really was superb. The Biriyani contained shredded mutton and was light flavoured. This is a must try here.  Overall the experience was good.

Great ambience. Went with my friends and was awestruck by the way this place is decorated. Felt like historical fort.
The food is good. I really liked the kakoori kabab. The biriyani is awesome and is not dry . This makes the biriyani very tasty. One must try Raan Biriyani . The quantity is very good. 
One draw back is long waiting hours. Went on a Sunday and had to wait for more than an hour. But I must say it was worth waiting as the food was very tasty and we had a wonderful dinner

Heard a lot about this place... So, after hearing i jumped into that place along with my cousins for dinner... The ambiance is just way too superb but as heard about the food, didnt find them to be like that... Wont say that the food is bad but we ordered a rann biriyani and the pot in which the biriyani was ordered it was hot but the content inside it was not at all hot... We all were way too disappointed by that... Never expected this kind of service from oudh 1590...

It is one of the best Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata. Decorated in Nawabi style, the entire restaurant will make you awestruck! Wooden furniture, dim lights and the beautiful paintings on the walls will steal your heart. The staffs are courteous. They were all dressed in black Pathani style kurtas. These friendly staffs make your food experience a lot more worthwhile.

We ordered Galawati Kebabs, Raan Biryani and firni. The Galawati Kebab was made of mutton paste marinated in Awadhi spices. It truly melts in your mouth. Raan Biryani had shredded mutton pieces cooked in Dum Pukht style. The biryani was served on an earthen pot which will definitely grab your attention. Lastly, we ordered firni. It was the best firni I've ever had in Kolkata. Next time will definitely try their Shahi Tukda. Though the prices are on the higher side, they are worth spending on such delicious dishes.

Overall, it was an excellent dining experience. Will surely visit them again but may be their other outlets. Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 900 for two

Want that melt in mouth feeling?? Try the Galauti kebab with lucknowi ulta paratha!! One of the best Awadhi cuisine in town. The decor & the thumri in the background gives you that heritage lucknowi feel! One must also try the fish sugandhi kebab and naseri murgh! All the biriyanis are delectable but my personal favourite is the raan biriyani with those soft pieces of mutton being an absolute delight!

1 Awadhi Handi Biryani & 1 Murgh Rezala

review;
Awadhi Handi Biryani as stated Dum pukht method of cooking rice with mutton pieces imparting a typical Awadhi flavour, served in earthen pot. 
no1!!! the best biryani i had after arsalan or vice versa.... _/\_ the biryani was flavorful and less oily.... it contained 2 pieces of mutton and 2 fried eggs no alu :(( the quantity was ok (it can be shared with two) con was the mutton it was hard/chewy :///

Murgh Rezala as stated chicken cooked in yogurt and cashew paste cooked with desi ghee.
again no1!!! though i had rezela's very less but can surely say this was the best of all...... <3 chickens were soft and the gravy was just heaven ^_^ chickens cooked in yogurt and cashew paste cooked with desi ghee mmmmmmmm yummyyyy ^_^

got bit of raita too and it was awesome too......

my father went there yesterday to bring all this and he was greeted nicely :)))

all superb just price is high :|

ps the packaging was awesome... loved the handi a lot :P :P

i am giving 5 out of 5!!

@Good place to be with ur family n friends n enjoy the speciality of their Awadhi dishes. We went on Sunday evening n the place was full with almost family crowd. We ordered both  veg as well as non veg dishes. Non veg starter qalmi kabab was very different n delicious main course too was good. Veg dishes were good too but this place is not for vegetarians as there is a very limited n small menu for them. But yes non-vegetarians will love this place as there are plenty of options for them. And yes pricing was very decent (reasonable).

The Oudh 1590 is recreating the essence of the old word Awadh, it is no less than an architectural marvel. It is a themed restaurant serving Lucknowi cuisine with a Nawabi ambiance. Now coming to the food and it also bowls over you. To begin with the biriyanis, Raan biriyani is my favourite. This is an awadhi biriyani where minced lamb meat is cooked with rice in Dum Pukht Style. The lamb meat was soft and juicy. They bring the biriyani to the tables in sealed clay pots. Kakori kabab also tastes heavenly well. The kababs melted right away once inside the mouth. Staffs are courteous, helpful, friendly and they know how to make the right impression on their guests.

It was a rather long wait and much planning before a visit to this place! Naturally my expectations were also sky high. Loved the Nawabi themed decor and especially the music, all culminated to a perfect ambience.

Now coming to food, unfortunately for me, it didn't live up to the hype. We ordered galauti kabab, awadhi sugandhi machhi, raan biriyani and phirni. The kababs were good but not close to the best I've had. The biriyani was decent, but again not something I'd mention if asked about the best Kolkata biriyani. The phirni was nice, perhaps the saving grace.

Overall, a nice place to visit and try out awadhi cuisine.

Visited during the puja time. As usual, totally packed. We had to wait for 2.5 hours to get a table. Anyways, the food was okay but not what we expected or what we heard about such an esteemed restaurant. Understand, it was a rush hour so it might not be possible to maintain the standards. But the staffs were courteous, biryanis, side dishes were just okay. The authenticity and the atmosphere is something which brings the essence of the old royal days. Would like to visit again later at a better time, but definitely not during puja days again.

A new outlet near Vivekananda park. Take the lane next to Vivekananda park and walk straight. Oudh will fall on your right hand side.
The majestic treatment and decor of oudh is well known. And since it's a new outlet, you won't really find yourself standing in a long queue. If you want to experience the nawabi treatment, do visit oudh. The decor was a delight to my eyes. There was a soft background music playing to set up the mood. The staffs were well mannered and very courteous.
We ordered the chicken pardah biriyani, chicken Irani and lucknowi paratha.
Lucknowi paratha was an instant hit. It's light and melt in your mouth. The chicken Irani was their house speciality. Two large pieces of chicken well cooked in a thick creamy gravy of tomato and fresh cream. It tasted quite good. Next up was their chicken pardah biriyani. It came in a clay pot. Cooked in Typical dum biriyani style. What really mesmerized me was the use of capsicum in a biriyani. Honestly, it was more of a chicken pulao than a biriyani. The rice was cooked really well. The chicken pieces was marinated properly with the right amount of spices. I really loved the pardah biriyani. It'll serve two people.
What really impressed me was, the manager came and visited us and asked us about our dining experience. I was enthralled more by the wonderful treatment the staffs provided us with.

Ambience was very nice..dim light with mughal songs...it was really nice

Staffs were good but we ordered 2 handi of rann biryani and they gave us 1 handi awadhi and 1 handi rann biryani...this was quite embarrassing...

We ordered..
"Galawati kababs"-----the kebabs were tender and well cooked....it was really outstanding...
" Rann biryani"-----Biryani was as usual brilliant in taste...nothing to say about that
"Murgh mussalam"------this was nice and goes well with biryani....
Overall it was a nice experience...

Elegant decor. Nice dimly lit ambience with Akhtari Bai's ghazal and thumri in the background which ofcourse gets substantially marred by the ambient noise created by fellow group of diners. Good food. We ordered sugandhi and galawati kebab , lucknowi paratha, nihari khas, nargisi kofta followed by rann and awadhi handi biryani with kulfi. Pocket pinch was Rs. 2870. Quantity sufficient for four individuals.The biryani is overpriced and overhyped. Shahi tukra was not available. Pity they dont serve beer or liquor. Would have definitely added to the nawabi ' Mizaz '. Will try other items in subsequent visits.

Gone for one of my frnd's b'day lunch. Fall in love with the ambience. Dimmed light, interiors, gazals and cutlery wll definitely give anyone the feel of awadh.
We ordered galauti kabab n gondhoraj chicken with lakhnowi paratha. Gondhoraj chicken was juicy and flavourful. Though i don't eat mutton usually but i managed to have one galuati kabab with the paratha and i must say that i like it only bcoz it didn't taste lyk mutton actually (almost after a decade i had mutton). Smell of herbs were going gr8 with the texture and taste of the kabab.
For mains we opt for handi biryani and murg irani. Both of them were awsome. The elevation of flavours in murg irani was mind blowing. Rich instance gravey went so well with the biriyani.
But the show stopper was the gajar ka halwa. I remember it's taste in details till now. We was full but can't stopped ourselves from having it.
Definitely it is a gr8 plc to visit for an awadhi treatment.

  Food was good.. Quality of food was also goood..
But their biriyani tasted like polau to it...it had no such flavour or taste like biriyani.. Don't know if awadhi biriyani means polau in kolkata style or what..
Food was very light..had no such stuffy feeling after having such good quantity of biriyani..

Firni was very very good
Behaviour atmosphere was niceee...dim lights with mughal songs..
Ambience 👍

I have nothing extra to write here about the place. The food is extraordinary in taste and the whole ambience is wonderful. It does take you to the pages of your history books. Nevertheless what i noticed was two contrasting things.
While we were waiting for our table a group of 9 people came and since they had to wait for 45 minutes the manager himself booked a table for them at their southern avenue branch. Besides most of their staffs behavior was really commendable.
But i got pissed while ordering. When we asked for a suggestion among side dishes with Awadhi & Moti biriyani, Murgh Irani was suggested to us and it was a complete mismatch.
So, its better to take a biriyani and kebab and enjoy your meal with awesome melody in background.

Went there today after hearing lots of praise of it from my friends! However was quite disappointed. The interior is nice, We had ordered Sugandhi Kebab, Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Nargisi Kofta! The kebab was supposed to have "Gondhoraj" lemon's scent which was totally absent! Secondly, the biriyani was nothing out of the ordinary, the quantity was quite a lot for 2 people, it had two eggs, 2 mutton pieces and NO ALOO. The mutton pieces were quite hard and it was difficult to tear them, the rice was almost dull. The Nargisi kofta was more or less okay. My expectation wasn't met, will try some other items next time and see how it goes!

Visited this outlet during Puja and after waiting for 1.30 hr finally entered the Biryani den. Galawati/Galouti kebab was so soft and tasty, feels amazing. Here comes the raan biryani with shredded mutton. The quantity is sufficient for two people. But for me, I can't share it.
Ambience and decoration is awesome. Staffs are good but behaviour should be improved.

I visited the Desapriya outlet and would love to rate this place 5 as i love everything about the restaurant. I visited once and can't wait to go back again. The ambience and decor is wonderful. The service is excellent. The staffs are very well mannered and courteous.
I ordered for their special Raan Biriyani and Murgh Razela. The dishes are finger licking. Absolutely in love with the Biriyani. It's just perfect and the kind i never tasted anywhere before.
The restaurant is little expensive but it has to be because of the dishes served. Biriyani lovers do visit this place. You're going to love their Biriyani no doubt.

Visited oudh 1590 Yesterday itself. Situated just beside carmel primary school, deshapriya park, it can be easily located. 4of us visited. We ordered 2plates of rann biriyani, 2plates of galawati kebab and 2firni. Galawati kebab tasted fine. Unfortunately the rann biriyani was a complete disaster. To add to it, one of the plates of rann biriyani wasnt well cooked. It smelt of boiled rice and was not mixed properly. When we asked them to change it, they simply took it away, made us wait for more 15/20 Min and brought back the same thing (after cooking it again). However once more it smelt the same. Firni was ok. Bit yellowish in colour. Interior was well decorated. However they need to concentrate much more on the food they serve. Another negative aspect was the rude behaviour of the service staffs.

Bought two plates of mutton handi biriyani today for home, opened the handis before dinner and microwaved it for 3 mins, couldn't believe that it was completely sour and far from fresh. Had to throw away the whole thing. Such a disappointment. I feel cheated, it could've caused health issues. Did not expect this from Oudh..

Many times heard about it. Today we went there for lunch. Ambience was good. We ordered gulawati kebab, rann biryani and awadhi handi biryani. Gulawati kebab was a shit. It was little bitter in taste. Rann biryani was awesome. Many small boneless piece of mutton was spread in it. Mutton pieces was so soft. I became a fan of rann biryani here. Awadhi handi biryani was so so in taste. There was 1 egg and 3 pieces of mutton(with bone) in that. If u go there , please try rann biryani once.

If you are a Biriyani Lover then this is one of the best Biriyani place in Kolkata. However Hospitality and quality of food has degraded a little. We ordered Galoti Kebab (was far better before), Burrah Kebab( so and so), Rann Biriyani (Thik thak), Murg Rogan josh (good) and Phirni (Best). A little advice , kindly change the plates after someone finishes off the starter and don't serve with a grumpy disgusted face. Last time it was soooo much better.The Man with a Moustache at the door does a really Great Job and am giving an extra star because of him. But yes I will still recommend my friends to go there . :-)

Visited Oudh for the first time today.
Here is what I found :
Atmosphere : the rich decor made us feel royal to some extent.. the furnitures, crockery are perfectly at
par with the theme.. staff behaviour is absolutely professional.
The paintings on walls can easily take you to a 'mahol' of a rich princely palace.

Food : we ordered afghani kebab, butter nun, murg kossa, sabz kofta curry and sahi tukra.
The kebab was tender and soft, and tasted fabulous.
The nun was dry to some extent, and we found it a bit hard. Murg kossa tasted different from the typical taste, but we definitely liked the little bit of innovation added to it.
The koftas were very soft and melted in mouth. The gravy though tasted well, was too oily.
Sahi tukra tasted good. The intensity of sweetness should be diminished.

Looking forward for a second visit for tasting the specialities there!

The best Mughlai/North Indian in the city. My inference is not based entirely on food, but the ambience, the music, the staff and the overall feel that can virtually take you to the alleys of Lucknow. The Galauti kabab is soft, like a candyfloss. The Nawabs wanted it like that in old age when they could no longer bite due to lack of teeth. The Rann biriyani is out of the world, the quantity they provide is enormous. I can write a paper about the food, don't listen to me, I may be biased at times😂. Just visit it, it would be a "walk to remember".

very bad. i went there on 2nd October with my family. Initially everything was ok. It wasnt much crowded. Then the plates and glasses which were given to us were dirty. The food was bad..really bad. we ordered chicken irani and the chicken was half cooked and the paneer qorma was even worse the spices were added at the last given a taste of raw spices to it. and the waiter was about to serve us main course in the same plate as the plate where starters were served. When asked to change it he completely ignored us. We then asked someone else to do it. the food was bad rather horrible. The butter naan was so stiff. the hospitality was bad. i would never recommend anyone to go to this restaurant

A brilliant restaurant in the city...!!!

I’ve been here several times. Taking several dishes. Even took home delivery from them.
About the Food- A brilliant Mughlai cuisine. The best in the city if not then one of the top 3. To be honest with it they serves much better biryani than 99% of Kolkata’s Top biryani sellers. Kebabs are great. Sublime. Galawati kebab one of the best dish of them. Everyone should give it a try.
About the Decor- One of the most cozy place. Decorations are beautiful. It makes you feel like you are in the Lucknow or Oudh.

There should be no negative things about this. A 10/10 from me. Thank you.

If you are in Kolkata, for the love of biriyani, you cannot miss this place!
It is a themed restaurant serving Lucknowi cuisine and they've done such an awesome job giving the place a Nawabi ambience. The place is structured like a summer palace of Nawabs with carved wooden furnishings. Light classical music plays in the background while food is served on brass plates.

The ambience is impressive, but the food simply bowls you over. To begin with, the Biriyanis. They offer quite a few varieties all of which taste distinctly different. They serve even more varieties during their Biriyani festival, make it a point to visit them during that month.
My favorites are the Raan Biriyani and the Awadhi Handi Biriyani. They bring the biriyani to the tables in sealed clay pots and the first whiff of the aroma from the biriyani as they remove the lids would immediately make you happy that you visited this place. The rice is incredibly fragrant, packed with flavor and the irresistible aroma of ghee, is rather light but has that perfectly balanced richness from the ghee that makes the biriyani perfect by itself, you hardly need a side dish to go with it. The quantity is enough for two with generous pieces of succulent meat. The Raan biriyani has a lamb shank with the meat gorgeously tender and falling right off the bone.

The other dish you must try here is obviously their Galawati Kebab. This minced meat kebab is the the ultimate example of melt in the mouth. The subtle blend of spices gives it a beautifully complex umami flavor and a bold kick of heat in your throat.

One other dish I'd love to mention is the Nargisi Kofta. It's essentially boiled eggs covered in minced meat and cooked in gravy. This, once again, has a rich, complex flavor and it is quite an experience savoring the distinctly different flavor profiles of the meat coating to the gravy as you dig into this dish.

The place is usually buzzing with guests and despite of that service is rather prompt and efficient. The staff is polite and attentive. Overall, this is one place where you can expect a guaranteed pleasant experience.
Lastly, the guard at the door who warmly greets you as you enter or leave the place has one impeccable mustache and he's rather proud of it!

The best Biriyani place in Kolkata. No two thoughts about it. 
The location is a bit difficult to figure out if one is visiting Oudh for the first time. The decor and ambience have been well planned, with soothing Awadhi music playing in the background amidst long and welcoming wooden furniture exclusive to the bygone era.
What We Ordered : 
1. Galawati Kebabs for Starters (5/5) : The kebabs were tender and well cooked, with a fine aesthetic presentation. The kebabs melted right away once inside the mouth, throwing open a plethora of tastes, a feeling of fulfillment that sets in and gets the meal started just like it should.  
2. Awadhi Handi Biriyani (5/5) : This is the best Biriyani I've ever had. Not your quintessential Calcutta Biriyani, but hey, I'm not complaining. Two handis are enough for a group of three.
3. Murgh Massalam(4.5/5) : Well cooked. Great use of spices. 

Am I coming back? The answer is a no-brainer.

Have been here multiple times and  ordered the famous galawti kebab with those thin crispy paratha without a miss. 
Their special raan biryani and nihari khas are few other dishes are definitely worth trying 
Awadhi sugandhi maahi sums up for the perfect  starter for the people looking for something in fish

But quite dissapointed with the dessert menu
Almost nothing to order for except for phirni and shahi tukra

Went out for dinner with whole family on 1st October on the occasion of Durga Puja.

We ordered Murgh Metiaburz Biryani, Gosht Metiaburz Biryani, Roomali Roti, Lucknowi Paratha, Butter Naan, Gosht Roganjosh, Paneer Qorma,Murgh Irani and last but not the least Phirni.

Food was awesome. Biryani was cooked pure Kolkata style, behaviour of the staffs was polite.

Only 1 thing, they calculated the bill wrong. We ordered 3 biryani whereas they charged us for 4 biryani. Maybe for the puja rush they were mistaken, but these kind of mistakes should be avoided to maintain customer satisfaction.

Wanted to visit this place for so long and I have heard a lot about  this place so my expectations were pretty high.On sosthi I went there for lunch.we had to wait for almost one and half hour but still we were okay with it.. It was only the food that disappointed us.. We have ordered galwati kebab and kakori kebab for starter and Raan biriyani for the main course.. Kebabs were so bad that we could barely eat it. I am fan of galawti kebab but here it was just waste of money. Biriyani was just okay nothing very nice..quantity was pretty good though but Oudh 1590 made me disappointed 😞

In Biriyani, meat pieces were so small that they can hardly be compared with other good restaurants keeping in mind the price tag and not to mention the taste .......hard to find any awadhi texture. Honestly I am quite disappointed.....a very overrated name

The food is so so, and the customer service of the restaurant is one of the worst I have ever seen. No manners by the manager/person sitting outside the restaurant enquiring about the type of table and number of guests.
If he is told that you will take away the food, he won't even let you enter the restaurant. Such disgusting behavior by a restaurant of this high rating! It is unimaginable for any restaurant. If you are not charging less for the take away, how can you not allow a person to enter the restaurant!
These restaurants should understand that due to us customers they are doing their business, they are not doing any charity and we are paying for our food. Also, as you are charging similar price for both dine in and take away, you have no right to deny a person from entering the restaurant, whether it is dine in or take away.
When confronted, they were trying to justify their act blatantly, even giving excuses that due to our occupying of the table, many people are waiting outside. Such rude behavior! How can a restaurant be such unprofessional? As we are paying full, we have every right to occupy a table and how can the staff say that we are hindering their operations? Had very high hopes for this restaurant, but it was a disaster of an experience visiting there. For a place which don't even know how to treat their guests, I shall never visit there nor recommend anybody to.

I can't promise about the food quality (which is not that good according to the other authentic restaurants in kolkata) but the service is the worst. The waiters are so rude that they didn't allow us to enter the restaurant citing the reason that we will be uselessly occupying the table. After a round of argument they hesitantly allowed us to get inside. After we took out parcel, one of them said due to us, there were people waiting outside which is insane. I asked him, were we not paying the food bill and the taxes to which they were numb. People here is extremely callous, rude and unprofessional... I would hate to come here again and would ask to whoever reading this review, not to go there... there are many good biriyani houses than them. Just hated it.

We went to Oudh 1590, deshapriya park with friends during Durga Puja. There was big queue and they were not taking prior bookings. But the staff courteous. We ordered for raan biriyani which has boneless mutton pieces, galouti kebab which is one of their best dishes and neehari. We also took phirni.

Their food tastes great. Mutton dishes are a must try, specially galouti kebab. The serving waiters were not very courteous, but service is fast. Ambience is beautiful, it has awadi decor.

Beautiful interior & good background music to add on to the feast which just makes it better. Had to take away 1 star beacuse of their late service this time. They were supposed to open at 6:30PM in the eve so accordingly to their schedule we went in but had to wait 1 hour as they started service on 7:30P.M. Except this everything was top notch . Even the staff are well behaved too.Would definitely love to visit again.

Had heard of this place from many people. Finally visited during Durga puja. As expected, there was pretty long queue and we had to wait for 30 mins before we got entry inside the restaurant. The way these people managed such a huge queue in this festive season is commendable. 
We ordered Galawti kebab, Qalmi kebab, Rann biryani, Murgh irani and Kulfi falooda. Each of the dishes were delectable and you would feel like coming again to have each of these again. Truly speaking never had such awesome awadhi delicacies before. 
The Galawti kebab was properly marinated and extremely well shallow-fried to give it an awesome colour and taste. The Qalmi kebab was also pretty soft and delicious. Coming to the biryani, it tasted awesome too along with chicken irani. By far the best biryani I have had is here at oudh 1590. 
Highly recommended!!

Every foodie must visit this place for a different style of Biriyani with a royal treatment. The quality and taste of food was just awesome. The interior decoration gives you the feelings of some ancient kingdom's dining area. Yes, you have to spend a little more penny but it won't hurt you as the mouthwatering dishes will keep you happy. I am recommending this place for a different style of Biriyani and a proper care of your tummy😂😄

This place had been on my bucket list for quite sometime. Finally tried out during the Pujas. First of all..I must admit that the ambience is absolutely flawless and one of the best in any theme restaurants. Service was satisfactory too.
              Coming to the food, I tried out Rann Biryani, Awadhi Biryani, Galawati kebab and Firni. The food was great too..I loved the kebab and biryani too..I liked the Awadhi biryani more than Rann. I must admit that the Firni was the best I had ever had.

FINAL VERDICT- I highly recommend this place..not just the food, but the entire experience is splendid here and hence this is a must try!!

The Durga Puja menu we were served had a limited selection of items, and the items themselves were pretty ordinary (very few specialities along with the usual stuff most North Indian restaurants serve). The Awadhi biriyani we ordered had pieces of mutton which were mostly fat, cartilage, and bone. Moreover, there were only two pieces of meat per serving and mostly stuffed with rice, making it insufficient for two people let along one person (assuming that a single person wants to eat something more than plain rice at a restaurant). The kebabs were fine but once again, nothing extraordinary. The service was okay, but it looked like they wanted to argue when we complained about the food instead of courteously accepting the feedback. The plates and glasses appeared to have a tinge of oil on them which gave me the impression of poor hygiene. The rooms were small and didn't allow for movement or privacy, which was only made worse by the dark decor of period dining. Furthermore, there were no windows to allow daylight in. We were seated next to a couple and our request for seat change onto a empty isolated table was promptly denied. There was only one co-gender bathroom which caused queues to build up, especially since is Durga Puja seaason. Overall, this place left me pretty disappointment especially since items are priced high and the ratings on Zomato are good.

My 1st visit to this place . 
Ordered galawati kabab and lucknowi paratha. The kabab was too salty and the taste was just plain bad. 
Next we ordered raan biriyani and gosht bhuna . Though the shredded meat proportion was too less yet 1 pot had enough rice for 2 people. The biriyani was ofcourse different from the kolkata variant we are familiar with and while the aroma was good too but the rice was bland to my liking and not lively enough .
The best part was definitely gosht bhuna .
Overall the food being average , my take on its pricing is very unjustified.

Their Parda biriyani is THE most delicious biriyani I've tasted. I went there a few weeks back and I still can't get over the taste. The ambience was beautiful with ghazals playing in the background therefore justifying it's name. I strongly recommend this place.

I was waiting for a long time to taste the Awadhi Biriyani.Finally I got the opportunity to visit this place on this durga puja . After two hours waiting outside we got a chance to enter. We had tried 2 types of kawab.1. Mutton Galawati kawab,it was not that much of tasty that I have thought.It is too much spicy.2. Mutton Kakori kawab,I feel this one of best kawabs I had tried in my life,it is really mouth-watering.
After that we tried, Awadhi handi biriyani,this one is really good but lack of fragrance & quantity not enough for two. Next one is Ghost Metiabruz biriyani, this dish is as good as the biriyani of kolkata we are trying for long long years.I didn't found anything special taste or smell of it. With biriyani i lile to have a side dish so here we are.we have taken Ghost bhunna.this dish is really mouth-watering...yummm....but i would suggest you can try it with paratha or roti...may be it can taste better than this.
And last but not the least we have Firni and obiously its so much delicious...
Well all i waana say that every foodies should try oudh 1590 for one time atleast...I must say about their hospitality, i have visit on nabami ,in that very day they have managed the whole thing that is really appreciable.

So finally had the opportunity of the highly praised mughal restaurant on Chaturthi.... I had expected a waiting queue but never would have thought that it would take about an hour to enter! But...totally worth the wait. Loved the mughal ambience, with royal interior decor along with the light music, perfectly blending in.  The waiters were the best I had ever seen. Donned in black pathani, one could hardly believe that they were waiters. From the courteous bow to the gracious smile while serving the food- You are bound to praise them.

Coming to the food, we had Murg Qalmi Kebab- Must have...Please please please try it once!!!! It is the bestest tandoor flavoured succulent chiken leg pieces I ever had!!!!! 

In the main course, we had Murg Mitiaburuj Biriyani. Although some might say that the essence of biriyani is too light, but trust me, this is EXACTLY what Awadhi biriyani tastes like. Not only was it served in a brass pot(handi), but the amount was surprisingly enough for two! Coupled with two soft Chicken pieces and raita, the biryani was fabulous. 

In the dessert, we had Shahi Tukda. It was an all new taste experience for me, for I had heard a lot about it. It was a bread pudding softly baked and prepared with a creamy texture and maple syrup, topped with walnuts. All in all, a great show-stopper for Mughal Foodies!

All in all, I am compelled to give it no less than 5 STAR review. Please do visit it once, if possible. It won't be as crowded as it was during Durga Pujo times.

The food was excellent but Given the extremely high rates, the quantity was not upto the measure. 
We had to share a table with strangers, but that can be excused as it was during the Durga Puja and there was a rush . 
Tried Raan Biriyani
Chicken Irani
And Phirni. 
Extremely delicious. One of the best mughlai curry based restaurants of Calcutta. 
The ambience and decoration were beautiful. Really a 'Period Dining experience.' 
Recomended if you're willing to pay a lot to satisfy your taste buds.

Wanted to visit here for a long time , finally managed to check in today. Though we expected a huge rush due to puja, we only had to wait fr 5 mins before we entered to experience a perfect Awadhi ambience.

Now coming to the main part...we ordered rann biriyani , quality was excellent , quantity was sufficient(though we were expecting a bit more according to the price )... followed by awadhi murgh biriyani, delectable as previous ..then comes gosht Rogan Josh...a perfect combo... finally my favourite dessert firni

All in all great quality and lip smacking menu but a bit overpriced

Must say had a Royal experience. For the ambience they deserve a 10/10. Ordered Raan Biryani, that's what they are famous for. Well, one handi is enough for two persons. Coming to the taste, it's not something out of the world but surely u gonna love the taste. No Alu, no big pc of mutton. Infact the mutton is shredded and that's something I loved about the biryani. Now what's so special about this restaurant that makes it overpriced? Believe me considering the quantity I didn't feel it was overpriced but still if you ask me what's special, I think I m gonna tell you, "you won't feel heavy after the meal". And to all those smokers... after the meal, Ek bada Goldflake to banta hain to nail the Nawabi feel.

Wanted to try this place for long and finally got the opportunity on oshtomi. Their crowd management during pujo along with service was excellent. Their menu was limited but all was available within tjat limited choice.
Ordered 1)awadhi handi biryani:  quantity and qyality of meat wise it was good and comes with two eggs as well. Taste wise was okaish. Light and mild tasting.
2) luckawni paratha: one word to describe it is superb. Soft and almost oil free.
3) chicken kalmi kebab: huje drumsticks of chicken and nicely grilled with mild spices good to taste.
4) Mutton rogan josh: superb, lightly spiced gravy and very tender mutton pieces.

Would go back for the parantha and kebabs again.

As I am finally done with my exams I thought of sharing my gluttonous experience of this year .I always desired to eat in this restaurant .Finally on 10th September I along with my family went to Oudh 1590. The moment we entered we had a strong feeling that our experience will be great .The staffs were very friendly and courteous .A bit of more lightning would have added to the ambience .Now coming to the food what we ordered.
 1) Chicken Biriyani 4/5 :The biriyani serves for two persons .The chicken pieces were very tender.The biriyani was light and tasty . 
2)Mutton Biriyani 4/5:The biriyani serves for two persons .The mutton pieces were cooked properly . 3)Murgh Irani 4/5:Chicken pieces in tomato sauce with sweet and sour taste .Serves 2 chicken piece . 4)Fish Tikka 4/5:Serves 4 fish piece .Cubes of betki fishes was marinated with yoghurt,mustard oil ,etc 5)Chicken Zafrani Kabab 4.5/5: Serves 4 pieces of boneless chicken .The boneless chicken pieces were marinated with saffron,cream and yoghurt . 
6)Phirni 5/5:For bengalis without desert we don't end our meal .So we ordered for this .It was so delicious that we ordered one more . 
Overall the dining experience was amazing .Outstanding food and good ambience but a bit of more lightning should be added to it . Experience at a glance

Very much disappointed with the quantity!! As they says it serves 2 but I think merely it can be 1.25.
They says there will be two piece of Mutton but practically it's nothing but two big bones!!

It's a request to all Bengali people, during this Durga Puja don't take any chance...

This is 2nd time we visited oudh 1590 ..i think this is best ever awadhi restaurant in kolkata... Specially for biriyani & kebab lovers.. Specially their raan biriyani is really outstanding,no other can beat them specifically for biriyani section..in first time when we visited..we ordered raan biriyani but this time we ordered awadhi handi biriyani & qalmi kebab.. Awadhi handy biriyani was always delicious.. Qalmi kebab was good.. But it could be more better.. Maybe their other kebab is more tasty..interior ambience was very different.. Peaceful also.. Behavior of their stuff was friendly..

Being disappointed the previous time thought of paying another visit to this restaurant famous for awadhi cuisine... Nd what better time could it be other than Durga puja..

After waiting for nearly 45 minutes finally got the green light...

Ambience wise definitely i loved it... With the ghazal playing in the background and dimlit conditions and all the portraits it does set the mood right... 🙂

Speaking about the food... I have had:-
1. Moti biriyani: quantity wise good... Serves 2 individuals... But the biriyani is very dry... I even didn't like the taste also...

2. Gosht biriyani: good one... But the quantity is very less.. that is the turn down point about it..

3. Raan biriyani: magnificent... There is a reason you find it under the recommended list in zomato... Quantity wise pretty good.. if u visit this place i highly recommend that u order this one for sure.. 🙂

4. Murgh irani: has that achaari tangy flavour to it.. 2 chicken pieces are served...

Hospitality is also nice... The attendents are well behaved and courteous...

P.s. liked it (finally!! 😅)... Would love to visit again.. ☺️

First of all, they are supposed to open their restaurant by 12 pm, but they opened at 12.20 yesterday! Considering the puja rush and with such a long line of hungry souls, they should be punctual. Second, they should've written names of the customers so that they get seats in a proper order. 
The food menu was limited, that's expected during Pujas. But nothing tasted extraordinary. The Zafrani kebab was wonderful. But the metiabruz chicken biriyani and chicken rezala really failed to satisfy my taste buds!

I am in awe with this place. One of the best I have ever had !!
So, this place was in my bucket list for quite a long time. But every time I came to Kolkata, never found a company. Finally this time, convinced my parents and here we came !!

Ambience : Royal !! Grand !! Once u enter, u get totally lost into it's aura. As if you travel back in time to the Mughal era. 

Food: Perfect example of fine dine! 
We ordered kakori kabaab and galauti kabab for starters . They tasted amazingly soft, melting into our mouths. We tried eating them with naan, it was good too. We also ordered Awadhi Handi Biryani, butter Naan , Nargisi Kofta and Raita. Each and every item was excellent.

Service : Prompt n courteous !!!

Cost : Honestly after what we tasted, cost actually doesn't matter !!

Must recommended to all my friends who love good food !!

As one sees the establishment of Oudh 1590 and is welcomed into its premises by the brawny man at the door,the Nawabi vibes come rushing to them,with the interior decor and the background melodies.

A easy way to locate this place is to head north on Sarat Bose Road from Deshapriya Park crossing and take a left turn into the lane right after Tamarind. You'll find it just up ahead on your left.

Have been here a multiple times,the first time being to try out their main attraction-The Galouti Kebabs and the Nehari Khaas.

The Galouti Kebab is rightly called the pièce de résistance of the Awadhi cuisine : 4 pieces of perfection that melt in your mouth instantaneously,served with some pickled onions and coriander chutney.The three of us loved it so much the first time we tasted it that we ended up ordering another serving of it.

Nehari Khaas: A light preparation of Mutton shanks. Had this with the Lucknowi paratha.

During the second visit to this place, we tried the Nawabi Kebab platter which consisted of Mahi Tikka,Jheenga Zafrani,Gosht Burra,Gosht Zafrani,Murg Qalmi Kebab and Afghani Kebab. One serving of this platter plus some parathas was sufficient for the three of us.

I haven't tried their Rann and Awadhi Biriyanis yet as I'm afraid I might not appreciate it,being a staunch admirer of the Calcutta style Biriyani ;)

This rating is exclusively for the Puja Season. I visited this afternoon....where the Puja season has just started to sink in.
The menu has been cut short. They have specified short list menu,hardly totalling upto 40items max.
The mutton  galauti kebab just melted in the mouth, couldn't have been softer. The Nehari was really mind blowing.

But the their speciality i.e. Rann biryani was pathetic. (Very very blunt & tasteless. Any given day Arsalan is miles ahead than this day's biriyani. I hope this is just a error due to this Puja snag.

Talking to the sitting set up, couples must share their table during this Puja season with other guests(for managing the Puja crowd,as said by the management) .

Looking forward to come back with a better experience than this. Thanks...

What hits you is the raajshahi atmosphere that you experience when you enter. The decor, the music, even the heavy bronze glasses that they serve you water in.lol. The food was better than most of the mughlai retaurants as the flavours that they mention in the menu is in fact present in the dish.For example Zaafrani Murg, was tender and the smell and slight taste of Zaafran was evident. Their Awadhi Biryani is nice and has its own uniqueness. Next time will try the highly recommended Galauti kababs. The service was prompt. A great option for a dinner for couples as well as family.

Kakori kebab was just yum...The taste of the dish still lingers in my mouth ...its a must try
Rann biryani was good
Lukhnowi paratha was also good...
Nihari khaas I took because most of the people who reviewed had recommended...but I didn't like it much..It was a different taste altogher!

Very good Awadhi food! The soft classical music (thumris, tappas and ghazals) playing augments the food and decor and truly recreates the essence of Oudh in 1590 (perhaps). Recommended: mutton galauti kabab with lucknowi paratha, Rann biriyani, and yes - Shahi tukra (must try)! I look forward to my next visit.

No doubt one of the most royal places to dine out in Kolkata. Even the gatekeeper has an Awadhi swag. The Raag music playing with the Mughal setting makes you awe inspired. The food of course is equally mouth watering. Personally I had Qalmi Kabab, Raan biriyani(more than sufficient for two) and Gulawati Kabab. It's a must visit for all great foodies in Kolkata.

This awesome restaurant serves the best biryani in Kolkata according to me. I have always recommended my friends and family to try out Oudh 1590 since then. There's nothing to speak about the ambience. Its mesmerizing. The theme is 19th century Awadh. A must-visit place.

The best place for having indian and moghlai dishes in kolkata. Specially the types of it's biriyani. Each n every one of it has it's different test. But the overall price is a bit expensive. Otherwise no issues with it's quality and taste.

Biriany is an easy thing to nail. And this is when i realized its equally tough as you are not the only one in this Mughal cuisine food race! 

Ambiance - 5.5/5  (extra score for good performance)

Well speaking of the Mughals you will imagine this place. Well, of-course for its food but more of the ambiance. A perfect ambiance that will make you feel like you are sitting amidst the Mughal darbar in Lucknow. There sense of exactness and attention to details are remarkable. Sometimes, if you are a bong, you will forget that you are in bengal and start communicating in Hindi :-D. 

The Taste of Lucknow - 4.5/5

Its smells good. Looks appetizing and plated with perfection.
Delightful in taste. 

Conduct  - 4/5

Its pretty good.

Value Of Money - 3.5/5

Its a bit expensive and might pinch your pockets. But its worth the expense.

Average Wait Time - 3/5

Its reasonably provides a some-what agile service.

Please feel free to try it out.

A must visit for food lovers! The galawati kebabs will simply melt in your mouth. Qalmi kebabs are also worth mentioning. They have a wide range of biryanis. We tried the Awadhi Handi Biryani and Murg Irani and they were delicious. The Rann Biryani is one of their specialities. In desserts we tried the Shahi Tukra and Phirni. Have to admit both were awesome. The ambience takes your experience to a different level. If you find yourself at the end of a queue waiting for a table here, its better to have patience. It's worth the wait😊 And there's no exaggeration here.
Basically period dining at its best!!!!!

Full marks for ambience! The place is quite small but pulls off the theme quite well. On entering the restaurant it felt like I've reached the sets of some movie. However I personally felt that the volume of the thumri playing should've been a little lower. Food was great. We order galauti kabab, partha, rann biriyani and chicken masala. Stuffs were cooperative. A pleasant experience on a whole :)

Had dinner at Oudh 1590. Went with lot of expectations. The efforts to create an ancient ambiance is successful to an extend. Good carving of wooden work can be seen on the walls. Light olden classical music creates a good ambiance. 
Ordered some Mughlai starter drink as available in the menu card along with starters. Surprisingly the starters were served before the drinks. Had to remind them to serve the drinks, and it followed soon after. Two of the starters were good but the "" was not cooked well. I was unable to cut it with a knife as can be seen in the uploaded video. On requesting an opportunity to meet the manager there was prompt efforts to try and replace the dish, which was rejected. Eventually the manager arrived and I informed him of the situation and my intention to upload the review in Zomato. Soon after the manager left, I got peices of papers in my drink Again the manager was called and complain lodged. He tried to explain that the source of the paper might be from ice-cream. Then the much awaited main course comprising of biriyani arrived. Ordered were jheenga biriyani and murgh pardah biriyani. In the jhinga biriyani the prawns were not well cooked, but was acceptable since sometimes you don't want to overcook the prawns for the fear of they getting rubbery, and in the end you undercook them. Then came the chicken biriyani. The taste of the gravy was good but the chicken was again not cooked and could not be cut with all my efforts. The manager was called again and I offered him to try and cut the chicken. He put all his efforts with his weight being in standing position and managed to cut the chicken but he accepted that the chicken was not cooked and again promptly offered to replace the chicken piece which was rejected. He was explained that by replacing the chicken the agony will not be erased. He was told that I had gone there with lot of expectations having checked the reviews of zomato - all the while the manager was very courteous.
Worth mentioning here is that the manager was also made aware that his rest room was stinking. The checklist indicated that the rest room was last checked 7 .5 hours ago at 2 pm. He did not show much concern about the situation as if this is their normal and the stinking rest rooms are acceptable to them.
Overall experience - place had good ambiance but being a small ace and fellow customers talking loudly it seemed to be a bit chaotic. Staffs were well mannered, never did any staff try to go into any argument with me. However, the waiters were a little inexperienced. Correct cutlery are not provided as per the order. Only fork and spoons are available. You have to ask for knife which they will give to specific persons who asked for them. Desert spoons were not available and I had the desert with rice spoon. 
Dealing with the staff I got the impression that this kind of incident had happened earlier also and the resolution they provide to complaining customers is replacement. Now if you are happy with that - good for you. But for me I don't want to have this experience at all. I can't think of getting my food replaced and not giving a review for others to refer to. This place has a rating of 4.3 and I had three - actually four complains on the same visit. Is it believable? Zomato should seriously check their rating system - something has gone wrong somewhere - nowadays you can't just depend on Zomato's rating and visit a Resturant. We have to fall back upon the olden system of hearing about a place from a near and dear one before visiting it. 
Having met with a stubborn customer like me who would put a review on zomato instead of compromising with a replacement, I saw the manager requesting other customers to give them a good rating on zomato in my presence - thereby letting me know that it hardly matters to him if one customer is giving a negative review. In the end what do we have -a rating system which you can't believe upon. I could not upload the video of trying to and unable to cut the piece of kabab with knife as there is no provision of uploading a video in zomato - check this link -

The food has distinct unique taste, including the biriyanis and the kebabs. The quantity is sufficient. The prices are on the higher side, but it is worth it.

But they are awful in terms of billing. They make you wait long for the bill to arrive. And then, they come with an incorrect bill, either the items or quanity, or both are incorrect. So either they overcharge or undercharge. And if you insist for the bill to be corrected, they make you wait for another 15 minutes.

Biriyani coold have been better

There's hardly anyone left in the city who hasn't been to Oudh! The food, the decorations, the Ghazals, everything is simply mesmerizing. No wonder I have always seen a waiting queue outside, even on normal working days.  

I have been to this place several times and would strongly recommend the Galawati kabab, Qalmi kabab, Murgh Pardah Biryani, Awadhi Handi Biryani, Murgh Irani, Gosht Rogan Josh and the Kulfi. You can also try the other dishes, all of them have a varied flavor, but you really cannot go wrong with the ones mentioned here!

It's a nice, ambient place near Deshpriya Park crossing. The place has setup with the old and rugged Awadhi decor. An elegant, desi feel would engulf you, the moment you step in. 

The food items are spicy, delicious and homely. Be cautious while placing orders, the quantity is surprisingly good. The Awadhi Thaali is just the perfect item to order!!!

This place is Hogwarts for Biriyani lovers! Everything, from the starters to the desserts are absolutely perfect. Hands down, the best Mughlai joint in the city. We tried 3 types of starters, namely, galouti kabab (the finely minced mutton was so good that I felt like crying), qalmi kabab (the best kabab related to chicken leg I have ever had), and saving the best for the last, Sugandhi Mahi Kabab (tender bhetki marinated in lime, cream and loads of deliciousness that absolutely melts in your mouth). Next up was the all time favorite rann biriyani ( with apparent flavors of ghee and tenderly shredded pieces of juicy mutton) and keema kaleji (which looked, smelled and tasted so tasty that I forgot to click pics). After that was done, we ordered all three varieties of desserts! The firni was unlike what you get at most joints. It actually qualifies for a proper dessert out here. The shahi tukda was almost as good as Shabbir's but with more flavour. The kulfi was ok, and a bit over priced (the only average tasting dish I had). Would I visit this place again? In a heartbeat! All that I had, pinched me back 2ks, but that's a small price to pay for taking advantage of this human birth.

We went to Oudh1590, Deshapriya Park on the final Saturday night of July, 2017. This was our first time at this restaurant. On our arrival we were thrown off by the waiting queue. At least 20 people were waiting outside the restaurant in mild rain on the footpath, which they have turned into their property. I have seen waiting queues in Peter Cat, Mainland China and some other restaurants as well. But at least Peter Cat or Mainland China has a place where people, waiting to be served, can wait patiently without having to run around for shades when it's raining.

I went to put our name on the waiting list but the host was not in his place. In the mean time, I asked the door-keeper (with a large mustache) about the estimated waiting time, he told me that it would take around 45 minutes to 1 hour. He also suggested me another restaurant in case I can't wait (which I never mentioned). At this point I seriously considered leaving but waited for the promise of checking out a trending restaurant. Surprisingly, the host, after he arrived, was also saying the same to other people, who arrived after us. Unlike me, some replied back with caustic comments like - "Do you send everyone (whoever comes here) to that restaurant?", etc. In my opinion, from a customer's perspective, such a comment is quite justified after the unnecessary tease.

After approximately one and a half hours of waiting with a toddler, we could enter the restaurant at around 10:30 p.m. on a condition that we have to share our table with a college-going couple. I didn't really know what to do at this point but we just went in as we had already invested a lot of time. It was already turning out to be a very uniquely unpleasant experience for us even before we could order.

The interior is dark colored and unusually dimly lit. I would rather term it to be different than call it classy. We did not want to waste any more time and went for our order immediately. We ordered galouti kebab, raan biryani, rogan josh with firni and gulab sharbat. The nice and slow background music didn't go well with the chatter and the loud communication of the waiters. The metal alloy plates were probably part of the experience but once again I didn't like it.

Galouti kebab was too earthy and too finely ground for my taste. It was a little too hot and spicy as well. We wanted to order two raan biryanis but the waiter, taking our orders, suggested to take only one instead of two and later when the order arrived we saw that his suggestion was spot on. The orders took a while to arrive. The raan biryani was very dry. This was my first time eating this item so I was not sure whether it is supposed to be so dry or not. Whatever the ideal raan biryani might be, I didn't like the one we were served here. Also, my expectations regarding this type of biryani (as found on Google) were aligned with a popular Mediterranean food - spiced rice with lamb shank. I was taken aback to find that the shanks didn't come in one piece here. Instead, the meat (hopefully from some shank) was highly shredded and therefore was devoid of any juice.  The rogan josh was not bad but you can have a similar rogan josh in Bawarchi, Bedwin or Shiraz any day. Firni and gulab sharbat were pretty standard.

Bottom line: The food is highly overrated. The interior is not appealing. The warm inviting culture of the East have been replaced by rudeness and lack of class at this establishment. I would never visit it again, if it was up to me.

Note: My review rates the branch at Deshapriya Park. I am not sure about how things are at the other branches of Oudh 1590.

Evaluation:

1. Waiting time/arrangement: 0/5

Comment: At least the queue was what it was supposed to be - first in first out. So, no negative marks.

2. Decor: 2.5/5

Comment: Different (weird to some extent). Not classy.

3. Ambience: 2/5

Comment: It was confusing. Waiters communicating so loudly and the chatter didn't fit well with the nice music. The experience the owners planned to provide to the customers is half-baked at best.

4. How helpful were the waiters? 4/5

Comment: Re-adjusted the order. Saved me some money.

5. Food

a) Portions: 3.5/5
Comment: Really large biryani portions. Others were standard.

b) Quality: 2/5
Comment: I can name 10 restaurants right from the back of mind, who would treat you to better biryanis on any given day.

6. Value for money: 1.5/5
Food is over-priced compared to the quality. I can understand why ala-carte kebabs in Sigree are so expensive because they cut like butter but the prices here are not justified.

7. Overall experience: 1/5
I had a bad time here and given the foodie I am, that's pretty exceptional. The hype surrounding a trending restaurant Oudh 1590 was met with harsh reality and (to me) it is not worth another visit.

By far the best Biryani in Kolkata.
The aroma the taste are simply awesome.
Go for the Top 2 Biryanis Rann and awadhi handi.. theya re class.. and the quantity is enough for two people.
Alongside go for chaap or Kundan Kaliya
And also try the house special Galawati kebab.
And phirni is also awesome.
The ambience is perfect awadhi with a cool background music.
The staff are extremely polite and caring.
They have a special attire and greet you in the best way.
Just that you may have to wait to get a table.
Deshapriya park outlet being the first of the 3.
Go here to taste the best Biryani in town..

It was my birthday when I visited Oudh 1590 for the first time... That was my best birthday simply because of the mind-boggling food... The restaurant has a real time Awadhi ambience with Lucknowi music playing in the background... The entire decor kept me tongue-tied... Now coming to the food, the best handi biryani and chicken chaap that I had... The Jafrani kebab was also amazing... During my second visit the restaurant attracted me as before.. It is a great place to have Mughlai cuisine at its best.

* Yuuuummm!!!! If you love non-veg and especially Biryani , this is the only place in Kolkata where you can get real Awadhi style Biryani. And! and! and! I tried their Galawati Kebab.... Believe me it was the most delicious mutton I've ever eaten ( I'm not usually a mutton eater). Just awesome!!!
* The quantity of the biryani is more than enough for 2 people ..
* An absolutely quirky and at the same time a relaxing ambience..
* Recommendations:
1. Awadhi Handi Biriyani.
2. Galawati Kebab.
3. Nargisi Kofta.
4. Lucknowi Paratha.

Since a long time I wanted to taste this Awadhi cuisine...n finally it happened when one of my brother recommended this restaurant to me. I surely had no clue about Oudh 1590 till I viewed it in zomato. Seeing the rating I urged more to visit this royal place.

Located in a prime place, Oudh 1590 stands tall in the Desapriya Park West Road with all its grandeur. A man with a big moustache welcomed us in a purely nawabi style. It was a Monday so we didn't have had to wait and got our table as soon as we entered. The inner decor moved me. I felt like I just entered a haweli or so. Big chandeliers, coloured glasses n the ghazal which was being played in the background truly matched it's theme. Just that I felt there lacked some bright lights.

Now, coming to the food. We ordered soda shikanji, galawati kebab, qalmi kebab, raan biriyani and kulfi falooda. I absolutely have nothing to say about these dishes! Galawati kebab melted in our mouth just as it should. Marvelous! Qalmi kebab is a preparation where they serve chicken leg pieces. It was very soft and had a very nice and different blend of flavours. Raan biriyani just made my day. Served in a earthen pot with shredded mutton pieces, the biriyani was delicious! And the quantity was more than enough for 2 persons. Kulfi falooda and soda shikanji was also good.

The service was really good. The waiters attended n suggested us well. The price is reasonable if compared with the amount of food they served. A good place, must try for the Indian cuisine lovers!

Had been to this place last week after innumerable attempts because every time we plan to go to this place, we end up going somewhere else because of the huge crowd waiting outside it. So finally this time I  managed to make it after waiting for half an hour, that too in the Afternoon, on a Weekday. But I have to admit that the wait was worth since the food was superbly amazing and the service very fast. We'd ordered, 
Galawati kabab which was heavenly. It just melts in your mouth. 
The awadhi handi biryani- since I'm not very fond of mutton we took the chicken one and it was amazing. The biryani had a different taste to it, making it stand out from the other normal ones.
Chicken Irani- this again was a delectable dish and the gravy deserves a special mention. 
So overall I had a wonderful experience and would recommend everyone to surely give it a visit.

A long awaited visit to oudh 1590, deshapriya park.
We had taken attempts before, but the long queue had always haunted like a bee. But today, all thanks to  the determination, finally we made it to the awadhi quisine. 
Timing: Lunch (around 2pm-3pm, we had to wait at least 30mins to get our turn)
Foods ordered: (not much) murgh sugandhi kabab, keema paratha, gosht bhuna, raan biryani. Undoubtedly, food is the main attraction and the most valued thing here. (Descending order)Raan biryani was absolutely bliss, in gosht bhuna, gosht was so tender, keema paratha was perfectly cooked, but i found the kabab not to be that good, aroma of 'gandhoraj' wasn't there and tastewise it was flat.
Ambience: 4/5. Loved the decor, the music and the cutlery.
Service: I am not much happy about it, will give it 2.5/5. Each time we had to call someone for the assistance :( .

It's my second home and it is the king of all mughlai dishes. I just love everything off this place, be it ambience, be it food, be it the waiter service, everything is perfect here. So, my favorite dish is raan biryani and nihari khaas. These two everyone should taste. The best biryani dishes I have tasted is in Oudh. Thought it costs a bit expensive, the quantity they serve is a good one. I mean to say that if you order a raan biryani it will serve two of you. The foods are tasteful. If you want to taste the best mughlai dishes in Kolkata then Oudh is the place for you.

The place and its decor is royal. Everything is grand. The place is dimly lit with music playing in the background. The staff was polite and courteous. Coming to the food, we ordered Afghani chicken, Raan biryani, Moti biryani, Murgh Irani, Awadi Dal and Tandoori roti. For drinks we had, Soda Sikhanji, Aam khas, Badam Sharbat and Lime Water. Both the Biryanis were a welcome change from the usual Kolkata style one we have. Though the Raan biryani and Murg Irani were my favourite. I had the Badam Sharbat and it was absolutely delicious. The Awadhi Dal was not so good. Tandoori Roti was soft. Afghani chicken was so-so. Overall it is an excellent place for dining with friends or family or even your date.

Last week went here and honestly I was basically longing to be here for so long. The ambience was too good to describe which is applicable for the staffs as well. I couldn't take picture beacuse of the insufficient light. Anyway we ordered Awadhi Biriyani and Zafrani Kebab. Let me be brutally honest here but  both the dishes smell different beacuse it is supposed to have the Lucknow wala experience. Just the piece of mutton I got was not a very good one and I was dissapointed. Else its ok type!

Been there with my family and the ambiance, the food everything was just excellent.. The galawti kabab, burrah kabab, shammi kabab, take anything from the menu, won't upset ur taste buds. Rather we had to order all the three starters--each item twice. It was so irresistible that all my family members demanded "once more , once more!!" We ordered three different types of biriyanis and all three of them were just awesome.  Must try this restaurant!

This new addition to the much celebrated Oudh 1590 family does complete justice to the legacy of Oudh. Great ambience, cordial staff and lip smacking food.

To start with I have no clue how does this place have such high ratings considering the cuisine that they serve is nothing close to what you will get Lucknow region. I tried the pardah biriyani which was a disgrace. They mention that it's spiced with different flavours of Lucknow/ Hyderabad. But trust me it's as bland as water. Has no taste. Yes it is sufficient for two and that's all that you can say good about the preparation. The galauti kebab is okayish as i have tried much better ones in Lucknow Hyderabad and for that matter even in bangalore. The decor is good but I found it too dark and you would  have difficulty seeing the colour of the biriyani. Too much price to pay for below average food. Please visit if you like non spicy food or probably for the elderly people. Not recommended for people who loves biriyani or have a taste for it.

Birthday Girl Reviews!

Hello to my lovely peeps! Yesterday was 17th August (my birthday) and like every other creature on this earth, I was very excited about my birthday. :)

One of the most crucial questions in my life is "kothae jabo bday te khete?" (where should I go on my bday to eat?) but this time it was really crystal clear to me. I and Ankur decided together, lets go to Oudh 1590 which was on my bucket list for long. Voila! We landed at their Deshapriya Park branch for basically two reasons: it is their flagship branch and it was closest to Behala.

Location: Opposite Carmel Primary School. Go to Lake Mall and then walk towards Deshapriya park. On your left you will see a lane (the same lane where Choco Lust falls) and after two lanes on your right you will see Oudh standing with all its glory.

Ambiance: It was dangerously amazing! Pure awadhi ambiance with light ghazal playing at the background. The tables and cutlery used also went hand in hand with the theme of the restaurant. I must mention here about the menu card. I have seen many different types of fancy menu cards but this one was damn heavy man. I mean look at the weight of the menu card and you can make out how much they have paid attention to minute details of the place.

Staff: In one word, one of the best I have seen till date. They are courteous, helpful and most importantly they know how to make the right impression on their guests. Right from the word go, they were extremely professional and friendly at the same time. You can just go to this place to feel their lovely courtesy. Smile! This is what I came back with.

Food: Oudh 1590 serves one of the best awadhi cuisines in Kolkata. Right from their authentic presentation to their rich taste, I am in love with every bit of their food. We became devils and I can prove this to you. Read on!

We ordered Badam Sharbat, Gelawati Kebab, Raan Biriyani, Nehari Khas, Lucknowi Paratha, Shahi Tukda and Firni.

Summary of all the food:
Badam Sharbat is one of the best drinks I had in recent times. The sweetness was really proportionate to the amount I need in my life. It was not at all overly sweet and just became the perfect start to our food journey.
Next came the legendary Oudh special Galawati Kebab and Lucknowi Paratha. Now I have a word to say about this thing. Lucknowi paratha was really good and crispy. I have been to Lucknow and have tasted their local delicacies in their allies only. Oudh only revived that taste in my mouth. Galawati kebab was just amazing and melted in my mouth like a dream. The feeling can be compared to the feeling of kissing your loved one after a long tiring day. Amazing isn't it? There were 4 pieces of kebab which I feel is a little less for the price paid. I would have loved if it was 6 pieces. Hope the authorities are listening. Fingers crossed!
Then came our main course- Raan Biriyani again a speciality of Oudh and Nehari Khaas. Biriyani was just the way it should be. No complaints! Perfect amount of spice with a high quality rice. Tender and juicy mutton pieces and a huge amount to satisfy two hungry souls- what more to ask for? I missed the potato though! :P
Nehari Khaas was relatively average. Well I know many of you will disagree to this statement but somehow we felt that it marred the flavour of the biriyani. I would have preferred the biriyani alone.
Salad was actually like pretty normal with no added points to be mentioned. Price is a bit high for the salad though.
Then came my favourite portion of the lunch- desert. Being a meetha freak, we ordered two deserts- Shahi Tukda and Firni. I loved the firni more as I felt the shahi tukda was a little too sweet for me. Ankur didn't let me have his firni but I still managed to have a spoon. Birthday girl benefits!
.
.
.
Ps: The ambiance was of top notch and what added to the extra charm is the behaviour of the staffs. They are extremely well behaved and can make any customer fall for their charm. The smiling faces and ever attentive nature really stole my heart.
.
.
.
.
If you ask me and if you trust this review even by a small amount, then please go to this place with your loved ones! It is a perfect place to pop the question too. :)

Oudh 1590, you made my 2017 wala bday so so special. Thank you :)

I feel a Lucknowish ambience here...ordered badam sarbaat, Rann biriyani handi and side dish.. biriyani is very light and well cooked.. badam sarbaat was heavenly.. bt one thing which is very disappointing dat mutton pieces could have been adequate ..otherwise its good

The decor speaks of the regal Awadhi era of the Nawabs who ruled some of the Northern parts of India.

Oudh 1590 has quite a comprehensive but well decorated menu. We started with Qalmi Kabab and Zafrani Kebab both of which which boasted of saffron as its core ingredient. I particularly liked the Qalmi Kabab as it had more elements of spices.

Our main course included Rann Biyani and Awadhi Biryani both of which were excellent and the aroma of the spices was mesmerizing. One portion of Biriyani is good enough for two adults. The savoury ordered was Murgh Chaap and Murgh Irani which was quite delectable.

But options for dessert is very limited and the service is half-pie.

Food - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Ambience - 5/5

Nice to see a typical awadhi restaurant in Calcutta. Beautiful ambiance, and well behaved staff. I should say really appreciate the staff for their behaviour.

For food, ordered a Raan biryani, only one word: awesome. Typical awadhi biryani as it should be. 
Ordered Fish tikka, it was very nice. Treat for your tongue. In the main course also ordered Murgh Irani, once again very good taste, typical mughlai preparation.

Now the worst part: The kebab. Ordered Kakori kebab, and the restaurant should actually first understand what is the difference between a sheekh kebab/kakori kebab and shami/gelawati kebab is. The kebab was nothing but only a shami/gelawati kebab rolled in the form of a seekh kebab. Did not like it all. First of all it has to be a sheekh kebab. Then you can prepare a typical sheekh kebab or a kakori kebab. Not satisfied with the kebab at all.

Overall a very good experience.

Have visited several times and never been disappointed at all and one of my favourite place in town.
My favourite here is the mutton raan biryani,The jheenga biriyani cooked with prawns is another worth mentioning and also the Palak biriyani.
Among the starters, the galauti kabab, kakori kabab, served with Lucknow paratha and chicken Zafraan kabab and Fish Zafraan kabab are my favourites too.
Service was as always great too and this is a must visit place to all...

The restaurant serves not only Mughlai cuisine but also Mughlai feels... An amazing ambience that teleports you immediately to Nawabi Lucknow... The gazals played in the background adds to the charm... The decor is too fascinating... Now coming to food, the biryani was excessively good and the chicken chaap was the best among the lot... The service is beyond praise... The beverages and desserts are also quite impressive

Had a horrendous experience after waiting for around an hour on a Sunday evening finally got a sit. The portion where we were sitted lacked proper lighting (they informed that they have a major electrical fault) but there was no lack of initiative to take guests in. 
Now the food. The Kasturi kababs were cold. Biryani was cold with no mutton only bones were there . When we asked about dessert nothing was available and the waiter seems like waiting when are we going to leave so that he can put in the next guest. Disgusting service I'm never gonna go back to Oudh

A great place to go on a date with your special someone and the ambience with dim lights and the "umrao jaan" kind of songs playing in the background make you feel relaxed !
Oudh is also one of best choices you have when you are planning to have a great food for dinner with your family or friends ! I have been there twice and looking forward to going there again and again for the taste and smell of the special Awadhi Biriyani !! *_* #oudh1590

The decor was excellent. The heavy designs on the wall, paintings,awadhi music, mirrors with minakari.. altogether it was a nawabi experience.
We had ordered mutton galauti kebab which tasted good. Oudh's special Raan biryani was unavailable which was a turn off. We also ordered Awadhi handi biryani, Moti biryani. I can easily say Awadhi handi biryani is one of the best biryanis I had till date but the moti biryani was not up to the mark. We ordered Murgh Irani as side dish, but we were so full that we barely touched it. The pieces of chicken they served were not good.
The staff were friendly. They have the most unique way of serving mints and wash bowl. Overall, an average experience.

Strongly agree with the review by Sujata Thaker. It's articulate and every word of it is true. Please do read it to get an idea of the place and food. How on earth can this place get a rating of 4.3??!!!! Me and my family had a bunch of their non veg dishes - biriyanis, kababs and even gravy, all below average in taste . When given the feedback that the food isn't fine, the servers and the manager  were bluffing, that this is how it should taste. We've had food in Lucknow, we don't expect that amount of authenticity , but this was just bad food at Oudh. Pretty bad in taste. Why the hype? I hope I can continue to trust Zomato ratings. Dear Zomato , this place doesn't even deserve a 3.4 rating ! How come it has got  4.3?? Fishy!!!!!!!

One fine sunny afternoon, along with my family, decided to visit Oudh for lunch! There were ample parking spaces on the adjoining roadside in front of the place, although might get tricky during school closing hour as it stands right in front of a school around the corner! 
Coming to Oudh, ushers and staff waiting at the tables were courteous and tending to suggestions well. My parents being vegetarian, I ordered Veg recipes more... Shahi Dahi kebab, Subz Kofta Kalia, Daal, Peas pulao and tandoori roti. In non-vegetarian, I settled for Murgh Chaap. 
All the vegetarian items were very good, very much balanced in oil n rightful flavourful, but the Peas pulao won the show!! It was superb... Subtle hint of all the necessary aroma and still so less in oil... It was in fact one of the best Peas pulao I had till now. 
I dint like Murgh chaap at all... There are plenty of restaurants all around which caters way better chicken chaap... It was way too sour, and the thick gravy was missing in flavor and taste, and to top up, for small sized two pieces, it was very pricey. 
Overall, it was a nice outing, and I look forward to visit the place and try some of their signature dishes next time!

Disappointing to say the least. I went there after poring through many reviews at Zomato, and was super excited as a Biryani fanboy. But Oudh disappointed me. The Galawti kebab served was a mess of mince meat with no texture what so ever, and overuse of spices (not complaining of heat though). The Biryani was even more disappointing and horrible. It was cold, served in Gargantuan proportions. I can't fathom how a normal couple can eat so much, let alone any single person. The rice used wasn't even Basmati, and of little flavour. The Murgh Irani wasn't cooked to perfection and again a product of way too much use of spices, so much as to suppress one another leading to a deadlock to the taste buds. But the silver lining was the Sugandhi kebab, soft succulent pieces, with a flavor if kime, this was one dish that could be eaten whole heartedly in the entire range. Also the meat in the Biryani was cooked just right. But that's pretty much it. After so much reading on Zomato and other blogs, this was totally out of the blue. 
Not happy, and definitely not going back in the near future.

I entered the place with high expectations and when I reached there, and viewed the restaurant from outside, the wooden panelling impressed me. I was also impressed by the security guard and his greeting at the gate( was intrigued by his handle bar moustache). On entering too I was impressed by the latticed wood work , the set tables with copper glasses and plates and the ghazals being played. But after this everything went downhill....the servers were crowding in one area and talking loudly, even going to the extent of eavesdropping into our conversation!!!The service was lackadaisical, indifferent and too slow. The staff wouldn't crack a smile, they went about their work in a surly manner, with a I couldn't be bothered attitude.The food was also not as good as the reviews make it out to be. I simply cannot understand how this place has got so many recommendations.Of course, I had vegetarian items and it might be argued that they specialise in non vegetarian food. I added Luckhnowi paratha and Lasooni paalak....both disappointed. The paalak was tasteless. The sugandhi panir as starters too was tasteless, even the pudina Chutney, couldn't liven up the dish.The only saving grace was the shahi tukra which I had for dessert, it was yum. My friends who had non veg,too, didn't like the biryani or the mutton dish they ordered.
All in all extremely disappointing place, over hyped and overpriced.

Ambience,, Service,, Food quality are the main three things that a foodie looks forward to find in a restaurant and boy! Oudh 1590 have ticked all the boxes gracefully.. The ambience of an awadhi rajmahal,, the dim lights, classical song in the background added to the flair... Staffs were well dressed nd well-mannered.. and lastly the food quality,, galawti kabab,, zafrani kabab,, rann biryani,, awadhi biryani,, nehaari khas,, all were unique in their own way and all unique tastes just fullfilled our cravings immensely..
p.s. a single platter of biryani is enough for a couple of foodies and also the bill is not over the top,, highly recommended..
go in for a royal experience...

One of the best authentic oudh biriyani outlet of kolkata. I reviewed about their ambience and food in my previous review. Again ambience is exotic and service is good. Except food another interesting thing in this place is their guard. He has a great moustache of rajastani style. Staffs are friendly and well behaved.  
In this turn we ordered fish kebab taste is mouth-watering. Though their speciality is raan biriyani but their other biriyani was damm good.  So try other also. Oudhi hundi biriyani is great tastes. They are flavoured and rich in spicy but very easy to digest. 
Now about the cons. The restaurant should introduce the facility of pre booking table. Yes the place is small but should be provision of table bookin. Every time we have to wait for some time.  But for this mouth watering food lover can wait a bit and it also help in appetite... Other wise its good.

Coming to the food..we ordered awadhi handi biriyani,mutton galawati kabab,sprite. Biriyani was served in a earthen pot. Kababs were too good.. food is enough in quantity. 
One will definitely enjoy the overall experience with a "mahel" wala feeling.

Oudh 1590 is a traditional Awadhi restaurant in Kolkata. They offer mouth watering Nawabi cuisine. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah spent his last days in Kolkata, and true to his Nawabi tradition, Oudh 1590 serves the best of Biryanis and Kebabs in a great ambiance.

The decor is very nice and the waiters are decent and helpful. Sitting arrangement is very comfortable. My favorite dish is Moti Biryani and Galauti Kabab. You must also go for the Kakori Kabab. If you don't want mutton then go for Murgh Tengdi Kabab or Fish Tikka Kabab. My vegetarian friends can go for Shahi Dahi Kabab or Paneer Kabab. Choose from a variety of Biryanis, like Moti Biryani, Raan Biryani or Parda Biryani. Each is unique in taste, style and presentation. You can also try breads like Tandori Roti or Naan. Try it with Murgh Kasa, Rezala, or Chaap. Or else, go for Gosht Qorma, Bhuna or Rezala. Vegetarians try the Awadhi Daal or Paneer Qorma.

Sweet lovers can have a happy ending with Shahi Tukda, Phirni or Kulfi.

Don't miss the Paan shop outside the restaurant!

I’d heard tales of long queues at this place, and that there was no seating provision for waiting customers. As a result, I reached there early in the evening so that we were spared the trouble. I was glad I did so because the dining area is not spacious, and it filled up soon. There are ornate wooden screens and lattice-works on the walls and ceilings, which lend a rich period look to the interiors; the wood furniture in a mahogany hue and earthen/metal utensils complement the decor. The other three members of our group joined me within the next 15-20 minutes, and we ordered a non-vegetarian kebab platter for starters. It was very appetizing, and heightened our expectations from the main course. We ordered two handis of Moti Biryani, and a couple of side dishes. The moti biryani was so-so; I particularly found the ‘motis’ or mutton balls very dry.  The side dishes were okay, though.

First of all , the ambience ..  you will feel that you are dining in some royal family .. The background music was amazing .. 
We ordered Moti biryani , Murgh Irani and in starters Galauti Kabab..
All of the items were top notch .. Amount of biryani is enough for 2 adults .

Well, I was under the impression that Oudh is something mervelous but it's not that. Yeah, foods are good but not that I will die to go back again. The primary reason of the rating is the darkness inside the restaurant. The members were good but they don't seem to be very much enthusiastic. Finally, sorry for my words but I feel the Raan biryani could be much better if the quality of the rice is upgraded. No hard feelings, this is just my personal opinion.

If you love Biriyani & kabab this place is a must go..Try Raan Biriyani & qalmi kabab & nehari khaas . For me I & my partner drenched in rain went there & ordered "gorom gorom Biriyani " & those mouth watering kababs..Though decorations surely gives you feeling like Mughal period but the gazal playing background will surely make the ambience more exquisite. For me that is one thing I really like...Staffs behavior was also good.

Been there yesterday. The ambience was awesome and the staffs had a great attitude. Now when I come to the food, it was a pleasant surprise. Took Galawti Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha and it just melted in my mouth. Then comes the Ran Biriyani n Nihari Khas. Both were good but specially I would like to mention about Nihari Khas. It has a very unique taste and has a rich flavour of spices. So overall the experience was good and would like to visit it again. 😊

Oudhv1590 is tucked in a lane opposite lake mall. The architecture of the restaurant instantly takes one to the historical times of Lucknow. The jhaarbaatis (chandeliers),intricate wooden designs and the background classical music with dim light and food served on copper plates set the mood instantly. Coming to the food,we ordered galawti kebab which came in a quantity of 4 in one plate.The taste was too awesome to describe with mutton that melts in mouth instantly.Lucknowi parathas fried in ghee was one of the best parathas I have ever had. The awadhi handi biriyani(with two chicken pieces and two eggs) was nothing extraordinary.Murgh Irani as a side dish(2 pieces in a plate) was a really good choice and it could turn out to be a perfect dish if not the chicken was so stiff. It was the only negative point that I could find in their dishes. The waiters are nice and the pocket pinch is quite high but the amazing taste makes up for it. Am surely going back to have kebabs with parathas.

Went on Saturday launch for the first time in this branch .. After shopping we were really hungry and rushed to reach Oudh nearly 3.15 pm as it will be closed at 3.30. But surprisingly there was a queue for at least 10 people. So we have to wait for 15 mins. They arranged seats for the outside waiting which showed their kindheartedness to the senior citizens. On a rainy day biriani lovers will never disheartened in Oudh. Previously I went to their salt lake outlet but this south Kolkata outlet is quite smaller in size though the interior and background thumri music will be the same. We got our seat and already decided menus were ordered. When u came to Oudh then u hv to order their special Rann biriani. Really mouth watering biriani with shredded muttons and it's taste 
can challenge any popular biriani from Kolkata's renowned biriani houses. We also ordered awadhi style but it was not like the Rann. Previously ate their murgh pardah that was also not up to this Rann. I'm becoming fond of their Rann biriani.  The mutton rogan josh was also good in taste.. I'm really recommending all biriani lovers to taste their Rann biriani at least once.

The speciality of this place is The Raan Biriyani which is served in a Handi... The biryani is a lucknow style Awadhi biryani so don't expect a Kolkata style biryani in this place.

Oudh is located actually at lake market. It's a restaurant I was thinking of going there for a long time and last Saterday I went there with one of my friend. Everything I liked about this restaurant the ambiance the interior decoration and also the decorations outside.
But I was kept waiting for more than half an hour because of the rush they were having. It's sitting arrangement are little bit different from the others suppose 2 people are sitting in 4 or 6 sitter table. So that's why I have to wait. 
Now, the dishes they provide was fantastic the quality was really good and I have to say that. Quantity if you want to know is good enough you can order for one and share in between. So, if you are a biriyani lover and want so well decorated and ambiance restaurant then surely go for this one.

Wanted Biryani for lunch. Landed in this restaurant with my uncle and by the que we understood that it would be something exquisite. Well after a 40 minute wait we finally got a two sitter.
As we entered we saw a packed restaurant very low light with mere visibility. But by the rush, the 40 minute wait was justified. As soon as we entered we were greeted by one of the serving person with lot of warmth and comfort. Though I would like to highlight that the right side of the restaurant needs light, not a bright one though, cause that would spoil the ambiance. It was Biryani festival and we asked for the variation available. Soon it came to light that it was more of minced mutton dish which was highlighted more. Not going for the minced we ordered for the traditional biryani which there signature.

Very honestly the biryani was average but the dahi (curd) along with biryani made it taste exquisite. The mutton was tender and the aroma was just fine. Though it was not the typical kolkata biryani but it had its own unique taste.

Bottom line : slightly over hyped but overall a good experience.

When you are Bong, then it need no reason or occasion to have Biriyani and particularly when it comes about Awadhi biriyani, the name Oudh 1590 comes into first place. A 4.0+ rating restaurant, which is popular for its multiple types of Biriyani, is really something eye-catching point for all Biriyani lovers like me.

Few days ago, was trying to order their biriyani via Online food ordering platform but was unable to do that due to the distance. So I visited their Desapriya park brunch to grab my favorite biriyani. When I reached the restaurant, it was almost 9PM and the restaurant was almost full of customers, but still the stuffs allow me to sit inside their dining section area till my order became ready. So a big thanks to Stuffs and management.

The interior of the restaurant was too decorative and the dim lighting inside, adds some real Awadhi feelings in your dining experiences. Big painting and wooden works was really draw your attentions.

I ordered 1 Zafrani kebab, 1 Raan Biriyani, 1 Peas Pulao, 1 Ghost Shahi Qorma and 3 firni. The preparation time was about 20 minutes though they told me, it will take about 10 minutes. I guess the time was delayed due to high demand. But okey. So forget about the time and lets come to the food –

Zafrani Kebab – I ordered this item with the help of the stuffs. 6 pieces Boneless chicken were there with little saffron aroma. The chicken pieces were well grilled and the tastes like heavenly. The kebab comes with masala onion which also tastes good with it. Overall awesome.
Raan Biriyani – This item was in my wish list for a loooooong time and this one is Oudh special item too. The Biriyani was cooked in Dum Pukht style in an earthen pot and the mutton pieces inside it was something you can die for. Super soft, juicy in nature. The fragrance of the biriyani was too attractive. The quantity of the biriyani was sufficient for two persons. A complementary raita was also served with the biriyani, which also goes well with the biriyani. Must try item here.
Peas Polao – Nothing special about it. Fine steamed rice, cooked with green peas and ghee. No such spices were added into it, so good for those persons who don’t want to have spicy main courses.
Ghost Shahi Qorma – Midsized mutton pieces were cooked in a yoghurt based gravy with full spicy flavor. The side dish goes excellent with the biriyani and Polao also. Overall good.
Firni – Everything is perfect when its ending is perfect. Yes, the firni gave itz intro in such way. Rich kesaria flavor and saffron smelling really melts your heart down. Will recommended it, to have it in chill mode. Awesome in one word. Must try as a dessert.

With all the food mentioned above, it costs around 1656INR inclusive of all taxes and packing charges which is a decent amount. In conclusion, I will say Oudh is a must stop destination for all Biriyani lovers. Have their Awadhi biriyani and it will surely melts your heart down. Overall a nice dining experiences.

Amidst all the brands trending Awadhi cuisine in kolkata, Oudh 1590  successfully made period dining a grand affair in this city with its dim lighted royal decor ambiance and singular food.
Biryani never disappoints the people of Kolkata. Their love for this awadhi mastery is eternal and when any restaurant provide kolkatans what they want with a royal feel that automatically becomes one of the best. Oudh 1590 is also not an exception of that.
The speciality of this restaurant is, every Biriani is Raan Biriani ( which is soft and delicious).
One must try sahi tukda in the dessert section which is their speciality.

Food quality, quantity, ambiance​ and staff behaviour all good. Highly Recommended for all the food lovers who want to experience their food with a royal feel.

Well we went there for my bday celebration!! This was  first time i visited this outlet. Earlier I have always been to the salt lake outlet. Food was nice here just as in salt lake. But what disappointed me was the behavior of the staffs. Every now and then they would come and ask whether we are done or not which doesn't happen in saltlake. Service was not upto the mark. Seevice here did not match the standard set in mind by the salt lake outlet. The only staff whose behavior was good and appreciable was that of the guard who was standing outside the outlet.

It was an special day for me for some reason, to enjoy I invited my friend. So let me start here.. 

First of all I'm an avid traveler and a foodie too, many a times I have to ask my friends or relatives to know where to go in an unknown place to eat, but now I seems to have Zomato by my side.

Opened the app.. Searched for 4+ rating... Oudh1590... And dantanaaaaa I was here. 
Waited for half an hour #excitment
Sat on table 6 #can c the crouds
Ordered :

1)Murg tandoori _looks wise seemed okok, taste wise was missing the spices, the green Wali chutney was not found, onions were forcefully made tangy. 

2)Awadhi handi biryani_ when ever I use see the pot arriving, by default my mouth starts to water. The moment the upper foil is teared apart, a burst of sunami of flavors use to encounters me, but this time it was lacking... I mean seriously. The 2 Mutton 2 egg concept was something new, but irrelevant. Needless to say it was  below average in every aspects. 
The most horror to me was a small bowl of Raita which we both had to share. Wait wait this is not the real problem, the Raita was a sweet curd with no onion or chilli or Corriender... Uffffff. 

3)Murgh rezala_ To rescue from the Raita that literally spread the Raita, it was our final shot. Thank God it was satisfying. 

To the viewers :I like spicy food and prefer things smoked. Oudh1590 can be for those who like things simple and less experimented ( yes the menu was of only 2 pages)... Also the ambience was good but the crowd can destroy the essence of nawab texture.

Oudh 1590, located near Desapriya Park, is a good one for having awadhi dishes. Had a wish to visit this place & finally visited with a friend. We ordered

● Galwati Kabab: 3.2/5

● Raan Biriyani: 4/5

● Murgh Irani: 3.8/5

Food was good. I liked their Raan Biriyani as it had chunks of tender boneless delicious mutton.

Ambience: dark, well decorated interior, comfortable seats. Period dining experience, as they say. 4/5

Price: Our meal was of around 1100 Rupees.

Service: was okay.

overall a good experience.

This restaurant is famous fr it's interior decor nd exceptional Awadhi cuisine. Nd truly, the decorated wooden wall, the antique touch of the furnitures, the oil paintings, the utensils , the jhar lanthan , the memorizing gajal of Begam Akhtar nd spcly that man infrnt of ta gate , wid a big afghani mustache, made me feel lyk 'ek din er nabab', hvng lunch in a Nababi mahal in a Nababi style. Let's tlk abt the food.....the galawti kabab ws awsm in one wrd, vry smooth, almst melted in mouth. Here's a sggstn, pls hv parathas wid it otherwise it'll b bread without butter. The Qalmi kabab ws mouth watering too wid it's coriander flavour, tender chicken leg piece. Their speciality, the raan biriyani ws vry unique in taste as it is cooked in awadhi styl, wid full of aroma nd shredded mutton pieces bt still nt much oily nd spicy. The one handi of biriyani is more than enough fr two ppl. I like the tangy flavour of the gosht bhuna too . Bt the mutton pieces could b more soft. The gosht roghan josh ws nt lyke the roghan josh we usually hv . The gravy of it ws more or less like the gosht qorma. Bt still , they both hd tasted quite good. The stuff wr vry much gentle nd hlpful too. The restaurant is alwys mobbed , even in lunch hrs too. Bt if u dnt mk it count Oudh cn giv u a Nababi day .

A 0.5 deduction only bcoz of the lack of space inside (jokes apart).
Ambience:
Wonderful. Will take you back in time to the age of the mughals. Soulful music and the decorum is created in such a way (even the cctv cams and ACs were not spared when it comes to coloring and making it uniform with the walls :) ).

Food:
I would love to be there every weekend only for there galawati kebab, if not for anything else. Its minced mutton turned into a deliciously tasting dish, one which will leave you craving for more.
We also ordered Mutton Rann biryani and Mutton awadhi biryani along with a mutton side dish (pardon me as i dont remember the name).
They both tasted at a different level and also how uniquely they brought two different flavous onto the same biryani.
Price:
6 of us after taking 4 biryanis, 2 galawati kebab plates and 1 chicken and 1 mutton side dish had to shell out only 4k which is quite reasonable.

Overall:
A wonderful experience and a perfect way to end a sunday for some crazzy foodies in our group.
I would reccomend this place to everyone specially if you are planning to take your family. This is one place which should be there in your wishlist.

Cheers to the team at Oudh 1590.

The tale of Awadh and Mughals is as old as history itself. The ascendancy of Mughlai cuisine over the region of Awadh was inevitable during the mughal rule. The flair of Awadhi cuisine despite of having striking similarities with Central Asian and Middle Eastern cooking patterns is indigenous to India today.
                                                                ...

I had visited oudh on sevaral occasions, picked up takeaway from here and I am writing this review after several visit the interior of the Deshapriya Parl Outlet is really incrdible it host the 15th century of Awadhi culture with fine woodwork and ghazals in back ground it is incredible to done with family.
Comming down to the menu my favourite here is always mutton rann biriyani however no potato is served in this one, people looking for potato can order murgh pardah biriyani or Gosht Metiabruz Biriyani that is cooked Kolkata style.
The jheenga biriyani cooked with prawns is incredible and also the Palak biriyani cooked with Palak is really a must try and specially people who ate vegeterian must try this one this is something I bet they dint taste.
Among the starters, kakori kabab, galauti kalab served with Lucknow paratha and chicken Zafraan kabab and Fish Zafraan kabab are my favourites which I mostly try whenever I visit them.
Among sidedish/ Salaan, gosht chap, gosht bhuna, mahi chaap, Irani jhinga masala(prawns), gosht roganjosh, gosht kundan kalia are among my favourites which is a must try!!
I am adding a photo of Rann biriyani take away will be adding some more soon.. stay tuned.. until then Bon Apetit!!

The first taste of Oudh 1590 I savoured was at this outlet... And with a dear friend, who was a huge fan of the restaurant and insisted that I tasted their raan biryani or my life is wasted!!! So we went... And man was he right!!! The raan biryani was by far the best biryani I had tasted... And I have since then gorged on it many times!!! We also had the badam sharbat with rose petals as garnish... Lovely and rich... Whatelse we had I don't remember... I guess I have to make that call and fix a date to refresh my memory... Again!!!

Maybe the best biriyani I had till date at a restaurant. Ambience was awesome with no dhikchik honey singh music. It was a perfect dining experience. Quantity of biriyani  was just enough for 2 people. 
One bad quality i.e the staffs stare at you a lot.lol.
Thanks!

I am a frequente visitor at your deshapriyo park outlet and obviously it had some good factors which made me visit you so many times. But on my last visit I was shocked by the terrible  rudeness from the staffs.
After the completion of our main course when we were about to order for our desserts the waiter outrightly said that no desserts were available phirni,shahi tukra, kulfi faluda...nothing...whereas they were serving these to the other tables...still I did not say anything to them and thought that these might have gone out of stock. But a while later a guy came to clear our  table..who was probably unaware that the other waiters had already decided not to serve any dessert to us..the innocent guy asked if we had  any dessert orders...  I was shocked and pretty disheartened as one of my frnd was an expecting mother just cam to eat the kulfi at oudh. Anyhow lastly a person came up with the bills and it was quite evident  that  there were people waiting outside so the staff intentionally did not serve us the dessert they were rather in a hurry to wrap up.... Well after this I dont think I would visit Oudh anymore...as it was a very bad experience..completely unexpected and insulting..

Oh what a classic and authentic atmosphere they made, best ambiance so far I experience. And ti talk about the food, it's mind blowing ! I visite here today with my friends and we ordered "Mutton Handi Beriyani, Chichen Chap for non veg and laccha paratha with Sabz malai kofta for veg. The beriyani is so delicious and the best part is it's very light and not so rich. The meat is also very tender and well cooked with full of flavour . And the chichen chap is a bit heavy and a little spicy too. The beriyani contains two pieces of meat and a egg so as per me, one beriyani is enough for two people. Then on the other hand to talk about the Paratha, it's very thin, and the Sabz Malai kofta contains 4 pieces of good medium size kofta with thick curry. The koftas are made by some mix vegs and chana. So if you think about eat some mughalai dish with a periodic journey this place has no comparison to other. It's great.

An authentic place with one of the best architecture in Calcutta for restaurants. The biriyani had different taste not the usual Kolkata Biriyani, the flavours were strong in the meat. The kebabs were rightly made with perfect flavours. To add to it, not only food or architecture, the ambience was great with gazals playing in background.

This is my 3rd visit since theyve opened this place and i feel they need to open more outlets in south kolkata...whenever i visit them i always have to wait for a place...yesterday my visiting time post 3pm so waiting time was around 7min(previously waited for 1.5hrs to 2hrs) waiting can be a lil irritating specially when ure hungry...nd just as we entered the waiter said mam puro order kore deben as kitchen closed hoye jabe(kitchen will be closed so give your full order on one go) this is rude!! Ive not yet gone through the menu, i might not knw their portion size or i might think i want something more after having sum starters...how can i order on one go!!! Yes it was 3:15pm but then you ppl said its open till 3:30pm so atleast be tht much descent to wait till 3:30 and then say!!! And if you visit them during proper lunch time you literally have to wait a minimum of 30min.... so if you ppl are facing so much footfall pressure open few other outlets too..
Now the food...this is whre a foodie forgets everything...the waiting n the weired behaviour.....we orderd 3portions of galauti kebab in which they r perfect, chicken sugandhi kebab, raan biryani...i wanted sum dessert but they only had kulfi ..seriously nothing else??? Atleast 2 choices of dessert should be available... this place is a little pocket pinch(we paid 1700 around for 2). And not to miss my dessert was a mitha pata pan from the pan shop just beside this outlet which was awesum...

Recently I visited Oudh 1590. It's situated near Deshopriyo Park.
First of all the decor of the restaurant is just superb. The chilled atmosphere​, perfect sitting arrangements the mood matching stereo system and the entire decorum was just heavenly.
Now comes the dish. Well, we hadn't order much things. Biryani, Galauti Kebab, Nargis Kofta were ordered by us.
• Biriyani
It's not like the "Kolkata style Biriyani". It doesn't contain any potato. So basically it contains two pieces mutton and an egg. The taste is quite good. Although it's a bit spicy but it's perfect for all Biriyani lover. And the quantity is more than enough for a person.
• Galauti Kebab
It's one of the famous kebab all over the world. The taste of the kebab is just awesome. It's served with sauted Onion, carrot and Chutney. There are two kebabs in a plate.
• Nargisi Kofta
It is also one of the famous and traditional Mughlai item. Basically it contains egg covered with minced mutton. It's a gravy item. The gravy also contains minced mutton. It's a bit spicy. But the taste was finger licking.
So as my point of view, "Mughlai Gharana" @ Oudh 1590 at it's best. I highly recommend it for the all "Mughlai Cuisine Lovers".

The restaurant is pretty easy to locate, and is a 2-minute walk from The Banana Leaf near Deshapriya Park.

Oudh 1590 does give a feel of the Awadh era. The decor, the lights, the oak furniture, the staff dressed in black pathani kurtas, the antique-looking crockery and the ghazals played here will definitely leave you mesmerized. 

Coming to the delicacies, we ordered mutton galwati kebab, awadhi dum aloo, lakhnawi paratha and tandoori roti. Galwati kebab is one of their most popular specialities, and it lived up to the billing. The kebab was very delicious and soft and simply melted in the mouth. Awadhi dum aloo was my favorite though. It consists of potato stuffed with paneer and lots of dry fruits, cooked in thick gravy. Generally, we do not order vegetarian dishes when we dine out, but this dish was simply amazing. 
None of the dishes were too spicy or oily, but they were just the right balance of tasty and healthy. The quantity served is sufficient for two. Additionally, they serve raita, achaar and meethi achaar at each table which are delicious in their own right.

One minor issue I had was that the tables in the restaurant itself are placed a little too close, and though it doesn't feel cramped in any way, they can feel a little too close for comfort.

Will definitely visit again. Next time,  I'm gonna try their biryani.

TLDR- Great authentic experience, brilliant ambiance , friendly staff and absolutely delicious food.
Highly recommended.

What this place boasts of is the Awadhi interior decoration and the variety in their Biryani. And I loved both of these factors. They add to their variety of Biryani during the Great Awadhi Biryani Festival, which had been extended till 30th June-so it was a golden chance to live the great Awadhi life for a day.

Interior-
The mellow Ghazal greets you in the background as soon as you enter. The lights are just dim enough to add to the aura. The chandeliers are mesmerizing. The mirrors and the wall decorations will just transport you back to those times.

Food-
We ordered:
1. Awadhi Handi Biryani from the main menu
2. Yakhni Gosht Biryani from the Biryani Festival Special Menu
3 .Zaffrani Kabab
4. Rose Sharbat

Both the biryani came in earthen pots and were so soft and tender-so were the mutton pieces, which just melted in the mouth! Now let me mention that the prices are high for the Biryani in this place which is justified by the quantity they offer. One pot serves two people, but even 3 people can easily share it.
The Kabab was too awesome, with all the saffron adding to the taste.
The Rose Sharbat, priced at Rs. 110 was a good one.

Location- Opposite Carmel Primary School, Near Deshapriya Park

Note- There is such a hige variety in the menu that you can get confused, so read the details in the menu carefully or be sure to ask the waiters serving in the black kurtas, pure Awadhi style!

Went yesterday with my father. Not very hard to find. This place will impress right from the exterior only. The whole get up is exquisite and once you get inside you are bound to be amazed by the old awadhi period air. The ambiance is something to experience. The wooden finishing and interior décor will surely win you over. Add to that the soulful ghazal renditions being played over the speakers. So now that you've successfully reached the era of 1590 let me come to the food. It was a bit late and so we decided on eating light. We had galawati kebab which were succulent and very well prepared. Just the right proportion of spices and it is bound to give your taste buds an experience of a lifetime. The awadhi handi biryani was very well cooked and gave off a very earthy aroma that added to the entire experience. In short I had one of my best experiences here. Will definitely visit again in the future.

The Oudh 1590 transports you to the yesteryears. The food is rich and tasty especially the Galauti kebabs, the Lucknowi parathas and of course the Biryanis.

Oudh 1590 serves you delicious awadhi and mughlai cuisines. I had galawati kabab for starters and I absolutely loved it. And for main course, we ordered Nehari khaas, Raan biriyani, Paneer rezala and Lucknowi Paratha. For dessert, we had shahi tukra and firni. I recommend all of these items. Only the biriyani was not heated, but the taste was great. The ambience and service is very good. There is enough parking space. This restaurant is not on the main road so I had to use Google maps for directions. Overall experience was great.

Every morsel gave me the best feelings a man can get. And yes, the two types of biriyani were also great with tender mutton pieces cooked in ghee. The best awadhi experience sitting at the heart of kolkata. Worth a visit everytime.

So finally I visited one of my coveted restaurants in Kolkata. The famous galauti kebab and brilliant biriyani for what it's best for. It has brilliant period dining decor, the ambiance was good. We ordered the galauti kebab, awadhi sandhi biriyani with rose sarbat, shikanji and all of it lived upto my expectations. Definitely recommended for the awesome experience. One suggestion considering the craze for the restaurant, may be management can increase space of the restaurant a bit more to accommodate more ppl.

The only thing that is overrated here is the biryani,in my opinion.
We've had their khichri when the biryani festival was going on,it was brilliantly flavoured.
The other time we visited we had their lamb brain curry,galawti kebabs,mutton biryani and parathas. Apart from the biryani everything was top notch. 
Their Shahi Tukda also deserves a mention for being absolutely delightful and a great ending to the meal.

This place is lovely. The decor is amazing and the music played in the background and the art on the walls all match the traditional aristocratic Lucknow era. The food is superb too.
Best among all the amazing biriyanis they offer is the runn biriyani. We ordered it with a side of murgh Irani that serves two people. We also had the palak biriyani and you won't believe how amazing it was. I was genuinely surprised at its rich taste.

For starters we got mutton sheekh kabab which was as good as well. Keeping up to the standards of the other dishes.

We ended the journey of rich flavours with some phirni which sure did please us as much.
I can revisit this place over and over again on loop.

After waiting for 40mins we finally manage to get a seat inside the restaurant.The food was amazingly sumptuous.Best ones in the menu to try for galouti kawab justs melts in your mouth as soon as u take the first bite. 3 Awadhi handi was too much for 4 to finish but every bite was worth the wait. 
Waiting for next visit soon. A must visit.

More or less easy to locate, this authentic awadhi restaurant offers one of the best dine-in experiences you could think of. The interiors are exquisitely made which gives a really nice feel to set things up for you. The staffs were really nice and cordial. They do know how to take care of their guests.
So now coming to the food, we ordered Galawati Kebab, something which this place is famous for. It is made out of mutton paste with authentic awadhi spices and grilled to serve hot. It was so good to taste, I can hardly express in words. The thing melts in the mouth;it is little spicy with a nice balance of flavors of the spices giving it a really wonderful taste. For main course we had Raan Biryani and Gosht Kundan Kaliya. Raan Biryani, something which would make you ask for more. No burst of flavors, very balanced, made of ghee and numerous tender pieces of mutton. The Kundan Kaliya on the other hand is a thick gravy mutton dish. The mutton was nicely done, only thing it tasted a little too sour otherwise it is not that bad either. Overall a great experience for me and my partner.

People are a fan of oudh. Bt personally me and my friends didn't like it that much. The ambience is of maharaja's palace type.
But if u ask me about the biryani. Its a no for pure bengali biryani lovers. There is lots and lots of ghee. Rather excess ghee i would say. And the taste is not that we like our biryanis to be.
Though the quantity is huge.
One visit is okay.

Mutton gaulauti kabab was very delicious it just melted in the mouth as i had it . Although, the veg galauti kabab was very dry and it is made of chana . The biryani was very tasty even the palak biryani was delicious.

Went there at our anniversary after reading some reviews and also because we wanted to eat some authentic North Indian meat.
Location is quite easy to reach.
Went there on a friday and had to wait around 30mins for a table.
Ambience is very simplistic, not worth any mention.
Waiters were very busy so had little interaction with them.
Ordered - Galawati Kebab, which was very tasty and also juicy. 
Awadhi Handi Biryani - taste was ok ok and also the quantity was not enough for the two of us, so zero cost benefit ratio.
Gosht Kundan Kaliya - among my order this was the best dish. Very tasty spicy and quantity was also good.
Also ordered Shahi tulda for dessert, worst mistake ever. The worst dessert I have ever eaten. Should have ordered a firni or halwa instead.
Bill amount was as per food. 
Conclusion - they should increase the quantity a little bit and offer some drinks too.

It was great being here!  A wonderful place with perfect awadhi ambiance. The food was different from any other mughlai or awadhi restaurant nearby. The famous galawati kebab was actually worth its fame, a mouth melting dish and a must try. Fish kebabs with bengali gondhoraj twists were also delicious. Biriyanis were a bit different from the ones we generally taste but i personally liked it since it had some unique spices in it. In dessert the sahi tukda was above everything, beautifully cooked bread pudding with aromatic rabri and nuts and is a sure thing to be loved! The people were courteous enough and helpful.

The service is good and prompt. The background music and decor add to this place's charm. The utensils also send you back to the time of Nawabs. The food is good but not necessarily  extraordinary.

After a long planning finally the day came and I visited oudh with my family. It's a small place with a great ambience. We had to wait for 40 mins before we can enter.
The food was pre decided so it didn't take much time to order. On the list we had galauti kabab, sugandhi mahi for starters. For main course raan biryani, awadhi murg biryani, gosth bhuna, murg Irani. And for dessert shahi tukda.
Each and every dish was exquisite. The all time favorite galauti kabab was just too good. The biryani was different from what we have as a normal Kolkata biryani. It was light and perfectly spiced. I liked the murg biryani more. One biryani is enough for two people. I will recommend everyone if you go there please try gosth bhuna. It was amazing. Murg Irani was also complementing. And the dessert. Just perfect after such a meal. Just try shahi tukda.
All the staffs were very attentive and polite. Order comes a little late because of the crowd.
At last I can say you won't regret after going to oudh 1590. The food worths every penny.

Sevice is prompt..staffs are very helpfull n ambience here is pretty good. Decor is like mughal era.Coming to their food they have their own subtle yet distinguished taste which I think made them stand out.We had Kalori kebab-soft juicy mutton minced kebab..murgh abadhi handi biryani was mind blowing ..quantity was pretty good..
Nargisi kofta is a must try dish..just loved it.We had gajar ka halwa n that is treat to one's buds
Cost-1250 approx for two.

Awesome experience!
It was a time journey through the delicacies of the Mughal Era!
The interior decor, dim lights, the aroma, everything created a mystic atmosphere inside.
Each and every dish was like a festival of flavours!
We had,
Shahi Tangri Kebab: succulent juicy leg pieces, grilled to perfection.
Galawti Kebab: exotic spices, each bite were like short trips to Lucknow kebab lane.
Rann Biriyani: Huge amount, lots of mutton shreds, pleasant taste.
Murgh Irani: Less spicy, tangy flavour, perfectly complementing the biriyani.
Ghosht Rogan Josh: The mutton pieces were super tender and tasty, the gravy was a bit oily and rich
Sweet lime soda: Refreshing.

Was here to check out the biriyani festival. The ambience is very intresting. I specially liked the ghazals playing in the back-ground.
 I was really looking forward to tasting  the biriyani with quail but was informed that it was not available.:) We had to settle for hans handi biriyani instead. The dish had more than enough rice for two people, two eggs and three very small pieces of duck . The meat was cooked perfectly and was very flavoursome, but I found nothing remarkable about the biriyani itself. We also had the famous galwati kebab, which is basically minced mutton cooked with spices. It had an wonderful aroma.

one of the best moghlai restaurant. all the cuisine was mouth watering except yankhi ghost biryani which was tasted like normal ghee and rice. Apart from this one we tried galawti kabab, zafrani kabab, sughandhi kabab, awadhi nargisi biryani, murgh irani and murgh kassa, and all of these was really tasty. nice service and ambience too. only expected 6 pcs in starter but they served only 4 for every starter. So planning to visit next week again for these tasty food.

Their kababs are just heavenly bliss..soft, melting in mouth and most importantly none have a single burnt carbon mark although they are cooked with utmost perfection..this is their USP. I have never ever had such delicious & sumptuous kababs like this anywhere else. You can just die for them!

Other dishes are just average and biryani is not at all something you should order here & cherish for, since they are very bland compared to Kolkata's tastebuds. Ambience & service is decent.

Since the Biryani Festival was going on, my parents and I decided to go to Oudh 1590 on a Friday night for a hearty Awadhi dinner. After waiting for about 25 mins, we were directed to our table.

The Afghani chicken kebab was juicy, soft and delicious. We chose to have​ Awadhi Nargisi Biryani from the special spread being offered during the festival (personally​, I think it should have been offered as a buffet so that we could get to taste a little of everything), which was enormous in amount, and cooked to perfection, although slightly spicy as the description suggested. Anaras Raita accompanied the Biryani, which complemented it well, rather than overpower the taste of the rice, which raitas sometimes tend to do. Phirnis, slightly runnier than usual, rounded up our dinner.

We also got a handi of Yakhni Gosht Biryani to accompany us home.

The only, MAJOR problem I had at dinner was the poor lightning. We were seated at Table 8, which is tucked away in a corner, separated from the main, well-lit area, by a wall. It takes away a lot of the pleasure of eating if you see your food as if drowned in a burnt sepia filter - that's how bad the lighting at the table was. Upon pointing it out to the waiter attending to us, I received the smooth reply, "This is the theme."

Um? "Strain your eyes in the dim light" is your theme? I would suggest giving an equivalent lighting to all tables, or I'll have to bring some candles and matches with me next time.

If u r biriyani lover then u have to go there..Oudh 1590..the cozy place, lovely ambience, indian Classical music enhance the awadhi flavour. It's easy to locate, opposite of Carmel primary school (lake mall). Qalmi kabab and raan biriyani were served..both were just awesome, it was cooked perfectly with mutton shraded , the quantity of raan biriyani was enough for 2, even 3 also..the cost was 771 for 3people. Service was really good, staffs even asked about the food quality and service, which I never experienced before at any restaurant. Recommended atleast once to get such an awesome experience with awadhi cuisin

Never was a big fan of biriyani. It sounds crazy enough. But the scent drives me nuts. Makes me nauseous Idk why.
So going to Oudh was a bit of a nightmare for me. On my first visit I had galauti kabab with lucknowi parathe and rann biriyani. I was awestruck. The ground mutton kebabs didn't taste anything like meat at all! It melted in my mouth and that smoky after taste. Oh my. Absolutely Heavenly!
Moving on to the biriyani, it was a heap of flavourful rice combined with some tender meat. Quantity n quality wise they deserve 5 stars. Definitely worth paying a visit. Looking forward to try some of their gravy meat dishes and veg sides too. :)

I went to the Deshapriya park outlet of Oudh 1590 and after a long wait I managed some seats for us. The ambience gives you a royal feel. The lights were dim. The table and chairs had an authentuc indian feel as if you were having food in a Rajbari.The waiters are even dressed accordingly. The decor, plates, glasses spoon everything had a royal touch. Coming to the food, the biriyani and mutton could not have been any better. We ordered the Rann biriyani, the mouth-watering galawti kebab and the special Nihari Khaas. The quality of food was astounding and the quantity too. A plate of biriyani is more than sufficient for two people. Wan'na try out the Mughal dishes in a Mughal ambience with a royal feel? Oudh 1590 is the place to be!

Yesterday I went there with high expectations for a great hangout with my friend. Specially, they are renowned for their biryani. Well they deserve their fame. Their zafrani kebab, gost bhuna, awadhi biryani, gazar ka halwa were awesome. But we tried galwati kebab which was just waste of money. And we were told that firni wasn't available but it was served in other tables.

I have given 4 rating only for their food quality. Yesterday (04.06.2017) after an hour long waiting we got a table. Galawati Kabab is excellent. Chicken Zafrani Kabab not only delicious but also tendered soft like butter and melts inside mouth! Keema biriyani is a part of their on going biriyani festival. Superb! Made in individual earthen pot in dum pukht style. We chose Murg Irani as salaan with biriyani. Outstanding. Even as a contemporary one, I think Oudh somehow has failed to keep the dining experience fine! The person who was enlisting the guests waiting for table outside the restaurant, started fighting with other staffs. Gazaal in loud speakers is pretty loud. Although initially the waiter was pretty helpful to choose items as it was my first visit. But may be due to paucity of service boy, dishes were coming pretty late. Even we discarded our desert order after 15 minutes of waiting where we saw our service boy gone busy with other tables. These need to be corrected.

Very easy to locate, situated on the opposite lane of lake mall. This place is all about ambience and decor with good food and hospitality. Indian classical music, played in the restaurant is very refreshing and smooth. We ordered mutton galawti kebab, lakhnawi paratha, awadhi handi biriyani (full) and shahi tukra. Galawti kebab and shahi tukra was excellent, where as biriyani Britain was nothing extraordinary. The cost was Rs983 for two people and food was more than sufficient for 2. Recommended atleast once to feel & taste awadhi cuisin.

But after entering the restaurant, decor is awesome, slow music and low lights, I love the ambience.

We ordered their speciality raan biriyani, and Lucknow I paratha and galwati kabab...All foods taste is awesome..

After waiting more than 2 hour's, my mood was happy.

The much awaited awadhi biryani festival is on presently.i.e. from 19th may 2017 to 18th june.
Apart from the basic menu one can get choices of many types of biryani. Each plate of biryani is served with anaras raita.
We ordered Aam khaas, chicken qalmi kebab, Awadhi nargis biryani, gosht bhuna, sahi tukra..
The interior is very good and the behavior of staffs is also polite.

The food is quite good. if you are a fan of authentic mughlai and lukhnow dishes this is the place to be. the ambience is very good and they play soft music which is really nice. we tasted mutton galawti kabab, chicken zafrani kabab, maahi shammi kabab in starters and all of them tasted really delicious. main course was murgh irani and lukhnowi naan which were good as well. the best however was gajar ka halwa and shhi tukra. the food quality is beyond the expectations. the behaviour of the staffs were good as well except they were in a hurry to take orders as we hd reached around 2pm. they dodnot take any orders beyond 2pm and lunch time is till 3pm. to our surprise they had shut down the ac after 3pm which was quite disappointing as this particular kind of behavior is not expected from such places.

This place has been on my "must visit list" for quite a long time. Located near Carmel primary school, this place is hailed as one of the best places to gobble down biryani and other Mughlai dishes. The decor and ambience are very pleasant, with dimly lit chandeliers and enjoyable ghazal music playing in the background. Coming to the food, we ordered gulaab sharbat, chicken zafrani kebab, awadhi handi biryani, murgh irani and kulfi falooda.
Gulaab sarbat: 2.5/5 - Roohafza mixed with soda didn't really work for my taste buds and it's overpriced as well.
Badam Sarbat: 4.5/5 - After being disappointed with the gulaab sarbat, this drink was a refreshing drink. It was thick and flavourful. 
Chicken zafrani kabab: 5/5 - Undoubtedly, the best dish of the night. The kababs were tender and juicy, and they practically melted in my mouth; a must try in my opinion.
Awadhi handi biryani: 4/5 - Another must try dish, this one comes with two decent mutton pieces and two eggs. The biryani itself tasted dandy; however, it's cooked with ghee and might be too heavy for some.
Murgh Irani: 3/5 - I was not at all impressed with the quantity. The gravy was delicious, but the quantity left me underwhelmed.
Kulfi falooda: 3.5/5 - Tasted like just any other kulfi, nothing special about it.
Overall, this place is a must visit if you want to taste different variants of biryani and mouthwatering kababs.

Heard a lot about this place but my experience in this place was not overwhelming as I expected..Royal Decor and Furniture and pleasant thumri tunes made the ambiance soothing..Service was okayish yet nothing extraordinary l..We have ordered the most recommended dishes Mutton Galawti Kebab, Lakhnow Parantha, Awadhi Handi Biriyani..

Mutton Galawati Kebab : It was a big let down..when I gave a bite on it, then I realized it was undercooked and the spice blending wasn't perfect.The first showstopper disappointed me very much.

Lucknow Paratha : It was perfect and fluffy as I expected.

Awadi Handi Biriyani : It was also good but lack of real awadhi flavour. I had tasted better awadhi biriyani before.

Complimentary Pudina Chatni, Pickle and Sweet Chatni were nice.

Overall I must say this place hasn't make any unforgettable royal Awadhi remark on my Culinary Journey.

I visited the establishment with my colleagues in order to celebrate a success party, ended up in having the best culinary experience with them. The restaurant provides an unique blend of ambiance and  luscious cuisine within a reasonable price. The period appropriate decor accompanied by classical Hindustani music along with the extremely professional staff made it a experience worth reliving. 'Aam khas' offered in the refreshments category is absolutely a must to start off your dining adventure which can be followed by my personal favorite the 'Galouti kabab'. Other starters like 'Shikh kakaba', 'Tengri kabab', 'Shahi Dahi Kabab' and 'Corn Kabab' were also wins. In the main course, 'Rang Biriyani' is also a must try along with the classic 'Keema Paratha' with a side of 'Murgh Chaap'. My vegetarian colleagues had some complains regarding the absence of vegetables in 'Subz Yakhni Biriyani', but they can be forgiven for being vegetarian and not knowing the finer tastes that life has to offer. In dessert, 'Gajar ka Halwa' is a must have along with 'Firnee'. Overall, this house of uniquely Indian tastes is an welcome sight to all of us who are tired of visiting Chinese dumpling dens and Continental potholes.

Oudh 1590's best dish is undoubtedly their Galouti Kebab and Paratha. However, their Biryani, while good, isn't as good as some of the other Biryani places in the city. Their prices are also quite monstrous and not exactly value for money. I wouldn't have a problem with their high prices had their Biryani been of a superb quality, but I can get better Biryani for much cheaper.

Was there for the biriyani festival n i must say like our previous visits audh 1590 satisfied our stomach and mind too.. Though Audh is specially known for their awadhi biriyani but i love the taste of kebabs made by them... the light smell of ghee n juicy kebabs are just wowww.. we tried different side dishes of chicken and all of them reached d peak of satisfaction. Last but not the least , I am in love with their interior decoration and d well behaved staffs. When we reached there it was around 3.15 and we had to wait.I was a little bit worried as d restaurant closing time was near but d staffs behaved so well n said how can they have their lunch without serving us?thanks to them.. and as a biriyani lover i will visit Audh1590 again n again...

A perfect Biryani and Kabab destination. Biryani's are full of aroma, juicy and bounteous quantity of chicken / mutton - generous quantity. The kababs are delighfully tasty and the taste reaches each bite. We had Awadhi Handi Biryani, Qalmi kabab, Kakori Kabab, Shammi Kabab along with naan - each of the dishes were simply impeccable. And a review for this place cant be complete without mention of the phirnis that they serve - one of a kind luxury that one can indulge in after a pure Mughlai meal. Cheers to this place, we are a loyal to yours now!

Ok here is the thing. I have been hearing about this place almost a year now from my frnds. So I finally decided to visit this place this saturday.
So if you have read the other reviews you would know that this place has sitting capacity of 60. So you would have to wait for atleast 20mins no matter when you visit. I arrived at 7.45pm and still had to wait another 40mins.
Anyway the ambience is quite traditional or 'awadhi'.
The service is quite slow no matter what you order.
Now the food. 
Galawati and katori kebab. Tried both of them.
Galawati kebab just melts in your mouth. Its just heavenly.
Next was raan biriyani which is another house favourite. It is probably the best biriyani in kolkata. There is no egg or aloo but the mutton is shredded and cooked in ghee. Sufficient amount for 2. Also ordered mutton raghon josh and luckhnowi paratha.
The paratha was thin and light and no sign of oil. The raghon josh is a must try. The gravy is simply outstanding and I have never tasted something similar anywhere before. 
The place is hosting the biriyani festival till 19th june, so we tried awadhi nargisi biriyani. But turned out to be too spicy for our liking.
Finally the kulfi was pretty ordinary and they charge 95 for it. So a bit disappointed by that.

The Great Awadhi Biryani Festival at Oudh 1590.

Whenever I think of Lucknowi Biryani, the first name that pops into my head is none other than Oudh 1590. The first in the city to introduce Awadhi Special Biryanis, Oudh is every biryani lovers' paradise. The best part of this restaurant is the month long Biryani Festival which is held every summer. This year the Festival has commenced from 19th May and will go on till 18th June. So leave everything Biryani lovers and hop in to enjoy manna dew on your plate!

I was thrilled when I received an invitation for the Biryani Festival and couldn't contain my excitement. So last Thursday me, and a few bloggers from Kolkata visited Oudh to taste the various Biryanis up on this special menu.

Before I start, let me brief you on the festival. This festival is one of its kind in Kolkata. One of the most hyped festivals of the year, The Great Awadhi Biryani Festival has introduced 12 variants of biryani that is available in this special menu. They are -

Awadhi Nargisi Biryani
Yakhni Gosht Biryani
Keema Biryani
Gosht Bhuna Khichdi
Murgh Pulao
Shikari Bater Purdah Biryani
Shikari Hansa Handi Biryani
Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Pulao
Jheenga Kofta Biryani
Multani Kanthal Biryani
Awadhi Palak Biryani
Subz Yakhni Biryani
All of the above Biryanis are available on the special menu, and frankly that's quite a lot! The menu also includes drinks like Aam Panna, Rose Sherbet and Badaam Sherbet.

Now coming to our lunch.
We were served with :

• Aam Panna - This is the perfect thirst quencher for the sweltering heat, and is made to perfection at Oudh. The tangy taste sure did refresh us.

• Rose Sherbet - This one is a favourite of mine, and needs to introduction. Again, this is a saviour during this heat. Perfectly made again with the zing balanced out well with the rose syrup.

• Gosht Bhuna Khichdi - Lentils and rice cooked in a dum gravy with mutton chunks, this was heavenly. It was rich and sinful. Fitness freaks, give your regime a break and try this sinful khichdi to give your taste buds a treat.

• Awadhi Nargisi Biryani - This was the first biryani that was served to us, and it blew our minds. The rice was well prepared, and the egg kofta was fried with a coating of minced mutton on it. Divine!

• Awadhi Palak Biryani - Vegetarian Biryani is a kind of an oxymoron, but that's till you've visited Oudh 1590. Try this particular biryani to bust that myth! Never imagined Palak Paneer and biryani to go this well. Another plus point would be the creamy and soft paneers which went perfectly with the rice. This unique combination is sure to win hearts.

• Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Pulao - This was the show stopper of the afternoon. Boneless bhekti pieces were marinated in gondhoraj lemon and cooked in rice flavoured with lemongrass. What ensued was a mild and subtle flavoured pulao with super succulent piece of bhetki fish! Ah! I loved this.

• Murgh Pulao - The chicken pulao tasted good with an adundance chicken cubes. This too wasn't spicy and had a mild taste and was topped with fried onions.

Each of these Biryanis were served with Pineapple Raita, which had small pineapple chunks and tasted sweet with a hint of spices.

Overall, I believe that this Festival is a must visit by one and all! My favourites from the afternoon were, the Gosht Bhuna Khichdi, Awadhi Nargisi Biryani and Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Pulao!
This special menu will be available at both the outlets of Oudh 1590 and deserves more than one visit!

We ordered a fish preparation from the starters, fish afghani, which was good. And then moved on to the rank biriyani which good but not at par with the price they are charging. With salads and fresh lime soda and firni was decent. Biryani was okay, and the size of the muttons were small.
What to be mentioned is the behaviour of the staffs which was horrible. They literally wanted go throw us away by stuffing so that they can shut before 3,30 although it was only 3pm. Staffs are impolite as well. 
Food is okay but staff behaviour is real bad. Loved the decor and the ambience inside.

Had been there twice.. first time was during pujas. Waited for 2 and half hours in que. Had ordered rann biryani and chicken kabab. Rann biryani was awesome and gajar ka halwa too. But on second visit, neither the same biryani nor the galuati kababs was as tasty as the first time visit. Galuati kababs had very strong smell which resisted us to have the complete food.. overall it is satisfactory.

Oudh 1590 was the pioneer to introduce Awadhi cuisine in Calcutta. Biryani, which is Calcutta's favourite, got a new definition through Oudh 1590. Since its inception four years back, Oudh 1590 has been one among the very first names that come to our mind when we think of biryani. Infact I'm a huge fan of their Rann Biryani, which is their all time best seller. Apart from their normal biryanis, every year Oudh 1590 organises a biryani festival named 'The Great Awadhi Biryani Festival' which is one of the much awaited and much hyped events among the foodies of Calcutta. I was invited for a bloggers meet on the occasion of this festival in their fourth year to try some of the special biryanis from the festival menu.

The festival has introduced twelve variants of biryani which include Awadhi Nargisi Biryani, Yakhni Gosht Biryani, Keema Biryani, Gosht Bhuna Khichdi, Murgh Pulao, Shikari Bater Purdah Biryani, Shikari Hansa Handi Biriyani, Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Pulao, Jheenga Kofta Biryani, Multani Kanthal Biryani, Awadhi Palak Biryani and Subz Yakhni Biryani. Each biryani is served with a portion of pineapple raita. Some special drinks like Gulab Sherbet and Badam Sherbet have been specially introduced for this festival. I was served the Aam Panna which was tangy and very refreshing.

Gosht Bhuna Khichdi

The biryanis were to follow next. I started with the Gosht Bhuna Khichdi. Now, a Khichdi being included in a biryani festival sounds a bit odd. But it isn't a normal Khichdi. The khichdi was cooked with mutton pieces and tasted amazing. It was oily and slightly heavy. So you shouldn't be very health conscious if you wish to try this out. Initially, even I was hesitant to try this out but at the end, it stood out among all the biryanis.

Awadhi Nargisi Biryani

In this biryani, the egg was coated with minced mutton and fried to perfection. The rice was mild and fragrant. The mutton coating was well done. The egg tasted lovely and went well with the biryani.

Awadhi Palak Biryani

A veg biryani amidst the non vegetarian options was disheartening for me. However, I was taken aback upon trying it. The spinach was mixed throughout the biryani, imparting an unique flavour. The paneer was super creamy. I can gladly suggest all my vegetarian friends to visit Oudh during the course of this festival, atleast to try this biryani.

Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Pulao

Bhetki was marinated with Gondhoraj lemon and cooked in rice flavoured with lemongrass. The rice was very light and flavourful. The fish tasted divine. It was so soft that it easily melted in my mouth. The Gondhoraj flavour was like cherry on the cake. It made the fish taste much more amazing. This is my second favourite after the Gosht Khichdi.

Murgh Pulao

The chicken pulao tasted good with the soft chicken cubes coated with spices. It wasn't oily nor light. You can definitely go for this one, if you don't like the smell of biryani.

I tried the Gulab Sherbet during the course of my meal. It was fizzy and had the beautiful aroma of rose. It is probably the best accompaniment with a plate of biryani. I ended my meal with the Firni, which tasted great. The portion size was appricable as well.

Overall, I would suggest every biryani lover to visit Oudh during this festival and try out these amazing biryanis. My favorites are the Gosht Bhuna Khichdi and the Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Pulao in the non vegetarian section and the Awadhi Palak Biryani in the vegetarian section. What I loved was the fact that each biryani had its own impact and tasted totally different from the other ones.

About the festival :

• The festival will continue till 18th June from 12pm - 3:30pm for lunch and 6:30pm - 10:30pm for dinner.

• The festival menu will be available at both the outlets.

• Meal for two - INR 850 plus taxes.

I visited a couple of times to Oudh 1590.Last time I tried their special Raan Biriyani,Galawati Kabab & Murg Irani.Raan Biriyani was very tasty.Galawati kabab was very soft as it melts while eating.Murg Irani was little bit burnt.Buring smell came out from chicken pieces.
Staffs were very courteous.
Sitting arrangements and Ambiance were too good.Decoration matches perfectly with the cuisine.
Will definitely go again 👍

For the Biryani connoisseurs in town, Oudh 1590 – the restaurant which excels in traditional Lucknowi (rather Awadhi) gharana of cuisines, have launched the Biryani Festival from 19th May 2017, which it plans to serve to its patrons till 18th June 2017. 
The exterior of the Restaurant has intricate designs of the erstwhile Nawabi splendour. There are open parking facilities available around the place with easy access to Rashbehari Avenue and Sarat Bose Road.
The interiors of the Restaurant adorn traditional designs. The tunes of Hindustani Classical builds on to the entire ambience.
Let us now come down to the Food, of course. We were welcomed with a refreshing Aam Panna drink, which especially helps on a sweltering summer afternoon.
This was followed by the spread which consisted of 4 types of Non Vegetarian fare, namely, Awadhi Nargisi Biryani, Gosht Bhuna Kichri, Murgh Pulao & Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Biryani, along with 1 Vegetarian variety, namely, Awadhi Palak Biryani.
Now let’s get down to each individual dish.
Let me begin with the Vegetarian Fare, the Awadhi Palak Biryani. This dish happened to surprise most of us with its rich flavours, especially the Palak (Spinach) gravy which hid among the Pilaf. The rice was light and aromatic and packed a hefty punch, the moment the Palak gravy was mixed with it. Definitely recommended for people who are vegetarian and for those, who would like to explore.
Let us now come to the Non Vegetarian Fare. The journey began with the fiery Gosht Bhuna Kichri (Khichuri, for Bongs). This dish happened to be the hottest pick of the lot, with plenty of boneless mutton pieces adorning the Khichri. The dish is rather rich and bursting with flavours. Not for the weak stomach, but certainly for the Lionhearts, in the summers of Kolkata. Recommended (with caveats). 
This was followed by the Awadhi Nargisi Biryani. The Biryani was adorned by two pieces of Nargisi Kofta, cut in half. For the uninitiated, Nargisi Kofta is boiled egg covered in minced meat. The rice was light and aromatic with the Kofta chipping in as the supplement.
This was followed by the subtly flavoured, yet another dish which caught our fancy, the Gomti Sugandhi Mahi Biryani. This is essentially Fish based, with the Biryani cooked in dum (kachchi style) with marinated Gondhoraj Bekti and Lemongrass. The rice was infused with the lovely aroma of lemongrass and the Betki and you may definitely experience the subtle waft of both. The dish is definitely recommended for people who wants something different, yet palatable.
The last of the lot was the Murgh Pulao. The Pilaf consisted of boneless chunks of chicken which was nicely cooked in flavourful gravy. 
Along with the Biryanis, Pulaos & Khichri, we were also served Pineapple Raita as compliments.
Last came the desserts in the likes of a Kesar Firni, which is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, and can be had to end the course on a sweet note.
To conclude the proceedings, the day ended with a colourful & tangy Gulaab Sharbat.
The experience overall was memorable, where we got to sample few of the signature dishes that are on offer in the presently ongoing Biryani Festival at Oudh 1590. The Festival has to offer 12 varieties of exotic Biryani preparations.
Apart from the regular Non Vegetarian options like Chicken, Fish & Mutton, the menu also features exotic items like Jheenga Kofta Biryani (Prawns), Shikari Bater Purdah Biryani (Quail meat) & Shikari Hansa Handi Biryani (Duck meat). Vegetarians can choose between Multani Kanthal Biryani, Awadhi Palak Biryani & Subz Yakhni Biryani.
So what are you waiting for? Hurry up, grab your phones, book a table or two and embark on a culinary fest of the erstwhile Nawabi gharana.
Bon Appétit!!

Since the hype was on regarding The Biriyani Festival it was a proper moment to check in again. Located near carmel school in deshapriya park this place hold its glory from much time. As soon as you step in you will feel the royal ambience it provides with all its wooden interiors and chandeliers. Since the festival was on we settled for;
•Qalmi Kebab: 4 tender and juicy leg pieces of chicken smoked properly, not like other typical kebabs. Highly recommended.
•Awadhi Chicken Biriyani: a huge portion of rice with 2chickens, 2eggs enough to serve two people happily. The smell of the ghee will be the first thing to smell when it is served in your plate.
A slight disappointed cause the festival menu didn't have any variety of chicken biriyani to offer so we needed to stick to the normal menu.
Do try their Shahi Tukra as dessert its mouth watering. When your tummy will that much full you don't mind to pay a lil extra than other places.
P.S. If opting for lunch do drop by quickly else you need to stand in the queue.

Visit here very often with my wife. The decor and ambiance is unmatched. The slow ghazals makes one feel like a royal. Coming to the food, the kebabs and biriyanis are the best in the town. Though the price might seem to be on the higher side, the quantity is sufficient for two people.

They close the doors on time so beware to reach on time ! staff were a bit rude , Ambience I liked very much and food was okay , prices were also okay . On my opinion , I didnt like it much , but I feel I 'll be going there again, just for the ambience !!

A restaurant which started with great promise is starting to show signs of decline in quality of service and food. Yes, they are on their way to opening another branch and people still make a beeline each day, but for the true connoisseur of good Biriyani, it is  getting to borderline ordinary.

Here's why.

I ordered, the classic Dum Handi Mutton Biriyani, and what I get is  stale mutton ,an under cooked piece of meat,ensuing  a tug of war to separate it from the bone , reused oil , and no fragrance or aroma that is signature to a quality Biriyani. All this priced at INR 450!

I have always maintained, that mixing meat with rice does not equal a great Biriyani. Each time a Biriyani is prepared, it almost tastes a bit different from the previous occasion and good chefs, make it a point to make every iteration  better than the previous one. Yet, if you consider classical Biriyani eatery's you will see that not only the meat pieces are carefully chosen, they are cooked well, tender enough to shred from the bone  at the slightest flicker of your finger. 

If it is the pressure to serve more with limited resources,then the management ought to take note before it starts to become a trend from an exception. 

Many restaurants start well, hit peak, and then crash out, a classic bell curve syndrome. This typically happens when the management is busy maximizing profit, and minimizing quality control.Yet they are often fooled into believing of their invincibility owing to large volumes of business happening daily. Generally, people often get confused seeing half a kilo of rice and a couple mutton pieces of meat and term it as great Biriyani, the word spreads, and more people flock to it. 

The management often realize this when it's too late, and get into crisis management to rejig the eatery. Unfortunately, most don't make it back once they fall off the grid.

I am not suggesting that Oudh management is on that path,or will meet that fate, but just observing as a common trend across the restaurants in the country. My assessment is simply based on eating out 15-20 days in a month around the country , for the last 15 years, and many connects in the hospitality industry! Call it unscientific if you will, but common sense it is. I only make this comment as a disappointed fan of Oudh having been perhaps the first few customers  from its inception. This is not the same Biriyani they delivered 3 or 4 years back.

The usher  at the entrance is a picture of exasperation ,perspiration and despair, being subject to 40C heat and humidity ,that too in a black heat absorbing attire with customers piling on him.Really felt sorry for them and their tough condition of service.Manually taking orders in this day and age of tablets and smart phones, which send the order directly to the kitchen. Yet, they put on a brave face  and smile at you. 

These are all small but significant signs of mismanagement creeping in on the path to expansion and glory. Yet history is replete with instances where quality control has brought in a sustaining business over time, and running a restaurant is not a sprint, its a marathon. Remember, morning never shows the day.

On a saturday noon me with a friend visited oudh 1590. That day was middle of May and it was a long queue outside that place. People still waiting for their turn. Half an hour later we got our turn. This place is located near lake mall, one of the best place to have kebabs and awadhi biriyani. We ordered qalmi kebab, murgh sutli kebab, lucknowi paratha,murg Irani , raan biriyani and soda shikanji. Qalmi kebab is soft tender juicy inside. Raan biriyani is prepared in awadhi style served with shredded mutton pieces, and ghee. 1 plate of raan biriyani is enough for 2 people. Murgh sutli kebab looks like fish paturi.. So tasty. We were so full we couldn't taste their dessert. Highly recommended and will definitely visit again to taste their galwati kebab and firni.

One of the best biriyani in town.  With an option to choose from a wide variety of biriyani makes this place a whole lot more special. One can have the biriyani without the side dishes as the authentic taste of biriyani may get lost. Also the starters are quite good and one can try them out. We tried aam sharbat in drinks section and it was quite unique as well. The ever lasting taste of food makes this place recurring eatery on my list.

A perfect place to have Awadhi & Mughlai Cuisines. The place is very nicely decorated and the ambience is elegant. Tried Galawati kabab and Rann Biriyani & Murgh Rezala. The kabab tasted like heaven and the Biriyani was mouth watering. The mutton was really soft and tender. It gave immense satisfaction to my taste buds. The quantity of the food is enough for two people. But it is a bit expensive. The staffs are very helpful & Courteous. It was a very luxurious experience of dining . Totally worth it. Will love to visit it soon.

I had been to Kolkata for work and found this place via few blogs and zeroed in on this one to try the Biriyani... 

I took a taxi and when I reached the restaurant, I found at least 20 people already waiting and the booking guy told me that I will not get a table for next 1.5 hours atleast ... but he suggested parcel the Biriyani instead. And I must say that this Biriyani will go into MY top 10 Biriyanis. Very mild , not spicy , you can smell the ghee and the mutton flavor ... it's simply awesome !! Very different than regular Biriyanis .. 

The Galouti Kabab was a disaster and due to which I could not give a 5.

We went to oudh 1590 for lunch,  The ambience was good and staff's behaviour is nice. Coming to food we ordered :- 

Rann biryani ( Shreaded mutton pieces cooked with rice prepared in 'Dum Pukht' style a true Royal awadhi delicacy served in an earthen pot )  -  It was perfect with nice aroma,  flavours were rich and completely different.  4/5😍

Murgh  champ ( chicken pieces marinated with yogurt and shallow fried)  Spices were awesome,  you can feel bit lemon flavor too.  4.5/5 😍

Lucknow paranthas -  It was soft and equally awesome .  4.5/5 😍

Would visit again and will recommend to others as well.  Definitely worth a visit!

In love with the Galauti Kebab and the Biryani..
Short and simple, there is nothing much to write about this place.. they make lovely biryani, of which we had tried 3 variant - Rann, awadhi & prawn, all of them tasted equally good.. the galauti kebab were melting in the mouth... we have also tried the Nagrisi Kofta and it tasted grt as well.. 
A place to visit regularly for sure.

Tried the Raan Biriyani and Phiri. Initially the Biriyani tastes great. The meat is very tender with rewazi. But when you come to the bottom of the handi the rice is very oily and has a distinct smell of oil . This is a complete turn off for me.

The Phiri is superb. Perhaps one of the best I have had.

A three time visitor already during the last three years, still the place keeps offering new angles to the Awadhi cuisine.

Tasted probably all of their Biriyanis, and confident to say that they serve one of the best Biriyanis of Kolkata. Also a big fan of their Galawti Kabab. 

Decor goes well with the cuisine style, possess some courteous staff. The place is always filled with the foodies due to it's prime location and tasty high quality foods.

The place is highly recommended.

Probably the best place in town serving awadhi food wid a lovely ambience. Located in d deshopriya park area this is a theme restaurant serving the Galwati kabab and luckhnawi paratha, their patent and most famous dish.
We also tried their Nihari khas with awadhi handi biryani, consisting of 2pieces of mutton with egg.
Nihari khas is mutton leg pieces prepared in a brown gravy. We also had tasty kakori kabab. Dont forget to try their Shahi tukra at the end. The ambience is very much comensurate with d food and u can also hear some Classical music in the background as portrayed in d movies showing Nababs.
After finishing the food dont forget to try d benarasi paan from d paan shop outside.

This nawabi house has been in my wish list for quite sometime until my friend decided to surprise me with a nawabzyada treat..
It's a nice cosy place in the lanes of deshopriyo Park opposite carmel school.. The ambience gave us a royal feel with the classical music and dim lights...
The waiters were attired in ethnic uniform.. And the pure mughlai food simply made my day.. We had ordered galawati kabab and Mutton biriyani which came along with raeta and phirni for dessert.. The delicacies were truely awadhi.. A must visit for all the biriyani lovers there and please do make good use of your hands in order to experience the delicious tastes of the dishes.. Sorry for not being able to click pics.. I was so engrossed in my hunger tide..

Okay, this one is a food lover's paradise and has just everything right about itself. The decor of the place is just fit enough to tantalize your senses and the cozy vibe provided by the friendly staff calls for some applause. The mughlai and awadhi cuisines with their mouth-watering taste leaves you craving for more even when you are full. Everytime one thinks of the galawati kabab, it is sure to trip you. Without blink of an eye, this place should be tried out and the slight pinch in the pocket is absolutely worth it.

Come to food, we ordered murgh biriyani, awadhi handi biriyani, murgh kasa and mutton Rogan josh. Biriyani was excellent with awadhi flavour. Also there were rayta and chatni. I must say chatni was awesome. Foods were well cooked and yummy. They serve biriyani in small handis that were sooo cute. It's a place to enjoy with your family. They play gazals which can make you feel that you are in a royal place in Rajasthan. Decorations were too good

The best place in town to have awadhi cuisine. The decor and ambience is just excellent and the begum akhtar ghazals just add upto the atmosphere. The waiters are dressed like contemporary lucknowi style and the whole decor is made of wood which matches with the style of the nawabs of Lucknow. All the utensils starting from the plates, glasses and the water mugs have the nawabi style.
Coming to the food, we ordered galawati kebab, laccha paratha, awadhi handi biriyani, gosht shahi korma and firni... All the dishes were excellent particularly the laccha paratha tasted excellent with the galawati kebab. The gosht shahi korma was also brilliant in taste. The staff were very courteous. So all in all it was an excellent experience

This is the place i was waiting to visit for a long time. I went there yesterday with my family and we so loved the place. Mughal style decors matching the music in background. You can find a variety of biriyanis here. The galawti kebabs which is one of their speciality is a must try. The Raan biriyani and moti biriyani was mouth-watering alongwith chicken irani, which makes people visit this place over and over again.

Went for a Dinner last week. Heard a lot about this restaurant and its food quality. Almost all had mentioned about its biriyani. I had thought this will be just another biriyani because there are lots of arsalan shiraz wannabes. Ordered mutton galauti kebab. chicken irani kebab as starters. The chicken kebab was okay but galauti kebab was heavenly, soft was silk. We had also ordered the famed mutton raan biriyani and a chicken side dish the name of which I dont remember. It is quite natural to forget the name because the dish pales in comparison to the raan biriyani. Its so heavenly. Every mouthful was worth remembering. Shredded pieces of mutton accompanied by light flavoured rice.

Went here on 4th Feb 2017. Sorry for writing a late review. We reached here around 2:00 pm and found that it was full so they took a reservation and told us to wait for a few minutes. After 30 minutes or so I and my elder sister got a table for ourselves. I have eaten at their salt lake outlet which was fabulous. My sis was eyeing this place for a long time so she finally got time in feb and took me. We were soo hungry at that time that we forgot to take pictures. We ordered rann briyani, galawati kebab, lucknowi parantha and murgh irani and parceled one chicken briyani for home. The bill came out to be of Rs. 1509/- all inclusive. We had to pack murgh irani as we were full with eating rann briyani , kebabs and parantha. Their achaar which you will find on table is heavenly a must try and the green chutney is totally lip smacking. I would deduct 0.5 points for slow serving. Else 5.0 for food. The food here will definitely take you to heaven.
Must have galawati kebab!

We went to Oudh 1590 yesterday to celebrate a small family reunion in Kolkata after many many years! So it had to be special! We were looking for authenti Kolkata biryanis and kebabs to make the reunion memorable. We had heard a lot of good reviews about Oudh 1590 and decided to celebrate the evening there - an we were delighted that we had made the right choice. Though we had to wait about 10 mins in the evening, around 9 PM, the wait was worth every minute as we found out later to our delight.
We focussed on kebabs, biryanis and gravy items to give us company. The chicken Zafrani kebab was awesome - a very subtle aroma of saffron and rose and just the right amount spices! Have not tasted such a kebab so far anywhere. The Sugandhi kebab was very unique and satisfied the Bengali palate with the exoti flavour of gondhoraj lebu! The Galawati kebab was rightly spied and melted in the mouth as it should do. It brought back memories of my gorging on Galawati kebabs (Tunday kebabs as it is known there) in Lucknow. We ordered one Mutton Awadhi biryani and one chicken Awadhi biryani. Both took us to the seventh heaven! It was not oily, full of aromas of spies, kewra and saffron and Oh! so subtle in taste! Cannot be described in words though! For us, it was such a wonderful change from the usually spicy and oily biryanis that one gets in other parts of the country! 
The chicken kassa had a very unique taste and complimented the biryanis and roomali rotis perfectly. 
The portions served was excellent and we had enough left-overs that we packed to be had at home later. 
The pricing is reasonable and for the four of us, the cost was about Rs 800/head inclusive of taxes. The other pleasant surprise was that the restaurant did not charge the controversial "10% service charge".  Only mandatory taxes like VAT and Service Tax was added to the bill. 
The service was very prompt and friendly. 
The only shortcoming was the lack of space in the restaurant - the tables were too close to each other - making the place a little crammed and noisy. But who cares with such good food on ones table and adda with family after a long long time! 
Overall the experience was awesome and for us memorable for its food. Wish we could be here more often - but then we live miles away! 
Would congratulate the Chef and the entire team for such wonderful food!

The 3 .5 is for food only...the service I found not worthy of giving any review...let me give little food for thought for the management-I went there early evening when there were no other customers..still after waiting for around 25 minutes I got served chicken kabab instead of fish kabab which I ordered!!!..on pointing out the waiters were courteous enough to take that away and again a wait of another 20 minutes began with a senior citizen and a pregnant lady....the indiffernt attitude of the staff  was irksome...it seemed they were doing us a favour....now coming to food...we ordered parathas, biryani, mutton and chicken...everything was good as expected though the muton was tad salty....last word for the management-guys, Oudh 1590 is one of my favourite restaurants ...I hope you will put efforts for keeping it to that way though I doubt I will visit the Deshpriya park outlet again as I found the Salt Lake outlet staff little better....

If there's one place where my parents love to visit over and over again, it is Oudh. The biggest reason why my father loves this place so much, other than the stellar quality of food, is the Begum Akhtar ghazals that are played. 
Coming to the food, I cannot not mention the Mutton Nihari here which is perhaps the best in the country! I like how they serve the biryanis in small handis. The amazing kebabs and the plethora of choices is absolutely delightful!

Recommended for a nice family time.

Wonderful experience at Oudh 1590. Visited on 21 April 2017. I have not tasted mutton anywhere better than this restaurant. Bhuna ghost is an awesome masala rwcepie. The masala blended so well. J Nargisi kofta also delicious . It's gravy was made with Keema. Lucknow paratha is so oil free and light weight. Galauti kabab just melts in mouth and is the best in the kabab section. Kakori kebabs are also nice. We ordered awadhi handi biriyani which was just ok. The mutton piece was not that soft and juicy. Ambience is good with gazals at the background. A must visit for mutton lovers.

This restaurent is one of those few in kolkaga where you can find varities of biriyani.

This place is good, and not great like some people claims.

I've had Galawati Kabab which was very good, 
Awadhi Handi Biriyani, didn't find it as good as the origian awadhi cuisin.
We also tried Nehari Khaas and Phirni.
None of these two was good.

However everything seems good as you get one fine mughal-isq ambience around you.

The staffs are well mannered. Takes a tad bit time to serve though.

Small restaurant which looks a little cramped up. Tasted the chicken biryani and chicken chap with the chicken kasha. The chap was a little different from other places but was very nicely cooked. Loved the kasha as well. The biryani was pretty much at par with some of the renowned places! Ambience was decent and the waiters were friendly. The biryani is probably a tad expensive compared to the quantity served!

One of the best exotic biryani experiences, we tried Kakori kebabs, chicken afghani kebab, rann biryani and chicken chap. Quality of food is extremely good, delicious and very well cooked. Staffs were courteous and attentive. Pricing a tad bit on the higher side (did you know understand why I called this an exotic biryani eating experience?). Must try if you love biryani and visit Kolkata. You can come over a romantic date, with friends and with family as well!!! Must visit as a repeat customer.

Rann briyani was also superb and the quantity is more than sufficient..
Tandoori roti and Chicken irani was pretty okay.

Finally am done with it. 
So it you want some authentic mughlai food in a very royal style right from the beautiful decor to the utensils in which they serve food. 

We ordered,
Badam sharbaat- it's was pretty good 

Galauti kebab - soft succulent kebab comprising of minced meat , spices  which is an absolute delight. 

Raanna biryani-  shout out for this amazing dish, didn't have biryani like that amazing for some time. 

Kakori kebab - cooked delicious.

And a phirni is must for dessert 

The service was a bit slow and for some time i felt they were indifferent sometimes.
Well the amazing food was enough to suits your mood.

Definitely coming back for more kebabs🙂

Cheers!

Oudh 1590 is the closest one in Kolkata can get to Lucknow. Finally, there is one restaurant in town that can offer authentic Lucknowi cuisine. The mutton biryani is an original Awadhi. Do try Mutton Kakori, Galawati and kababs. In fact go to this place all empty so that you can try all the kababs. One can also opt for the platters. The ambience is fantastic. It reminds me of Dastarkhan in Lucknow. Overall, a classy experience and delicious Mughlai food that will make you gobble more than usual appetite.

Today was my second visit to Oudh 1590, Deshapriya Park and I don't hesitate in accepting the fact that I can't wait to dine again here! My first acquaintance with this place was from zomato as I was going through the list of biriyani serving places in Kolkata. I tried their Salt Lake branch and was more than delighted to find one throbbing close to my house! Happy😍😍😍
Coming to the food...o my!!!
If you are an ardent fan of biriyani then yes you've found the right place but also you need to shake off your inhibitions about finding a large plate of biriyani with alu and dim as in Kolkata style... The place takes pride in its cuisine and I feel it should. The biriyanis are not only good but are individually different from each other. I tried their dum murgh and raan biriyani and both were equally good and distinct in flavours. This time I went for chicken chaap. Though I am not a very big fan of chap but my husband insisted on having it and it was an excellent choice. Very different from the normal oily chaaps that you get with biriyani, this was more of a shahi chicken preparation with the right amount of ghee to leave that subtle aroma on your palette and your hands😁 Though I had tried their chicken kasha I thought too much gravy but this one was spot on! I have had their galauti kababs and the sugandhi murgh and they do taste good but if you visit this place keep space in your tummy for the oh-so-good biriyani experience!!
The only thing that concerns me is that the place is dimly lit, as has been pointed by the other reviewers, which I think can be thought of and solved while keeping with the décor and ambience of the place! Overall an awesome dine time and I hope they continue serving with such delights for the years to come!

Four of us decided to step in here one muggy Friday afternoon with a hanker for meat. I was late (always -_-) and by the time I came up the starters were already on the table, boti kabab, galauti kabab and a chicken achari kabab for me. Can't say about the others, but my chicken kabab was proclaimed to be more delicious than the boti (which was stiff) and the galauti (which was just okay). Mutton and chicken biryani was ordered, along with chicken rezalas and a paneer butter masala with tandoori rotis. They all tasted good individually (except that the chicken in my biryani was stiff and bland) but honestly, not off the charts good, which I sort of expected seeing the price tags. The carnage came to 2200 for the four of us.
That said, loved the background Ghazals, beautiful and so soothing. The ambience was transformative, with all the intricate paintings, jaali work...It was beautiful. 
Would I return? Maybe. I'm still hoping it'd blow my mind away...

South Kolkata needed a restaurant with such an ambience and the awadhi cuisine in this price is something I had never experienced. Service,  taste,  ambience everything is well in place. This place cn accommodate about 100 diners at a time while during weekends there's another 30 at least waiting outside for their turn to get in.  Two negative points: the portions can be a little more than what they serve
 considering the price is pretty decent and people inside a pretty loud.  

We have seen the sister concern Chowman deteriorate with time and hope that will not be the case with Oudh.

Food is huge in quantity and good in quality and taste. It's very light. Burra kebab is bit dull. Awadhi Biriyani is good. The music and the decor is a perfect set of Nawabs but the lights need to be put on to add the glory into it.

Not sure what the hype is about! The paneer starter was good -- very soft, high quality paneer with the right amount of spices. But the Galawti Kebab reeked of artificial perfumes and not real spices. The Raan Biryani wasn't that great either. Not going back.

This is one of my favourite restaurants. I visited this place like 5 days ago. The restaurant really takes you back to the days when the Mughals ruled India. The food is really really good. The Galawati kebab is a must. We also ordered Biriyani and Murgh Chaap. The  staff is also very cordial and attentive.

Ya, its a good mughlai restaurant. Undoubtedly it has a wide range of dishes which will make you a regular guest of this restaurant. But I would suggest you not to visit here during festive season, specially during Durga puja. Cz due to large demand, sometimes the quality get compromised.

The place tries to mimic Nawabi style and succeeds to some extent-dimly lit and thumris playing in the background. Would rate 4 on decor and ambience. Coming to the food now - had raan biriyani, murgh biriyani and shahi tukda here. The murgh biriyani was less than ordinary- nothing special about it; most places serve better biriyani than this at much cheaper prices-275 rs seemed overpriced. Next comes the raan biriyani which lives upto the reputation. Though seemingly overpriced (@395), I would still consider this, as the taste somewhat matches the price. The mutton was tender and melted away in the mouth- characteristic of a true raan. For dessert, had shahi tukda which tasted quite good but at Rs 110, may be, one can find a lot of better sweet dishes. So to summarise, Oudh 1590 is surely a good place to eat but it is overpriced and overhyped. Would rate 3.8-zomato doesn't give that option so rounded off to 4.

We have ordered for delivery, today, celebrating year ending , The delivery man was just 15 mins late than our given time, and he was also very sorry for that, and we understand it was due to the traffic jam and one ways, near our office.  But that is not any issue to reduce my rating. We ordered for Awadhi Handi Biriyani, Gosht Biriyani, Murgh Pardah Biriyani, Veg Biriyani.  All were just awesome, and of same taste as the inhouse dining.  Its the best biriyani authentic in town. Thank you Chef, keep up the good work .

If you are a fan of Awadhi/Nawabi cuisine, then Oudh 1590 is one restaurant that you must visit. I have been at both of their branches (the other one being in Saltlake), but I must say that I like the food better at this one! The place is decked up in beautiful Nawabi style and even their dishes, glasses and serve ware are all copper finished ones which adds a rich look to the place. These, along with the ghazals playing in the background, makes it a true period dining experience!
Dishes ordered:
Starters:
1. Mutton Galawati Kebab - 5 star dish. No Awadhi menu is complete without these melt-in-your-mouth kebabs. I can visit Oudh again and again just to have these!

2. Paratha - Just order any small partha, to try with the Galawati kebabs.

3. Mutton Burra Kebab - 5 stars. Soft and succulent mutton panje/rib pieces cooked to perfection.

Main Course:
4. Awadhi Moti Biriyani: 4 stars. This biriyani has the north authentic Awadhi taste, with subtle aroma of ghee and Mutton moti/minced mutton balls instead of typical pieces. Its surprisingly light, and you don't feel the heavy after a hearty helping of this one. The biriyani proportion they serve is quite good and one is more than enough for 2 persons.

5. Awadhi Handi Mutton Biriyani: 3 stars. Good one, but I somehow felt this one is quite like any other Handi biriyani we taste in other restaurants. Nothing special in this one.

6. Ghosht Kundan Kaaliya: I would recommend this one. 4 good pieces on mutton in creamy rich gravy.

Desset:
7. Gajar ka Halwa: Very ordinary. I won't recommend this one.

Clearly an overrated place.
Good: kebabs were nice

Bad: service is awful.
1.They don't give separate plate for starter and main course.If only you ask they give reluctantly.

2.Biryani was good, not great for sure with bony pieces of mutton.When we mentioned about the all-bone piece of mutton , a waiter conviniently took away the piece from the plate where I had starter and also the biryani waa served already.He definitely did replace the mutton but I wonder where the piece from my plate headed to or rather to whose plate.That is not how a reputed restaurant functions.

3.Place is very small which enhances the darkness even more.next table people are just a few centimetres away and either you or they can have conversations.

4. staff completely ignore the fact that doing your job passionately and treating someone good in a restaurant is way different from smiling at guests only because you are being paid for it

5.And the loud music gives you headache instead of creating a good ambience

Though you need to wait before you get a place,the food is worth waiting for. Galuti kabab served with two mini parathas,tastes awesome. The kabab melts in your mouth.Mutton Rann Biryani is amazing. Though a mughlai restaurant and one would expect to take firni for dessert,i would suggest everyone to have gajar ka halwa.Its warm,its subtle and its heavenly.

The ambience has been perfectly made to provide an Awadhi feel. The dimly lit decor, Ghazal music, the copper utensils, biriyani served in handi, the paintings take you to a day back in history. This place is mainly for meat lovers. The Salaan and the Awadhi specialities does cater to my taste (no idea about the vegetarian ones which I haven't tried as yet). The Galawati kebab comes in both veg and non veg menu, the former serves cottage cheese kebab and the latter serves mutton paste kebab. Now 'mutton paste' might make one feel that it's something awful, but it's been made to perfectly melt the kebab in your mouth. The firni is too creamy and has the perfect sweetening done. What may dissatisfy you is the long wait on weekends and special occassions (may be one has to wait for hours). But the wait is worth it for a sumptuous meal in an over-hyped restaurant with an overflowing crowd.

After visiting 3-4 times thought it's an appropriate time to give a review.  Located just in front of Carmel Primary school you can easily locate as people are always there in queue even If you reach earlier. interiors are well decorated with themed ghazal musics but on the other hand the lights are very dim. hardly you can see the menu if you sit just in the right row after entrance. the glass and plates are heavy purely made of copper. The galwati kebab for which Oudh is famous is actually minced keema paste. Kakori and shami kebab i think are better as you feel to taste the mutton.the Lucknowi paratha is real soft and goes well with the kebabs. then comes the biryani.  honestly i didn't liked it. many people are crazy about their biryani but sadly i'm not. The amount of rice  in the pot is plenty but honestly i'd prefer a street biryani with an egg and aloo rather than this Awadhi style(not my type). the pieces of mutton/chicken of the biryani are good and soft. Thumbs Up only for kebabs.

Oudh 1590, a restaurant which, I feel,  is much too overrated in this city of food-lovers and food connoisseurs! 

I visited the Deshapriya park outlet on 19th March for the first time for celebrating my father's birthday. And oh boy do I not regret it? Thinking that it was a normal sunday with no special festivals around it would be possible to get a table there easily (in any case they do not reserve tables!) However our ordeal began when we were told to wait for 15 minutes as the restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside too. We thought we could afford to wait for the 15 minutes. 

However, the 15 minutes soon turned to 1 hour 15 minutes and it was really bad with aged parents being made to wait  with little arrangements for people standing outside, especially senior citizens! 

Having got the table at last, we were ushered into a very dimly lit corner of the establishment, where reading the menu card, seeing what is being served or the bill amount afterwards, was tough. The person who took our orders and served us was polite and helpful and the food was served comparatively quickly, which were the only two good points. 

We ordered:
Mutton Awadhi Biryani X 1
Chicken Awadhi Biryani x 1
Mutton Kakori Kabab x 1
Chicken Tangri Kabab x 1
Shahi Tukra x 1
Kesar Kulfi x 1

The biryanis were good, though not as sumptuous as reviews seem to misguide. The kakori kebab was not tasty at all with too much of the scent/attar which overpowered all the other spices. The tangri kebeb was moderately good. What we liked best was the shahi tukra! Over all it was a mediocre dining experience!

What truly put me off were:
 1)the darkness of the place, 
2)the terrible mosquito bites my feet under the table received, all through the meal, (no body pays for getting infected with dengue/malaria)
 3)the fancy copper glasses, coated with unwashed food remains, which we had to send away and drink from our own bottles instead! 

Some of the amount of money charged, which is not very little, could be well-utilised to make such basic amenities available to the diner. 

So much for the maharajas, their ghazals and fancy wood work decor! Only for me.... there will be no encore...

This is my third time experience in this restaurant.Due to the awesome experience of the last two times,I recommended Oudh to my close guests.Its a home delivery order which turned out terribly bad.
1.The food they served,especially the main course n starters r so poor in quality that we were forced to waste the food and through it to dustbin.
2.The Awadhi Sugandhi Mahi-Fish starter has too much bad odour in it.
3.The Rann Biriyani quality was very poor.Neither they had the mutton in proper amount nor they had the quality.Instead of Mutton they filled it with Fat of mutton which was just shocking.
Thanks Oudh 1590 for successfully ruining the very important lunch I had planned for so long.

This was my 4th visit to this gastronomic heaven. Located near the Carmel school in Deshapriya Park, this place is a Royal treat for meat lovers. Whenever I think of biryani, my mind just cannot go beyond Oudh's famous Raan Biryani. And so my cravings took me to this place, once again.

For this time, we ordered Awadhi Sugandhi Maahi and Chicken Zafrani Kabab. The fish kebab was a melt-in-mouth delicacy with subtle aroma of the "gondhoraj" lemon. The Zafrani Kebab was again a juicy number, spiced with saffron. And now for the star dish- the famous Raan Biryani. In one word- AMAZING! An aromatic and richly flavoured Awadhi biryani with soft and succulent pieces of Mutton 'raan' (leg pieces), cooked and served in an earthen handi- this was what I could term as Pure Pleasure! Unlike other rich biryanis, this one was rather light on stomach. Along with it, we ordered another speciality of this place, the Nehaari Khaas. Although the meat was a bit on the tougher side, I liked the flavour of the richly spiced gravy. For our sweet tooth, we ordered Shahi Tukda and Gajar ka Halwa. The Shahi Tukda was just rightly sweet, but the Gajar Ka Halwa was terrific! The Halwa, served piping hot, simply melted in the mouth and the flavour of pure ghee and mawa was something one cannot forget. Our dinner was just an overdose of memorable flavours.

The ambience gave a royal feeling with slow Thumri playing in the background. A well behaved staff added to the joy.

Ambience: 3.5/5.
Food: 4.5/5.
Staff: 4/5.
Pocket pinch- ₹2531 for 3.

No doubt about the awesomeness of this place. A cosy beautiful 'shahi' place, serving you the Nawabi dishes in a royal fashion. Topping the list, of course their signature, Galawati Kebab with that Kaju Chutney, Raan Biriyani with shredded mutton and raita and Murgh Irani. And inspite of a too much filled stomach, I couldn't leave the greed of Phirni and Shahi Tukra.

Their Raan biryani is memorable- with chunks of melt-in-the-mouth mutton nestled among beautiful fragrant rice. Both quantity and presentation is commendable. I personally found the galawati kebabs to be a bit dry, but the nehari khaas tasted outstanding. I am looking forward to trying more biryani variations from this place.

I just walked into Paradise yesterday.Er,called by the name Oudh 1590. Seriously.What's not to love about this place? The Ambience is just super fab,what with the beautiful songs playing that set the right mood for a gastronomic extravaganza.The Restaurant staff dressed in suits and leading us to chairs was an added bonus.The Food itself is fabulous.I don't know how people can rave about Arsalan or any other place serving Biriyani when there is this place that does ample justice to the Awadhi tradition of Biriyani..I have never had Biriyani which tasted tastier..The quantity too was really good.A single plate of Biriyani would be enough for 2 people of medium appetite. The side dishes,though really delicious,were a disappointing quantity wise.Not a word can be said against the food quality-The Moti Biriyani and Awadhi Dum Aloo that I had were simply amazing.The mutton used in the Biriyani simply melted in my mouth..Awesome..Lastly i also had Kulfi Falooda which provided a suitable ending to this wonderful meal.Every ingredient here is SO grand.Even the pan masala was served not in plates but in the Royal way in an ornate box..The price might seem a bit hefty,however it would ensure a great great experience.The place could however do with separate washrooms for men and women.Other than this glitch,the restaurant stands almost flawless.Its a place where you would like to go back again and again,albeit with your pockets filled. ❤

To be honest,  we really found this place overrated! 
The interiors are done perfectly though it becomes stuffy if the place is crowded because of the dim lighting! 
We are vegetarians so we ordered Dahi ke Kebabs, Veg Biryani , Paneer Qorma , Rumali Rotis and Aam Panna drink!
Dahi ke kebab was good but they took a lot of time to serve it.
Veg Biryani was very bad and was cold. It tasted like pre-cooked biryani, frozen and warmed in microwave before serving! We could figure this out because the rice on the top of the handi was hot but inside, it was freezer cold!
Paneer qorma was okayish, did not like the preparation much whereas the rumali roti was soft!
Overall a below average experience and would never prefer to go again! We thought that the place is famous for biryani(we know we should not expect veg ones) but the cold biryani spoilt our mood!
Not a good choice for vegetarians .

The more I grow fond of biryani the more places I seek to explore. But this time the food came with an Awadhi twist. When i arrived near Oudh I was amazed at the very first sight of the outside decoration. The interior was also mesmerizing with palatial furnishing and the classical music playing in the background took us to a totally different era. But somehow I felt the place was too dimly lit.

They served everything in brass tableware. The aam khaas sharbat was a little thick for a refreshing drink. The lucknowi paratha was thin and oil-free and the galauti kebab was good. The Raan biryani was out of the world and the Irani chicken was delicious as well. Towards the end they were taking too much time to give us the bill and change. They might have done it with promptness.

Oudh 1590 is basically North Indian style, lucknow   awadhi cuisine... I had been to Oudh 1590, Deshapriya Park branch, which is in bipin pal road,just near Deshapriya park crossing. A fine dine experience indeed.., though i have been to this place twice still moved by ambience and dishes....The royal ambience will give you promising vibes..the background gazals & ragas..the dim lighting will send anyone back into the days of nawabs..

The staff are courteous and dressed as per theme..the utensils interesting..
Coming to dishes...ordered item was Raan biryani, Gawlauti Kebab and Sahi Tukra. Awesome tastes and quantity are too much for biryani.  Kebabs are good, but very less in quantity as per price.its bit expensive food joint but still affordable as authentic awadhi food goes.
Overall a great experience. Highly recommended...CHEERS..!!!

Today I went to Oudh for having our Dinner. After seeing the menu card we ordered 
2 Plate Mutton Galouti kebab or Galawati Kabab which is not good enough.It was taste like bitter.
Then we ordered 1 Plate Zafrani Kebab Chicken. First bite was good then we realize that chicken was not well marinated.Then we ordered "Rann Mutton Biriyani" it was so pathetic feeling. It was taste like Bengali Ghee Bhat (Homemade) with Sliced Boiled Mutton. The price of all dish are too much. I went to lukhnow 2 times and had biriyani, Galouti kebab. But Oudh menu is Not Equal to any of the street of Lukhnow.

No Booking, If you are late please wait. That was my first experience about Oudh 1590.
Highly rated restaurant was on my list from long time. So I choose for a grand occasion.
I went to book a table for 7 persons. They politely decline the request. We don't encourage early booking.

So on the day we went little early. if we are late then we need to wait for 30-40 mins approx.

Now Food and Hospitality.

The front door guard with a long moustache welcomed us inside the restaurant.
Nice seats but very low light, hardly you can see anything inside the menu card.
Exterior and Interior of the restaurant is perfectly matching with the tempo.
Lucknow Ghrana's mild music also created the atmosphere.
Garnishing of the food and Service style also interesting.

1. 7x Aam Panna ( Mild Cold, Smooth, Soothy, Tasteful) - 110/
2. 2x Gawlauti Kebab ( Soft, Rich, Tasteful, Legendary of Oudh) - 270/
3. 2x Zafrani Kebab ( Rich Zafran taste, Soft, Tender, Unique) - 275/
4. 2x Awadhi Sugandhi Mahi ( Lemon Flavoured, SO SO, overpriced ) - 385/
5. 3x Rann Biriyani accompanied with Raita (Perfect Awadhi Flavoured, Less Mutton Pieces but Soft & well marinated Mutton pieces, Raita was good to taste) - 395/
6. 1x Murgh Irani (Nice in taste, thick gravy) - 240/
7. 1x Gosht Bhuna ( Good and Legendary of Oudh) - 270/
8. 1x Green Salad (Carrot, Cucumber, Onion, Tomato) - 90/
9. Thought to taste Phirni but No space left in stomach

Total Bill 5550(including tax)

3 Biriyanis are more than enough for 7persons.
Over Price, Kebabs are good, but very less in quantity. At least 6pieces should be sufficient for the price, what we are paying for.
Taste pure awadhi, must visit. but not sure about second time.

Went on a public holiday. Had an extrodinary meal. Truly exotic items and generous portions. Starters are varied with Galouti Kebeb (the starter we ordered) stealing the show. The sharbats are also great. The decor and music sets the tune for the patrons to be transported to a new and refreshing environment. Three cheers for service as well and will definitely visit again with as  many references after today...Keep it up.

I have been one ardent fan of Awadhi cuisine and hence of Oudh 1590. I have visited their Saltlake branch several times, but never got a chance to dine at their Desapriya Park branch which is near Carmel school. I know how amazing their interiors are since I have heard it is similar to their Saltlake branch. The period dining experience goes up to another level when you dine in that awesome royal ambiance. But anyway, my order from their Desapriya Park branch was through an online delivery service company. The home delivery was done on time and the food was perfectly packed. The handis looked gorgeous and there were no seepages. We order for moti biriyani, raan biriyani, gosht biriyani, murgh Irani and shahi tukra. All the dishes were prepared with great care and the taste was comparable with their Saltlake branch. The raan biriyani was aromatic though somehow I felt the aroma was bit on the lower side, maybe because of the home delivery thing. The moti biriyani was nice and flavorful and not that oily, though I preferred the flavor of raan biriyani over the moti. Murg Irani was rich, very tasty and had succulent chicken pieces in there, I really loved this side. The shahi tukra was not overtly sweet and was good to savor, but maybe I had expected a lot more from it. The quantity in that gosht biriyani container was a bit less and when compared to raan biriyani this stands no chance to excel. Overall the dining experience was nice and pleasant. Prices were more or less reasonable keeping in mind the quality. But I would like to mention, if you want to have food from Oudh 1590, go there and opt for dine-in, take away or home delivery really takes away half the charm this place has to offer. A must visit eatery for all awadhi cuisine fanatics.

Cheers!

Oudh 1590 .. The place made my day..  Took my girlfriend for lunch after getting a job and it was totally worth it when we came out with a happy tummy.  
Galawti kebab.. Just melts in the mouth..  Rann biriyani..  Different kind of biriyani,  something I don't think is found anywhere in Kolkata and most of all a missing alu.  Mutton pieces were shreded and that beautiful taste of marination in spices and curd was just amazing.  
The biriyani quantity is enough for two members..( If u have a big belly like mine.. )

If anyone wants to enjoy the real flavour of awadhi biryani they must visit this place. murg handi biryani , mutton Rogan josh was too good but the mouth watering gulawti kebab took all the attention.ambience was totally mind blowing ,the dulcet tunes of Rajasthani songs made us to feel like royals😁

A great place and a must visit for every foodie. the food tastes just awesome and the staffs are excellent. try the badam sherbet and the rann biriyani.. the biriyanis aroma is awesome and it just feels like flowing through your mouth down your throat. the irani chicken is also good but the chicken needs to be a bit tender. try the kulfi in the end. just one point. if you are a little late in the evening be prepared to wait in the queue..

One of the best place in kolkata to have awadhi dishes..Oudh is located just opposite Carmel primary school..Ambience is beautiful both from outside and inside..Background ghazal and decorations create a perfect environment of mughal era..We ordered Raan Biryani,Tandoori roti,Murgh Irani..Biryani was simply mouth watering and the mutton was perfectly cooked..Other items were also delicious..Staff are courteous and service was fast..Definetly will visit here again..

LOCATION:

Near Deshapriya Park close to Carmel Primary School there. If you don't know either, it would be advisable to use GPS.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Oudh 1590 has been in my wishlist for a while. I must admit that I have tried eating there twice before my recent visit to the place, but a long queue and an even longer wait time had resulted in me opting for an alternate each time.  However, it was late on a weekday and there were three of us. We just managed to get there in time for their last order.

The place I must admit looks very nice from outside. They have tried their best to portray the Awadh era with a themed outer facade. Even the pan shop right outside has been themed accordingly although I did not think he was connected to the restaurant in any way. This was a great touch as otherwise his shop would have interfered with the look of the place. From the inside once again the place is well themed. The the ceiling takes you back many decades and the colored lamps with ghazals playing in the background gives you the feel of dining like a nawab.  No expense has been spared in making it a truly period dining experience. 

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for Murgh Biryani, Murgh Irani & Murgh Chaap, Masala Soda, Breads & Kulfi at the end.

The Masala Soda  came first and was standard. It was a refreshing start to the meal. Next came the Irani Murgh and Murgh Chaap. The Irani murgh was creamy with two huge pieces of chicken on the bone. It was the same with the Chaap although the later was more spicy and robust. I liked both these dishes although I felt the paratha was little too oily for my appetite. 

The Murgh Biryani came after. This was what I had heard and read so much about. It was a good helping, enough for three people and yet the flavors disappointed us. While the biryani was aromatic enough and and was served well in an earthenware pot, it lacked flavor. Normally, I can eat biryani by itself without having to order any sides with it, but I needed to borrow the gravy from our chicken dishes in order to make the biryani suitable to our taste. Maybe it was our taste bud. We were also served complimentary pickels which added flavor to all courses and provided a welcome and refreshing kick to all the very rich dishes.

The kulfi was served last and was great. Food is very rich and heavy and this had a soothing effect on our tummies which were full by now.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The biryani could have been better. Maybe it was our expectation levels from the place which were unfair and biased in a lot of ways. But we expected more.

While the interiors have been done up elaborately and people have been loving the same, I had an issue with the place lacking windows. We were seated in a small room towards the right when you enter which was walled on all sides except the entry. It felt a little stuffy and uncomfortable after a while especially since a lot of dark woodwork has been used across the place. 

VERDICT:

Good place for an Awadhi meal.  One of a kind interiors and a unique menu.

Wonderful restaurant to choose among other mughlai and awadhi restaurants in Kolkata...One can go with their families, friend's, office colleagues or couples etc for lunch or dinner. I went with two other school friends for dinner.. Perfect ambience was there, waiters were very polite, helpful and we'll behaved...Although interior space wasn't that much but it had a high glamour and reputation for food..We took galauti kebab among mutton kebab items and zafrani among chicken kebab items..Those were marvellously prepared and mouth-watering..Also waiter said that with galauti kebab you will be getting luccha paratha free of cost so we choose to taste that too..After that we took awadhi handi biriyani where I have a concern regarding taste of that..It's taste wasn't better than wat I expected...Apart from that we choose to have one drink which was masala mixed and that was too good...So overall I will rate Oudh 1590 as 4.5/5 requesting them to take plenty of actions for developing the taste of awadhi handi biriyani item whose taste seemed bit low.

Oudh Deshapriya park. ...Would've liked to give points less than zero...Horribly soury foods...staring from Kebabs to Biriyani. ...We opted for the overrated foods...Galauti kebab..and Raan Biriyani....Sugandhi kebab..We couldn't tolerate even half of the plates..Galauti kebab was worst...My honest suggestion is...if you are expecting something more delicious than the regular Kebabs and Biriyanis. ...you'll be hugely disappointed. 
Please remember, this is NOT a classy place. When told about our dislikings, we were given the usual EXPLANATIONS, like a cheap restaurant...

It was with great anticipation and expectation of indulging myself  with good food. Alas! Apart from the ambience,  nothing is worth mentioning. Service is poor. Food is below par. And incase you are expecting signature Mughlai or Awadhi flavour,  you will be highly disappointed.
I would rather go to Bengali restaurants incase I want to eat anything like that.

MUST visit for an unparalleled dining experience. I stuck to the signature galawati kebabs with paranthas, Awadhi Handi Biryani (they were gracious enough to pack the leftovers in one of the handis to bring home), and firni to end the meal on a delicious note. I write "experience" because seldom has the ambiance of an eatery struck me as so breathtaking (might have something to do with my love for history tho). The decoration, the food, the very gracious servers, and the music; for someone like me who has not had a chance to explore the eats Kolkata has to offer  because we seldom visit the city, this one should not be missed of given the opportunity.

I went there yesterday for lunch. It was perfect for my Saturday lunch. We ordered zafrani kabab in starter. In main course we ordered raan biriyani. Kabab was awesome and what can I say about biriyani. It was perfect. Motton pieces and rice are enough for two people. In desert we ordered kulfi falooda and shahi tukra. Staffs are very very courteous and helpful. The ambience was quite classy. Overall a great experience. Highly recommended.....

Yesterday we went there for dinner. Really we had a gala time.  A bit overrated but worth a visit. Loved the ambience. Their eager embrace of mughal influence along with the thumries made our time more amazing. Coming to the food. Food was really awesome. We ordered Raan Biryani ,Awadhi Handi biryani, Galawati kabab and murg irani. All the four items were really appreciable. Staffs were so good. Keep up your good work. Highly recommended.

This place was on my bucket list. Had heard a lot from people and hence decided to treat my taste buds.

Had ordered:
▪ Gilauti kebab
▪ Kakori kebab
▪ Raan biryani
▪ Gosht Bhuna 
▪ Butter naan 
▪ Mahi kalia 

Frankly, I am pretty disappointed. The taste is definitely admirable, but the quantity - very less in compared to price.
 Seeing the price being on the higher side, it's kind of expected that the amount of food will be satisfactory. Well, it's not! 

 Mutton pieces are small and smeared with a lot of extra gravy. Biryani, the price is 390 inr but the amount will not satisfy two grown adults completely.
I felt this place to be a bit overrated. Nothing more to say.

We ordered raan biriyani to moti biriyani to murg irani, zafrani kabab as well as keema paratha... The food was just too good. A special mention about Raan Biryani, it has mutton in every bite you take. Staffs are very very courteous and helpful. Overall a great experience. Highly recommended.

Hyped and OVER RATED. Orderd Sungandhi kebab,Awadhi pardah biriyani. Totally modified biriyani. Didnt like at all. Very spicy, so beware of Awadhi BIRIYANI. Sugandhi kebab is nothing but kinda soft smoked kebab cost 280 +tax for 4 pieces!! Very costly. Ambience is good. THe moment you enter you will see the Reflection of Mughal era and I cant post a highly rated review just for the ambience! Not satisfied.

Oudh, a den for biryani lovers. If you are a person who loves to have biryani even on a scorching sunny afternoon then you must pay your visit to this place. That's right you not only go their but you pay your vist. It's equally soothing to your tastebuds and your eyes.

The moment you reach the restaurant's gate you will feel that you have reached a fort. It looks so glamorous and classy that you will fall in love with the place on first sight. Moving in you will again fall in love with the interior and the ambiance. The chairs, the tables, the people in charge, the chandler, the way of serving the foods, everything literally everything. There's no one thing which you can say that yes I love this aspect of the restaurant, but all. They serve the foods on a heavy steel plate with a copper layer under them, which looks very old(in a good way), water on copper coated steel glasses, the kababs on a heavy steel plate and the biryani comes in an earthen pot. Overall it tingles your feeling for your love. Oh, another thing the gazals, they go very well with the ambiance.

The must tries are the biryani and the galauti kabab with parantha. The mouthwatering galauties will melt the moment you pet them in your mouth. The aroma, the blissful taste will stay with you for a long time, and would make you come back for more of them. The paranthas in here are small, almost the size of your palm(I'm assuming you are an adult), and are very tasty. They are all white and are not oily at all. So that they go well with the kabab as they are moist. But the parantha was a bit pricey.

Coming to the biryani it's rich, it's aromatic and the flavors 'mmmm' so damn good that you will use your hands but not the spoon. And please, try the raan biryani it's so high on taste that you won't need anything else to get high.

I would definitely recommend oudh to anyone, but would also suggest not to go their just by yourself. Take someone with youself who has the same interest in awadhi cuisines, just as you have.

A mind blowing themed restaurant. They have very successfully brought about the essence of Mughal era; even the AC and Speakers are customised according to the theme. 5/5 for the ambiance. 

Food is delicious. You are bound to go back there once you taste their Moti Biryani. And be careful while placing the order since the quantity is pretty high, you may not be able to consume a full place of biryani on your own specially if you have starter or soft drinks beforehand; so order wisely. 

Staffs are very nice n attentive, service is fast. 
I was very delighted being there. Thanks.

Decor is awesome and authentically a Vintage Awadhi Essence everywhere.Me and my wife had to wait for a table on a busy weekend afternoon.The waiters are right there to guide you inside to your table and their suggestions are also good,(a bit pushy though).
Food,wow.Lazawab.Felt like a Mughal emperor,having lavishing Lucknowi Lunch.
Be it the Mutton Galwati kebab,or the Zafrani murgh kebab.Biryani was okay.Mutton shahi korma was rich and thick and great in taste.Phirni again is also wow.
Strawberry flavoured drink that they asked to try was not good.
All the management staffs,Kudos.
A memorable experience.
Indeed a costly restaurant,but am glad to have such a place in my own Kolkata.
Good food attracts good price.So no one should complain about overpriced place and all.
A happy recommendation to all REAL foodies.

After waiting for a while we got our seats. The ambience was very good. Coming to the food. We ordered:
*Galawati kebab- Very tasty kebabs made of minced and mashed meat. Packed with spices. Slightly on the spicy side. Though it's not one of the best galawati kebabs that I've tasted. I'd give it a 3/5

*Nehari khaas- This dish is out of the world tasty. It's a mutton preparation who's gravy is made of the bone marrow . It's v v tasty. I give it a 4.5/5

*Rann biriyani- It's one of their specialities . Very tasty biriyani with mouth watering aroma. One of the best biriyanis in town for sure. The pieces of mutton were very soft and juicy . I give it a 4.5/5

The staff was courteous. Overall a great experience.

Yummy biryani with mouth watering kababs; that's what oudh 1590 is famous for. The decoration was fully nawabi with lucknowy classical music. The staffs were also dressed according to the theme. We tried qualmi kabab(chicken), awadhi sugandhi mahi (fish),awadhi biryani,firni,kulfi. Kababs were perfectly made. Biryani was a bit below to my expectation beacuse rice was slightly overcooked whether meat was not tender at all. Dessert were superb and the taste was increasing more when the smell of kesar was coming out of it with its own nawabi andaz.

Ambience: One might feel very close to the Bada Imambara once inside this food joint.

Service: Quite good and very helpful.

Pocket pinch: Affordable.

Verdict: Gives Arsalan a run for its money when it comes to North Indian cuisine. Absolutely authentic cuisine.

Located near Lake Mall. This is a great place to have Biryani. Especially the special Biryani(which are served in pots). I got a takeaway from this place. And i had a wonderful experience. Service is amazing. The restaurant opened at 6:30 and they got my food ready by 6:55-7:00 because i had to catch a flight at night. The loved their service, brilliant packing for take away and the biriyani. Overall nice place. Pocket pinch might be higher than other biriyani options but that is irrelevant since the food is amazing.

I have been here 2-3 times before , never clicked any pics so didn't review. Today i did 😜

 So i was here this afternoon,it was mostly empty as its a weekday, got a table instantly.
Ordered the galawati kabab with the special wafer thin parathas,i loved both of them, yummy to the core,.then had mutton handi biriani,the quantity is very good,i would have liked the the rice more intact,not so broken but it was full of ghee and tatsy ,the 2 muttn pcs were a bit of disappointment as it had less meat,mostly Bones.had the biriani needed a bit more salt.
Then a saahi tukda to end the meal, fantastic as always,2 people can eat one still hard to finish,the taste is on point.
 Fresh lime soda could have been less sweet more areated.

Located in one of the alleys of Desopriyo park Oudh 1590 still manages to keep 4.4/5 (as on 2/2/2017) for its “Nawabi isssytle”. 

Location tip: For people visiting this place for the first time use GPS from Desopriyo park; it’s easier that way.

Visited this place one Monday afternoon with a friend of mine. Place was not that crowded so we didn’t have to wait. Ambiance of this place is something worth noting: As soon as you enter there is a huge mirror on the left which shows how ugly you look! (or beautiful?)  The warm lights, bronze cutlery, beautiful paintings, courteous staff with “thumri” in the background sets the mood for Nawabi lunch. But the place is a bit small.  

Now coming to the “best part of being a Nawab” : Food. We ordered Sugandhi kebab as starters but we were served Zafrani kebab. They apologized and wanted to replace but we were so hungry we had both Zafrani and Sugandhi kebabs. Zafrani kebab was mouthwatering but didn’t enjoy those white sugandhi kebab (felt the taste of coconut, gandhoraj lebu and chicken were competing with each other in my mouth :/ )   but both were well cooked and less oily. Volume of the kebabs may disappoint gluttons given the amount they charge for a plate but then of course we are paying both for quality and quantity.

As drinks we ordered aam sikanji, because aam khas was unavailable, which was refreshing. 

Next coming to the main course. We ordered “Awadhi Bandi Biriyani” and “Nehari khas” as suggested by the staff. People who have tasted biriyani in other famous places (in Kolkata) like Arsalan, Aminia etc will definitely find it different. Comment: Try it you won’t be disappointed! “Nehari Khas” was also very tasty. For a person with average appetite one plate of biriyani will be sufficient for two if you are having it after kebabs. (Disclaimer: This was told by my partner. I am a glutton so it’s not applicable for me.)

Finally deserts: “Phirni” was unavailable so we had to order “Kulfi Falooda” but it was a blessing in disguise. Falooda was awesome. Give it a try.

A ‘must visit’ for all meat lovers. I will definitely visit again to try their famous “Galawati kebab”,“Rann Biriyani” and of course the Kebab platter.

P.S. Price is a bit high (include VAT, service tax etc.)compared to other famous biriyani-kebab places in Kolkata but it’s worth every penny. We were charged around 2.2k (all inclusive) for 2.

Great ambience....the Nawabi style decoration,utensils and background gazals & ragas along with dim lights will take anyone to long years back to the Nawab eras....very nice...service quality wasn't upto mark....come to the dishes...we took chicken Aam sharbat,Soda shikanji, Zafrani kebeb,Fish awadhi Sugandhi mahi,chicken tandoori..then in main course murgh pardah biriyani,nan,murgh Kassa and murgh Irani...at last shahi tukda as dessert... didn't like biryani... other dishes were ok but not liked so much... actually the dishes taste different to us(may be as this is awadhi restaurant)from mughlai styles we are used to...

A fine dine experience indeed..long in my bucket list..the royal ambience will give you promising vibes..the background gazals..the dim lighting will send u back into the days of nawabs..
The staff are courteous..the utensils interesting..
We ordered chicken afghani kebab..unconventional stuff with a totally different taste to my palate..juicy pieces of chicken(with bone)drenched in a white curdy smoked paste..awesome indeed..
The galawati kebab was soft enough to melt in my mouth..minced meat paste cooked to near perfection..well i had expected a tad bit spice there..
The vinegar soaked masala onions are an added advantage..
The rann biriyani was oozing with flavours..soft juicy mutton..good indeed...the butter naan was average..the chicken irani had a bold flavour..the gravy was rich and i was disheartened as it had only 2 pc of chicken..
A must visit i must say..heavy on ur pockets..but still recommended ..

a very old style seating stricture 

the music of 18th-century era 

one of the top class background 

dim lighting made oudh1590 really romantic 

 the waiters could have dressed like the old style as well

the biryani is not soo impressive still the place steals the show  right after entering

2nd visit to this wonderful place! This time with family.

I felt that the service has gone downhill, the staff being arrogant and indifferent at times. The courteousness was also missing. I asked for paper tissues to which the waiter said "Please use the cloth ones on the table"! I asked whether they have paper tissues or not, to which he said "We have them". When I asked him to get them, he made a face and walked away mumbling to himself.
We asked the same waiter to serve the Tandoori Roti with butter and he refused. Fyi, all good restaurants do so. Even if they do not use butter normally, they oblige if the guests request.

Coming to the food part, we ordered:

Gulaab Sharbaat - A fizzy rose flavored drink. Refreshing.

Badam Sharbaat - Thick consistency, tasted great. We re ordered it, the 2nd one however lacked the thickness and was watery.

Sugandhi Kabab : Soft, juicy and melted in the mouth. Tasted goid, however the "gondhoraj' flavor was missing.

Kakori Kabab : Cooked to a tee! Delicious!

Galawati Kabab with Lucknowi Paratha : Do not miss this mouth watering, fingerlicking combo. A must order!

Tandoori Chicken : I've had better. Nevertheless, it was good.

Tandoori Roti & Butter Naan : Both were average.

Raan Biriyani : A shout out for this amazing dish. The best biriyani I've had so far! Loved it!

Murgh Irani : Chicken pieces were tender and juicy. Gravy tasted good.

Gosht Shahi Qorma : Tasted great. Awesome preparation.

Phirni : Perfect ending. Too good!

Portion: Good.

Price: Okay.

Recommended!

I have been there several times. But tonight the waiter misguided me while ordering. I felt as if the quality of service has come down over the years. It looked like the waiter wanted to sell a costly dish, even if it was more than sufficient for 3 adults and a child. I also had to pack the food at my cost. These are the signs of deterioration that affects the reputation of food joints. I have also complained to the manager who was polite and gave a patient hearing. But I wanted all customers to be very careful about what these guys suggest. Probably I made the mistake of not asking the price of the dish as it would have given me a fair idea of the size of the dish.Hope you don't make the same mistake..

This was my first visit to Oudh 1590 for a family dinner. The visit was worth remembering for various reasons. There was no hassle in locating the restaurant. I like their hospitality which was very friendly and caring. The way they welcomed us, then suggesting which food to go for till the security man's respectable job to come towards our car and closing the door. The ambience inside is well decorated. It has an aroma of Mughal Theme everywhere with a blending of Modern Design. For a second, we didn't felt uncomfortable with anything. Coming to dish we ordered. It was very much well presented and their famous Awadhi Biriwani. We also have ordered Irani chicken Kasa as per their suggestion which turned to be of great combination. We later ordered Kulfi and Firni as Dessert. Thank you for the warm and hearty experience. We would love to come here.

Ah! One of the richest gastronomical experience in calcutta. The aura of this place transports you into the mughal era. Right from the architecture, to the paintings and lighting and eventually those quintessential ghazals. You feel like mughal in a nawabi court. Coming to the food. The food is as grandeur as that of the place. Delicate, sensuous rhythmic dancing on your palate. The sugandhi kebabs was lajabab and the moti biriyani was bemisaal. The food satiets your hunger and fulfills your soul. One full plate is enough for 2 people. The lingering taste of the gondhoraj lebu essence in the kebab was excellent. Coming to the biriyani, the minced mutton meatballs were great. But the surprise element is the sweet aftertaste in some places. Their idea of serving the complementaries in a box seals the deal. Another bonus point for the gentleman with the royal moustache, guarding the entrance. Though the long queue and 1hr wait was a downside but still they made it up for the experience. I will be back to try out your signature dishes.

I visited this place for 2-4 times.
Food is just outstanding. But sometime their service disappointed me. When I firsf time visited this place they were in hurry to collect the plates and were also hurry to clean the table. I didnot find the reason behind it. There was no crowd outside the restaurent. Very much disappointing.
Now come to their food.... I tried their famous galauti kebab. Mouth watering.
The run biriyani is mindblowing. Evry bite has meat.
Then their Niharikhas.... WOW!!!!
If i can rate their service separately then i will give them only 2 out of 5.
And food is 5 out of 5.

I am a "jabra" fan of Awadhi cuisine. And Oudh 1590 is the best place to satiate my insatiable quench for Awadhi food. I opted for take away from Deshapriya Park's Oudh 1590. I called them 1 hour before and told my order: kakori kebab, galoti kebab and moti biriyani. I reached a bit early, but my order was ready. Their packaging is impeccable and so meticulous that there was no spillage. The kakori kebab was as usual mindblowing. The moti biriyani was piping hot and excellent. The galoti kebabs were too soft, the meat simply melted in my mouth. For all Awadhi food lovers, Oudh 1590 is a highly recommended place.

I had been here on Jan 18, 2017 at 8pm with my family. I had to wait for 30 minutes outside the Restaurant vicinity as it was too crowded. The ambience inside the Restaurant is awesome & perfect. They play the Lucknowi Gazals & famous Thumri. I ordered for Awadhi Handi Biriyani(FULL), Galawati Kabab(MUTTON), Kakori Kabab(MUTTON), Lucknowi Paratha, Murgh Biriyani(HALF). I am not a food critic but I have some common sense. Firstly, the basic difference between their different Biriyani is number of Potatoes, Mutton/Chicken pieces & Egg. For preparation of Biriyani a special long rice is needed which was missing. There was no taste of Biriyani, it lacked the specific spices needed to make it Biriyani. It was like yellow coloured Fried rice with Mutton & Egg. Secondly, the Paratha cooked at my home is much more thick & it contains layers but their Lucknowi Paratha is just a white thin paper with not even a single layer. In their food menu card they claim that, "Lucknowi Paratha is a LAYERED BREAD cooked on reverse tawa". I found absolutely no difference between a Rumali Roti & Lucknowi Paratha. I don't want to comment anything about the Kababs as it was not bad but it was not upto the mark. Overall I had a terrible experience. I think they have lost their food quality due to the over crowding . The Restaurant needs serious improvement in food quality. The quality of food they are providing isn't worth the amount they are charging.

What can i say....it was awesome. Went with my wife on a special occasion and it was totally worth. We ordered Galawati Kebab which is their Signature Dish. Then on main course had Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Murgh Irani.

Galawati Kebab: Not one bit exaggerated from what i have heard about their Signature Dish. To visit there and not trying it is a sin.
Awadhi Handi Biriyani: One of the best Biriyani's you will find in Kolkata if not best.
Murgh Irani: Very good

Price is on a higher side but totally worth. Only drawback is we had to wait for almost 1.5 hour before we got a table.

Oudh 1590 is situated at Desapriya Park, Kolkata, which serves authentic Mughlai & Awadhi dishes.

Ambience is nawabi kind of with lavish decor coupled with old gharana background music. Staffs were cladded in traditional avatar and were well behaved.

Service is bit slow.

Tried Raan biriyani , mutton roganjosh & phirni. Biriyani was awesome with perfect balance of aroma & flavour, well cooked , meat pieces were tender. Roganjosh was awesome too, rich & lip smacking . Phirni was enjoyable and was creamy and yummy.

Pocket pinch is bit high but quality wise it is adjusted.

A must visit place.

The interior decorating n the theme of the restaurant was really awesome. They took the awadhi theme too seriously of course 😂😂😂
Now lets come to the food... we ordered mutton galawati kabab for the starter, and it was absolutely delicious, its a must try.
Then in the main course we ordered mutton rogan gosh and raan biriyani. The rogan gosh was a good or rather average but the biriyani was a way too spicy and was average. 
The staffs are very polite and caring.

What an ambience with thumri playing in the background! Waiters wearing perfect kurta and food spread in nawabi style. It's like being treated in a mughal gharana!
Plunge in the galawati kebabs along with salaan and the biriyanis.
Lastly the mouth freshener box is another attraction!

On my dad's birthday we decided to treat him the Nawab way, and hence landed up at Oudh 1590. The decor, ambience and music instantly transport you to the royal era. 

This time we opted for the much talked about Galawati kebab who is totally worth all the hype. It was a smasher with its crispy outside and melt-in-the-mouth  spicy meat inside. The mouthful of kebab with the accompanying dip and onions is to die for. Coming to the main course, the Rann biriyani was delicious, the mutton was well cooked and falling off the bone. It has shredded mutton, but no eggs or potatoes  and one doesn't miss them either. However, there was a slight glitch which I am coming to later on. Murgh Irani was a good dish to go with the tandoori rotis we ordered. We finished the meal with Kulfi faluda which tasted like how kulfis should taste. 

Now for the glitch..Unfortunately, I found something unpleasant on my plate (the meat wasn't cleaned properly) midway through the meal. On drawing the staff's attention to it, they promptly apologised and replaced some of the food on the plate. I hope they will take better care of such things in the future.

All in all, it was a satisfying meal and an evening really well spent. Will visit again!

This place needs no introduction. Biriyani tastes too good. Ambience, interiors, and the background music will take you to the mughal era. Galouti kebabs are simply mouth watering.  As this place is always crowded you have to wait at least half an hour to get a table. But the food is worth waiting.

I heard a lot about this place and finally decided to check it out with a friend. The food was decent (slightly overrated). We had rann biriyani and qalmi kebab. The quantity was adequate and the green chutney they provided with the biriyani exceeded expectations. 
However, the service provided shocked us. They were in extreme hurry to shut down (we went in the afternoon) and literally threw the bill at us while we were still eating. They would remove the plates the moment we would finish and insisted on serving despite us repeatedly telling them to quit it. They kept interrupting us.
I don't know why the staff would behave this way with customers and hope the management will account for it. 
Here's hoping.

Wanted to try this place since a long time. Today ordered lunch from this place. So my review is going to be based on solely the quality and taste of food.
Packaging -5/5
I had ordered lucknowi paratha, tandoori roti, murgh Irani. The paratha was tasty and had the typical Lucknow flavour. Liked it a lot. The tandoori roti was made of whole wheat which is a really nice and new concept in Kolkata. The last thing was murgh Irani which had a disastrous taste. It had two pieces of chicken in it . But the gravy tasted like chawan prash!!! There was no balance of flavours I the gravy! 
All these came for 385 bucks.

Oudh 1590 comes with its unique identity. Traditional  Awadhi dishes served here. Raan biryani and galawati kebabs are awesome. I tried galawati kebabs some other places but I must say this one is the best. The paratha they served with the kebab makes it even better. But its a small place and  always crowded. We have to wait more than an hour but its worth it. A must try place in the City of Joy.

Oudh has created a name of its own in Kolkata. Truly a hidden gem , located just beside Carmel primary highschool in desapriya park . One will get a royal feel getting there. Dim lighting adding more elegance to the ambience. 
Now getting to the food , we were a group of six and opted for their signature galawti kabab and zafrani kabab. Galawti kabab was as subtle as it should be , truly a delight . They suggested us to try locknowi paratha along with galawti kabab and the whole combination was truly breathtaking . Zafrani kabab was equally good , tender pieces . For main course we ordered raan biriyani , awadhi handi biriyani , butter naan and murgh iraani . Each of it was an eye-catcher , but definitely raan biriyani stole the show . Shredded mutton pieces within the biriyani packed within an earthen pot was good beyond imagination . An overall very nice experience and the staffs were really nice. Will definitely visit again.

It's pathetically slow service restaurant. Oudh has gained its fame for its nawabi cuisine but the staffs are too reluctant to serve the food or water. We had ordered for sugandhi chicken kebab they did a mistake and served us the parathha. We don't know that the paratha is only served with galawti kebab. So we started our meal all of a sudden one of the staff came and took away the bowl where the parathas were. Dint apologize for their mistake and without seeking permission or without prior conversation they just took it away. Its so awkward and embarrassing.

Took a home delivery of Raan Biriyani last night. Nothing such special about it. Tested little better than other normal biriyanies. Taste - Quality & quantity doesn't match with the price (Rs 472).
They have shown in the picture the biriyani is coming with eggs but there was NO egg in my one which was surprising to me.
Over all its good. Nothing Great. Overpriced.

Well I must say that I heard of them a lot and today tried their biriyani. It was really authentic and very good. The best part that satisfied me is that the biriyani was not so oily and indeed the meat was really soft which most of the biriyani joints fail to serve. It comes without the potato but beleive me one will not regret if they have tasted Royal's biriyani which also comes without potato. Along with the biriyani I did taste the chicken chaap which also has a different taste than the usual chaap.

Extremely long waiting. At 11 pm at night we are still waiting outside.Though they said they can provide table in 40 mins.
They give preference to bigger teams than smaller one.
11:10=-finally we are in.

Awesome Biriyani. We tried the Awadhi Handi Biriyani. The best thing about this Biriyani is it's less oily unlike other popular biriayni available in Kolkata which causes no discomfort. I also liked the Zafrani Kabab. However the highly recommended Galwati kabab I found to be quite pedestrian. 
Ambience is quite good and service is decent.

Keep up the good work Oudh.

Located at desapriya park. What a great ambience and food. We ordered raan biriyani and galawti kebabs and paratha. Galawti kebab was super yaaam.. 1 Raan biriyani for two is perfect. 2 pc mutton , 2 eggs were there in Raan Biriyani. Ambience was super. Atlast we ordered for Phirni. That was wow.. well i can say must visit to oudh 1590.

located just beside carmel primary school, it is indeed a gem for biriyani lovers.
Starting from the ambiance to the mouthwatering kababs and biriyani ..all is a perfect combination of elegance, royalness and delicious food.
We were the first customer to enter the restaurant today. The decorations are beautiful.
The food included Afghani chicken kababs and a huge handi awadhi biriyani. It contained two eggs along with two mutton pieces.
the service is good and polite. the whole restaurant is themed to give u a lucknow nawabi feel including the workers there,who are dressed in black pathan suits probably.
We were a bit upset with the absense of potatoes in biriyani..but as we dug in to the food, all complaints were gone by the richness of its taste.
Definitely a must visit soon.

My family and I visited this place on Christmas day..Expecting the rush we became the Early Birds and were there by 12:30..Fortunately we didn't have to wait in queue.. It was a nice place to be... The theme,ambience, music carried historical Lucknow culture..The Royalty really captivated my mind..Starting from kebabs, biriyani to pan masala bore a mughal touch..Foods were too delicious especially fish mahi kaliya...We visited the deshapriya branch and just felt little congested for 8 of Us..They made us to manage in 6 seater by providing 2 extra chairs...Besides,everything else(behavior of the staffs,quality and quantity of the food) is worthy to be appreciated..

Gist : Must visit for its signature awadhi biriyani, price justifies the quality & quantity.

I visited this place on 07.05.16 around 11.45AM as some days before left a long queue to get an entry. Happy to see that the place opens before time. The place is well decorated with bit dim lighting. Place is big with a seating capacity around 20-30 person with a spacious washroom. Staffs are cordial. Ordered Awadhi Handi Biriyani (half), Galawati Kabab, Aam Sharbat, Aam khaas. They do take a bit longer time to serve than other branded biriyani joints. Awadhi handi biriyani was in great quantity (half biriyani can be shared by 2), tasted bit spicy but too great to describe. Galawati kabab looked like mutton chop to me and tasted okay. Aam sharbat & aam khaas was good but not great. Worth a revisit with booking.

Note : Lighting at table is bit dim, so small pieces of bones are tough to tackle. So either they should give more lights focusing the table or serve boneless items only.

Had gone there a day before Christmas. We had to wait for almost an hour to get a table for two. Because it was close to 3:30, they were almost in a rush to close the restaurant for their break. They made us eat in hurry. The food served also felt like leftovers as it was time to close the kitchen. Whatever the reason be, when you have accepted customers to take a table to eat, the food and service quality should be maintained. Little dissapointing.

Had heard highly of this place, so on a visit to Calcutta decided to try it out. The waiters were quite courteous and the service was good, in addition we had to wait for just a couple of minutes (on a Sunday evening) to get a table, unlike some of the review posted on Zomato. We ordered the Mutton Galawati Kabab and Shahi Dahi Kabab. In agreement with most of the reviews, the Galawati Kabab was delectable. The dahi kabab was an absolute disappointment and tasted nothing like it's supposed to. Both the kababs were served cold. For the mains, we ordered Awadhi Handi Biryani and Murgh Biryani. I quite liked the Awadhi biryani; there was nothing great about the Murgh biryani. Most the biryanis were served only medium warm, which the waiter took care of promptly. For dessert we ordered the Shahi Tukda and Firni, which were fine. Overall- Food 3/5, Service- 4.5/5, Ambiance- 4.5/5. And yes, the place didn't live upto my expectations. Inconsistency, maybe? And yes, the washroom is sort of inside the kitchen area, which I didn't find to be all that hygienic! :/

Went to this place after a lot of recommendations. Food was good no doubt but not one of the best in town. Seating was quite clumsy making the place noisy. The staff needs to improve their behavior. They put the bill on our table even before we touched our last dish. I thought they were expecting us to leave with the firni in our hands. I am not going back for sure.

The way this restaurant garnered popularity in such a short span, that's enough to tell u that this is the place to be. It is located at a quiet corner opposite to Carmel primary school. The elevation looks grand.

The moment you set foot inside you will be transcended to Mughal era. Every furniture, wallpaper, paintings,chandeliers, utensils even the air conditions are thematically designed and Colored. But the restaurant is small for such grand theme. You will need to jostle your way through the aisle between tables. The service is extremely cordial.

Now about the food. We ordered gaalauti kebab, rann biriyani, awadhi biriyani, chicken Irani, rezala, firni etc. The quality was awesome. Both chicken & mutton preparations were equally tasty but distinct in taste. Food presentation exuded a 16th century vibe just like the whole place. The ambiance is royal.

Pros:
1. Royal ambiance.
2. Awesome Food quality.
3. Cordial stuff.
4. Location. Cars can be parked on road without any hassle.

Cons:
1. Space constraint.
2. Price is at the higher side.

It is situated near Desapriya park, serves authentic Mughlai dish , they cook biriyani in completely traditional style.
Interior and ambience is realy good and grandeur , feel like Mughlai era, sitting arrangements were good.
From their vast menu, we selected Shammi kebab as starter , which was delectable, finely minced mutton with herbs, spices and soft taste made our day.
We took Aam khaas and badam shabbat as thirst quencher. Badam sharbat was ok  and common, but aam khaas was good, with a sweet and sour taste, added with spices, it was awesome.
For main course , we selected. Raan biriyani, encased in an earthen pot, was true Awadh delicacy, beautiful aroma with tender meat was just awesome, quantity was sufficient too.
Gosht kundan kaliya was awesome, distinct flavour, smooth taste, would definately satisfy your soul.
The combination of Raan biriyani and gosht kundan kaliya is deadly. A must try .
For dessert, we had Sahi tukra, which looked gorgeous and was enjoyable too.
Very nice experience indeed.

One of the best places for Biriyani and Lucknow cuisine...The raan  Biriyani they serve is just out of the world..You take a bite from the Chicken piece and it melts like butter..And I felt that the food is cooked with less amount of oil and thats a plus point which made the food more tasty.I ordered chicken raan Biriyani,ghost ragan Josh,shahi tangri kabab..The mutton pieces felt like full of juice and the taste was just yummmmm.Taste of the kabab was unique.
One thing I want to mention is that you don't just eat here,you will actually feel the great taste in every bite.
The ambience of the restaurant will make you feel like you are in a palace and having the meal like a king,😎
I strongly recommend this place for a perfect dine-out,date and get together.The amount of Biriyani they serve in a miniature handi is sufficient for two people.
Wish to visit there soon.

We had Qualmi kabab and Raan Biriyani ..
Qualmi kabab-The chicken legs roasted with nawabi spices  ... It was prefectly cooked ..When you give the first bite to the kabab it will melt in your mouth and you will be on the other world 😛 ..( highly recommended)
Coming to Rann Biriyani , it taste unique, from the regural biriyani .. The amount is sufficient for 3 people .. 
I will definitely visit it again n again :)

4 of us went to this pretty popular elegantly designed restaurant to give our tastebuds the pleasure of awadhi cuisine. We were pretty comfortably seated and the first thing we had wasgalawti kabab. Not the best I have had. It was too spicy to enjoy. But the fish item sugandhi mahi kebab turned out to be the show stealer. Soft, succulent with a tender gondhoraj flavour, it surpassed the gosht biryani and the nihari which we had in the main course. Overall a rich experience and the service was prompt. A meat lover's heaven!

If you are craving for some real authentic awadhi cuisine, want to travel back to the galis of Lucknow to taste the kababs, this is the place for you. The taste of the kakori kabab lasts in your mind for a long time.The Mahi Awadhi Sugandhi has the perfect blend of spices and Bengali Gandhoraj lebu.
In the main course I had Awadhi Biriyani which has a distinguishable taste from its counterparts. The chicken Rejala with its creamy texture melts down to your stomach. And I would definitely mention about the Pineapple Raita which soothes your taste bud in its own flavour.
Ambience takes you through the lanes of history coupled with the ghazals played in the background.
A must visit.

Friendly waiters with a great atmosphere and milad lights that makes You think like a rajpothe Prince himself. Specialities are in the app and You should check these thinks. Can't rate the desert though cause when we been there we can arrange to order only the "Firni" . So can't say if others are same good as this one or not. 
Till then I should say if u r a foodie then You should visit this place .

Honestly I had been dying to write the review  of this place. 
First thing first I had been very curious  to go to this place because  of its Lucknowi nawabi andaz and i must accept I had not been dissapointed  a bit. 
The place looks so Lucknowi from outside that as soon as I saw this place from far I was excited  to go inside. 
We had as suggested Gandhraaj kebab and Handi Biriyani.
Ambience was beautiful  and soothing with Rekha  Bharadraj songs at the background. 
Service was a little slow  where it lost my rating. 
Very Spacious. 
Even the Darwaan looks so interesting  that you must look at him  when you enter :p
It is moderately  costly and if you spend wisely it won't burn a hole in your pocket! 
If I am not the last person in Zomato who had visited  the place  recently  and if you are still thinking whether  to go or not it's a thumbs up from my side. 
I am definite to visit this place again!

I visited this place for the 1st time for my brother-in-law's aiburobaad. We ordered Galoti kabab, Kakori kabab and Aiwadi biryani. We loved the Galoti kabab; it was soft and juicy. However, the Kakori kabab was over -cooked and not so soft, when I compare it to its Delhi counterpart. And the biryani was very bland; no spices and hardly any smell. Moreover the place is cramped and quite congested. People in the next table can clearly hear what you're saying. The decor is good and the music was classical. I feel the place is over-hyped and too expensive.

I am a big biriyani lover  and ordered moti biriyani( it was the first time i had moti biriyani ). Amazing awadhi  taste and full of soft meet balls made it a delight. Also must mention the gosht rezala. they make brilliant food. and the overall experience is unforgetable. To the the treat had firni and also it was fresh n mouth watering.

Determined to not have biryani,I placed my foot on a place which is famous for biryani. Irony of life. This review is a little bit late because I was there at poila boishak(14th April of this year). For starters we had Shammi kabab then for main course I had tandoori roti and trust me I have no regrets for not having biryani. For side dish I had Murgh Irani  and my companion had Mutton Roghan Josh ,very fulfilling and satisfied. The warm ambience was enough to pay another visit.

After a long planing. I visited this outlet my last experience was not good in oudh 1590 (salt lake) but this time i was again disappointed. Restaurant theme is influenced by lucknow's palace. Ambience is good..  But is the food price justify its quality? In my experience no it don't. The price are heigh compared to quality..  And one of the biggest downside is quantity.  Galawti kebab comes with 4 portion in a plate but if you have galwti kebab we are half done..  And handi biryani is more for any two average indian but it is less for three. Menu is so confusing and until and unless its a group you can't justify pricing. For a couple they have to waste food. My only suggestion please reduce portion or split portion size and please reduce pricing. 
Now come to food. Galuti kebab is little spicy and hot. Nargis kofta is also spicy and hot. Now the biryani may be its my bad luck i just receive pics with less flesh and huge bone so i didn't enjoy the biryani ether. May be i will not visit this place again.

An absolute gem of a place this is.

Located in the lane next to Banana Leaf near Lake Mall.
The two of us went for lunch here. We were blown away by the ambience. The moment, the person at the main door greets you, you're really treated like a nawab.
Like a royalty, they help you in plates and glasses of bronze. A soothing music goes on in the background.

The food that we had:
Murgh Biryani- this comes with a complementary raita. The quantity I found was a bit less. Other than that two pieces of chicken and a melt-in-your-mouth potato. When it comes to Biryani, I cannot manage without the aloo.
Murgh Irani- absolutely delicious!
Shahi Tukda- not a huge fan of it, but I liked it here.
Even the raita was great.

Prices: not very reasonable though. But worth every penny spent.. They just take the 14.5% vat and 6% tax extra to the bill. 
Take my suggestion, you'll have a great time there. In love with Oudh. Can't wait to return back for the kebabs this time.

Very disappointing experience. The Awadhi mutton biryani was only ghee rice with 2 small pieces of mutton and two boiled eggs. The mutton was tough, and mainly bone. The gajar ka halwa was little more than grated carrot boiled in sugared water, with some raisins and cashew added. The decor is obtrusively heavy, and not reminiscent of Lucknow. Service is mediocre. Overall, not an experience to be repeated. Your local takeaway might be a wiser choice, tastewise and walletwise.

Well you are in for a royal treat. Lavish interior, along with courteous staff and accompanying music sets the mood for Nawabi style dining. We ordered awadhi biriyani but to our disappointment the food was not so great.

Looking for a nawabi dinner in Kolkata? Look no further. Oudh 1590 is probably the perfect place for anybody who is looking for a royal dine-out experience.
This place is a little off-course from your main Rashbehari Road. Oudh is located somewhere very near to Lake Mall. Seeking help from Google Maps is probably the wisest decision once you reach the above mentioned landmark.
Food is delicious. No complaints regarding anything in that area. Well, maybe except for this one tiny thing. But let's go to that later.
The ambiance of this restaurant is A1. The carefully selected decor, the adornments and the accents in the restaurant, the old classical music- everything is just impeccable.
We ordered their Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Murgh Irani. Every bite of the latter dish was delectable. The former item however had its meat dry. Although I loved the taste of their very flavorful Biriyani, the dryness of the meat did leave me a bit disappointed. However the service provided by the staff more than made up for that one defect. A four out of five!

We went to this restaurant on last Saturday as one of our friends thrown b-day party there... its near desapriya park, location wise it wasn't hard to find by... it was mostly my choice to go for oudh as I had already been here twice & my mouth was drooling for Galawtis... but my utmost desire went into vain when the galawtis were overcooked & the taste was terribly bitter... we had ordered 5plates of galawti kebab accompanied with qalmi kebabs, one fish item... didn't expect we were going to have such awful experience in galawti... Anyways moving forward we ordered raan biriyani,  murg handi biriyani, parantha & nihari kash... biriyani was upto the mark as always & nihari kash too... that's the only dish I found awesome... going further we ordered firni & sahi tukra... both were tasty & yummy... but definitely I'll think twice before gorging onto galawtis at oudh...

Visited the desapriya park outlet with my family last Friday. This is a fine place for trying authentic Mughal cuisine. The ambience is very nice. Looks like we are inside a palace 😅. We ordered Murgh Biryani, Seekh Kabab, Butter Naan and Paneer Qorma. All of them were lovely and mouth watering. For desserts we had Kulfi Falooda and Phirnee. They were lovely as well.

Oudh 1590, Authentic Period Dining experience is never so good before it. The Ambience, decor and music perfectly creates a glimpse of the Mughal era in a good way. Now comes the food, Tastes good served in period style manner. Quantity is excellent. Best Awadhi delicacy with Awadhi flavor.
Must try: any Awadhi variants of Biriyani, and Kababs.

I have heard of good reviews of this place.
So finally visited this one evening.
Asked for a high chair as I was visiting with my 2yr old. My bad, Mughals never used high chairs and hence they did not carry one.
I had expected a much better ambiance..
Next came the menu; food was ok in taste.
My road side shop sells better tasting biriyani than this place.. The price was definitely high..
A paratha for 60!! 
Over all experience- would never come back.👎🏻

And finally Oudh 1590. From the Pathan Pehredaars wearing surma, wooden worked furniture, mughal court paintings is more than enough to make you feel like you kust entered Akbar's court. The music played perfectly suited the ambience. We had awadhi gosht biryani, nehari khaas, murgh irani and firni. Full marks for authentic period dining, quality of food beyond excellent, amazing decor and staffs overtly courteous.

Went here on Thursday with great expectations based on Zomato reviews. From service to food everything was terrible. The galauti Kabab's are the worse I ever had. So was the chicken dish which was supposed to have gondhoraj undertones. It was disgusting. All the breads and kababs came out cold..I sent it back and it was just reheated and reserved. The biriyani mutton was very chewy.... the music was way too loud and the staff were busy chatting instead of doing their job... will never go back to this place ever again...and last but not least, the presentation ... I can do a better job garnishing the food than Oudh.... there was nothing appealing about either Kabab's....

Starting from the ambience to the food... 
Everything deserve an appreciation.
Those beautiful walls, that perfect dim light ambience, everything add a special taste to the food.
Coming to the dishes, the ones you must try there are : galawti kababs(pure mutton), moti biriyani (having kofta type meat balls) and murgh-irani(one of the best dish).
Quantity wise one bowl of biriyani serves more than two people. 
Quality being superb, with that same essence of mughal biriyani. 
A good place to dine with family/friends.
Cost is around Rs600 per people.

The restaurant is well known for their Galauti Kebabs and surely enough I was not disappointed. The melt in the mouth kebabs were out of this world. Since I visited during the Durga Puja time there was a long waiting. But it's worth mentioning that keeping that in mind there was a nice waiting area with ceiling fans for the customers just outside the restaurant. Must thank the owners for that.
The Awadhi Handi Biryani was good but found the mutton rezala too thick for my liking. The taste was also nothing to write home about.
The overall experience even on the Puja day was very good. The staff were very courteous and the decor was awesome. Best part of the ambience was Farida Khanum playing Lathe Di Chadar in the background & enhancing the festive mood.

Went to Oudh 1590 today. The ambience was  soothing and great. The interior decor is perfect for their mughal theme. We ordered qalmi kabab and galawati kabab for starters, awadhi handi biriyani, chicken irani, chicken kasha, bhuna gosht for main course. Butter nun and keema paratha were also taken. For deserts we had shahi tukda, kulfi and phirni. The food was very tasty and the overall experience was great. Shahi tukda is a must try.

Located in one of the many alleys of Deshapriya park,Oudh 1590 recreates a beautiful ambience of the gone Mughal days.The decor with its dim light,hanging chandeliers, long mirrors and classical ghazals adds to the uniqueness of the place.
The ocassion being the birthday treat of 3dear friends,the place was reserved and thus we didn't had to wait.
We started off with the Galawati kabab and Qalmi kabab.The Galawati kabab was too good with small tender chunks of mutton stuffed in ball shaped kababs cooked to the right extent.The Qalmi kabab was chicken leg pieces roasted in creamy sauce which was tender.In the main course we had Handi biriyani along with Murgh Irani and Gosht Shahi korma.Maybe I had a big higher expectations but the biriyani I felt was good,not excellent as it lacked the particular rich biriyani aroma and the aloo-Biriyani without aloo is just not the right.Although these negativities were sidelined by the fact that it served 2pieces of mutton n egg and the quantity-easily for 2normal people. The Murgh Irani was chicken in a rich gravy and the Gosht Shahi korma was 4pieces of mutton in a rich gravy.
We ended up with the famous ShahiTukra,classical firni and Kulfi.
Overall a great dining experience and a must visit fir biriyani lovers!
Happy Dining!!
Nomnom!!

Sharing my first experience. First of all the ambience  in one word is awesome. All the waiters maintain a similar awadhi dress code and gonna serve you warmly. Coming to the food part I only ordered Murgh Biriyani. But become a little dissapointed. First of all the quantity. The plate cost ₹270 and finally with tax ₹330 having two piece chicken and one potato. But the quantity of rice is such that it can only be taken as a snack.For food lover and food hungry people like me, it will occupy only a small corner of your stomach. The taste was not soo mouth watering.Taste of Arsalan and Royal India is better than this. And the biriyani is more of Hyadrabadi style, little spicy. The chicken pieces was very very tendered and you can easily torn the entire piece by fork and spoon. As mentioned I only taste the murgh biriyani and nothing else. But the most interesting thing after 15 mins I never felt that I had ate a plate of biriyani at a cost of ₹330. No problem in getting digested :D ..By the way the still waited to try their kababs and tandoor..!!

Though you might not get the exact mouth watering flavors of lucknow. Great fro biriyanis and kebabs. But be careful about trying fish dishes. As they may disappoint you a bit. One must try Handi raan biriyani and Kakori/ Galouti kebabs .
 Nihari Khash was awesome in taste.

Interior and ambiance : 9/10

Better to go with time in hand as you have to wait for a while to avail seat.

The Slow background Gazal  was fully changed the atmosphere.

The desert Firni was delicious.

This was the third time I visited Oudh 1590,we friends had a preplanned lunch.The ambience of this place exudes royalty and so does the dishes 😄.
We ordered galouti kebab,kakori kebab,moti biriyani and nargisi kofta.
Galouti kebab was a perfect blend in mouth kebab with a unique smoky flavour,Kakori kebab was also very good and a tad bit spicier than Galouti kebab.Moti biriyani was very spicey and very good,served in handis,each handi containing six motis (meatballs) and rich enough to be shared by two.Nargisi kofta was very unique and heavy too.. with thick spicy gravy and eggs with keema coating..
Service was quick and prompt.
Overall a cherishable experience. 😊

The quality of food has gone down. I ordered home delivery. The gulawti kebabs were soaked sour in vinegar and the accompanying onions were rotten. Had to throw them away. The chicken kebabs were good. The biriyani was above average, nothing much to write home about. The mutton pieces were alright. I have had food here 3 years back, the quality was much better then.

The biriyani was full of ghee which was bit annoying.  But the kababs are really yummy, specially the gulawati kabab.

Very interesting theme of mughal darbar...the decor and background thumri and gazal would definitely make you feel like a nabab too. Coming to food the aura of nababi kebabs and biriyani would definitely stimulate your taste bud. I personally like the awadhi handi biriyani but am being unfortunate I never got a good portion of mutton in the biriyani.

27/10/2016: I opted for a takeaway at Oudh. Ordered an Awadhi Handi biryani and Murgh Irani. Its one of the best biryani I have tried. The mutton pieces were cooked to perfection, the rice was long grained aromatic and was really savoury. Coming to the chicken dish, I have never tasted a better gravy than this. It takes the cake as the best gravy/chicken dish I have tried. The quantity was satisfying as well, a full handi biryani is enough for two people easily. (Unless you are really hungry...)

The restaurant should probably do a better job of advertising the working hours. Reached at 1215 today and found a "Closed" sign. Upon calling we were advised that it was too early and the kitchen was just setting up; any time after 1230 would probably be a good one. So, a nice walk-about later, reached around 1300. Was shown to a table. A quick word about the decor - the light is a drastic contrast from the sunlit exteriors and it took a while to get accustomed to the heavy wood and mood lightning. Happily enough, they provide a small torchlight to use while reading the menu. In recent times I've noticed that the restaurants at Kolkata tend to hand over a single menu to one member of a party - very intriguing as to why they wouldn't want both parties to have a menu at hand.

Anyway, we started off with Murgh Sugandhi Kebab and Galouti Kebab. Soda Sikanji and Aam Panna were ordered. The Awadhi Handi Biryani was to be the mains. The "sugandhi" kebab was a bit of a let down. I expected a better blend of a fragrance of 'gondhoraj' along with the base of white meat. The kebab has a somewhat paste-dough texture and a remarkably faint whisper of gondhoraj. The Galouti was well charred, but also was heavy handed with the after bite of clove. That often kills the melt-in-mouth texture that a well done Galouti has. I would also state that the 'onion' salad isn't a good companion to the chicken - it has a taste that is contrary to the one being attempted with the lime and shouldn't be paired at all.

The biryani was a generous portion - has 2 eggs. The cuts of meat are a disappointment. Seemed a bit away from the traditional pieces one expects in a biryani. The presentation is a good one and it does keep reasonably warm through the meal.

I would not recommend either of the starters. The biryani I would, but pair it with something which provides a bit of contrast - there is enough of biryani in the haandi to make it a monotonous taste.

A quick note about the staff - my seat was a convenient back-rest for various members of the staff as it was near the desk at the gate. It is an awkward experience to have the back-rest go thump, thump every now and then as a staff member is excitedly participating in banter across the length of the restaurant. Do avoid that table (first 4 seater on the right) as it will also catch slivers of daylight each time the door to the restaurant is opened . Also, I never did figure out why the staff member serving the chicken kebab decided to upturn the entire onion salad 'on' my dish with the kebabs thus killing any taste with the sour after-taste of onions. I didn't ask for salad and neither was I asked for my preference. Just a quick dunking of "here's the salad" to a aghast looking me.

The restaurant is obviously popular, when we made our exit, there was a good group of folks waiting to be seated. I wouldn't quite say that it was a value-for-money experience. I've had better servings of similar food.

Great great food, with very delicate and real flavours.
What was disappointing was its service. The issue wasn't with the food arrival time but with the attitude of the servers. They seemed in a big hurry, just plonking the food on the table, and going away before we finished our sentences. Found it quite annoying. Minus one point for this strange behaviour.

Loved the beautiful ambience and mute lighting. 

I hope to have a better overall experience the next time I visit here.

Nawabi lunch on Diwali ..Superb! the restaurant is themed in nawabi style . The ambience was just perfect with beautiful gazals being played in the background and the staffs were also dressed alike.
The whole cuisine was excellent, each item was finger licking.
We took two drinks badam sarbat and aam khaas and it was the most unique aam panna I have ever had. Then in kebabs we took zafrani chicken kebab and kakori kebab. Then we had rann biriyani and ghost shahi quorma. The shahi quorma won my heart and the show stopper was the biriyani. At last we took phirni and everybody should keep an extra place in their stomach for the dessert . can't wait to go there again and try the other dishes .

Updates!!! Again love for mughlai dishes and biriyani cravings took me here today.  
Starting with Zafrani chicken kebab, galwati kebab with lucknow paratha , having a blast with rann biriyani  (yes again!!!) and murgh irani , I satisfiedu myself!  Each and every dish was beyond perfect as always.  
Zafrani chicken was so soft, the paratha was too good perfectly paired with heavenly galwati kebab. Murgh irani , suggested by them and ranna biriyani were divine!!! 
Will come again and again!

Diwali dinner in Nawabi style - Oudh 1590.a long que made us more hungry,when we entered,it was like a set of Mughleazam/Jodha-Akbar, grt wood work,dim lights,beautiful gazals,10 on 10 on the ambiance.now the food- started with  nibmu sikanji and shammi kabab,it was good,served with masala mixed salad that was really good and three types of chutni or achar,loved the pudina chutni.then we dive into the Awadhi biriyani-served in a beautiful handi,mutton nihari,the biriyani was really nice,but the mutton was better.it was so good with two nalli pieces, I was so full with those,but my husband wanted a dessert, so we ordered the shahi tukra,it was nice but a bit dry,I like the more milky version of the shahi tukra,the food was really good but I liked the ambiance more than the food honestly. Looking forward to visit again to try other nawabi foods and the nawabi mood again.

People of Kolkata always have had it tough when making a choice for Biriyani outlets. While Arsalan or Aminia have carved names for themselves for their rich, spicy treatment of the dish, Oudh provides an alternative style to one of the most loved dishes of the Calcuttans. The Awadhi style is still rare in the Kolkata area, and so Oudh has largely become a household name for offering a peak into it. 

I have been to the Deshapriya outlet of Oudh 1590 quite a number of times, and it's never a disappointing experience to the empty stomach. The crowd has increased with time, and it's difficult to manage a seat without a minimum waiting period of half an hour, even on normal days. Thankfully though, the authority has judiciously incorporated a seating arrangement with the architecture to lessen the agitation of the waiting customers. 

Once you cross the wooden door of the entrance, you find that the inside is crunched for space, and there's hardly space to walk around, with big chairs trying to accommodate as many people as possible. The light is extremely dim, and there are big chandeliers adorning the ceiling, with a slow, soft melody further helping to set the mood. The interior is typical of the Mughal era, and the waiters walking around in long black flowing Pathani suits further is reminiscent of it. 

Coming to the food, the names leave you spoilt for choice, with one sounding more delicious than the other. Finally, on this particular visit, I decided to settle for the following:

Starters:
1. Galawati Kabab (Mutton) : This is one of the recommended dishes of the place. However, whenever I have tried it, I have always found it a little burnt in places, making it somewhat bitter and less enjoyable. It is tender, but and totally melts in your mouth. 

2. Murgh Sugandhi Kabab: The chef put too much effort in trying to live up to the description that the scent will last with you more than the taste. The taste is a typical of the Malai Kababs served elsewhere. 

3. Zafrani Kabab(Fish): This too, wasn't something that will stay with you after you're gone. It's extremely tender cooked though, so much so that it's difficult to even pick it up with the fork without it getting broken. 

Main Course:
1. Rann Biriyani: This is the Biriyani that is highly talked of, and is a tad different from the usual biriyani served in other places. For one thing, it has no aloo, that is so typical of the Kolkata based biriyani houses. 
It comes in an earthen pot sealed with aluminium foil, and is cooked 'Dum Pukht' style with little pieces of mutton scattered throughout the rice. The rice is steamed for a long time and is very soft, and except for the small pieces of mutton, there are mostly long bones, with the marrow inside. 

2. Awadhi Handi Biriyani: This too is an Awadhi delicacy, and comes in an earthen pot sealed with Aluminium foil. The rice is less steamed than the Rann biriyani and there are larger pieces of mutton, with two eggs. 

I believe, their quantity is more than sufficient to serve two people, and can even serve three, if you have an appetite like mine. 

Accompaniments : 
1. Nehari Khaas: This is a great accompaniment to the Biriyani, with small juicy pieces of mutton immersed in a thick creamy gravy. The combination, in my opinion, is worth the visit. 

2. Gosht Shahi Qorma: This is forgettable, and is covered too much in spices, but imparting the taste of only a few. 

Desserts:
1. Phirni: The Phirni isn't bad, but isn't too great either. I have had better in other places. 
2. Shahi Tukra: This is another highlight of the place. There is a thick creamy layer on top, that is too heavy for a single person to clear off. The taste, however, is pretty good. 
3. Kulfi Falooda: What can possibly go wrong with Kulfi? 

Overall, the place is worth a visit for the different kind of cuisine it offers. However, if you keep your expectations too high, you might come out disappointed. And the Paan shop beside the place just takes care of it.

This place takes you back in time to 1590 the awadhi era, mughal art and architecture on every inch of the surface and ceiling, the soft light ambiance is perfect for dinner, the kebabs however are a must, it's specializes in it I guess they taste amazing, the briyani however is satisfactory, the chicken gravy item needs some improvements.

It's hard to rate a place like this- insanely popular, so much so that I had to wait 40 mins to get hold of a table, but the dishes served where worth it. The other thing- huge portions, so pack in an appetite but it doesn't cost a bomb. At around 1400 for two, had an amazing Awadhi Handi Biryani, Mutton Nihari, Galauti Kebab and lucknawi parota and a single phirni. 
The Galautis were unbelievably good; taste of North in Kolkata. Trust me, places in Delhi wouldn't serve this any better and that's a tall order. Only in Lucknow perhaps (Tunday, Dastarkhian) you've a chance of having a better Galauti. 
The biryani was awesome too. None of the aloo nonsense kolkata biryani is served with, this Awadhi biryani had ample Mutton and a couple of boiled eggs. The biryani was lightly spiced unlike the kolkata version, which handles itself more on fragrance. The Nihari packed a punch too. The raita we had to ask for, and was the only blemish. It was a bit too dull. 
Phirni was rich and a treat too. 
At these prices, no wonder it's doing brisk business. Kolkata never ceases to amaze with reasonably priced gastronomic delights.

I called to book a table as i was unaware that they do not take reservations however the answer I got was in a rude and arrogant tone saying and I am quoting "Na Na ekhane oshob hoyna first come first serve basis" this statement put across in a nasty way.

My one and only experience with this restaurant has been simply out of the world!! Since long, i was craving for lucknow famous "tunde kabab" and this dine in restaurant satisfied my craving in superb style!!
Firstly, if you are thinking of ordering at home..my suggestion would be ...Dont!! Coz its not always that you get to enjoy yummilicious "galawati kabab" sitting the nawabi awdhi interior with thumri music playing in the background. 
We ordered "galawati kabab", "awdhi murgh biryani", "murg irani", and "badam shake".
Galawati kabab--- Must try item in oudh 1590!!
Awadhi murgh buryani- Was awesome...different from the regular kolkatan biryani
"Murg Irani" - Butter chicken with exquisite flavour.
Even the badam shake had us drooling for more. And after long i ate at a place where every dish was marvellous..not just their speciality(galawati kabab). We ll definitely visit again...to enjoy the nawabi khana at our own backyard....

Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Kolkata if you're looking for sumptuous Mughlai delicacies. The ambience and decor are really good and give you a traditional old world experience. The staff are really courteous and friendly. Coming to the food, it is simply delicious. We ordered Galawati Kebab, Lucknowi partha, Roomali roti and Awadhi dal. The roti and paratha were light and the dal was well prepared. But the kebab was out of this world, wonderfully prepared and served. The price maybe a tad high but its worth the experience. Would love to visit again.

Also ordered some vegetarian dishes which included kaali daal and malai kofta. Everything was excellent. The service too was great. Would definitely visit again or call for home delivery.

the galawati  kabab.- spicy and hot with an underlying smell of old curd.Texture was like smashed potatos. My kids couldnt have it. Then the neehari khaas. just average. taste of naan average. Now coming to the raan biriyani  a big dissappointment. i read the reviews before visiting and ordered accordingly. There were sredded mutton pieces . Didnt look that  more than one piece has  been used. the mutton pieces were not even from the leg , it had thick fibers and not even soft unlike leg pieces. plus the biriyani lacked the aroma and it was again hot and my kids could have it either. They charge Rs 395 for this. OK i give 5 rating for decor,ambience and service. i will never go back. Arsalan parkcircus, aminia goal  park and india restaurant is still the best placesfor biriyanis.

I had ordered their signature dishes like Galawati Kebab, Nehari Khaas & Raan Biryani.
Every bite of this delicacies will make you think yourself as Nawabs of old.
The courteous staff, Ghazal in background, low lit ambience & old furniture combined with the tasty food will definitely make your day, made mine for sure.

I would like to visit this place again & again.I would recommend this place to all food lovers especially the "Biryani" types

To start on a positive note... these folks deliver exceptional awadhi cuisines... no wonder why Nawabs loved their food so much, "galawati kebab" is a must have.. do try out with paratha which are soft and moist and freshly made. Another delicious item that must be tried is Nihari Khaas if you are a red meat lover.. preparation is really good and goes well with either Biryani or flat breads. Little disappointed on the waiting time as it took about an hour to get a table so kids were getting impatient. Please drop in early and have your name written early specially on weekends. Overall lovely experience with food, ambience, prompt and courteous service. Well done folks at Oud 1590.

It was on navami afternoon. We were seven people and we planned to visit this place for long enough.
We booked a table at 02:35 pm and got table no. 14 at around 04:10pm.
As it was a puja day, it seems quite natural to us to wait. The person, most probably his name is Karttick da, managing the whole thing quite well and also with a smiling face. He was prompt and polite. I liked his management skill. But the person who was serving inside was very arrogant and foul mouthed. He had some issues with our camera's flash light. His words turned down our excitement, so we stopped clicking pics and just plan to finish things.
Service: 0.5/5

The environment inside is amazing. Dimmed light, slow gazal and interior decoration is all that gave a feel like a maharaja. The utensils, lemon and petal of roses for handwashing, furniture...every thing gives you nice feeling.
Ambience: 5/5

Food: We have gone with gehlowti kebab, raan biryani and nihari khas. They must get full marks on quality as well as quantity.
Only thing I don't like is the taste of Aam khas, though others liked that item too.
Rating: 4.5/5

VFM: A little over five thousand bucks is worth for the things they are giving. For me, I was paying the money for the gazal and environment, foods were free with that. ;-)
Rating: 4.5/5

Oudh 1590, as the name suggests is a historical theme based restaurant. The ambiance is very good, with gazals playing in the background. Located at deshapriya park, this restaurant is quite spacious. The walls are decorated beautifully and there is dim lighting which creates a royal atmosphere. I've tried the mutton galauti kebab which was good, but could have been creamier. I've also had the awadhi biriyani, Raan biriyani and lucknow-i biriyani. The quality of biriyani is pretty good, but the place is a bit over priced. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.

We saw people sitting for hours to have food and we become eager to have our chance.But when we finally got our chance to satisfy our test buds we failed to understand why there is so much of noise. Starter Galouti kabab is saltire than expected, side dish Iranian Chicken is plain in taste, only saving grace is  the Awadhi Mutton Biryiani. Now why am I being disappointed!!did I expected more out of it? Anyway will find out next time

When you enter Oudh 1590 you get a feeling zof the mughal era as the interior is delightfully done in that manner.  The ambience i should tell you is very very fine and i love it. 
Coming to the food. It is wonderfully prepared.
we had ordered galauti kabab, afghai kabab and for the mains we ordered moti biriyani and murgh musallam. it was just amazing. I was a huge fan of shiraz biriyani but after having their awadhi biriyani i felt extremely wonderful. The taste lingers in your mouth for long and you actually want to go back to this place again and again. 
It is a thumsup from my side for the food, the ambience and the service as well.

Soon we realized that it would take a long time (even though we were told to wait for 40-45 mnts)... at last we got our chance to enter at 10.15 by that time we had lost our interest( standing on the footpath for 1.15 hrs, no seats )... We had to cut down our starter and in main course we ordered for raan biriyani nihari khas chicken irani... Food quality was good... Attendants were also courteous...

Heard a lot from my friends so on my Puja visit to Kolkata, I tried it out. The chicken kabab was well made but nothing to.write home about. The 2 biryanis, Rann and Awadh style were served in Handis. The mutton in the Biryani was well cooked and the rice was flavored but lacked the punch that I.was expecting. The aam khaas was good but a tad bit over priced. The servers looked completely exhausted after Puja rush. We had a limited menu to.select from and I am sure the place has lot of potential that I could not explore. The ambiance is simply perfect, with a soothing thumri that was attempting to create Lucknow.

A lot of praise by my friends group during my visit to Kolkata enticed me to finally make some time and visit this place. 
A dim light setting, with intricate design/paintings on the wall, complemented with the background music gives a complete lucknowi environment. 
We ordered for Galawati Kabab to start with which was superbly done, almost melts in your mouth; followed by Keema kaleji which was enticing and equally good. The mutton rogan josh was also very well made. My last order the gosht biryani somehow did not live up to the expectation, very low on flavour, and after such wonderful dishes it was rather a bit of a dissapointment. 
For desserts the firni was absolutely stunning, just the right amount of sweetness, and also kulfi faluda was satisfatory. 
Do not forget to order a soda shikanji, which would help you to savour so much of food at one go; a simple drink but quite well made. 
Note: Though the Pujas are over the place still seems to be quite crowded, depicting its popularity amoung fellow Kolkatans. 
For first timers, the direction shown on zomato through google maps do not lead to the right place. Its a left turn just after the Lake Market crossing when you are coming from Rashbehari side.

They are recommended to be had with thin, flaky lucknowi parathas. The Mutton raan Biriyani is generous and novel. The Mutton shahi quorum a was just heavenly! Shahi tukda was not available and it still remains on my to do list! 
Delivery is prompt as well and packaging is excellent.

You can't judge the magnitude of the taste on the time of Durga Puja. But still I love the taste of all the foods I ordered. Galoti Kebabs are the showstopper. Moreover Awadhi Special Biryani and Nihari will blow you mind. Good place with laknowi music. Probably Thumka (Although I'm not sure). Good ambient with we décor.

Warning: Contents of this Review MAY be subjected to biasing due to special arrangements during Durga Pujas.

Well I finally decided to start off with the only negative point of my experience here, 'cause after this everything will be high as heaven (not that sort of high weedheads). Such a popular and high ranking place is bound to have a huge crowd on special dates, but what surprised me was the lack of a register to book a table and form a proper queue as the restaurant was opening. I understand the whole first come first serve principle and it works well while the restaurant has already been opened and your customers are arriving one by one. However what happened with us was that we reached about 30 min before the restaurant was opened, and thus had to face a race against all the other people who had gathered there by the time it actually opened. Your food is so awesome that i have no problems showing off feral instincts while helping myself to it, but except for that i really insist on a more civilised organization. Now that that part's done, we can move on to the better stuff.
I have no comments about the ambience of this place. None. Whatsoever. And the reason is that i'm still spellbound with the captivating interior deco, which was wrapped by the dim lighting from intricate chandeliers, its lure, its magic increased manifold by the music. You'll find yourself in the mystery and adventure filled pages of story books (or history books, which are much the same barring the mugging up of dates for exams) of a past lifetime. Guaranteed to steal your breath. Hey what do you know? I just found comments about the ambience after all! Now tables have to be shared during high demand periods of some special dates, we had to share our table with an unsuspecting couple. But it's understandable and not as bad as it may sound (depending on the people you share with though, we were lucky in this regard). The service was excellent. From being polite, helpful and prompt, oudh 1590 leaves no area for any grievances in this regard. Now coming to the food. Gawd. Should've added a line in the warning label of how the majestic level greatness of the food is indescribable. If those Galawti Kebabs weren't a god sent gift, i don't know what is! And the unfairness of having to hide/shield that expression of pure pleasure on our faces due to those table sharers! Our tastebuds were subjected to the most intricate and slow pleasures of the purest kind. The flavours were not only accurate, they crossed all limits and went off all charts. I could live on this food my whole life (now to only arrange for the required amount of money involved). My utmost respect and love goes out to everyone involved in preparing those delicious and mouth watering delicacies. Also, to those wondering, 1 plate 'dum' biriyani should be sufficient for 2 people. And this is one of the best biriyanis in Kolkata, i can give that in writing. Oh wait, i just did. Sometimes you can have some major rearrangement of the chairs around you, disrupting your blissful seventh heaven of lunch munching, but even that's understandable for the puja season. Overall a 5 point experience except for that simple yet easily solvable snag at the beginning. I look forward to visiting again, and I'm sure that the 2nd time will leave me seeing myself giving the 5 point rating.

This is the third time I've visited this place. To be very frank first two times were very satisfactory but last time was very disappointing. We didn't like the taste of their handi biryani at all. We ordered two types of kebabs and one spicy gravy chicken dish also. Those were average in taste. We had to wait for 1.5 hours to get a table but I felt that it was not required at all.

Visited for a Astami(09/10/2016) Lunch with my 3 foddie buddies,we were at No.55 in the queue and it was worth the 1 hour wait. Joi ma Durga,this is heaven for food lovers out there.We ordered Qalmi,Galawati Kabab,Raan Biriyani,Murgh Irani.When You land your  first bite on the Qalmi's ,only one expression will come out of you,"Ahhhhh!!Am I in Food Heaven",and a signal will be sent to your growling appetite,"Calm Yourself!!" The ambiance,Decor was awesome.Service is top notch.Price is super reasonable.I will be returning to Oudh,hungry for more .....(Ratatouille Style).Sorry for no Photos as my Phone was lost last Monday,and the Great food of Oudh really soothed some of my pain for losing my beloved zenfone....

Ambiance was really nice with music.. but the place is very clumsy... due to puja rush had to share table.. 
now coming on food.. raan biriyani was nice but mutton quantity was not satisfying ... galawti kabab was a bit salty... sahi tukra was a disaster... 
didn't fulfilled my expectations as i heard from others...

Oudh 1590, The legend of Afghani Cuisines, never disappoints and always have something up their sleeves to make us want more. The location is within earshot from the Deshapriya Park Puja Pandal and is located in a calm locality. Lot of parking space so no worries if you wanna bring your car along. As we entered the restaurant, it was dark and was quite awkard but don't judge too quickly, give your retinas some time to adjust with the light. The interior decor is traditional and resembles a mughal place but beautifully done and the music playing in the background makes the ambience exquisite. The staffs are extremely professional and decent. Let's get to the food. We ordered Galawati Kabab, Raan Biryani and Rogan Gosht Josh and boy, was it good. It was lip smacking and melts in the mouth. The biryani is perfectly spiced and will leave you wanting more. Best part is that they don't take too long to deliver the food to the table. I highly recommend this place and will definitely visit again with higher expectations.

A complete dining experience. An elegant decor with exquisite ambience perfectly caters to the historical and cultural backdrop and captures the spirit of Northern India.The zafrani kebab has been a favourite since day one and the qualmi kebab is splendid too! I wish there were more main course dishes when it comes to chicken.. But for mutton lovers, this place is surely a blessing! The service is top notch. No questioning that. A favourite for festivities and special occasions in the Bengali Calendar.

Wanna try best Awadhi delicacy?? Just go for it...
Delicate Qalmi kababs, Spicy Kakori kababs and the classic Galwati kababs... Each of them is a must-try...
The story is never complete without Biriyanis here... Traditional Raan biriyani and Awadhi handi biriyani will give you exact fullness... Nehari Khaas is a perfect side one for the biriyanis.... 
Phirni is the last topping to your mind-wobbling dinner....
Thanks Oudh & Co. for such a great service...

A special mention so as to praise their nonchalance not to change their signature dishes even in the pujas...

Impressed at the quality of food even on a durga puja day where usually other restaurants fail to meet up to the quality to balance the demand. Biriyani is scores better than arsalan. A must try for biriyani lover.

Although the queue was long enough but the staff was kind enough to manage us a good seat today. It was my first time today so i had to try the Raan Biriyani today. It was a mix of minced mutton and succulent spices. Really loved it. As we heard the quantity was good i ordered 2 for 4 people. But it was not enough. Maybe they decreased the quantity a bit but thats okay as long as the quality was awesome. Then we ordered the awadhi biriyani which was also good but devoid of any spices. The icing on the cake was Sahi Thudka. It was the best i ever had anywhere. And 2 was enough for 4 persons. 
REALLY ENJOYED THE VISIT A LOT.

Visited this place a couple of weeks ago with my family. We ordered Galawati kabab, awadhi handi biryani and raan biryani. For dessert,  we opted for phirni and shahi tukda. Simply loved the biryani. The meat was succulent and juicy, perfectly cooked. Biryani cooked with ghee definitely stands apart. As for the dessert, the shahi tukda with saffron and pistachio was excellent. And yes,  the decor was good as well.

Located at the opposite road of Lake mall, Rashbehari..its a fine dining place. Service was quick and cordial. 
I had ordered for Mutton Awadhi Briyani, Mutton Rann Briyani , Nehari khash and Galawti kebab.
One handi briyani is more than enough for two heads. It has a lucknowi flavour in it...relished the taste. 
Nehari khash also has a twist in the taste. Price is on the higher side. Its a good place for fine Mughali dining.

Oudh 1590 has long been on my wishlist since ages and I got to fulfill it today and I must admit, this place has totally bowled me over! I had high expectations given all the good reviews about it and it has totally lived upto it.The ambience is amazing. As an ardent biriyani lover, I confess that this place is better than Arsalan even in the Calcutta biriyani department solely because of the brilliant essence that it comes with. As for the Awadhi biriyani, well, that is just SUBLIME. I look forward to going back to this place again and again.

Went there with my family as they are fond of biriyani.. Must say the food was lip smacking and delicious .Though I was not happy with the Veg Galawati kabab and was a bit disappointed too as the menu was reduced due to Durga Puja Rush. But main course was good and all other items like Bhuna Gosht, Gosht Biriyani was really awesome followed by mouth watering Firni and Shahi Tukda.
A must visit restaurant. Vegetarian please avoid veg Galawati kabab.

But I was disappointed with the nihari khaas. Came to know that some preparations has been short listed for puja. So hope to visit you soon post puja to try some new dishes along with galauti kebab.

Oudh 1590, as the name suggests, is a truly traditional and antique dining experience.   This place will attract you and it completely gives you a historical look by their decoration. 
Oudh specialises is serving Awadhi & Mughlai cuisine.                                                                                                                                                                          We had the below items.

Galawati kabab,

shahi tangri kebab,

lucknowi paratha,                                                                                                                                                                                          murg kassa ,                                                                                                                                                                                                    Raan biriyani,                                                                                                                                                                                                    shahi tukra.                                                                                             Galawati kabab was very nicely cooked and combination with lucknowi paratha was a heavenly . Everyone should try this. the only negative point of the restaurant is  that it is very much crowded..  otherwise it was good  experiance ....

This restaurant is located in the lane opposite to that of Lake Mall. When I first stepped in here I found it to be very dark but afterwards I was accustomed with the environment of the restaurant. Once you visit here you will get a feel of some ShishMahal of Lucknow where ghazals are being played incessantly. The ambiance is typically of some old Mughal era and the interior was nicely decorated.
Now coming to food, we ordered gelaouti kebabs and murgh biryani.
The gelaoti kebabs were too good and they just melted in my mouth and they were really yum and a bit spicy.
The biryani here is well cooked with a juicy piece of chicken and quantity was good. What I really liked about their biryani is that it was very light and not at all very much heavy and full of oil. 
The service here is also up to the mark and good.
Overall it was a very good experience and all you Biryani and kebabs lovers must visit this place one.
I also intend to visit here shortly!

Visited this soon after it started it's operations in 2013 after hearing many oh-to-die-for reviews of the Galauti kebabs from my colleagues.
So I go there with my parents and find a huge queue. We enter after waiting for almost an hour and had to fit in a place right next to the entrance in a table of four.
Food was okayish but too pricey for that, décor was nice but we couldn't enjoy that much from our position and also after that long wait.
Overall, I found it to be a bit over hyped.

have not had the best experience.  I tried their Biriyani.
 The biriyani was dry and was just about okay. The kebab was dry and they did not provide any mint chutney with my order!  I see a lot of good reviews but somehow didn't find the place to be wow at all! In fact have had much better Biriyani & Kebabs at smaller outlets very near to that place.

To start with the ambience, you will easily be transcended to the Nawabi era of Lucknow, with the perfectly built interior and the ghazals playing in the background. The galawati kebab and lucknowi paratha was the perfect way to start the meal along with badam sharbat. The raan biryani is a must have for any first timers and it goes down well with some nehari khaas. By now your heart and stomach should be full but the meal isn't over until there's some dessert to finish it off. The three of us tried the koolfi, shahi tukra and gajar ka halwa and each of them was an equally good competitor, although the firni is left to be tried in the next visit. Overall one of the best dining experiences in Kolkata. Kudos to the management and the waiters at the place. Lastly, if u don't like waiting, be there as soon as the place opens for the day.

On 25th September, 2016 me and my wife visited "Oudh 1590" (Deshapriya Park branch). We had to wait for almost 45 mins in the queue but finally we found out it was totally 'worth it'. We have ordered "Gulaab Sharbaat", "Galawati Kebab" and last but not the least the famous "Raan Biryani". Trust me it was delicious and authentic. Then we ordered "Murgh Irani" which is tasty and good. But the biryani and Kabab were extraordinary. We would like to visit Oudh 1590 again and again. Thank you "Oudh 1590" :)

3 times in a week having the same awadhi handi biryani I guess that says it all.. this place is the place if you are looking for some nice awadhi cuisine.. the ambience itself takes you to the era.. the copper vessels adds a rustic feel to that era and it definitely stands by its name period dining 1590.. do try the handi biryani and pair it with chicken Kassa or Irani or gosht rogan Josh.. and end your meal with sahi tukda. However they play a very traditional song of that age which I didn't like but that's ok with me till food is great..

Went back to the mughal era.. The smartly matched decor helps to travel in time. The ac too is brown to match the interior. Getting down to the food ulta paratha is a must, so is the awadhi special biriyani.

went there today 24/9/16 . they have started an offer for pujas . buy any  biriyani and get a coke free . for the starters we had mutton galwati kebab. for circular shaped kebabs which were spicy and perfectly cooked . someone just cant get better than that . for the mains we had rann biriyani. 1 earthern pot was enough for two of us. and furthermore we had to pack the rest which we couldnt finish.  now i realise why they charge so much for just 1 biriyani. it was full of boneless mutton . we were completely filled. another thing they serve a plain raita with it. which was delicious too. from the presentation , ambience , service . everything was top notch cant deduct even .5 from the rating.  just follow the zomato map u will easily find the place. a must visit for biriyani lovers out there
                    on my second visit i tried their moti biriyani but for me nothing matches their rann biriyani . also had their nargisikofta with tandoori roti .really a stand out dish

Came here with my Mother who was longing for Biriyani after a shopping session at Gariahat.
Firstly, I must notify everyone that if you're are really lucky, you might not have to stand in the queue; or else it is a common scenario outside this popular food joint even in the weekdays.
Staffs are well mannered and organised.Probably the first time I heard ghazals sung by Begum Akhtar being played inside Oudh, which amplified the intensity of the ambiance.
For starters we ordered Dahi Kebab, which was decent.For main course we ordered their signature Raan Biriyani, Keema Kaleji and Rumali Roti.
Raan Biriyani is almost perfect for two people to share,and tasted different and great with the fragrance and shredded mutton.Must I add, it is not the yellow rice with aloo we are used to with in Kolkata.Keema Kaleji was spicey and extremely tasty at the same time, though it did not match as a side dish with Biriyani, so we ordered Roti.
Bread was soft, tender and were served really quick.
For dessert we ordered Sahi Tukra and Kulfi. Kulfi was average but Sahi Tukra was a real delight for my sweet tooth. Must I add two types of Raitas were served and please check out the style of serving mouth fresheners they follow.
In short, visit to Oudh 1590 was worth every penny.

Heard of this place thousand times!! Ultimately happened to be there with my hubby.. First of all we were awed by the ambiance!! The lighting, the walls and above all the "gazals" will simply took our breath away..

Then came the dishes . Their most talked dish is Galawati Kebab which was too spicy for me but unique... We also took Kakori Kebab,  Awadhi Biriyani and Aam Panna Sarbat which were awesome in short.. Specially I have no words to describe the Biriyani.. you take a spoonful of it and just reach the peace heaven.. A must visit place!!! Gonna visit this place again very soon!!

Can anything get better than this.
Authentic Mughlai at its very bestGonna start off with the ambiance, brilliance redefined. The walls, the presentation, the choice of music was undoubtedly spot on. The dim light added extra flavor and it had an amazing smell hovering all around.

Talking about food, we had a host of dishes, 
Galoti Kebab: Soft, melts as you pick it up and put it in our mouth, the herbs and spices were affluently mixed
Zafrani Kebab: Tender, soft, and the chicken was fresh as anything
Nargisi Kofta: Never had anything like this before and words fall short to describe itRann Biriyani: the icing on the top, probably, tops my chart now, as the best biriyani in the city, if not the country.

Can never get tired of visiting this place
And a special mention to the person standing outside in awadhi dress, with a smile, irrespective of it being sunny, rainy or shivering

Went there today with my family today. 

Easy to spot from a distance which is a plus.

Decor was interesting. Slightly different had old school music playing in background which was good. Upon going to the restroom noticed the place was in a bit of a mess. Things placed all over the place. Difficulty moving due to congestion and also same area being used by staff as prepping area before serving. Space management not done well.

Service seemed a bit off. Boys need training for sure.
(Had to ask 3 times for water!)

Food was good. Had the galauti kabab, reahni kabab, mutton biryani and a few non veg gravy dishes. Decent. Biryani is a large portion so be careful. 1 bowl is sufficient for 2 ppl or 1 really hungry person.

Food felt quite heavy on the stomach. Its quite rich i guess.

Would give a 4 for food. But dropping overall down to 3.5 because of service.

Located just across the Carmel Primary School, and 5 minutes walk from Deshapriya Park, Oudh 1590 has to be one of the top places to dine if you are looking for a fine Lucknow and North Indian cuisine . Since it's inauguration last year, I have heard a lot about the restaurant and it was about time I had to pay a visit. 

What we had- We ordered an Awadhi Handi Biryani and a Moti Biryani along with a dish of Murgh Irani (Chicken gravy), and for desert we had Phirni (pudding). There is a wide range of delicacy that Oudh has to offer and any Biryani lover ought to go and taste their food.

Experience- The ambiance was will set the mood alight. The ghazal background music fits perfectly with the tone of the restaurant. If possible try to sit on a separate cubicle that is placed on the eastern side of the restaurant. The waiters were kind enough to ask about our food, and were very helpful.

Verdict- Without a doubt a must visit restaurant for fellow Calcuttans and biryani enthusiasts!

I have been to this place earlier. The best thing you will find when you just step into this place is ambience. The best thing is the ambience. A soft ghazal enchants the beauty of this place to some extent. As far as the food is concerned, probably the best biriyani I have ever had and the shahi tukra is the added flavour to it. So a must visit place for all foodies here in kolkata.

This is a real Persian styled home - turned- restaurant.
The ambiance , lighting , decor and crockery are all theme based and really good. The bathroom even has a hookah. !!  😆😆 
Well , what we ordered , all turned out to be really good. All of them . So if confused, check the list out. ::

Awadhi Handi Biryani. ## most popular biriyani. Try..

Awadhi Sugandhi Mahi *** best FISH kebab . The Gandhoraj lemon makes it really tasty. 

Galauti kebab *** Mutton kebab. (Wont recommend)

Nehari Phaas *** really good Mutton dish. Very tasty and tangy gravy. Persian flavour bursting. Recommended . Pls pls do try. Dont hesitate. 😘

Murg Irani ### Same as above. The gravy is real good. Can try. 😋

Shahi Tukra |||| Dessert|||| -- Very tasty. Royal Mughal🛐 taste and sweet. Can try gajar ka halwa. But this is recommended. 😊😊😍😍

(((All items serve 2 )))
Order a fresh lime soda to enjoy. They also give little bowls to wash hands with a Gandhoraj Lemon slice and rose petals and hot water. Loved it . 😍😍😍


The place maybe a little chummed up but food is really good. Some users🚹🚺 have faced bad service but our service and hospitality was excellent. ✔✅Thanks.⛔

As soon as you step inside oudh you get a taste of royalty. Oudh is a family restaurant located near desapriya park. Easy to locate this place is great place for the biriyani lovers. The interiors are artistically down with large wall paintings,dim lighting and old awadhi music. The staff is extremely courteous. We had ordered a chicken tengri kebab which was extremely soft and tender. Along with this we had orderded 3 rann biriyanis and a mutton do paiza.the biriyanis were excellent. They were light ,airy,non greasy and had the perfect balance and richness. The mutton side dish was also very tasty. This place provides value for money is a must visit for biriyani lovers. :)

This review is solely on the basis of my delivery experience at Oudh. I have on two occasions ordered from here and have not had the best experience. Despite of the place having a negligible veg menu I tried their veg biriyani once and the veg dahi kebab on the other.
The biriyani was dry and was just about okay. The dahi kebab was dry and they did not provide any mint chutney with my order!

Probably the delivery here is a problem because I see a lot of good reviews but somehow didn't find the place to be wow at all! In fact have had much better dahi kebabs at smaller outlets but tastier.

I've been to Oudh 1590, twice. This time, with my family for dinner.
Their special Handi Biryani which is pretty famous is really amazing. The rice is tasty and the mutton is slow cooked and fall-off-the bone kind of tender. That was the only standout for me. Other than that we ordered Tandoori Roti, Chicken Awadhi Kebab, Onion Salad and Fresh Lime Soda. The kebab was okay. It had a strong rosewater smell, which I don't particularly love. The roti and fresh lime was just as good.
What really disappointed me was their service. With such beautiful ambience I wish they had a more hospitable and prompt service. Our waiter had to be nudged twice after the order was placed for the soda, which finally arrived 10 minutes before the meal was finished. We basically had to sit and only drink our soda in the end. And the Biryani that we could not finish, we asked them to pack a parcel of it. We had even walked out of the dorr when my father realized they had not given us the parcel, and had to go back to the kitchen to get it.
Food is commendable, but service needs major improvements.

Comming to food. I have been to Lucknow a lot many times. Tasted the native Galouti Kebab there. I can vouch for the fact that even the Lucknow people would envy Oudh for serving this quality of Galouti Kebab in Kolkata. Run biriani is another must try.

Last but not the least, they have one of the best Firni you get in Kolkata !

You want a real royal like ambiance? Go blindly for Oudh 1590. The background music/ghazal will surely give you a Nawabi vibe. Coming to the food, we'd ordered the well known Raan Biryanis(Definitely not the biryani next door, it's quite special) which was arrived in a handi along with a delicious raita, Mutton Rezala which was fully made on ghee and a lil bit of heavy too and Aam Serbats. The staffs were very cordial & courteous. They even asked the food is okay or not. 
Overall excellent place for having delicious awadhi foods .

As all ways... the one place which has never disappointed me no matter how much biriyani and repetitive Hariyali Kebabs I had from this place. The ambience is something which always makes me want to go back and experience the time of brass 'cutlery'  and old music. The well groomed maitre d'hotel was charming and helpful as ever, same applies for  the waiters dressed in crisp black. Coming to the food : Awadhi Biriyani served in earthen haandi is something I can never get enough of. The rice is well cooked, is smothered  'ghee'  and is not something which is overdone with spices, hence invigorating the pallet's but not bedazzling them altogether. The chicken kebab was cooked well , served with different dips and pickles some of which were too sour for my taste buds. Anyways...as all ways a great job done !!! Thank Oudh

Planned to drop by for a long time, finally went there last night with wife.
I really liked the decor, the wood paneled walls with paintings of (kathak?) dancers - the paintings were surprisingly good! The classical piped music was just right. The whole ambiance was maybe a little dark for everybody's liking but I had no issues.  

We went for Afghani Kebabs - large pieces, soft and beautifully finished with a spicy aroma.
The Murg biriyani did not have the ubiquitous Kolkata egg, but was good again. I wouldn't say among best I've had in Kolkata but still a good rendition - flavoured non greasy (and non desiccated) rice with chicken. I would prefer it served a little warmer. As reported in many a review here the amount was ample, but I wouldn't say it was enough for two. 
The Mutton Rogan Josh was the best of the evening with spicy gravy and good pieces of meat that easily came off the bones. Yes, you could suck in the marrow effortlessly as well. We took a tandoori roti with it which was perfectly done. 
The accompanying add-ons on the table were very interesting - a morabba, lime pickles, a yoghurt based dip...nice.
We finished with a Firni and a Shahi Tukda - the Shahi Tukda didn't have any discernible bread in it, at least visually, but tasted good. The bread must have been pulped into the Kheer. 
The finger bowls had slices of Gondhoraj lime and a large rose petal  - good touches. 
Courteous service, nice food, overall a good experience. Shall be back soon.

The reputation brought me to oudh. Had ordered awadhi handi biryani which was good but not the best and enough for two. Nehari khass was nice. Gelawati kebab was excellent had a touch of aminabad Lucknow. 
The decor was good but low on light. But after all these the washroom was very bad,smelly needs maintenance, really didn't expect that. That was a thumbs down really...

Well, I had high expectations from Oudh. Having heard about it and seen it highly rated on Zomato. 
But sadly, It doesn't seem to live up to its expectations. 

If there is huge line for something, for onlookers it seems important. By the same logic, Oudh commands good following and gives you feeling that you gonna have something very mesmerising and satiating to your palate. 

But sadly It doesn't. 

We visited this place on 15th of August and had to wait for nearly 30 mins and like a good build up for experiencing mouth watering awadhi delicacies, satiating our taste bud. 

In starters we had Awadhi Sugandhi Mahi and Afghani Kebab.   Awadhi Sugandhi Mahi is prepration of bhetki with saffron, yogurt and gandhoraj. It taste was ok. 

We had Awadhi Handi Biryani, Murgh Parda Biryani, Nehari Khaas, Murgh Kassa. In Murgh Parda Biryani, significance of pardha is only till it is served as there's a parda over the pot and hence the name Murgh Pardha Biryani. There Biryani were full of ghee and taste was great.

Ambience is quite awadhi style. With chandelier and paintings. But lighting was very dim, it took some time for my eyes to get used to it.

Overall, It was a decent experience.

But now comng to bad:the tandooris..they were no less than papads!Quantity of murgh biryani is like in  Ant's wedding ceremony!and none the less,the waiting outside fr no less than one hour!! It's terrific!! No particulr place to wait for..jus standing on footpath,waiting for our turn,all those chaos!!Gosh..not my cup of tea!

If u want to be treated like a Mughal emperor..this place is a must..When u go out for a dining,its not only the food that matters but also the ambience that matters....The utensils used for serving...the ambience as well as the interior decoration gives u kind of a Nawabi feeling..and the music in the background makes u remember the pages of ur history book..

Now coming to the food....in bengali terms"Chollable"..The awadhi delicacy is ok...The lucknowi paratha could have been a bit softer...and the galawati kabab could have been a bit finer...The biriyani section has much to choose from...Well,we Kolkatans look for a ALOO in biryani...which u will not get in OUDH..There in comes the heart break...But still the Awadhi biryani was good...where u have 2 pieces of mutton and egg...The rice was good...which was prepared with Desi ghee...that gives it a rich taste and lovely aroma...

Overall a good dining place to visit....But if u plan to visit it for a weekend...u need to keep ur hunger rats waiting for at least an hour....

The funny thing about Oudh is, its biriyani is not even its second or third best dish, let alone being the best dish. The now-famous dam biriyani and raan biriyani, are of course in demand and worth having. But I think Oudh serves absolutely fantastic kebabs and that isn't limited to the popular galauti kebabs. Be it Qalmi, burrah or shammi- they are worth having on various visits. My standalone favourite is the Nehari Khas. No one in Kolkata makes that dish better. Coupled with refreshing aam panna and the delicious Shahi tukra, Oudh is a must-visit for all the kebab lovers of Kolkata. 
One small grievance, I've received, though very sporadically, below par shahi tukra. I don't know why there is a lack of consistency in this regard, since most other dishes are pretty well quality controlled.

This place promises period dining from (as the name suggests) Oudh (known as Lucknow today). The ambience is top notch, with Kajri and other ghazals playing in the background. As far as the food is concerned, one will not be disappointed in terms of taste and presentation. The food is delicious and well cooked. Service is prompt. I ordered the Gilawati Kebab and Chicken zafrani kebab along with Kundan  Kaliya and Bhuna Gosht with Naan and I must say it tasted brilliant. It is a must visit with family and friends to have this wonderful finger licking deliciousness that awaits at Oudh 1590.

Though m not much into north indian food,i would definitely say yes to hv this cuisine if its oudh.first i love the place.the decor the music(some kind of old music,it was very different but soothing,going very well with the ambience).now comes the food.it was yummmy( except the moti biriyani).we started with galwati kebab n lucknowi paratha(it tasted similar to that i had in kanpur) followed by afghani murgh kebab(i may b wrong with the name,but it was very good).we definitely had raan biriyani(i didnt like biriyani but m in lubbbbb with raan biriyani,mutton rice everything was melting in the mouth).moti biriyani n normal chicken biriyani were also ordered.the mutton balls were too dry,i wud hv loved if it was a bit juicy.we were so full that we dared not to order dessert.quantity is adequate wrt price.i thought it to b on the higger side seeing the menu, but the quantity and the taste are worth it.

One of the best cuisines i have ever visited.  Food as well as ambience is excellent. Had Afghani kebab as a starter, followed by Awadhi handi biriyani and shahi mutton qorma. Finally phirni in desserts. Nothing but simply delicious food.

First word to describe this themed restaurant is MINDBLOWING! If anyone has love for authentic awadhi cuisine then this place is a must try.I went there twice and each time I had their biriyani and kababs I was totally mesmerized by the taste and smell of it.The interior decoration and the background music was too appropriate with the theme and the utensils and the staffs' dress-up also match with it. The price is a bit expensive but when compared to taste and quantity then you'll realise it's not that much costly!

With my office colleague we had visited the place in last month. Decoration of the restaurant is amazing. Feel good atmosphere was created. We ordered chicken shahi tangri kabab and mutton galawti kabab as starter. Chicken kabab was good but mutton galawti kabab was below average. After that we ordered Raan biryani as main course. Again we were disappointed 😞. The rice of the biryani was cold. We asked the waiter and manager for that, but the manager denied and waiter excused that the biryani was lying for long time in their kitchen so it may be cold. After all the price of the food is too high. We need to think more than 10 times to visit there again.

Finally checked into Oudh1590 with my friends. And what an experience it was. Surely it's one of the best in Kolkata for very few can match their standard. Regarding the ambience, it's mesmerizing. The hosts deserve special mention for their hospitality was great in spite of the fact that we arrived at 3.30 which is beyond the restaurant hours. Overall it's really great.

We visited this place on a saturday night. The place was fully packed with people waiting outside to get in. After a painful wait of 40mins our turn came. The ambience and decor was impressive but the place was a bit small compared to the number of tables they had put in, so there was a bit of space crunch. We had mutton kakori kebab and fish zafrani kebab in starters. Both were good but nothing out of the world. In the main the  raan biriyani was really good and so was the rogan josh. The lucknow e paratha was excellent. Thin and soft and accompanied well with the rogan josh. Overall  a nice experience.

Oudh 1590 is well known for its biryani and kababs.the Arabian style interior and awadhi style designing makes you feel like your back to the medieval times.I loved the galawati kababs and raan biryani which was served in an earthern pot.the food was mouth watering! If you want to have north Indian food and are craving for kababs then go for it!

Oudh 1590 was in my bucket list since ages. So, when I finally got a partner in crime the rendezvous could not have been delayed any further.
The place offers a period dining experience in the nawabi awadh and it lives up to that promise. Conveniently located in the Deshopriyo Park area the restaurant is easy to find. We reached around 12:30 pm and found the place surprisingly empty. But, when we were leaving around 2 o'clock there was already a big queue outside. However long your wait may be once you enter the door there is a different century designed to perfection waiting for you. From the dimly lit & richly decorated interior to the thumri played in the background to the attire and mannerism of the staff utmost care has been taken by the management to make you feel regal. Coming to the food, we ordered Gulab Sarbat, the famous Galauti kebab, Raan Biriyani, Nihari Khaas, Shahi Tukra and Firni. I was blown away by the spicy Nihari Khaas, the aromatic Gulab Sarbat & Shahi Tukra was perhaps the best desert I have tasted till date. The much-hyped Galauti kebab & Raan Biriyani rather tasted okayish. But what can be said about all of them is that they are all distinctly different from what is served at regular north Indian cuisine restaurants. There was complementary aam ka chatni which was also decent in taste. They provide water bowls with slices of gandharaj nimbu & rose petals. The entire sumptuous meal amounted to ₹1693 for two people. Considering that we were filled to brim, I guess one can manage a decent meal here at around ₹700 per head. That may still sound expensive but definitely not over priced for all that this place offers. Kudos to the management team for having such a well trained & courteous staff out there. I just have two suggestions for the management team -
1. Give it a thought to add a hookah section. None of the hookah bars in Kolkata currently has the ambience you people offer.
2. Definitely try to increase the seating capacity. If you guys keep up the good work you're gonna need it very soon! :)

I have heard a lot about Oudh from all of my friends for a long time. Hence decided to visit for my birthday lunch. Even on a Thursday afternoon there was a queue and wait time of 15-20 mins. Finally when I entered was greeted by the soothing music and the Nawabi decor. The uniform of the staff also wants a special mention. The ambiance deserves special mention.

Food - We ordered the usual favorites. 
 Galwati Kebab with Lucknowi paratha -  The kebabs were amazing, melting in the  mouth with the parathas. 
 Raan Biriyani - Totally different from the usual Kolkata biriyani. The mutton pieces were prepared to the perfection. We ordered one portion which was sufficient for 2 people.
Nehari Khaas - Chunks of meat in a soft gravy. The taste of the nehari with the biriyani is sure to make you feel like a nawab of days gone by.
Shahi Tukra & Firni - The deserts were really good as well, with the shahi tukra being one the best I ever had.

Pocket Pinch - 1581 with taxes. Not expensive if you consider the food and the ambiance with the services.
 Will visit again .

Its not a large restaurant. The decorations are so fantastic that it'll catch your eyes. Stuffs are attentive. Now come to the main thing. Foods are really tasty but I think a lil bit overpriced. The way they serve and the handis in which biriyani was served was amazing. Recommended dish is Awadhi Handi biriyani, Galwati Kebab. And don't forget to have benarasi pan from the stall jst beside the restaurant.

N when u enter, yes it will give u the feel - interior wise, the song playing in background matches the same... 
The attainder and the waiter both hv pleasant attitude... Now comes the food the tikka kabab was grt.. Biriani we ordered was also very good... 

And for the last bit, bite to the dessert ...........- OK now stop please don't order any of the dessert items or it will ruin evry good feeling u had so far because of the good food u consumed.... A bit disheartening at the end but evry1 must visit the place if u want to give ur taste bud's a treat.. :)

If anyone is looking to spend some time just as the way Nawab Wazid Ali Shah used to in his times, there cant be a better place other than this. Ambience - more than Perfect, Hospitality - 10/10. When those Classic Lucknowi Gharanas play at your background what else can bring in inner peace along the food. We tried the trademark dish on the menu - Galawati Kabab. have to say Nawab Wazid Ali Shah was blessed to have cook who invented the food. Other than that , Lucknowi  Paratha and Murgh Irani was a perfect blend. Didnt try out the Rann Biriyani , another signature dish of the place which will be for the next time. Overall The Best Place for MUGHLAI.

And this place never disappointed me. Once visited during the biriani festival. It was HEAVEN !!! We ordered three types of biriani and all were unique in their own way .

I love the special complimentary mango pickle. Once I have asked for the chutny even after paying the bill. It was so generous of them that they served a bowl full of chutney and I finished it.

And the decoration and ambiance is also very unique . Specially the utensils they use give the royal touch.

I had heard many positive reviews about Oudh 1590 and had been longing to visit this place for quite sometime. Finally made it here with 2 other friends.

Luckily we did not have to wait outside upon reaching.
The interior immediately cools down your nerves and takes you on a journey to medieval India. The waiters are courteous. 

We ordered for Galawati Kabab, Awadhi Handi Biriyani, Gosht Biriyani, and Nehari Khaas.
Nehari Khaas was definitely the best of it all. A must - everytime I visit this place from now on!
And the Awadhi Handi Biriyani was also quite liked by us. The taste is different from other Kolkata biriyanis you have in Kolkata. Gosht Biriyani is like a typical Kolkata Biriyani and has a piece of potato unlike the Awadhi Handi one (Potato in biriyani lovers - take note) :p

We had heard good reviews about Galawati Kabab also. But it was quite bitter and spicy. We did not find it "that special". 

It was a good experience. The costs may look a little pricy, but the ambience, staff behaviour compensates for all that. And do try out the Nehari Khaas everyone.There are other famous items to try out too which I will definitely do in my future visits.

We visited on 14th August lunch time. Food was great. For two of us we ordered moti biriyani and galawati kabab with lucknow paratha. It was sumptuous and tasty. 
However, the behaviour of the management was atrocious! The supervisor came and told us we were taking too long to eat. When I asked about the complaint book, he flatly told us "Even if you complaint, it's no use".
The least we expect from restaurants is courtesy to customers. My feedback page Sl. No. 16845. Don't know whether it reached the management.

I have been at Oudh 1590 a number of times now and I have never been disappointed. Their tangri kebabs and awadhi biriyani are simply mouthlicious. Though there galowti kebabs could be a little better in term of taste. Oudh has got a very royal decor and a serene ambience. Anyday recommended for the north Indian and mughlai delights!

Firstly, it is a bit difficult to locate this place in the first go. But like they say, a little difficulty adds more charm to the journey and my visit to this restaurant was proof enough. Like the name suggests, it is almost a journey back to the time. As we entered, we lost the track of time. Interiors amazing, staff warm and prompt, the background music superb and the food surpasses everything. The menu card left us baffled. Who knew ‘our’ biriyani had so many variations. When our attendant saw our plight, he offered to help us. The soft and succulent ‘Galawati Kebab’ with a soft paratha, the heavenly Raan Biriyani and the sweet delightful ‘Phirni’ are a must try. The ambiance, the décor, the dim lights, the uniform and behavior of the staff and the music did make me feel like a King from Awadh.

What a place! The owners must have really thought through in detail about how to provide us with the best period dining experience. As soon as one catches a glimpse of this restaurant you know you are in for something special. The interiors along with the Thumri playing in the background creates a calm environment. I had ordered Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Kakori kebabs. The kebabs literally melt in your mouth while the biriyani's rice is the most flavourful I have had in my life. Although I had to wait for 30 minutes the wait was well worth. Service is top notch and designed so that you may be transported to a different century. I highly recommend this restaurant. I will keep coming back.

The décor of the place is outstanding.  Capacity is on the lesser side and they do not accept table booking, hence difficult to get a table. Coming to the food, we ordered galawati kabab, kakori kabab, awadi sugandhi machine nd zafrani fish kabab as starters. Except for the galawati kabab which I felt had more salt for my liking everything was cooked to perfection. Their minced mutton biryani was outstanding. We finished off with firni which was also good.

Earlier the place was crowded but today it was nearly empty so we took a four seater and ordered Badam Sarbat. I was amazed after having a sip because it was made of real Badam. Very tasty.

Ordered Kakori Kebab, Raan Biryani. Both were fabulous. 

Tried their Koolfi Faluda and Gajar ke Halwa. Both were very good..

Ordered Murgh Biryani and Nehari Khaas - the two recommended dishes by most of the fellow Zomato users in Calcutta. And guess what, it more than lived up to my expectations and so much so, it exceeded them. 

Murgh Biryani: The regular Calcutta biryani (very different from what you will get at Bawarchi or Paradise in Hyderabad) with the addition of a special Raita. Something which compliments the biryani really well. 

Nehari Khaas: Chunks of soft mutton pieces submerged in dark colored gravy. The very taste of it with the Biryani at your plate will give you a royal feeling. 

As a whole, quantity: 5/5
Quality: 5/5
Service: Moderately quick

Definitely recommend.

A one of a kind restaurant. The ambience is the main attraction in Oudh 1590. The copper plated cutlery and the background amazing thumri music atmosphere is something you will not find anywhere else. No wonder it is a big deal to get a table here.

The food is as good as the ambience.
The raan biriyani and the exclusive galawati kebabs are standouts and the nehari khaas is a treat as well.

Will try out some new kebabs on my next visit but surely this one is a keeper and one to cherish.

Located opposite to desapriya park and near the Carmel junior school.
This is one of the very few authentic Awadhi restaurants in the town.

We Ordered : 1 plate Qalmi Kebab(4pc), 1 Awadhi Handi Biryani.
kebabs were soft,juicy and melt in mouth.
The biryani came in an earthen handi and the quantity was good enough for 2 persons with 2 pieces of tender mutton and  egg and the taste was too good.

The hospitality of the staffs was awesome.
Prices were high,but to maintain such a costly interior and quality food they have to keep the price high.
Overall it was a good experience....

Oudh 1590 stays true to its date. Yes, 1590. One of the best places in Kolkata where one can get authentic Awadhi cuisine, this place has really wowed us. The ambience just transports one back to the era. With paintings and the sweet Mughal era music, it is just royal. Another neat little trick that amazed me was that they had coloured their ACs to match with the walls as a result of which there is no break of continuity. But all this is overshadowed by something more   royal - the food. Lip smacking good. Wonderful and delicious to its truest sense. It literally seems that the food had been made by Mughal cooks and we are made to feel majestic. No complains at all with the staff who are extremely courteous. And the price is also reasonable enough for the quality of food that is being served. So if one wants to feel royal once on a while and wants to treat oneself with royal food then Oudh 1590 is the place.

Only very few restaurants in kolkata can provide moghol preparations as good as Oudh! I went there along with my friend to have some sophisticated moghol dishes. Dim light inside the restaurant add a special feeling with the food. We ordered Awadi handi Biryani,galawati kabab, Nehari khaas. Galawati kabab was delectable and mouth melting. Other preparations are also quite delicious. The biriyani contained 2 pieces of egg and mutton and served in a handi. Waiters' behaviour was very amicable. I would like to visit it again.

What a place man.. .. Like i have never tasted such amazing awaadhi food ever in my life.. i and a friend went  in here for lunch... the interior literally shooked us. It was amazing.. a guy escorted us to an extremely beautiful seating area which had big beautiful paintings hanging in the wall.. the weather was great today. And the thungri music in the background was going so well.. now coming to food... without taking any starters we straight away jumped into main course... we ordered their special raan biriyani nd ghost bhuna..
The mutton was on a richer side with blends of various spices... but as we love spicy junglee mutton.. it was great for us.. The biriyani was served in a small "hari" which i quite loved... like as soon as we were served.. we couldnt wait to put a spoon full of heaven inside. So we hopped in.. like. For 2 mins. We were silent. We just ate, ate and ate. Nevertheless, the staffs were not that good.. but full 100 for the food. Really looking forward to this amazing place in future

Starting with the ambience : The decor is fantastic and goes well with the name. Its well complemented by ghazals and the place is darkly lit .Before going to Oudh, me and my would be had read the reviews here on Zomato.
Dishes worth trying according to a lot of reviewers were : Mutton galawti  kebab and mutton awadhi biriyani.
To be honest, we were very disappointed with Galawti kebab . Didnt find is as nice as we were expecting it to be and our expectations were truck loads.
To get over our disappointment , we decided to give starters another try. We ordered for Zafrani Kebab and boy, it was delicious!!!
We ordered  Mutton Awadhi handi biriyani and we were advised that one would be good for two ( We could have done with a little more rice though) . Biriyani tasted a little different and it was very light on the stomach. It was tasty nonetheless . If you expect aloo wala biriyani and bengal wala taste, you will be royally disaapointed(and so was she). When in Rome, be a roman!!
Completed our meal with some fine firni desserts.

Price wise , it was around 1300 for 2 which is quite affordable given the quality/taste of food and the wonderful ambience. A must visit for people who want to take a break from the usual Bengali biriyani.

The place is nice but not too much option for vegetarian meal so it was bad experience for me.. otherwise if you are non vegetarian meal lovers the gates are always open for you as the menu is vast to choose... A must visit place if u r non vegetarian...

Been here for the 1st time.. though i just took a parcel but the atmosphere of the place is fabulous due to its low light n ancient kinda music playing in the background.. from the glasses to the structure of the building.. everything is so mughal.. that's the main show of the place n yes no doubt about the Biryani.. awesome as it is!

had today's lunch @oudh deshapriya park outlet..i had went thru d previous reviews wherein sum1 said d location to be the opp lane of lake mall bt that was misleading..the location is opp of carmel schl primary section..from deshapriya crossing take the road frm P Majumdar sari shop take the second lane frm the shop go straight nd u ll find oudh
the ambience will gv u a mughal feeling
the food quality is good really good the afghani kabab was good and the chatney complimented perfectly with it
then we were served the rann biriyani nd murgh irani..the mutton was very nicely cooked it was very soft even the ch was also soft nd juicy 
the qty of the biriyani was more than sufficient for 2persons
serivice was v v quick nd also cooperative

Small but beautifully decorated inside. I love the entrance gate, gives you a feeling that you are entering somewhere royal.Low lighting and great wooden work inside creates that lovely feeling of fine dining. Coming to food I loved thei mutton preparation more than the chicken preparation. Not to miss is Galawti kebab and rann biriyani those are the famous item of Oudh. Biriyani is very heavy and different from the normal biriyani you get here in kolkata.Be prepared  to have a nice sleep afterwards because food here are very heavy and will make you feel sleepy later on.Price is on the reasonable side. You may find the quantity bit less earlier when they serve you but when you start eating you can feel how rich the items are prepared.Great option to eat around Desapriya Park.

For Biriyani loving crowd in Kolkata Oudh 1590 is refreshingly different and that the USP. They dared to be different when we accepted a cetain style of cooking calling it Kolkata Biriyani. Their Raan Biriyani is famous. It comes in quantity enough for 2. So good value for money. Boneless Biriyani and that too without potato is not a common practice in Kolkata. And people are loving it.

It had been my father's wish for a very long time to have dinner at this restaurant. Having stayed in Lucknow myself for two years and having tasted authentic Awadhi cuisine, I did not know how much it could appease me although I had been hearing good things about this place. So I decided to try it out by taking my parents for a celebration, albeit a little early one, of their 25th marriage anniversary. 

We had gone there on a Saturday and as expected it took us a long time to get a table. Almost an hour, to be exact. When we did enter we were awestruck by the ambience-- the decorations to the thumri, there was a keen attention to detail in this restaurant which promises an experience of "period dining". 

For starters, we had ordered mutton kakori kebabs. Each plate contains four kebabs and were perfect for the three of us. The meat was melt-in-the-mouth soft and the spice was just perfect. It created a delicate taste which was very appealing. The dhania chutney and onions were the perfect accompaniments. For the main course, we had ordered their very famous rann biriyani and irani chicken. The biriyani was served to us in an earthen pot and contained sufficient amounts of flavourful rice and pieces of mutton. Unlike the Calcutta biriyani, Awadhi biriyani tends to be towards the more moist side which was not appreciated by my mother. Also, she missed the potato and the egg!! My father and I found the taste quite authentic. The Irani chicken was a good accompaniment to the rice. We ended our meal with a shahi tukra and that is what, in my opinion, takes the cake. The dessert with kheer and malai was fragrant with rose water and kewra. The texture was just perfect. 

Overall, I have had a good experience at Oudh 1590. The bill is towards the higher side and it especially burns a hole in my pocket because food in Lucknow is one of the cheapest in the country. But I give all credit to the restaurant for having transported most of its appeal into one single building. I look forward to revisiting here and recommend at least a one-time visit.

Biryani is a magical word. And it is more magical when somebody says "Kolkata Biryani".. But Oudh 1590 is just beyond all of this so called adjectives. Amazing in one word. The restaurant has designed in a different way which will take you in some Mughal Period.. Architecture of the restaurant is just amazing. Now the food.. We had ordered Raan Biryani which is most acclaimed in this joint and Gosth Bhuna.. The Biryani comes in a clay pot. One is sufficient for 2 adults. Taste... Heavenly.. Speechless.. But here you have to compromise yourself with Aloo (Potato which is an essential material for Kolkata Biryani). The Ghosth Bhuna is also very tempting. Oudh 1590 is just not a restaurant, it is an experience.. For me, a typical Biryani Lover!!

It was a long-awaited visit to this place. And yes, the wait was well worth. Everything you want to be good when going to a fine dine restaurant, this place offers them and more.
Ambience: 4.5/5 (the place literally takes you on a historic ride to the age of the nawabs...and you don't need the food for that)
Food: 5/5 (yes, it scores a 100% in customer satisfaction in this department...right from the kebabs in the starters to the main course biryanis to the desserts and appetizers, all are picture perfect like the surroundings...for the record, our group ordered Mutton Galawati Kebab, Chicken Zaffrani Kebab, Murgh Biryani and Awadhi Handi Biryani...needless to say, we had our fill and more)
Price: 4/5 (the high score isn't for the high costs, but for the "worth for money" quotient...you don't have to shell out a premium to have a heartful lunch at this place...you have already read what our group of 5 had ordered...the total bill turned out to be below 2.5K...I would say that to be hugely worth the food we were served)

For those who are familiar with the place, you know the goods this place has to offer...and for those who are yet to visit, just cut the wait, visit the place and ask them to shut up and take your money!! :-D

Happy eating, you foodies! :-)

I am finally done with my exams and now I am going to share a lot of my food hogging experiences of this year.:D

Starting with a new favourite of mine I.e. Oudh 1590.
This restaurant was on my whislist for quite sometime now until it got ticked off finally on 7th March 2016. We chose the Rashbehari Avenue outlet and inspite of being a Monday we had to wait for a seat of 9 for 15 minutes.

The moment we got in, we knew that a pleasant experience awaited us. Soft and serene golden lighting with excellent ghazal playing in the background. The staff members of the were very cooperative and humble.

Moving on to what we ate and how we felt :
1) Mutton Galawti Kebab @Rs.270/plate (4.5/5) : (Serves 4) For starters it had to be galawtis. My love for mutton galawti is a never ending saga. We ended up ordering 3 plates because they were so good. Soft melt in the mouth kebabs with hand pounded mutton keema. The amazing fragrance indicated the right usage of the spices. Oh! What joy we had on having these beauties. :)
Ordered : 3 plates.
Total : Rs.810.00

2)Lucknowi Paratha @Rs.60.00/portion (4.5/5) : (Serves 2)The galawti kebabs were relished with super soft by flaky non-oily parathas! So good! The parathas had mild tinge of sweetness and it went amazingly with the salty fragrant galawtis.
Ordered: 4 plates.
Total : Rs.240.00

3)Awadi Sugandhi Mahi @Rs.385.00/portion (4/5) : (Serves 4) This was specially ordered for my fish-loving grandfather. Thick fillets of bhetki fish cooked to perfection. Not undercooked but perfectly flaky. It was marinated with lightest of spices and gondhoraaj lemon. The freshness of the fish was prominent.
Ordered : 1 plate.

Moving on to the main course.

4)Nargisi Kofta @Rs.300.00/plate (4.75/5) : (Serves 2) Nargisi Kofta being a signature dish of Oudh, did not disappoint even a bit. Hard boiled eggs covered with mutton mince which is crumb coated and fried to perfection. These fried goodies are then simmered in a rustic and robust semi-dry gravy which also has mutton mince as the base. Excellent in terms of flavour. Superb quality of both the eggs and mutton mince. Polished every morsel till the last drop.
Ordered : 2 plates.
Total : Rs.600.00

5)Naan @Rs.60.00/plate (4/5) : (Serves 1) The naans were ordered for polishing of the narigisi koftas. The naan bread was soft and had a slight fermented feel to it which was enjoyable!
Ordered : 3 portions.
Total : Rs.180.00

6) Raan biryani @Rs.395.00 (2.85/5) : (Serves 2) Amongst all the extremely delicious dishes, their famous raan biryani couldn't leave its mark. Though the rice was fragrant with independent grains, the mutton was very chewy. The nalli portion of the goat was served with every handi and surprisingly it was stone cold. We had to return those to them and they brought the same back after reheating them. Was disappointed with the quality of the meat.
Ordered : 3 Plates.
Total : Rs.1185.00

Next, we moved on to the desserts.
7)Phirni @Rs.40.00 (3/5) : (Serves 1) The phirni was good to taste but nothing out of the box.
Ordered : 3 portions.
Total : Rs.120.00

8) Shahi Tukra/Tukda @Rs.110.00/portion (4.5/5) : (Serves 1 with a serious sweet tooth and serves 2 with a moderate sweet tooth) Hands down the best shahi tukda I have had in a long time. Crispy edged bread with soft buttery centre and thick malai on top. Oh my god, it was nothing short of amazing.
Ordered : 2
Total : Rs.220.00

The total cheque came upto Rs.4608.00 (Including a vat of Rs.555.00 and Tax of Rs.222.00) I.e.Rs.512.00 per head, which was reasonable enough given to the quality of food.

Overall, the dining experience at Oudh 1590 was excellent. Outstanding food, pretty ambience, good and soothing ghazals in the background - how can this combination ever go wrong?

Experience at a glance :
•Food : 4/5
•Ambience : 3.85/5
•Staff behaviour : 4/5
•Value for money : 4/5 (full paisa vasool!)

Total : 3.96 ~ 4/5

Totally recommended. 👍🏻
Happy eating. ✌🏻

Recently visited this place.  Ambience is a 3.5, food is a 4.5, service is a 4.5. We ordered a galawati kabab,  tandoori roti and murgh irani.  They suggested we take a Lucknow e paratha with the kabab.  The paratha was awesome-light,  thin,  delicious and totally complemented the kabab. The main course was equally delicious.  Overall will definitely visit again.

Visited this place first couple of years back and it immediately became our favourite. Terrific interiors, good music played at the right volume and excellent food. 

To start with found the Mutton Galawati Kebab to be excellent. The Murg Biryani was excellent too. Light and flavourful. But, according to us, the best items we had here were the veg biryanis. They were having a biryani festival and we tried the palak and echor biryanis. Both were excellent. At last some restaurant served a veg version of a biryani and not fried rice.

a small beautifully decorated place given the look of the then era, was the place i decided the celebrate a month after my wedding with my beloved and rest of family. superbly located in south kolkata, this place is the destination for people loving nawabi cuisine. the galawati kabab is its specialty accompanied by lucknawi paratha, a mutton kebab just melting in mouth. awadhi handi biriyani is also another delicacy nurturing the taste-buds. what more to say... eagerly waiting for opportunities for repeated visits.

I upset with their arrangement for waited customers. Twice i went there and every time i had to wait for more than one hour. They dont make any arrangement to seat outside you have to stand and wait no matter whether its raining. May be their food quality is good but not worth to stand and wait long outside hour and hour.

As the name suggests, oudh thats the cuisine of lucknow or earlier as it was called awadh. From the seating arrangement to outer look, and then comes the ambience every inch of its depicts the 'shaan' of lucknow. The subtle music in the background just added more awadhi feel to my wholesome luncheon. Oudh 1590 was unplanned again, so just went to fill myself after reading expert reviws of zomato. But oh my! This place is just so nawabi, coming to the main part food; ordered awadhi sugandhi mahi thats fish in marination of gandhraj, yoghurt,saffron never tasted such good fish kebabs in kolkata yet. It was that good, melts in mouth and gandhraj adds a zing to the whole fish. 
Then we were served with awadhi handi biryani. This was more than enough for me and my friend we could not even complete. We got two pieces of egg n chicken each, chicken was tender and the rice full of awadhi flavors. 
Along with biryani we chose murgh irani salaan which was good with tanginess of lemon, flavor of ginger was not that prominent though. Chicken was very tender.
We were so full that there was no room for dessert. Our server dabashish (hope i got his name right) was really helpful with suggesting a good menu and service was prompt.
I am going back for trying rest of their kebabs. 
ps- they serve fennel and other mouth freshners in a really cool box. Loved it!

Oudh 1590. Located on the opposite lane of lake mall. Beautiful place to eat. Beautiful ambience. The moment we entered we felt we were transported to another time. The décor is absolutely amazing and the music playing in the background sets up the mood. We ordered galawati kebabs, Lucknow paratha and raan biriyani. The food was served rather quickly. Food tasted amazing. Each and every dish was very good. The galawati kebabs really did melt in the mouth. Parathas complimented them very well. And then the raan biriyani. YUM! Different from the regular biriyanis we eat here in Kolkata. No potato. Lol. Usually I don't eat mutton but the mutton here is really worth trying. Good restaurant. Great food. Definitely recommending it to all. 👍

After waiting half an hour outside, awesome ambience accompanied by great gazals welcomed us at Oudh 1590. We started our food venture with Galwati kabab and Murg afgani kabab. Both are equally marvelous but Galwati kabab was l'll bit special.. It must be tried. Then we asked for Mutton Handi biriyani and Gosht kundan kaliya. The biriyani came in a earthen handi and the quantity was good enough for 2 persons with 2 pieces of tender mutton and 2 eggs and the taste was too good. Kundan kaliya's gravy was also very savoury, it can be tried with paratha/nun also. Next we had Raan Biriyani and fish jafrani kabab. Biriyani was really tasty and fish jafrani kabab was splendid. Firni and kulfi was equally good but falooda was not up to the mark. At last bill came with a four chambered wooden box with paan masala which looks very unique. If you are going in a Sunday eve then try to reach within 7.15 at least as the service is slow and a good mob gathers outside. As a whole our experience is really good. Its a must try place.

Their speciality is afgani and Kakori kabab is a must try... Biriyani is just too good... Not a place to visit regularly bt a must try.... 
Price is high but to maintain such a costly interior and quality food they have to keep the price high...

If you're looking for authentic Awadhi cuisine then this is the place where you should stop by. For first time visit the place is little tough to find out. You need to take the first left lane on Lancedown street,  opposite to the Desopriyo park and your destination is on left side, at the last of the lane. 
The interior and illumination will remind you of old Lucknow. Kebabs are literally succulent and tender. Galwati kebeb, qalmi kebab, burra kebab, shahi tangri kebeb must be there in your order ! Biriyani dishes have also brought up the true flavour of Awadhi cuisine. Limited dessert options are equally tasty. To end it up on a sweet note, have mitha patti paan (sweet leaf betal roll) from the Pan shop, adjacent to the restro.

When you go to a restro there are lots of things which you expect to be good !!
But in the case of oudh 1590 everything is beyond the excellent line !!
Starting from the look of the restaurent the service the staff the ambience the food every single thing will make you go like damn man this is heaven !!
I went here for lunch and was bit crowdy waited for 10 to 15 minutes and my wait was totally worth it !!
I ordered few dishes and each and everyone of them was like heaven is entering in my mouth !!
The staffs were really nice service was damn good !!
Whatever briyani you order 1 is enough for 2 !!
Every food lover must check out this place and if you haven't visited here yet you ain't tasted nothing !!
5/5.

"Veg"ging It Out!(Chetna)

In Kolkata, the concept of veg biriyani is a farce! Until this place happened!!! The spicy palak paneer biriyani with the raita giving you that sweet relief is highly reccommended. Vegetarians have this habit on commenting on the softness of the paneer and I shall do just that. The paneer is so soft and juicy that you feel like a pat in the back for coming to this place. Even the simple Veg Biriyani and pineapple raita reconfirms your faith in veg biriyani. However the galawti kebab is a tad bit dry and not comparable to places like The Marble Room. The vegetarian Shahi daal , subz makhanwala will make you forget that you are in a predominantly non vegetarian place. Buttery, spicy and yummilicious!
Desserts are just an after thought at this place but anyways you will have no room left !

My first perfect score for a restaurant..I wanted to go to this place since..when...I don't even remember..! Finally last week we went there for my birthday lunch..the elaborate wooden decor on the walls outside screamed "period" to me..As it's a small place and runs on spot appointments , we had to wait for near about 35/40 minutes to get a table...If it wasn't Oudh..I would have left in no time ..! But the waiting did pay off! Once seated I was mesmerized by the art works of the dancers on the walls..the chandeliers..the music..the decor ,the service guys' black kurta uniforms...overall gave a period courtroom vibe..half of my heart was won over..Ordered Afghani Kabab, Nun roti, Raan biriyani and awadhi biriyani..The coriander flavor in the kabab was prominent but tasty..I found the taste similar to coriander chicken..Raan biriyani is my favorite biriyani after that day...the mutton was moist..the rice grains were perfectly cooked..Portion was more than enough...loved it!! Awadhi biriyani was rich ...the aromatic smell of pure ghee in the biriyani was a real treat to my senses and of course my taste buds as well.. By the end of the main we were so full that we had to drop the idea of ordering a dessert...o yes they served us raita kind of chutney with the kababs..it was bang on with flavors ..complimented the dish well and also went well with both the biriyanis !!!
Pricing was okay as the portion was good enough for two. Service was quick and friendly..
Can I just say I love this place and can't wait to go back again???..Oudh thoroughly made my lunch that day..So 5/5 for Oudh!!! :)

Brilliance would be less to say about this place. Firstly, the food. By far the best Mughlai and Awadhi in town. Go for the Nihari Khas, Awadhi Biriyani and Gelauti Kebab. The ambiance is perfection, with the interiors decorated in the traditional Nawabi style. The soothing music of old, gives a pleasant feeling while having your food. The service is good. We found nothing to complain.

A place for trying out the Awadhi cuisine in Kolkata. Tried their Galawati Kabab, Burrah Kabab, Awadhi Handi Biryani and Phirni.
 
Galawati Kabab was good. Burrah Kabab was just average. Liked the Biryani most. Phirni was too sweet for my palate.

The interior is amazing. The service is also prompt. Overall an average experience.

Sorry to say but i found this place a bit overrated or may be just because of my high expectations after reading such great reviews on zomato.Yes the ambience is really great but coming to the food,i am disappointed!We ordered galawati kabab and awadhi biriyani.Both the dishes were not that good.Specially the biriyani was lacking in taste and it was dry!But overall it was a different experience.

Ambience is beautiful and the music is refreshing.
Their behaviour is too good.

I write review againts which I have ordered.
Seek Kabab is good but the gosht biriyani is not different compare to other well knowned resturent and its too expensive.
If you ordered only biriyani then its not enough for only one person but the cost is Rs/-300.
For lukhnowi paratha Rs 60 is too much againts its taste.
Murgh Irani was tasty.

One of the best north indian cuisine experience I've had! From the kebabs to the biriyani - just loved it! The ambience was superb, light ghazal kind of music playing in the bacground. Starting from the cutlery to the waiters, everything was authentic. And you will get one of kolkata's best biriyani here. The side dishes were just the right compliment to the main courses. The staffs were courteous too. Will keep going back and back for sure.

Oudh 1590, Deshapriya Park was the venue for my girlfriend's birthday lunch. And I must say, they do not disappoint. We started off with some Afghani Kabas, which were tasty as well as tender. And the smoked flavor was truly heavenly. Next came the Awadhi Handi Biryani. We opted for the Chicken Handi, as I cannot have mutton for obvious reasons. The faint aroma of desi ghee from the rice, and the tenderness of the chicken pieces takes the prize today. We ordered Paneer Rezala, which was satisfactory, nothing special to mention here. The Firni was also satisfactory. All in all, a good experience. Would visit again soon. Thank you for your service.

The interiors are beautiful and the restaurant was packed at 8.30pm on a weekday. We ordered Rann Biriyani and Murgh Irani. The biriyani was al dente, fragrant and delicious. Murgh Irani was light but there were only two pieces of chicken. The gravy really complemented the biriyani. Raita, chutney and pickles were served along with the biriyani. Both the raita and chutney were perfect. This restaurant is value for money and I hope it stays that way. 
 My only grievance was that there was too much noise inside and the ghazals couldn't be heard. 
I'm not a big fan of Indian food but this one really impressed me and I think I'll visit again. :)

Food is exceptionally good. Ordered for raan starters and it was satisfactory. Curries ordered both veg and non veg were good and spicy.

Their raita was very bland and not up to the mark with other things on the table.

Also the tables are very crammed and feels uneasy when other people have to cross the floor of the restaurant. 

Service was fine.

I am really dissatisfied with the behaviour of the service staff. I visited the Deshapriya Park outlet. Some of the staff were really discourteous and they showed no interest to help us with the menu. It seemed they aren't even aware that they need to serve water to the guests even if they have come for takeway. We would have complained to the manager too but we couldn't as we were in a hurry. Really impolite service staff for such a highly rated restaurant.

Today we checked into oudh.. After getting a tremendous good feedback from my friends and relatives... I cldnt resist myself.. But all my expectations went in vain...as the food we ordered had lots of faults...we ordered a bhetki item..my goodness it was smelling horrible.. The fish was not at all fresh..even the famous Galauti kebab..was not at all up to d mark..it was very grainy in texture..and tasted horrible. Though after complaining abt the fish, they didn't charge, which was a good sign.. But coming from Bangalore, I had huge expectation from this restaurant, which didn't turned up well..So, food lovers I would not recommend this restaurant, as Ur aim to have good food, won't b successful.

What happens when you go to a restaurant? You don't just buy food, you buy the experience. That's exactly what this place has to offer. The decor is worth a look and its sure to give you a royal feel and the ambiance will take you back to the Mughal period where you dine in the rich heritage of the Indian history. A subtle tune of ghazal or a classical dadra or thumri to set your mood. The staff, always ready to assist you and also give you enough space to be with your family or friends. The entire ambiance will elevate your mood, taking you for a royal tour. About the food, the taste and quality speaks for its authenticity, leaving you craving for more. The biriyanis are perfectly cooked, whether its a dum pukht or a kacchi biryani, kebabs are one of the finest out here. I specially loved the galawati kebab and the nehari khaas. Though rann biryani is a speciality out here, but I would also recommend the Jheenga biryani and the shahi tukra in the end to leave your appetite in full satisfaction. I wont hesitate to say this is one of the best places in the city for Mughlai cuisine with a lot on the menu to offer and the incredible ambiance along with the food. A must visit for all.

Seldom food goes beyond satisfying your tastebuds and overwhelms you, like watching a classic film...Oudh 1590 was one such experience. Considering the fact that most "North Indian" or Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata draw their inspiration from Awadhi or Punjabi cuisine, I might conclude this was the best experience I ever had as far as this particular cuisine is concerned. From the melt in the mouth Sugandhi machhi, to the famous galauti kababs(best had with lucknavi parathas), the fragrant yet so subtle raan and moti biriyanis...each and every dish exudes flavours that are bound to bring people back at the doorsteps of this restaurant repeatedly.  The service is prompt, the staff courteous and helpful , the decor brilliant. Half a mark is deducted for the hurry, but when there are patrons waiting outside on a sunny afternoon this is bound to happen. Definitely an experience to remember.

Go for an experience of awadhi cuisine at its best. To value add, the ambience which gives a feeling of retro Lucknow, makes an overall experience of relishing the food. One must try the complete course but a mere Biriyani would also leaves you spellbound. You shall definitely return to taste the next target on the menu.

Heard a lot about this place, so finally decided to visit it. Me along with three of mine friends finally landed up for a lunch get together.  Throughly impressed n had a lovely meal.  The Interior decoration transport you to old Lucknowi ambience with light gazal playing in the background. Had Galawati kabab which will just melt in your mouth along with Lucknowi paratha.  Though the kabab was bit bitter to taste,  could not understand why so. Maybe because of the minced spices or something else.  Donot know if another patron felt the same taste. But overall it was tasty. The Raan biryani was just too good.  Very stuble flavour with zero amount of oil. Which is really surprising. Even the Soda sikhanji n the kulfi for the dessert was very tasty.  Best part is you donot have to take gelusil even after a heavy Awadhi meal.

I have seen a few negative reviews despite this being one of the most well known restaurants in the city. I have fortunately found this place to live up to its reputation. Lets check the takeaways from the restaurant-

1.Food- Excellent. I have had a variety of kebabs here, all being sumptuous to say the least. I specially loved the kakori and the galwati kebab. The galwati kebab almost reminded me of lucknow. I absolutely loved the nargisi kofta and the combination of lucknow paratha with that. For food something between 4.5 to 5/5

2. Ambiance- Outstanding. The dim lighting, the slow thumri and gazals, the authentic crockery all adds up to creating a perfect setting. I must rate it 5/5

3. Service- Only thing that I found is in need of some supervision is the service. I wouldn't say it is bad, but the staff tend to hurry way to much and it feels like they just want us to finish up and leave as soon as possible.

4. Price- This place is priced slightly steep when compared to other places who offer mughlai/biriyani. But if we take note of the quality of food, it is completely worth it. You will know you have spent well when your eyes close with delectable comfort after you have the first bite of the kebabs

To begin with, the starters served here are mouth watering.. Have tried their mutton burrah kebab and galawti kebab with Lucknowi paratha.. yummmm... In the main course, had the Raan Biryani once earlier which we completely loved. But the Moti Biryani was nothing great, not very tasty.. However the quantity is huge, more than enough for 2 persons. For dessert, shahi tukra would be a good choice.. Service is very good..

An authentic restaurant at the heart of South Kolkata serving excellent Mughlai cuisine. In starters, the kabab platter is a must try. If interested in ordering separately then the "Fish Sugandhi mahi" is a fish lovers delight. The galauti kebab is another must try dish (unfortunately it failed to tickle my taste buds at an exquisite level, however my friends loved it). The kasmiri parota goes well with it. Coming to main course the first thing as must try is the "Raann Biryani" with shredded mutton pieces. Its so yummilicious that it almost melts away in your mouth. We also ordered the Awadhi hundi biryani, which was ok, however it was nowhere as delicious as the Rann biryani. The gaajar halwa and specially the kulfi are worth mentioning in the dessert section.
Overall had some excellent food in a nawabi ambience.

Went there yet again yesterday for lunch :) It was the last day of the festival! As the two of us reached early, we had to put our hunger to rest for some time before the awesome food was actually provided. We enjoyed a Badam Sharbat (perfect one again!) till then along with the ambience which was no less than 'Awadhi'. The decor, the dimly lit area, the thumri songs being played, all added to the beauty of it all!
We ordered Gosht Bhuna Khichri for myself (of which I have heard very good reviews, so wanted to try it) and Awadhi Palak Biryani for my veg friend :P Also a Murgh Chaap and Onion salad.
After sometime of waiting, it was delivered fresh and hot and aromatic! Both the dishes, the khichri and even the palak biryani were too good to say the least! Loved the Khichri more :D with mutton pieces almost in every serve of the spoon, although quantity cud have been a bit more :P And frankly speaking, never had I thought that Palak biryani could taste so good :P The quantity of the biryani was very good indeed, unlike the khichri. The Murgh Chaap tasted bleak and not properly cooked, might not have been quite fresh. This was the only negative of our overall experience.
We also ordered Kulfi Falooda and Shahi Tukra for dessert, both of which were very good again.
Specially the Shahi Tukra was awesome! Being a sweet tooth, I urge others to taste the Shahi Tukra for sure :) Total bill amount was around 1470, which was around what we expected.

Overall ambience and food quality : Excellent!

This restaurant actually serves unique Awadhi food. We went there on 2nd July, to taste the special menu of the Awadhi biriyani festival range. We ordered Shahi paya Biriyani which contained flavoured biriyani rice along with two huuge mutton leg pieces. Apart from that, the murgh biriyani tasted much better than its counterparts served in other restaurants. The Mutton Rogan Josh was good, but nothing awe-inspiring.The best part of the food is its tempered flavour-not to spicy, not at all bland; but a perfect blend of spices. From the experiences of my earlier visits; I would recommend one to try their Galawati kebab with lukhnowi or Laccha paratha; and their raan biriyani; which is truly amazing.Also try their Nargisi Kofta and Nehari Khaas.

Another one of those places which has been on my wish list for a long time, and I finally got a chance to visit a few days back. I am very pleased with the service I got there, to begin with.
The decor is one that strikes your attention as soon as you enter the restaurant. Awadhi style interiors with similar chairs and tables, with ghazal style music playing in the background. The place is spacious and dimly lit, perfect for a private lunch/dinner with family/friends. They took the interior decoration very seriously, as I noticed that even the AC's were coloured accordingly to match the theme.
Coming to the food, here's what we ordered: Gulab Sherbet, Soda Sikanji (I wanted the lime aerated drink initially but it was unavailable), the very renowned mutton galawati kebab, Lucknowi paratha (which was recommended by the waiter with the kebab), murgh pardah biryani and murgh irani.
The gulab sherbet was light, mildly fizzy and refreshing. A very good drink to start your meal with. However, I did not like the soda sikanji. The spices were not mixed properly, and it also seemed a bit overpriced for that simple a drink.
The mutton galawati kebab was delightful. It was so soft that it almost broke while the waiter served it to our plates. It simply melts in your mouth, and with the first bite I knew why it is such a popular dish here. It was served with caramelized onions which I also liked very much. The lucknowi paratha, which was suggested, was a really good addition. The soft, light, layered paratha brought a new dimension when eaten with the kebab, which we would have missed had it not been suggested.
We were already more than half full by the time we finished the appetizer. Then came the main course, murgh pardah biryani. A clay pot was brought to the table, which was sealed at the top with a curtain made probably with dough (I'm not sure though), the reason why which it derives its name. The curtain was opened right before us and the biryani served to our plates. The aroma itslef, of desi ghee and all the right spices was very appealing. The rice also tasted wonderful. It was light on the stomach and the flavours were not overpowering. The chicken was soft, juicy and well marinated. The murgh irani was an okay-ish dish. Though the chicken was very well cooked, the gravy was a little bland. Lacked a certain punch of flavours you generally associate with awadhi cuisine.
We would have ordered dessert, but the quantity of all the dishes being pretty good we were too full and so we skipped it. 
The thing I was most pleased with was the staff behaviour. They were very polite and well behaved. We wanted to change the table where we were first seated since it was too close to the door and the managers desk, and they shifted us at once without any questions. The manager himself came to our table to ask if all the dishes were all right, as did the waiter who was waiting on us.
Overall, I'm satisfied with my experience, and I'd revisit. Recommended.
Thumbs up to the entire Oudh 1590 team 👍

Awadhi biriyani was very delicious and quantity was plentiful. Two pieces of mutton, two eggs , plenty to feed two people.
Twice the quantity of Arsalan's biriyani.
It's served in a handi.
The Irani chicken is creamy and thick.
The butter naan is crispy and thin, the best I ever had.
Raan biriyani was okay, I would prefer the awadhi biriyani.
I went during the Durga puja's time, maybe due to the rush the raan biriyani didn't taste well.
The place has a royal decor and it has a mughal feel to it.

I would not say their secret is the delicious recipes, rather I think they truly have a time machine, in which you can travel to the realm of the Nawabs. From the very 1st step in the restaurant till the last you will feel as if you are in the palace of Lucknow with dancers showing their ethereal performances and singers singing "Thungri's". 
Now regarding the food, I will not waste many words rather describe it as mouthgasmic, delectable and worthy of gourmandise. And the good food is complemented by the amiable behavior of the staffs with their valuable recommendations. We went their mainly to enjoy the "Biriyani festival" and had there "Mutton Galawati Kebabs", "Lucknowi Paratha" (recommended), "Shikari Bater Biriyani", "Gomti Mahi Pulao" and "Firni". Thus, I am fully satisfied with the culinary skills and environment of this restaurant and advice everyone to visit this place atleast once.

Want to feel like a nawab for an hour or two? Visit Oudh 1590. Once u enter here u r no more in Kolkata. Dim lights, ghazals, thumri playing in the background, furnitures decorations the glass the plates and moreover the attire of the waiters makes u feel a culture which existed in Awadh during the Sultanate or Mughal period. Trust me its an absolute pleasure just visiting this place in itself. 

Now coming to the food. We ordered a plate of mutton galawati kebab with lucknowi paratha, rann biriyani and aam khaas. The kebab goes perfect with the paper thin non oily lucknowi paratha. Galawati kebab is an authentic awadhi dish. Very well prepared here. And what to say about the rann biriyani. Trust me u wont feel the absence of potato. U'll find shredded peices of mutton in every spoon of biriyani that will melt in ur mouth with a mild flavour of desi ghee. Its a foodies delight! I strongly recommend evryone to visit this place. I m sure u'll love it. Quantity is more than sufficient for two average eating people and compared to the quantity and quality the rates are justified.

Oudh 1590 is a typical awadhi style restaurant located close to the Carmel School near Lake Mall.Located in one of the bylanes it might be a difficult find for people not from the locality.
The 1st thing which catches your attention is the ambience. Dim lights and waiters dressed in black and soft and soulful awadhi music in the background is excellent.
The moti biryani which had minced meatballs was beautiful and so was the quantity.It was served is a "handi".The best dish was obviously the galawati kebab.the meat was succulent spices excellent and it tasted yum.The best dish by a mile.We also had kakori kebab but i felt the spices overpowered the dish though the meat itself was very well cooked.
The service was very good and the waiters were courteous and explained the dishes which was good.
The only negative for me was the price which was a little too steep for college goers like me but then the galawati kebab made up for it :)

Awesome Mughlai food. 
Matching ambience to give a Lucknow Nawabi feel.
Trying Biriyani is a mandatory. And so are kebabs. Yummy! :-)
But, pricing is on a higher side. Not really for regular visits.

Bored of visiting regular Biryani Outlets..? Well, Oudh 1590 is a well Awadhi themed restaurant with nice wooden decors and well manner staff which sets the mood for a feast.
Been there a couple  of times and the food is unique and very different from regular Mughlai restaurants.
One must try the excellent kebab preparations.My personal favourite is to start with Galawati  Kebab and Lucknowi Paranthas..!
The Biryanis are again a must try...! Served in Clay pots and enough portion for two..The Awadhi handi Biryani is yumm and has different taste with  Zero oiliness.
One can also try the lachcha parantha and  Gost bhuna/Nehari Khaas combination.Again,One of my favourites in Oudh.
Overall a great place to revive your fetish for Mughlai/awadhi cusine..Prices bit on higher side which I guess works..!

Mutton Galawati kebab, biriyani, tengri kebab... I will never forget the taste of these from oudh even if i suffer from memory loss!! And I am definitely not exaggerating. Excellently cooked, with perfect balance of all the spices..very different yet authentic traditional biriyani.. Oudh is a MUST TRY even for those who do not like mughlai cuisine!

Sincere apologies for thinking that the place had anything to offer for vegetarians. Had galoti kabab which was decent. Dal makhani was strange and biryani was sweet. And don't dare to taste the falooda kulfi. Overall food was short on expectations-overdose of blandness and annoyingly sweet. Not visiting it again.

One of the best place i have visited so far in terms of food,ambience,welcoming by the staff.. Everything was 10 on 10.. The ambience takes u to that era of kings n nawabs of Lucknow.. The music totally sets the mood.. The utensils,food r simply wow.. A must visit for the foodies.. And compared to the quality of food n everything the pocket pinch is quite affordable.. @Asit Karan

“The Great Awadhi Biryani Festival” at Oudh 1590 is back and this time it is bigger ,better and tastier than before. With their magnificent ambiance and hospitality Oudh 1590 has been hosting this lip smacking Biryani festival with lot of enthusiasm and pride. Brain child of Mr. Shiladitya Chaudhury & Mr. Debaditya Chaudhury (Partners, Oudh 1590) along with Chef Mansur Ahmed have put in a lot of effort to bring back the lost flavors of Awadhi delicacies through their initiative and transport us to the Nawabi culinary delights.

This place in Southern Kolkata is totally worth the money if you are looking for a Afghani/ Nawabi cuisine. The ambience, music, interiors and the staff everything gives you a proper Mughal kinda feel. So thumbs up for that.
To talk about their food, I ordered the Galawti kabab, Zafrani kabab and Tandoori Chicken which were mouth watering delicious. The Galawti kabab could easily be the best in town. The Main course as in the Biryani was comparatively a notch below compared to the starters. But the Bhuna Gosht was very spicy and tasty. I would any day recommend ppl to order that. All in all the everything was very good and I had a good experience just for the fact that I had difficulty in finding the restaurant because the Zomato directions made me reach a different place some 500- 700 metres away. That was the only blemish. Still a big Thumbs up ✌👍👍👍

The much awaited Biryani Festival of Oudh 1590 is back and has set the foodies and blogger of the city of joy into a frenzy of joy. Orchestrated by Mr Shiladitya Chaudhury & Mr Debaditya Chaudhury and master chef, none other than Janaab Mansur Ahmed, the festival took off on the 3rd of June and is scheduled to go on until the 3rd of July.

Lovely ambience. Feels like a Nawabi place. Food is served quickly, so it's a bonus if you're starving. Galouti Kabab is brilliant. Best dish of the restaurant by a mile. Biriyani and other kebabs are good too, but nothing matches Galouti. All in all, a very good place. Must visit.

What is the single food item we love the most? A dish that can be had on its own? A dish which doesn't require a starter, side dish or a dessert ? A dish which doesn't require even an introduction? Well, that has to be either a pizza or a biryani. Though to be honest both are best enjoyed with a glass of carbonated drinks, yet for me both are essentially a on dish meal & somehow the biryani gets a bit more preference when I am looking for a simple dinner. Now we, the Kolkatan are accustomed to a specific type of biryani which we swear by. It's the modified version of hyderabadi biryani sans some typical southern spices & with the addition of the unmistakeable boiled potato. In fact the potato has become such an integral part of our biryani we can't even imagine biryanis without the potatoes. However as outlets of other cuisines opened up in Kolkata we got to taste the varieties of biryanis previously unheard of by the common people. The Awadhi Biryani, Daryabadi Biryani, Sindhi Biryani, Kachhi Biryani & even the authentic Hyderabadi Biryani were like revelations to our eyes regarding what biryani could be!
Among all these new tastes, one that was sure to attract our noses & tastebuds alike was surely the Awadhi styled Biryani. Originally from Lucknow, some of the outlets even went so far as to bring down specialist chefs to prepare this particular styled Biryani. One such outlet 'Oudh 1590' definitely deserves a special mention. Not only the chef, they even styled their restaurant after Awadhi style. As you enter the outlet the intricate woodworker ceilings & the paintings depicting 'baijees' will surely transport back you to the pre-british era when only the royals would get treated to such a magnificent spread. Not only the décor even the music played over the music system is specially curated to set the mood with all those ghajals & thumris which most of us haven't heard in our lifetime yet can connect with the mood instantly. However do note that although the dim ambient lighting perfectly complements the overall environment it's a nightmare for all the foodgraphers & selfie freaks out there. As if this is a silent word of caution to them, enjoy the excellent food, pictures are a secondary item.
Now as I already said, Oudh 1590 has earned a legendary tag for its awadhi cuisine, specifically for its gekawati kebabs & biryanis, it had been on my wishlist for quite a long time. My friends had been pestering me for quite a long time to pay them a visit. A dinner was definitely on the cards, however when the the management invited me over for a bloggers meet & a food tasting session on occasion of the 'Awadhi Biryani Festival' it came as quite a pleasant surprise. This wasn't to be missed at any cost.
As we entered the outlet we were quite impressed by the décor, as I have said earlier it perfectly matches that of a 'mahal' from Lucknow. The restaurant comfortably seats around sixty, however it's mostly filled to the brim during rush hours, so prior reservation is definitely recommended. As we took our seats we were served glasses of aam panna. To say the truth it was a tad bit too sweet & missed the real tang which is expected of the drink. & surely when you are serving water out from brass jugs, surely you can serve the welcome drink in a brass/stone tumbler instead of the standard glass. Anyway that surely wasn't to be any important thing, as the star attraction of the evening was to be Awadhi Biryanis specially prepared by masterchefs flown down from Lucknow. We were eager to taste them. & as they arrived one by one, boy, weren't we impressed. We got try a number of varieties from the special menu, a brief review of which is given below. However a word of caution, each & every item was mind blowingly delicious, judgement given is comparing one item to another. To say the truth even the worst item I tried would surely win hands down when compared to the biryanis served by the so called biryani specialists of Kolkata. May be that has something to do with the 'awadhi' cuisine as a whole. Whatever that may be my review is as follows:

Yakhni Gosht Biryani:
Yakhni is simply a class of foods which contain the stock or broth as the base. Although sometimes erroneously considered a prominent Kashmiri variant its actually prevalent in wide parts of Southern Asia ranging from Balkans to Northern Indian areas including Arabic, Greek, Israeli, Turkish & even Bulgarian cuisines. This variety of the Biryani consisted of mostly white long grained rice with some coloured rice here & there & chunks of well cooked goat meat cooked in the broth itself. The smell of ghee was predominant; absence of dalda could be surely felt. This was the closest to the biryani we are used to. The meat was soft & flavourful & absence of the boiled potato couldn't be felt to be honest.

Subz Kofta Biryani:
Next to arrive at the tables was this. To be honest, vegetable biryanis aren't something one really looks forward to, & majority of the outlets make do with basically what one can mostly call a vegetable Pulao. But this one was different. A superb smelling rice with balls of mashed veggies popularly known as Kofta, this one can give even non-veg Biryanis a run for the taste. The koftas were expertly cooked with the mashed veggies encapsulating pieces of mewa & the rice although tasting a bit sweet from the Kofta yet being able to maintain the true flavours of biryani. Once again the smell of ghee was predominant, but who's complaining?

Gosht Bhuna Khichri:
Now who expects Khichri amidst a biryani spread? Moreover, who in his wildest dreams would imagine that a Khichri would trump biryani in terms of taste? I for one wasn't expecting that. To say the truth this one was a surprise to all of us. Although a bit too oily for many, this Khichri was something like no other. Bet you haven't had a Khichri this good. Served in a miniature kadhai, I actually mistook this for a side dish to go with the biryanis. However this one, when served just blew my mind. The aroma of the small diced goatmeat will surely remind of you a standard 'khashir mangsho', which wasn't a bit overpowered by the standard biryani spices. Having this was like having homemade mutton & rice only a thousand times better. Of course like I said, the preparation uses a lot of oil to bring out the exact taste, so health conscious foodies better avoid this one, however be warned you will be missing out on the best prepared dish of the whole spread.

Gomti Mahi Pulao:
Next up was this Pulao. Once again, the long grained rice were not excessively coloured, but had a consistent mix of white, yellow & saffron rice. The fish itself is traditionally supposed to be sole fish from the Gomti river. However considering the local availability well cooked bekti is used. The twist is with the taste of bekti itself, as it is cooked with gondhoraj lime imparting the unmistakeable sweet tangy fragrance to the rice as it is marinated with the fish. The dish as a whole smells & tastes superb. To be honest this would rank second after the Khichri among all the five dishes we tried.

Keema Biryani:
After all the Gosht , Kofta & Fish Biryanis & Pulao we tried, expectations were high from this dish. However as it happens most of the time, over expecting leads to disappointment, same happened with this one. Though I must admit the keema was cooked well, being juicy & the rice flavourful, somehow this one lacked the unique awadhi touch to it, ultimately being reduced to a standard fare overall. Maybe if we hadn't had the Khichri & Mahi Pulao, this could have enjoyed a better appreciation, but served at the end of such great items, this surely couldn't impress most of the foodies.

All the biryanis were accompanied by a house special pineapple raita which was good, nothing extraordinary. I for one like a glass of fizzy drink to gulp down the generally drier biryanis. These versions were however amply moist, oily to be precise & didn't pose a problem when gulping down.

Overall the experience was great. Right from the ambience to the aroma & taste of the biryanis. However I felt they could include some awadhi styled drinks & desserts as well to go with the theme of the whole festival. However as I said, biryanis are more of a one dish meal, & can be surely enjoyed without any accompaniments. I would surely recommend the Khichri & Mahi Pulao to anyone who are yet to taste them.
The festival runs from 3-06-2016 untill 3-07-2016. So book your tables & embark on a journey of mouth watering biryanis. I am going back for the Jhinga Pulao which I couldn't try during this visit.
Till then
Happy Eating
Cheers!

When there with my family at around 9:50. Was informed about the queue before of us. Waited for almost 50 minutes to taste the food here, which I was informed tasted great. 

P. S. : If you are waiting and unfortunately among the last few people to be served, please have sky wide patience and DONT EXPECT GOOD SERVICE. 

Was given the menu and in less than a minute the waiter came to take the order. Unexpectedly rude. 

Ordered 1 Kalori kebab, 2 mutton biriyani, 1 Mugh Parda Biriyani. Both the mutton biriyani was serves cold. Very disappointed. 

The ordered Kulfi for desert. When ever I have kulfi in small roadside shops, they give the kulfi in slices as it's easy to eat and enjoy it. My friend and I were almost fighting with the spoon to make a slice of the kulfi as it was very hard and frozen. 

Please don't treat your customers like this. It's not that we are hungry that's why we came to your restaurant. We came because we wanted to taste the cuisine. 

Please inform the waiters not to rush through everything. Relax.  

Just having good ambience and music, doesn't make customers happy. 

Not a good experience.

Being North Indian i did not like this place at all. It did not taste anything like Awadhi cuisine. The same food in Lucknow tastes 100 times better. Everything was slightly sweet. Everything was a bit cold and it felt like they were items which were kept for a long time. The food was also very oily and in the chicken kassa there was just too much of masala and less chicken. The naan and paratha was chewy. The ambience was dull and the whole place was very dimly late. All the waiters looked lost. I have had much better North Indian food in Hermanus, South Africa.

Wow ,wow and more wow! Probably the only mid-priced restaurant in this city that offers authentic Mughlai cuisine. The food is absolutely sumptuous and keeps you craving for more. I especially loved the thin parathas and the heavenly Galauti Kebab. The meat was so succulent and tender ! Absolutely incredible! :)

Located opposite to deshapriya park and near the Carmel junior school,Oudh 1590 has set its position as kolkata's one of the best awadhi cuisine attraction.Went there for dinner and found the place to be dim-lighted,well themed provided with excellent hospitality.Took chicken zafrani kebabs,their house speciality mutton Awadhi handi biryani and shari tukra and firni to wind up dinner.
Food-5 out of 5
Cleanliness-5 out of 5
Staff interaction-4 out of 5
Ambience-4.5 out of 5(gave less due to low lighting which doesn't encourage photographs)
I would recommend every people who loves biryani and still thinks Shiraz or Arsalan to be the best to rethink again :)

A place to reckon if you want to have authentic mughlai food in a royal style. Right from decor to the utensils in which the food is served eberything has a touch of royalty. We ordered only main course.
Awadhi gost biriyani- the amout is sufficient for two ppl and the mutton is soft snd succulent.
Irani chicken- A beautifil dish with thick creamy gravy with blended very well with the biriyani.
Galauti Kabaab- A soft succulent kabaab comprising of minced meat which is an absolute delight.
Moti Biriyani-An absolute delight.

A wonderful culinary experience.  The Raan Biriyani was simple awesome. The Mutton Galawati kebab was extremely soft and mouth melting. The mutton Burra Kebab was well prepared but was a bit high on salt. Will surely excuse the  Chef for that small slip. The Chicken Chaap tasted a little different from the regular joints.... Was simply delicious. The Dal Makhani could have been a little better. The only dampner waa the Shahi Tukda. It  tasted really horrible. Prompt order takers, on time delivery,  excellent food and wonderful packaging would want me to place an order here... Again.... and again!!

Mood elevating ambience defines this place, it takes you straight to the luxury of nawabs and presents to you in the midst of your awe struck expression a tinge of delicious delight! Went there today with three friends, experienced their Biryani festival, had Pineapple raita, yakhni gosht Biryani(hope I spelled it right) with a curry of the waiter's suggestion. Each had out of the world taste especially the biryani, making it a signature of the place.Ending the sumptuous feast with shahi tukra was one of the best culinary decisions we ever made,making the experience worth repeating!😉

My father being a Lucknow born and brought up, we were extremely excited ,and looking forward to this. I have been there 4 times totally. And the thing that has been constant in my every visit is GALAWATI KEBAB AND LUCKNOWI PARATHA . This place has a wonderful ambience, the music going on in the background totally complements the decor and food. Partly being a Lucknow person, I have never tasted a better galawati kebab than this, anywhere else in kolkata, of course tunday kebabi in Lucknow being the best. My father was of the same opinion as well.
Besides, we had awadhi handi biriyani, which had shredded meat pieces, and indeed was tasty. The mutton nihari , again, was a great great great USP for me. I love mutton, and the preparation was totally on point. 
I am a dessert freak. Be it Asian, continental, Indian anything. I ordered for a shahi tukra. This , to my disappointment, wasn't the authentic preparation. Might be they've tried to innovate a bit. But still, it was a later of bread, and a layer of phirni corresponding . That isn't how it should be. Tastewise, it was yum, but it wasn't shahi tukra :/ 
Yet, I'd love to visit again, and try all other yummy items !!

Very popular oudhi restaurant where one can always see people seating in waiting list. I have been to there salt lake branch but found it overhyped. But this time ordered takeaway from there desopriyo branch  and everything was awesome.Since the place is always crowded one  we planned for a takeaway for which we had called them in advance. Ordered zafrani fish tikka,moti biryani ,veg biryani and handi biryani. Every thing was well prepared and delicious.

Brilliant!! I and my bro wanted to check out this place for long time and here I'm. We were well prepared with our order beforehand I.e Galawti Kebab, Lucknowi Paratha, Qamli Kebab, Lucknowi Handi Biriyani and Shahi Tukda. A perfect Galawti should be effortless in mouth and flavours of indian herbs were absolutely marvellous. Qalmi kebab is chicken leg piece grilled and hint of Desi Ghee, it's like regular grilled chicken, Lucknowi Handi Biriyani is combination of Mutton Chunk, Boiled egg and rice mutton was well cooked and the rice was just perfect, this was cooked in clay pot this was well balanced biriyani in terms of flavours light on stomach and I loved it :D then comes Shahi Tukdaaa oh my goodness, this one's one of my favourite Desserts :D it's Indian Pudding san egg, Saffron, khowa, dry fruits' flavours and minced dry fruits dude heaven tastes like Shahi Tukda only. Loved the ambience and thumri, kajri, ghazals made my day. We bro sis duo love shayari so it was great option for us. Extremely courteous staff who know their job and they are very helpful, I asked for a Handi cause I forgot to take snap of Handi Biriyani and they brought me another Handi :) the manager and staffs' hospitality is something you can mark on.. we felt like Guests and not the customers :) thanks a ton guys the only thing I want to improve is lights cause it was a hindrance for good food photographs.. we wish you all the best, keep it up and please never compromise on your quality. Oh yeah it's pocket friendly as well :)

My father wanted to taste good biriyani today and hence I suggested this place, since I've heard so much about it. And the first time experience of my parents and I was simply marvellous. We ordered Gosht Galawati Kebab, Mutton Ran Biriyani, Mutton Handi Biriyani and Gosht Rogan Josh. Everything about the place is brilliant, though a bit heavy on the pockets. The Ran Biriyani and the Galawati Kebab were the standouts for me and these two are probably one of the best in their respective genre, in Kolkata's culinary foodscape.

I had heard good reviews of this place and my expectation was high and maybe that's why I was disappointed. I am not saying that the place is bad, it's just that I was not satisfied with the food.The place is well decorated and has a lovely ambiance, you can visit both with family or with friends and it'll give you a good feel.We had ordered 5 dishes. Mutton Galwati Kabab, Mutton Kakori Kabab, their famous Raan Biriyani, Moti Biriyani and Gosht Roghan Josh. The Galwati Kabab was ordinary, but the Kakori Kabab was good and you might want to try that. I was really disappointed with both the biriyanis. They were lacking in terms of taste as well as quantity. Maybe it was the blend of spices which just did not fit in well with me. But you can go ahead and give it a try. It's definitely unique. The gosht roghan josh was excellent and the best part of the meal.The price is on the higher side if you ask me. The experience could have been better.

An awesome Awadhi experience:
Went there hungry as a in a group of 10 and ordered everything we could find sounding direct from the Nawab's kitchen. :P 
The ambience is amazing and the music will groove you into the royal culture, preparing you for the dishes slowly.. The copper cutlery are oh so good and though heavy you will love eating on those plates and those spoon will give you a royal edge. The food was way out of expectation, 1 word, AMAZING! 
Try the Raan Biriyani there.
The pan masala box will remind you of "Podipishir bormibaksho" :)
Pocket pinch: High but worth it.

They say it right "It transforms to a different era". Beautifully decorated...though the lighting could be a little brighter. Staff is extremely courteous. The food is literally to die for...the famous galouti kebab...oh so mouthwatering..the biriyani is excellent...light, aromatic...perfect mix of meat. Now coming to the price....if u r tight on budget, not a problem..just plan ur meal smartly. For example the galouti kebab n paratha is a meal in itself or the quantity of biriyani is good for 2 people...it will come around rs 500 incl. taxes for 2 people. Only con...is the long queue for table

It is a dimly lit restaurant with a nawabi feel.We ordered zafrani murg,galawati kebab,raan biriyani,mutton rogan josh and green salad.The kebabs were juz simply melting in the mouth and was really good.And if you prefer less oily and less spicy biriyani then raan biriyani is perfect.For the first time you put it in your mouth you may not feel the taste instantly but as you keep on having it your taste buds will relish the flavour.Yes it has a bit different kind of flavour compared to the biriyanis you get elsewhere.But I liked it.Now mutton roganjosh- cooked to perfection and pretty awesome.I would recommend all the mughlai food lovers to visit this place .

Medium sized very well decorated with old paintings and dimly lit with wooden works all over.The slow background gazal(singer unknown) goes very well with the ambience. I have been seeing a lot of reviews of oudh 1590 about their signature dishes and awadhi food and its one of the best restaurants of kolkata today. Very much eager to try Lucknowi Biriyani for the first time.

Foods Ordered:

Qalmi Kabab
Rann Biriryani
Tandoori Roti
Nehari khaas

The mint chutney is very tasty.

Qalmi Kabab is something one should try. Very soft and tenderly made chicken leg pieces.

Rann Biriyani is awesome. Never had such mouth watering mutton biriyani ever and they serve it in a pot. Dont go with the size of the pot. Its sufficient enough to serve three.Also had Nehari khaas and Tandoori Roti. Didnt like much Nehari khaas.Its quite spicy.

The staffs are very courteous and mainly they are all dressed in black kurta pajama. Good experience overall and its a good place for family dinner except for the fact that it is not a pocket friendly restaurant.

The best part of this place is their staff and certainly not the food which is tooooo over hyped. Decor is fine and the portions are big. Their galauti kabob and luckhnowi paranhtas which have been recommended by one and all were not so good parantha is the ordinary bengalee maida ones only thing is they are about 50% the diameter.Kabab felt like half cooked meat+masala etc given a shape and served in hurry. However their biryanis are really good with large portions. Mutton kundan kalya was also very nice. The badam sherbet again highly recommend by all was very refreshing and good. Pricing is steep and they charge separately for packing the leftovers.

Well decorated, dimly lit, and a cozy place. 
Oudh 1590 offers mouth watering awadhi delicacies with Boti kebab and lucknowi paratha being a big yes when you visit. Their biriyani is light and almost cooked to perfection.
I recommend you to visit oudh 1590 only if you're not keeping low on the budget.  
Perfect place for family dinners!

Today  we had very bad taste of Awadhi Biryani in Oudh 1590 at Despriya park.we order Awadhi Naragashi Biryani(Mutton Minced with egg) from Awadhi cusine festival which is start from 3rd June 2016.Biryani dont have any taste of Awadhi Biryani and instead of minced meat,they use golati kaba in rice.So the Biryani taste only the Golati favour.

We are fond of Biryani and Oudha Biryani preparation but sorry to taste quality of Oudha style is fading day by day.

Visited today with family and was absolutely floored at the first instance by the courtesy extended by the Staff members to make us feel at home on the Sunday afternoon. It was quite crowded and we need to wait a bit but never felt like for the attitude of the staffs....Food was equally mouth-watering, specially the Rann Biriyani, keema-stuffed Paratha and the Galauti Kebabs. Tthe last surprise came on the billing part where the cost is also quite rational. Look forward for our next visit......

My mom was requesting to visit this place for a long time and finally we decided to go last night. The restaurant is just behind Deshapriya Park on one of the by lanes which provides ample parking spaces. The service inside the place is really prompt and the waiters are really courteous. We had ordered the Mutton Galauti Kabab, Mutton Raan Biriyani, Nehari and had the Shahi Tukra for dessert. The food was ready in about 15 minutes. The kebabs were legendary and gave justice to all the reviews I had seen about it. The biriyani, though I enjoyed it, is different from the typical Kolkata Biriyani which we get at Arsalan and hence a tad bit difficult to satisfy the typical Kolkatan taste bud. The restaurant interiors are designed as a royal house during the Nawab period of Awadh (pics attached) which gives a more authentic feel to the whole experience

It's opposite Carmel primary school. By now it's one of the fine dining restaurants in Kolkata.
My first two visits here was 1 nd a half years back when they were not this popular. Happy about the fact that their food quality hasn't dropped even aftr the popularity.
Visited here again for the Awadi festival!
The ambience is awesome. Slow colloquial music, low light, traditional Rajasthani decorations. The waiters wear black sherwani to keep up the feel.
Must try:
In chicken- zafrani kebab, Afghani kebab
In mutton- Galwati kebab, Burrah kebab.
Prawn kebabs(jheenga shami kebab) taste really good in fish items.
In biriyani: Awadi sandi biriyani, Raan biriyani, gost pardah biriyani are really good!
In the Awadi festival special menu,
Shahi paya biriyani, bhuna khichadi and awadi nargisi biriyani are awesome!!
The Galwati kebabs and zafrani kebabs are one of a kind!! Never tasted better anywhere!

If you are a true biryani n mughlai food lover u must try out here... one of the best places to have biryani. Its not a pocket pinchy place but u wont regret after having the dishes here. The place is very well decorated in Lucknowi style the waiters are also well dressed. The behavior of the staffs are quite remarkable. They keep asking how the food was if not satisfied they will ask for the reasons. But the one thing that i didn't like was the queue that I had to wait for my turn- around  50-55 min. But this cud be negligible it was a Sunday evening and it stood up to the popularity of the place. I really loved the Galuati Kebab, Rann Biryani and Murg Irani... I woulkd suggest you all to try them along with other dishes too... Enjoy!!!!

I have been to their Salt Lake outlet before & was dying to taste their Raan Biriyani which i missed out last time.

Some of our school friends decided to have a reunion sort of, so i suggested the venue to be this Deshapriya Park outlet of Oudh.

We got a table after almost half an hour of waiting (probably because it was a Sunday afternoon).

Zafrani Kabab (Chicken), Awadhi Sugandhi Mahi (Fish), Moti Biriyani & Raan Biriyani ~ Finally 😋 ... were what we ordered. The starters were yummilicious, Moti Biriyani was good and The Raan Biriyani? IT WAS AWESOME 😍. I have never tasted such mouth watering Mutton Biriyani ever. 

Coming to the service part, the staffs were swift. But we had a billing issue (they seemed to be very bad in calculations - refunded us wrong balances twice - we had to explain them how the balance calculation should be) which disappointed us a bit.

But for the love of The Raan Biriyani, I am ready to go to this place again & again no matter what.

The best biriyani, hands down, went after office with a friend, ordered oudh special handi biriyani and mutton galuati kebabs, after the first bite I actually closed my eyes to saviour the moments, it was too good, ended the meal with badam lassi, and I felt like I'm full for next 48 hours. A must must visit place for all biriyani and mughlai/lucknowi food lovers. The only problem is the space, few number of tables are there only.

Location:Take the opposite lane of Lake Mall, walk for 5 mins & on the opposite of Carmel Primary School this is located. 
It is a medium sized famous Lucknow styled Mughlai restaurant. Quite famous for its signature dishes & we had to wait on a weekday night for nearly 20 mins. 
The decor is beautiful with wooden works on all sides, as if to remind us of the history of the nawabs. Ghazals of Akhtari Bai was perfectly teemed with the ambience though the volume should be louder. 
Food:We ordered Galawati kebab, raan biryani, mutton Rogan josh, green salad & aam khas. The kebab was definitely best. It indeed was delicate & melted in the mouth. It had the typical taste of spices used in lucknow to make kebabs. 
All the other items were okayish, the least impressive being the rogan josh. The aroma of the ghee coming out from biryani or rogan josh was not much appreciated. 
The staffs appointed looked like more than enough at such a small place & it was kind of disturbing. 
Over all it was a nice experience.You may try.

It was my first visit at Oudh 1590. For the 1st time visitors it can be a bit difficult to get to the place. After a small wait for 15mins, me along with my other 4 friends got our seats. Alot has been spoken about the long moustache guard, the ghazal and the folk songs, the cutlery, the interiors and decor, so lets just cut the crap. We only tried biriyanis or as it is originaly called "lucknowi pulau". The awadhi handi biriyani (normal mutton dum biriyani) and the moti biriyani. Both were differnt from the monotonous kolkata biriyani,less in zafrani flavour,mild spices and high in the aroma of ghee! The staffs were courtious. I would surely pay another visit to try the varieties of kebabs here. The management can make the place a li'l bit more comfortable in many aspects. All in all it was a good 1st time experience for our group of buddys!

This restaurant was in my wish list for a long time. Finally visited d place with some friends. The moment we entered we were awestrucked. Wow what an ambience. Absolutely marvellous. 
Location: its near lake market bus stop. walk towards gariahat from lake market taking the opposite footpath of lake mall and cross the banaleaf restaurant then take the 1st left lane. You will reach within 5min. 
Ambience: its amazing.... No words...

Food: we ordered galawti kebab, chicken qualmi kebab, murg pardha biriyani, moti biriyani, raan biriyani.
Kebabs are fantastic. It will melt in you mouth. And even though I personally am a fan of nawabi and hydtabadi style biriyani but the awadhi style dum biriyanis served by Oudh did elicited my taste buds. All biriyanis were worth trying for.
Portions: biriyani are easily sharable by two hungry stomachs. 
Staff: they are welcoming and quite helpful.
Overall experience: a wonderful place. You will want to come back again n again.
Warning: if you are not a non veg person never ever think of visiting. You will die out of smell of chicken and mutton!! Not a place for vegetarians.

Was looking for a alternative to Kolkata Nawabi food like Arsalan etc. Then chanced upon Oudh 1590 at Deshapriya park. Their Awadhi Biriyani, galowti kababs are very different. The mutton dishes rocks. They have however very little choice of drinks and sherbets. Best part is in a city like Kolkata, parking is not a problem as it is bit away from the main road. Loved the total experience.

No wonder this is the new favourite among kolkata's biriyani lovers. I can even kill for those galawti kebabs. Also the biriyani is simply mouth watering. It comes in such a sumptous amount that it surely should serve 2 people at a single serving. I loved the firni too. But the most amazing thing, apart from those galawti kebabs is their ambience. Wonderful mughal decor with dimly lit coziness, the mellow ghazals playing along...makes it perfect. Service is also very good. But whenever you go to this place, be sure to wait in a que for a pretty while! (They simply cannot help that, being so popular, u know! ;) in the meantime, u can chat with the muchhiwale darwaanjee, he is so awesome <3 )

Nice decor with Lucknowi music playing in the backgroud. We easily got a able for two of us. I have nothing to say with the food I've ordered (Lucknowi parathas with the must try galawti kabab, VEg biryani along with Paneer Qorma) and for dessert we opted for Shahi Tukra.. All were excellent.. But my onl concerned is about the seating arrangements.. The tables are so close to each other that will seriously disturb you if you are looking for your personal space but luckily it was half-empty so we were comfortable... Staffs are courteous though... Overall an excellent experience and highly recommended..

The entrance is quite grand with mughlai style decorations and design. Plus there was this big verrapan wala moustache guard who was another attraction.  😆
The interior has those mughal designs in walls with old jewellery box display with ghazal being played on record. 
The plate and glass were all of bronze and quiet very heavy. In jist they had maintained the perfect mughal effect
We had goti kabab along with lucknow paratha. I somehow didnt like the sour taste of goti kabab. We also had afghani kebab. 
In main course we had murg biriyani, gosht biriyani and awadhi special handi biriyani. Biriyani were good enf. 
In the dessert.! Firni my all time fav was definitely too good and so was kulfi with extra rose juice. 
Good experience overall except for the fact that they could not provide me with their wifi password 😜😝😁

First thing first- prices are excessively excessive. Yes,truly it is. They don't serve out of the earth dishes.
Interior designing is good, kalavati music was playing in background. A feel of mughal era, enhanced more by plates and glass of kasa.
As recommended by all, raan biriyani was ordered along with nehari khas. All was more or less average. And, this biriyani is not made in proper mughal style , I felt, rather it's modified one, preferred by "overly health conscious" people of South.
And, had to repeatedly ask many times to give water. It was not chilly at all , rather feeling quite uncomfy.

I'll go there again only and only if my girlfriend wants,otherwise a huge NO!

Well, this is one restaurant for which I was holding back my review until I got some photos, because the food is so damn awesome , I forget to take pictures every single time.

Location: Deshapriya park, just cross Tamarind and take a left turn, or ask anyone at the deshapriya park more. Everyone knows about Oudh.

If you are in for sunday dinner, then let me warn you, you'll have a tough queuing up outside while hunger pangs get the better of you. So go a bit early if u don't wanna be waiting outside for too long.

Food: Authentic lip smacking Awadhi cuisine that'll surely make u wanna come back. My personal favourites include :

Galwati kebab: Minced mutton marinated with a variety of spices, formed into 'tikki' and grilled. This preparation here will melt in your mouth. 4 pieces are served per plate. Earlier they used to serve a paratha with it. But this time around, they didn't, so I ordered one.

Zafrani kebab: Delicious

In biriyanis: I personally love their awadhi biriyani and moti biriyani( although my mom feels the 'motis' are a bit dry). I really haven't tasted any of their chicken biriyanis so cant comment on that one.

Chicken chaanp: Yum yum.
These are some of my go to dishes when I'm here but honestly, every damn thing on the menu is lip smacking.

O and I love their firni. Creamy and less sweet flavoured with kesar. The way I love it.

Staff is very polite and well behaved. Service is prompt.
Wish you a happy Royal meal! :D

Eaten different types of biryanis I am not that fond of Lucknow style biryanis. But still on visits to Calcutta I enjoy the flavors of biriyani I have grown up with. I had high hopes on Oudh after reading the reviews. The biriyani I had was not up to the mark. The chicken was dry and extremely hard. That definitely was a dampener . The kebabs were good. I ordered a mutton rezala. I remember the flavors of Sabbirs. This was no where close. Thick gravy for rezala?

I went there last Monday and was welcomed by an exquisite mughal era ambience. The decor was excellent, so was the lighting and it felt like sitting in a mughal palace and dining with a badshah. I ordered galauti kabab, qalmi kabab, raan biriyani and chicken Irani. The galauti kabab was one of the best mutton kababs I have had in kolkata- the kabab just melts in your mouth. The qalmi kabab was also good but the best of the lot was the raan biriyani. The mutton is so gently cooked that it mixes with the rice entirely and only the bone is left. The dinner is perfect with firni at the end.

The ambience decor and music sink in its essence into the food that arrives on your table. The famous Galawoti kabab hits the palate with its delicate touch. It is simply brilliant. The Mutton Rann Biriyani had chunky pieces of mutton and tenderly cooked. Its flavour was unique and soft especially to someone who has had a typical Kolkatan Biriyani( with that potato). The fish preparations were royally delicious and the metallic durbari cutlery had a beautiful effect on the whole experience. I must add that the jhinga biriyani was a pleasant surprise, it tasted very good. The service was prompt and they even helped you in making choices. Would love to visit again

Although the menu contains very limited items,quantity of a Murg\Gosht Biryani is also on the low,but the experience will be worthwhile.The ambience and the quality of food is on a higher scale which matters the most for a Bong and if you're a Awadhi\Mughlai cuisine lover,do visit here!.

Heard a lot about this place and decided to drop in one day. Decoir and ambiance are really innovative giving one the AWADI like feeling. Food is not that great. The KEBABS are a bit dry in the inside. We had GOSHT BIRIYANI which was descent lacking the smell and flavours. The FIRNI was also average. For me its an overhyped resturant of biriyani lovers.

Poor customer service with extremely rude behaviour by Mr Pal and Mr saikat, the so called operational managers of the restaurant. I would suggest families should take gaurds along with them or at least be accompanied by someone who can protect them as the managers may get really unfriendly. If you r a hard core fan and ready to face humiliation  you must visit this place. I feel the owner should really hire some customer friendly employees as after a conversation with Mr Pal and Mr Saikat I really doubt this restaurant would go a long way. I would really like to speak to the owner to give him a feed back.

Regarded as one of the best Awadhi cuisines in Kolkata, Oudh 1590 interiors will surely make you feel like you are in 1700 AD Awadhi regime. Then the Kakori kabab, Galawati kabab, Qalmi kabab will take the responsibility to take you completely into that era. The combination of Lucknowi paratha and Galawati kabab is as deadly as Tendulkar-Ganguly opening the batting for India. You will definitely cherish the beautiful aroma and taste of Awadhi handi biriyani, Moti biriyani, Raan biriyani. Don't forget to have Phirni/shahi tukra  as dessert. Last year went on the day of Durga Ashtami and the service was very good despite of the rush. Only thing it can improve is the space inside in order to cater to more people. I went there 4 times and hope to visit more & more.

What an amazing experience!The ambience of this restaurant is absolutely top notch and has a vintage feeling to it the dim lighting and musical trance - ambience- 10/10Ordered galawati kebab and lucknowi paratha ,zafraani murg kebab and fish tikka kebab for starters;the galawati kebab is the best i have ever had soft,succulent soft and full of taste,the fish tikka kebab also tasted amazing and had a smoky flavor to it and while the zafrani kebab tasted somewhat different than the rest it was still a standoutFor main course we ordered raan biriyani and gosht biriyani ; people complaining about not getting potato in biriyani i recommend to order gosht biriyani,it is the vintage kolkata special biriyani the aroma was superb and the raan biriyani had a light aroma to it ,boneless shredded mutton was also nicely cooked ,excellent food supreme taste absolute 10/10 hereAnd a special mention to the service it was prompt efficient and heartfelt 10/10I recommend every fine dining lover and especially biriyani lovers to must five it a visit guys trust me you wont be disappointed.

The place might be a little hard to find given its otherwise difficult to find location. The restaurant is a little stuffy but food compensates for all the above. The Kakori Kebab made with mutton paste is a must-try. We tried the Awadhi Biriyani and the Mutton Biriyani with Roganjosh and Rezala. The naan were soft and fluffy. Also, do not forget to conclude the meal with their delicious Firni and Kulfi Faluda. But service timing is slow and waiters are ill-mannered with lack of time-management skills!

I never really liked Oudh. Perhaps am more accustomed to the quality of Biryani, giants like Shiraz and Rahmania used produce in the erstwhile years. I have taken the trouble of traveling to this branch of Oudh for a quick parcel and have also tried take-away at their Salt Lake counters multiple times, the latter being close to my home.

Finding this place can be a bit difficult for those who are not acquainted with this area. Come in front of Lake Mall,  and then take the help of Google Maps. The place was decently sized with a huge door to get into the restaurant. The steps right at the entrance was a bit awkwardly placed, something similar to their Salt Lake counterpart. The interior was dingy and claustroprobhic. Probably trying to give it a Nawabi touch.

The staffs appeared superbusy to me and they took their own sweet time to confirm my order and then deliver them to me. Had went for a Raan Biryani and a side dish (Do not remember the name). The Biryani was served in an earthen pot, making the weight of the package a bit heavy. When I went back home and tried the Biryani, it was all dry. The rice was dry, the mutton pieces were dry as well. With no Potato (We bengalis cannot live without Potatoes in Biryani), it was hard for me to digest the Biryani on its own. The side dish, which I do not actually remember, wasn't that great and I could barely have their combination. Finally, I decided to give up and rather have a Egg Poach and Bread Toasts for my dinner. Waste of money to me it was!

This is one AMAZING place. I wonder why I visited this so late. Nevertheless the experience was wonderful.

They have a beautiful ambience of a royal palace of old Lucknow. With paintings and mirrors and heavy copper plates and glasses,oudh leaves you gaping in astonishment at every step.

The staff are very polite and the food is brilliant. We ordered qualmi kebab, chicken awadhi handi biryani and soft drinks. The kebabs were one of the best that I ever had. It was soft and perfectly cooked. The biryani was an absolute delight. The quantity was huge and it tasted brilliant. It came with two chicken pieces and two eggs and we two struggled to finish it!

The prices initially seem very high but I think its worth the experience. MUST VISIT. ^_^

... After getting excellent reviews from a few friends who are frequent visitors we decided to try Oudh . Mouthwatering food and excellent ambience (fun fact: they have painted the Air Conditioners in order to match with the over all environment) . 
Galauti kebab with Lucknow paratha is a must try, also the raan Biriyani. Service was also fantastic, people were courteous enough to come and ask about how was the food. Infact they suggested a couple of dishes.
Pocket pinch: food for 3 (which included 2 kebabs, 1 biriyan, 1 salan, 6 paratha, 3 firni) was for 2100. Over all definitely worth it.

I had been there 2 times. 1st time was a pickup order and 2nd time was a actual visit to the restaurant.. Both times i had ordered biriyanis. 1st time it was handi biriyani packed in a earthen pot as shown in the picture. This biriyani is a lot different from the arsalan biriyani. But i liked this one better than arsalan biriyani. The biriyani is light, mutton was tender, soft and well cooked, tasty. There was a mild aroma of ghee which enhances the taste of the rice in the biriyani.. 1 plate of biriyani is enough for two people.. 2nd time we tried the galawati kabab and raan biriyani and i have to say that raan biriyani is a lot better than the handi biriyani. The mutton pieces was mixed with the rice and it tasted much better than the handi biriyani. The quantity of mutton seemed more in raan biriyani but raan biriyani is enough for 1 person. I being a foodie ordered 1 entire plate of raan biriyani myself and ate it. Perfect authentic awadhi biriyani taste. Galawati kebab was awesome too. Ambience perfectly matches with the awadhi cuisines. In short, it looks royal, feels royal and tastes royal.

Well this place was in the top of my list for visiting since a long time. Finally yesterday on my birthday we decided to go there & fulfill my wish.
Ambiance : Just amazingly brilliant. The low lightings & Lucknow ghajals refresh your mood for the day in a minute.
Service : They are so helpful & polite. We had 3 heavy bags with us so they took the bags from us and let us sit properly,and placed the bags on the other chairs. Evrytym when we needed something,or in two minds of what to order they suggested generously. They served very soon too.
Food : We ordered the famous galawti kabab,chicken kalmi kabab along with lacknow paratha.The galawti kabab just melted in my mouth and the taste was very unique and different from the other kababs we generally have. It was soft,tender and very tasty but light in spice. The kalmi kabab was four leg pieces. That tasted good too. The paratha combined very well with the kabab. Next we ordered the awadhi handi biriyani..that came in a handi,and they served very neatly .The biriyani tasted so delicious and yet having a very much different taste from our l Kolkata biriyani. It contained two big mutton pieces and two eggs,but no potato. I missed the potatoes really. ok,now the mutton was cooked well & so soft. The biriyani was full of flavors but it didn't tasted too oily or rich. The essence of kewra jal,mitha atar was missing from it...I think that is what creats a big difference between Lucknow biriyanis and the biriyanis in Kolkata. We had Nehari Khaas along with the biriyani...yet a flavourful one..with 4 mutton pieces and gravy. I loved it so much that wanted to order one more..but we were so full. We had to skip the dressert as there was no place left to have one.

So a big thanks to Oudh 1590 for a heavenly tour to their food,and making my birthday extra memorable. I wanna go back to this place again very soon.

The slow gazhal and sometimes the Lucknow gharanas will grab the mood to a swing. I give thumbs up for all the ambiance and attire of servicemen.
But the starters and the quality of the main was below average. Had high expectations of getting TITAS,the koyel bird roast. Unfortunately it was available only during the kabab festival.

Oudh 1590: A place that takes you to the Mughal ages through its ambiance and its wall paintings. Lighting , plates and other decors give an awesome feeling about Royalty. As for the food, I have never tasted such biriyani before. Its so flawless. Kakori kabab, gulawati kabab adds more delight to the flavors. You might feel the price is a bit high, but its worth it, so  its a must for all.

Undoubtedly the best hospitality I have ever came across. Coming to the food Galawati Kabab is a must , tried the Awadhi Biryani but not sure if that is the best they give. I didn't like it much compare to the biryani at other places in Kolkata. Planning to revisit once more to experiment some other stuffs.
To the 'Oudh' please keep it open for whole days on weekends and holidays. Just for the time issue I had opportunity to eat with u only once.

Love to visit more and more for Mutton Rogan josh

After hearing a lot about this place, finally decided to spend the saturday night (23-04-2016) with a hearty dinner at Oudh 1590. Reached at 9:15pm and was not at all surprised to see a long queue of people waiting to feast upon. The entrance, the doorman with a thick curly moustache, the waiters in long black kurtas, my expectations from this restaurant grew stronger. Due to the long queue I had to register myself and kept waiting for an hour. Due to the rush near the entrance, I and my friend waited across the road. Since it was long enough I approached the doorman and to my utter surprise I found that they had already let people waiting behind me to enter. When enquired, he vaguely said that he had looked for me and as I was not around he let others enter, which was again fine with me. But the next thing made me go mad when he said he would allow me to enter once all the guests were seated. This was unfair! But still I had kept my calm and waited for my turn. It was already 11.

Finally, I got to enter "Oudh 1590". It was poorly lit inside and it was being difficult to mind the steps. Just as I took the seat around the corner, the waiter came in a hurry and took the order and warned that it was the final order as the kitchen was closed. We ordered Mutton Galawati Kabab with Lucknowi Paratha, Awadhi Handi Biryani and Gosht Bhuna.

The order was served in a moment. The Mutton Galawati Kabab was the worst thing I had tasted in my life. It was nothing close to what I had had ate earlier at other kabab joints. I don't know what it was but it tasted like something mashed together which nowhere tasted like mutton. The only thing I could smell was something utterly filled with rich spices which instantly numbed my taste buds. However, the paratha was upto the mark which came as a relief. 

The utensils were very sticky and oily. With no choice left, I had to order mineral water so that I could sip from the bottle itself.

Finally when the biryani arrived, I could not wait anymore and asked the waiter to serve it. It smelled good but the taste was nowhere around the kind of biryani we are used to have at other reputed joints in kolkata. It tasted very rich and overly spiced. The oil content was also very high. Believe me, I had to leave my food without having it completely. The Gosht Bhuna was also very average type. 

Finally I decided not spend much more time here and asked the waiter to pack my remaining Gosht Bhuna which again turned out to be a nightmare when I had it once I was back home. The preparation was cooked in Dalda which was really disappointing. If places like "Oudh 1590" cook using Dalda oil, then the regular eateries are well upto the standards with them.

Overall, a very bad experience. I had also provided my feedback to the manager over there. I do not know if I would be back at "Oudh 1590" again. 

The other chain of restaurants of the owner of Oudh have pretty well kept themselves upto the mark with popular restaurants in kolkata. But Oudh 1590 was utterly disappointing.

Oudh is one of those exquisite places which is one of its kind. It has been in my wish list for over than a yr but for some reasons or the other I was not able to go. Finally went there with a lot of anticipation on last Sunday. I made the mistake of not making a reservation and as a result had to wait for a good 15 mins before we could grab a seat. 

Ambiance is the thing that sets this restro apart from others. The dim light, chandelier from the ceiling, wooden panelled walls decorated with colorful hues and the huge mirrors everything gives the vibe of a bygone mughal era. Even the backgrounf music was apt and created a romantic atmosphere. The huge mirrors on the walls gives the false notion of the place being a bigger one than it actually is. The furnitures and decoration everything has been done keeping in mind the theme. Even the crockeries were of kansa as we Bengalis call it. 

Now coming to food I was very sure of what to order and immediately ordered Badam sharbat and aam khas along with Mutton galawati kebab. Soft mutton balls which melts in your mouth. Recommend. The Badam sharbat was so good we actually ended up ordering another glass. For the main course we had Chicken awadhi biriyani which comes with 2 pieces of chicken and 2 eggs.( no aloo.:( this is the only thing that I did not like cz I am one of those Bengalis who savours  each and every bite of the aloo served with biriyani). Next came lucknowi parathas and we had it with the chutney provided with the kebabs which was really good. I wanted to order for side dishes as well but could not due to stomach constraints. Lastly we went for sahi tukda which justified it's name to the utmost. Kulfi falooda was not available sadly. Next time I go there I will make it a point to have the nehari khas. 

Overall  there is absolutely nothing that I can complain about. Service is again wow. The waiters are well acquainted with the menu and helps out willingly. Presentation of food is another factor i was impressed about. Even the presentation of pan masala was unique. This proves how keen they are about each n every detail of fine dining. I loved each moment of being there and would love to go there again n again.

After hearing a lot about the place finally decided to check it out and went for lunch. With the scorching sun and abnormal heat in this summer making life miserable, the ambiance and the theme music of this place will surely bring some cool breeze to your soul. The stuffs were courteous and helpful. However there is room for improvement to match with the theme (just not dress).
Coming to the food, we ordered Galawati Kabab with paratha. And it was was splendid! Simply superb! Ordered Nawabi Kabab Platter as well. The Gosht burrah was more of bones burrah. The kakori kabab in the platter was great. In the main course we had Awadhi handi biryani and Gosht bhuna. Both made justice to the reputation of the place. A perfect mix of spices and oil.
Forgot to mention about the Aam (mango) khaas..It was completely synthetic and even the glasses were sticky. Authentic mangoes (at least in this summer) were expected!

It was a bit hard to locate, but once you spot it..you will fall in love with it, right from the gate. Its almost like time travel..the food, the ambiance the staffs..everything will take you to the Awadhi era...the Galouti kabab will always remain my favourite along with the bread they serve. Biriyani was good, but since I am used to the Calcutta style biriyani, I could not just fall in love with the biriyani though

Oudh 1590 has done a great job in recreating a typical Mughal ambience. The facade, the doorman with a thick curly moustache, the waiters in long back punjabis, the interiors, the foods, and the way they are served, everything is quintessentially Mughal.

So one day when 5 of us friends decided to go to this restaurant, we did have a splendid dining experience in store for us. It was Sunday, and we went there early in the evening to avoid a long queue. It does get crowded late in the evening.

AMBIENCE: As the doorman politely welcomed us, and took us inside, we felt like we've never been to any such restaurant before. Although the place is small, but has been smartly managed with large tables, and comfortable soft-cushioned sofas and chairs. The walls in wooden patters, adorned with beautiful Mughal paintings, vessels, treasure box, everything added to the uniqueness of the place. We were in real awe of the place. 

FOOD: We ordered the famous GALAWATI KEBAB, and CHICKEN AFGHANI KEBAB for starters, and both were marvellous. The chicken afghani kebab wasn't much spicy, but it almost melt in my mouth.

Next we ordered 4 types of biriyanis: AWADHI HANDI BIRIYANI, MOTI BIRIYANI, MURGH PARDA BIRIYANI, and the Kolkata famous MURGH BIRIYANI that came with a big piece of potato.

All the biriyanis were excellent. But the Murgh Parda Biriyani was extraordinarily good, full of spices and flavour. It is highly recommended. In comparison the Murgh Biriyani was a little dry and bland.

Service was on time. The quantity is as satisfactory as the quality.

CONCLUSION: Oudh 1590 is a wonderful Mughal themed restaurant. The biriyanis they serve are exceptionally good, and will definitely satisfy your hunger, and taste buds together. On top of that, the prices are decent. The bill came around 2200 for the 5 of us. Don't think, just visit this.

I had heard a lot about it and finally had the chance to pay a visit. It's a little tricky to find if you're coming from the Rashbehari side. But after asking a few locals, we found the place. We were shown to a table in the corner and it seemed ill-lit. It's charming in the main dining place but the corners are pretty dark. The decor is Lucknowi and they play appropriate music in the background.

Coming to the food, we ordered the full Murgh Tandoori. The juicy pieces had gold leaf adornments and came on a bed of pickled onions. My friend didn't like it but I did- the rose water, attar taste of the Murgh needed something acidic and the onions served well in that respect.

The Awadhi Handi Biriyani came in a earthen pot covered with wicker lid. I won't say the portion is huge but two is sufficient for three hearty eaters, I would say. The flavor was top notch- subtle hints of aromatics, plenty of ghee and there were generous pieces of mutton. 

We ordered a butter naan and murgh irani. The Naan, even though it says is made with whole wheat, it was clearly made with refined flour (maida). And it was leathery and not fluffy at all. Don't try it. The salaan had two big pieces of chicken and the gravy was thick and creamy but the chicken was not very tender. So, I would suggest stick to biriyani and kebabs here.

The staff are all dressed well in silk kurtas and are quite gracious. My boyfriend lost his wallet and they all searched for it until they found it (he had dropped it on the way to the restroom). If you want Kolkata Biriyani, stick to your Shiraz and Arsalan. But for proper Lucknowi biriyani, there is no alternative to Oudh.

First of all.... when you enter Oudh 1590 the first thing that catches your eye is the elegant, classic traditional North Indian decor. More like a Rajput Haveli. The music playing in the background was classical, creating a perfect ambience for such a place. Now comes the main thing, 'the food'. In my opinion the must have dishes would be Raan Biriyani, Nehari Khaas.... I am sure there are many more...but i loved these dishes. The ambience and the service was excellent. Will definitely visit them soon.

So about food.... we had biriyani, chicken chap and chicken kasha.... we didn't like the chap that much but biriyani and rezala was chummeswari. Quantity of rice was not enough for the heavy eaters and side dishes came with two large pieces....
Saffs were friendly...dont forget to notice the moustache of the gate-keeper.
Definitely going to visit again.

It was poila boishak and we decided to order food from Oudh via Swiggy.The delivery was really really fast.It took hardly 20 mins.The packaging was too good.They even wrapped a cling film over the containers ! Very impressive ! We had ordered a plate of galawati kebab and gosht biryani.The galawati kebab was fantastic and the hype about it is totally justified.But the biryani....the potato was stale and the flavor of the biryani was really weird.Seemed it had been sitting out in the open since morning.Very bad.I was really impressed with the kebabs but the biryani ruined the experience.

I've been here a couple of times. The ambience is amazing, as is the quality of food. The space is a bit cramped in this outlet, which leads to long, serpentine queues of customers every evening. The prices, too, are quite high, nevertheless, the taste is truly memorable. 
Mutton galawti kabab, Lucknowi paratha and nehari khaas happen to be our standard order at Oudh. Will have to try out the Shahi Tukra here, have heard a lot of praises for it.

Oh what to say about this place. The moment you step in through those heavy doors it just catapults you back in time. The dim lights, the  rainbow coloured glasses, the mughal paintings, the entire decor gives you a royal feel. Add to it the thumris playing in the background. Coming to the food,  the biriyani was brilliant. The kebabs were delicious. Definitely an unforgettable experience. The staff was friendly and hospitality is something that one cannot complain about. Must visit for all the biriyani lovers.

Very nicely done up place, good service, I'm personally fond of mughlai food on the aggressive taste side and that's what I got. Biryani was wonderful and had a fresh flavour.

Oudh 1590 is now a highly acclaimed place basically known for excellent mughal cuisines. The ambience of this place is no doubt perhaps one of the best in the city. It gives the feel of typical Awadh....from the interiors to the cutlery everything just falls in place to give a awadhi feel. With courtetous staff and prompt service this place is well administrated. Unfortunately the food didn't live upto the expectations. Have been hearing a lot about the authentic awadhi cuisine they serve, I took my friends to this place as they wanted to have authentic awadhi food. They ordered Galaowti Kabab and were utterly disappointed as this did not match to what they had at Lucknow. They also ordered Raan Biriyani,  which was good...Firni was not bad either. Over all experience was kinda so so.

Oudh 1590 is a type of a restaurant where the ambience and the food both gets the same marks. I went there during durga puja,2014. My waiting list number was 43! So keep this in mind during puja,I suggest,an early reservation will be more comfortable. The taste of awadhi biriyani is seriously unique. I loved their food!

Food quality is very nice.. a must try is awadhi biriyani its served in a traditional mughal way.. Ambience is superb here, when you will enter d place ul get to listen traditional tune of 'Lucknow Gharana' a little light and darkness makes the ambience more special, servers also dressed up in a traditional Mughal outfits.. interiors are well designed, lamps, potraits and paintings are seriously appreciable.. Dont miss the Kebabs and Biriyani which is most special here.. I had mango panna here which is also very refreshing for summer time.. 
Zomations oudh 1590 is the best place to have Mughal Dishes..

If you can talk of a resturant which takes its food seriously, it is Oudh
The best part is a lovely absence superbly complemented with a young efficient and friendly staff. Saikat their manager had shown wonderful hospitality and made the evening memorable
Coming to food, the kebabs are cooked wonderful. Try the partha, and it made the kebabs taste few tads better
amazing value for money, great hospitality and a beautiful ambience. Would like to celebrate great kebabs here many many times.

I have literally recommended this place to everyone I know. Everything about this place is awesome. From the great ambience to the food to the ghazals they play. If you are among the people who like conversations over food with Begum Ghazals, this place is for you. The biryani over here is the best in Kolkata and also the starters and the desert. True mughal ambience and equally great food. Loved the place. Must go!

A place everyone was raving for their biryani, landed me to Oudh 1590. Went around 10pm and the place was jam packed. Had to wait for 30 mins to get a seat and it was well worth the wait.

The restaurant specialises in Awadhi cuisine and the ambiance matches with the name. It has a royal feel to it. Service was great despite being crowded and they warned us well before that the food will take some time to be served. That is indeed a good gesture from them.

Now coming to the food, we ordered shahi dahi kabab, Awadhi palak biryani, Lucknowi paratha, lacha paratha, subz kofta qalia and subz makhan masala.

Shahi dahi kabab was too good. Excellent starter from the vegetarian selection. Indian breads were well made. Subz makhan masala was rich and had great flavors. Subz Kofta qalia was disappointing. Had a strong overpowering taste of turmeric and saffron. Looked like the spices were not completely cooked. The show stealer however was the awadhi palak biryani. It was something i have never tried before. The flavors were magnificent and is a must try dish.

Prices are pretty good given the quality of food and is a must visit place is Kolkata.

Oudh 1590 should focus on the service part. On 9th April I visited the place for lunch.  First of all we had to wait for 45 mins. 
After having Qalami kabab and Galawati kabab as starters we ordered biriyani.
When biriyani was served our plates were bit dirty with the bones of the chicken kabab.
We asked for serving biriyani in another plate. However to my surprise the boy picked up 2 chicken bones from my plate with his hands and placed it in the plate where all the spoons were kept. And served biriyani in the same dirty plate over the green chatni.
Not acceptable. Its highly unhygienic. My friend started laughing and asked me is it oudh 1590 or Sona boudir jhupri bhaater hotel. 
That was really humiliating.
And taste of the ghost biriyani was pathetic 
I would request you to visit any take away counter of haji ali and learn some technique of preparation of biriyani.
That was my first visit to your restaurant, perhaps my last visit too.
And please visit Hindustan hotel which is located in gurab in NH2 and learn how to prepare kabab
I really don't understand what happened to people of Kolkata giving such a good rating in zomato. Come on people of Kolkata jag utho.
Your food quality is below average.
At least focus on the service.
However interior is really really good appreciate the work of the designer 
Prices are also too high in comparison to the quality and service.
For one 12 Rs thumps up you charged 65+vat+service tax
And for one fresh lime soda you charged 110+ vat+service tax
Super pathetic

Food was fine but service was very bad... Most of the items in the menu was unavailable. In fact they gave the spoon and fork by throwing them on the table....
Neither did they change the plates after the starters... Served in the same plate after keeping the leftovers(chicken bones) aside...

The latest sensation serving Mughlai dishes, Oudh lives upto the hype of the foodies. The biriyanis and kebabs carry an unique taste of their own. Ambience is good and so courteous is the staff. Prices are fair but not cheap. The authorities have opened up a new adress at Saltlake near CC1 to meet the people demand. So dont be late follow the mass...

The ambiance of the restaurant is no doubt one of the best. They have this theme of a mughal palace inside the restaurant which looks really good. Coming to the food I found it average and nothing special really to makr you visit this place over and over again. Prices are high compared to places which makes same or even better quality food.

Located in Deshapriya park, this is a themed restaurant that portrays awadh at its best. Went to this place to just try out their raan biryani. This was a place recommended by my friends based out of Kolkata. We were three people. We ordered galawati kebab and lucknowi paratha at first. the paratha was really awesome. I don't know how tey prepared teh parantha that was so thin and tasty. The kebab was great adn melted in the mouth. But the dish that stole the show was the Raan Biryani. The mutton was really tasty and the rice had a great flavour. The only miniature let down was that they did nt have firni on that day, so we ordered shahi tukda which was good.
Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5

Neither do I understand nor do I like Mughlai food very well, which is evident from the fact that this is the first Biriyani place I am actually reviewing on Zomato after 100 odd reviews.

Now that you are sufficiently warned of my inadequacy of knowledge, let me tell you that the Rann Biriyani I had here, was pretty good, but not mind blowing, though I wish the raita that came with it wasn’t as sweet. The Galawati was soft and well-seasoned, but a bit burnt in places making it bitter. The Lucknowi Parantha was perfect though. My favorite dish was the Murgh Irani, which was rich, not too spicy and very well made.

We also ordered an Aam Sharbat, which at 110 rupees + tax + service charge, was ready-to-order packaged Aam Panna syrup + water. Now that’s not something acceptable. Also, why weren’t there pickled onions on the table which is a pretty standard practice ?

In the dessert section, we also ordered a Phirni, which was good, but not like the creamy 15 bucks one at Nizam’s New Market, and a Shahi Tukra, which was wasted with a heavy layer of suji on top, and nothing like the excellent one at Naushijaan, Kasba.

In the end, if you are reading my review, you are probably a Biriyani-addict like everyone else in Calcutta, so give the regular biriyani joints a miss and visit Oudh. Even if you don’t fall head-over-heals with the food, you won’t be disappointed. And the old-haveli décor is certainly a plus to build up the feel and mood.

Been here today for lunch retreat.
The space is a real problem compared to its popularity. We had to wait at lst 40 mins in queue to get into the restaurant.

The ambience is nice with awadhi gazhals in background.
But only one common toilet for the customers. This number should b increased.
The dishes are a bit costly, but they have really maintained the quality of food n no compromise in that.

The qalmi kebab n the mutton galawti kebab were just fantastic.
The moti biriyani was a bit rich.
I mised tge smell of whole-garam-masalas n zaiphal in the chkn reza
We asked for shahi tukra, but was said to be not available. I think this being a signature desert in here shd b available always.

The way the food was presented was good... Liked biriyani in earthen pot.
Stuffs are hospitable enough.

Best place for Awadh delicacies in kolkata. Food tasted very authenticate. Ambience is good but quite crampy. Not giving a 5.0 just for one reason , as soon as you plate is empty they would like you to pay and leave the table. Some plates where taken off the table while still some of the people in the group had not finished.  This is not at all awadh style .

Would specially recommend the galawti kebab with Lucknowi paratha..match made in heaven literally!!We had raan and awadhi biryani along with another gosht side in the main course and they just melted in our mouth..it was one of my best mughlai dining experience and I really appreciate the courteousness of the staff there ( Ravi and joydeep)..would definitely revisit again  an would certainly recommend this place to every mughlai cuisine lovers!!

The food served was tasty but not delicious enough to eat till the last morsel. But then the ambience was excellent. The ghazal playing in the background with the mughal theme was done almost perfectly. Only if spaces between the tables were a bit more, the place would have looked better. Else it is good food at reasonable rates.

Biryani once was a common man's staple till it was glamouised as nawabi delicacy. Over the years most of the Kolkata mughlai eateries has once again brought it down to the level of streetfood. 
Biryani os now loads of rice with one or two pieces of meat often accompanied by a piece of potato and egg. OUDH 1590 has consciously steered clear of that road by introducing raan Biryani and other flavors like awadhi Biryani. The latter having a distinct flavor of ghee and the former having fairly generous amount of meat. Galawati kebab is soft and succulent. Chicken champ and rumali roti combination works well. Soda shikanji refreshes u and shahI tukda gives a sense of satisfaction. 
Ambience scores high. Wish food was that superlative. However. Oudh does provide a commendable experience.

This is an awesome place.Heaven for North Indian food lover and any big foodie.
We visited this place last month.
The interior is very good.
Nice ambiance with low light and soft ghazals at the background just set the mood.
The food is super mind boggling.
We had ordered Qalmi kebab, Galawati kebab and Lucknowi paratha for starter.
The kebabs specially galawati juz melted in the mouth n with the diff flavours of spices. It was an heavenly experience.
For main course we ordered Raan Biriyani,Murgh Kassa, Murgh Chap and Murgh Rezala.
The rezala was awesome tasty.
And the best biriyani till now I had is the RAAN BIRIYANI.
For dessert we ordered phirni and shahi tukra.
It was a very very good experience.
The food both quality an quantity wise excellent.
And definately will visit this place very soon.

This place is a little hard to locate. But trust me in this, once you find it you will be like "wooow". Thee interiors are done so well that it will take you to some other era. With the background music , it just sets the ambience right. Now coming to the food , we ordered murg biryani, seekh kebab and pineappple raita. Kebab was very good. Biryani was well okay for me but my friends found it a bit spicy. Raita was moderate, just like every raitas. The show stopper was obviously the kebab. Special mention to the sweet mango chutney they give. That was just too good. Do give it a try

Finally went there after hearing so much about this restaurant. We went there expecting awesome biryani and it was just a little more than okay for me.We wanted to order brain masala curry but it was not available then roomanli roti was also not available so then we ordered Gosht rezala with tandoori roti. The service was good and the food was served to us in less than 10 minutes but the rezala didn't tasted spectacular for it was just okay and the roti was raw, when ordered another roti that was fine. The mutton ran Biryani was good but nothing that would make my jaw drop. It was good and had a unique because in a handi which was giving it a different taste and aroma. We then asked for kulfi falloda and shahi tukra both were not available. I expected a lot from this place but it was not upto the mark for me. The ambience was really good and the decor was just amaizng.

Oudh is not a restaurant, it is a feeling, recreation of a time, which is gone. When you are entering Oudh, you are not just going to have some food, but you are going to live an era. Starting right from the main entrance door, the darwan ( guard), the interior, the lucknow music, the people, the crockery, the windows with multi-colour glass panels will make you forget the city chores & take you to the forgotten times. Brace yourself to take a ride of Auwadhi delicasies.

Forget all your worries and order some Galauti Kebab with Ulta  Tawa Paratha. After just the first bite of Galauti, I bet, you will forget everything for a while. This is a house delicasy & why shoud not it be? This kebab, was originally invented for Nawabs with no teeth left, but still in love with food. It simply melts in your mouth giving you a rich flavour of special secret spices which the chef will not disclose even on your repeated requests. The ulta tawa paratha is just perfect conpanion to Galauti with less oil & light, crisp texture.

After that, try some run biriyani. Different from Kolkata style biriyani. But you will not regret.

End up with Mango Firni. Whicb is again extraordinary. But don't go for Gajar Halwa. You can definitely find better versions of this at many other places in Kolkata.

Oudh is a another feather in the crown of Foodie's Paradise Kolkata

2. Thr were only 1 person who was responsbl for evrythng for a certain area. E.g: taking order, serving, taking plates, cleaning tables, billing everythng. In our area thr was only 1 guy who was taking care of 3 tables hence things were getting delayed. And it is also vry tough job for a single guy, so pls recruit some ppl.

Great place with great food. When we reached Oudh it was crowded with a waiting time of minimum 30 minutes.  Some people had been waiting for over an hour. I wondered if it would be worth it. But worth it was. We were welcomed by a man with big a moustache. The service is polite, however they naturally speak in bengali and I had to keep reminding that I don't understand.  Good Awadhi food.  The Awadhi dal was fantastic to the core. I have wiped the serving bowl clean . Even the paneer tika was nice.  The roti was a little raw but a must visit.

It will give you the feel of Nawabiana. Everything made of wood even the AC is also painted brown to give it a wooden touch. The food is very nice indeed but it is not much spacious inside. Galawati kebab and lucknowi paratha is a must try. The kebab will just melt in your mouth. The biriyani is as tasty as it looked with the others starter dishes. The copper thali and glass is a pleasure to eat and drink on.
Very much satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food offered.
You can definitely try the mitha pan in the pan shop just outside Oudh 1590. ;)

We had Rann biryani which was nice and along with it Bhuna gosht which was delicious but extremely disappointed with portions of mutton served. Made a complaint and it was patiently heard to by the manager i suppose. So all is cool.

Highlight was Gawlati kebab and Kakori kebab. Kakori one was done just right with spices n roasting of the meat. While Gawlati was a melt in our mouth delicacy. Kudos to that. Zaffrani chicken was poor. Just very very average.

Overall quite advisable visit.

On entering the restaurant you will feel as if you have reached the mughal era. The palace like set up, decoration, chandeliers, old style utensil and cutlery, paintings on the wall and soothing ghazal playing in the background will surely traveled you to that era. And the well dressed courteous staffs are always helpful with pleasing smile.
Food: First of all is the 'melt in mouth' GALWATI KEBAB. It was lip smacking delicious and went well with that light,less oily LUCKNOWI PARATHA.
AWADHI HANDI BIRIYANI was another amazing delicacy. GHOST KUNDAN KALIYA contained soft and tasty mutton pieces, slightly thick gravy was great.
FIRNI and GAJAR HALUA was average. I have not tasted their sahi tukra which is very famous in Zomato.
Only negative point is the long waiting time as the place is over crowded most of the time. And some dishes are over priced.

Vry nice ambience n decoration....the slow music gave the place a more ethnic n retro ghazal touch which suited more to me...the food was cooked to perfection...I would surely come back for the mutton biryani here...I deducted the marks for the waiters....even though there were people on other tables..they kept their eyes on our table n kept gossiping which made us a little uncomfortable to eat with their eyes watchng us constantly

Finally visited this so famous restaurant yesterday. The decoration was really something different with the background song which gave a full nawabi feel.  The ambiance was also pleasant. The behavior of the staff  was very polite. They helped us to choose our order. About the food we had soda sikanji,  murgh sugandhi kabab, galawati kabab, lucknowi paratha, raan biryani , moti biryani, nargisi kofta and kulfi falooda. Every item was good, I personally liked the paratha and raan biryani. So for me this place deserves a second visit.

Couldn't deduct a single mark. Visited Oudh Saturday for lunch and had a non-veg extravaganza feast in a Nawabi style. The décor will catch everyone's awe. The ornamented wood and stained glass decorations, the antique chandeliers, crockery, antique wooden chairs, the mural work on the wooden tables and what not they have incorporated to inculcate the Nawabi feeling to their guests. Not to forget the Thungri song which casts an added impact to the ambiance. Taste and quality of the food is extraordinary. We ordered Mutton Galawati Kebab, Chicken Tangri Kebab, Tandoori Roti, Nargisi Kofta, Mutton Runn Biryani and Phirni. Galawati Kebabs were sooo good that I find no words to appreciate it. After having it the tangri kebab actually felt a little blant. However the nargisi kofta- boiled eggs coated with mutton mince in a mutton mince gravy tasted heavenly with hot and crisp tandoori rotis. And what do I say about the Rann Biryani? It is totally different from the traditional Kolkata styles ones, infact much much better than them I must say. The rice was so light and mildly flavoured and filled with loads and loads of mutton pieces. It seemed I couldn't have enough of it. The Phirni too was heavenly. Entirely different from the Aminia and Arsalan ones. Unfortunately two of us had to share one as it was exhausted. I think the oil and ingredients they use are of very good quality because even after gorging on this non-veg extravaganza I did not feel heavy at all. This place needs to be visited again and again to try out each item.

My second period dining experience at OUDH 1590 turned out to be pretty satisfying , after my previous visit to its salt lake outlet. The best thing is the dim lit ambience,the grand and unique palace set up,the soft gazals, the brass cutlery that transports one back to the mughal era.
Comparing the outlets , i would prefer rating the saltlake one a little more , as i found it has a more spacious seating that this one (might be mistaking). Food is at par for both and we stuck to our fixed awadhi orders

MUTTON GALAWATI KEBAB , MURGH TANGDI KEBAB , LUCKNOWI PARATHA , AWADHI HANDI BIRYANI , MOTI BIRYANI, SHAHI TUKDA and FIRNI.
The motis werent much upto our liking, the meat in awadhi handi were mostly fat, except these issues everything was brilliant. I prefer having biryani with plain raita that comes with it , as another side dish can overshadow the aroma and taste of the ghee based awadhi style biryani. But if you are here , do try the RAAN BIRYANI which i whole heartedly recommend. The benarasi pan from the seller outside put a perfect happy ending to our noble nawabi meal.

Well, when u enter this place it's like going back to the Lucknowi gharana with wooden furniture, thumri playing in the back ground, the staff dressed in dhoti kurta, it seems like sitting in a time machine. The kebabs we ordered were awesome. The biryani was mildly spiced and the aroma was beautiful. In one word a must visit restaurant in Kolkata.

In one word "lipsmacking." Right from the kebabs to the biryani and their deserts, they serve you with the best quality food with a classy niche ambience. Smiling staff adds on to the glamour of this favourite joint of mine. Always like visiting this place. A big kuddos to the entire staff and their management.

Oh !!! Finally visited this place for a pre birthday celebrations on the b4 day of my birthday for a Sunday dinner with my family. It was on the top of my chart for rally long time. As usual we had a waiting time of around 30 mins and we entered a different era altogether. Wat an ambience with gazal playing in the background .Lukhnowi and awadhi ambience all over even the air conditioned are wood covered to make it look of that era. We ordered #galaoti kebab 2 plates of them. And# murgh pardah biriyani with # chicken achari. All of the dishes were excellent. The biriyani was so light and done perfectly. A touch of awadh all over.

I visited this restaurant on a special occasion to get that special feeling of great food.. excellent ambience nd good service. I would rate the food at 5/5.. The ambience nd th set up at 4/5 but not likely the service courtesy at 3/5. They were hurrying us to place the order although we said we were expecting some more guests. No one was personally attending us. It was my 2nd visit nd I wud love to visit only for the food but wud expect better experience in terms of service.@

I visited two times here.
The best awadhi foods you will get here.
My favorite is Mutton Galawati kebab.
It will surely melt in your mouth.
Just awesome.
Next is biryani.
They have multiple types of biryani.
First time I ordered Raan biryani,
Next time ordered Handi Biryani...
Both were awesome, lite and of huge amount.
Next the best part is ambience.
We will be lost with the thumri playing in the background and we might think yourself as a Lucknow nawab.

Great place.

Visited this much heard about restaurant on sunday night along with a friend. 
1. Location: located opposite to lake market near deshapriyo park this place enjoys a good location. Easy to reach from most parts of the city. 4/5
2. Ambience: This is the most talking point of the restaurant. As u step in you will feel as if u have reached the mughal era. Wooden interiors,chandeleirs,old fashioned cutlery n crockery, large nizam style paintings, comfy seating arrangement & last but not the least soft ghazal tune playing in the background will really transport u the era of 1590. 5/5.
3. Hospitality & service: The waiters are very prompt. They can suggest good food and always serve with a smile. They are hospitable and friendly too. 4/5.
4. Food: Well the food to me is nothing great or outstanding. The biriyani we ordered was nothing exceptional according to the price. It was average and can be compared to that of aminia and alibaba. However the presentation is nice but if the food is not that great, it is a big turndown. 3/5.
In a nutshell one time visit is good especially for the great ambience.

This is an awesome place I must say. The vintage decor and the light background ghazals being played added to the ambience. We ordered galawati kawab as a starter. It was amazing. The most amazing was a mango chutney being served with it. It is truly delicious and so were the kawabs. In the main  course we had moti biriyani and nargisi kofta. The quantity of the biriyani is excellent with 6 adequate sized meat balls. The interesting thing is it is served in an earthen pot. The nargisi kofta was a true delight people should always try. The service was awesome too, everyone behaving very much cordially. The serving time is also very less. Overall it is a great restaurant for trying out Indian cuisine.

The taste of murgh irani just can't forget it. Whoever is going there must have that as a side dish though you will also like mutton dishes. The biriyani was awsome.. and yes i should have mentioned the starters first bt nw m mentioning it its mouthwatering.... i want to visit the place today also i liked it so very much.. and last but not the least the service is awsome.. really awsome.. one short exmple.. the guard at the door he went with us till parking to open the car doors for us!!!

It was my 3rd visit in oudh 1950. this time i had decide to try some different type of preparations here. Last 2 times i have tried their signature galaoti .. kakori kabab and raan biryani. as usual it was great . so this time somthing different i wanted to try.

even this time also i couldn't resist myself to have galaoti kabab with it i ordered jafrani kabab.. what new to say about galaoti kabab. its melts in my mouth. jafrani kabab had a smell of jafran.. pieces were big and soft. with every bits u felt a irresistible smell of jafran.
In main course i have ordered awadhi palak Biryani . i am a hard-core non veg but fall in love with it.. this is sooo yumm.. i was complely satisfied with their food. Back home with a full and happy tummy.

This was my second visit to this place. As usual the ambience, service everything is just too well. Gets me the feel of some Mughal emperor with the tracks been played. The food here is remarkable with some really yummy biriyani's served here. I had ordered for the dishes below :
• Veg Dahi Kebab - This was a veg preparation presented well. The kebabs were really soft and melted in my mouth. It had a balanced flavour and a serine taste.
• Kadhai Palak - This was a preparation made out of spinach which had a rich taste of garlic in it. All my vegan friends would really like this dish since its rich in its taste.
• Moti Biriyani - Well this biriyani tasted superb. Minced mutton balls with flavoured biriyani rice. The mutton balls were super soft and sort of melted in my mouth. It tasted Devine. A must try.
The flavours were proportionally balanced.
• Shahi Tukda - The shahi tukda wasn't that great though. It was very much soggy and had a lot of fragrance of Gulab jal in it. The bread also didn't seem that fresh. The dessert wasn't that remarkable.

Overall I would surely visit this place again for its biriyani. Since its one of my favourite place for biriyani.

A bit over-rated restaurant...judging by the crowd outside that keeps one waiting for nearly an hour gives you high hopes...the ambience i would give a 5/5...the behaviour of the staffs can be 4/5 but the food? It wasn't at all what i had expected...
For the starters we had
Galawati kabab ( much hyped by the reviewers ) I had better kababs than this..they were kind of soggy and wasn't even warm...
For the main course we had
Raan Biriyani... it was good nd had the flavours  but the mutton pieces were hard and rubbery..
Awadhi Handi Biriyani...was way better and if you have to choose between the two do make sure to have this one...however it is supposed to have more flavour and spices in it...a better version of it you can have at Arsalan
Neehari khas. . . was alright...however it lacked the right amount of salt...
When the main course ends and you are already questioning your choice of restaurants they will bring you warm water with lemmon and rose in it...now this is what was typical of the restaurant...
For the desert we had...
Shahi tukra...it was just beautiful! All the dissapointment you got will just simply melt!!
Overall lacked the wow factor...if you want to try out you always can...but will i ever be visiting again? I guess not...

From my busy schedule I was waiting for a day to have dinner at Oudh one day as I already heard so much from so many ppl about this place. Look wise it looks like an old Delhi Mughal food place. Waited outside on a Tuesday for 10 minutes to get a place for 4. Interior is same as outside. Decorated with old paintings, furniture, dim lights and lucknowi  music. Service ppl in black pathani suits. Small place hardly can accommodate 30 ppl. A friend of mine who have been here before many times, ordered Gelawati Kebaab and Panratha. A plate consists 4 pieces of kebabs with some onions sauted in some sauce. Served on heavy Mughal plates. All tables are served with a special mango chutney, raita and pickle prior to any order. I had first time experience with Gelawati Kebaab at Lucknow so compared to that, this was nothing that great but it tasted good. At least in Kolkata I think they specialize in this dish. Paranthas were very thin like rumali roti so we needed few of them. We ordered Raan Biryani after that and they said they are out of it and not available at that time. So we ordered a plate of Oudhi Biryani just to have a taste. 2 pieces of mutton 2 eggs and rice served in clay Handi. The very first taste and aroma u will get is of Desi Ghee which I personally didn't like as am not used to of having it in Biryani. Mutton was tender and juicy.  Rice was good but I personally didn't like the Biryani as may b I have been spoilt by Arsalaan style Biryani. Quantity was good. We 4 shared that single plate. I think I need to go again and taste some other items to give my final comment on this place. All this was fr 2k bucks including tax. Rates according to me is bit high. But all in all for non veg mughalai food lovers this is a good place.

What initiated as a quick dinner plan turned out to be a gastronomic delight. We reached late in the evening and were stuck in a 25 minute waiting queue. 

After having found our table inside, our orders were promptly taken. The waiting time for the food is simply minimal. Our Galawati  kebabs and Lucknawi paranthas were promptly served. The kebabs were simply divine, giving you the true Melton the mouth feeling. Not too spicy or over cooked, done just right. THE Awadhi Biriyani was next on the table and it was simply delicious. The spices were balanced just right with the ghee.

The firni was okayish but definitely good. The only issue for me was the lighting that was just too dim. The food and service was great.

Oh! what an experience we had today at Oudh 1590. Me and my wife visited their Deshapriya park outlet for lunch. Menu was simple, Oudh 1590's signature dish Galawati mutton kabab, peas pulao and irani jheenga masala. Really a gastronomical extravaganza. The decor is very good. Wooden panels and matching designs on wall, the furnitures and the background music will take you to the Nawabi era.

We have been hearing so much about Oudh 1590 since last year (and given that we love Biriyani a bit exceedingly), that when a friend wanted to give her birthday treat, we just had to choose this place!  The ambience is just what I expected- themed decor, ghazal music softly playing in the background, and a heavy menu card with the dishes listed in beautiful calligraphy gives a very "Awadhi" feel. However, it was a little too dark inside. We began with Aam Khas and Sugandhi Kabab. The sharbat tasted very ordinary but the Kababs were succulent. For the main course we ordered Murgh Purdah Biryani, Roomali Roti and Murgh Iraani. The gravy was delicious though the biryani could have been better. I guess given it's reputation, we were expecting some stunning biryani but got something ordinary. We wanted to try their Shahi Tukra but somehow we were too full by the time we finished and had to skip dessert. Overall good food, but nothing spectacular. It's alright for a one time visit. P.S.: I strongly disliked being served on steel thalis! I know it was part of creating the "Awadhi experience" but it was too street-side!

Probably now one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Even in the weekdays, you have to wait outside of it to get your seats reserved. Yes, it's so popular. Try their specialities, the authentic awadhi cuisine, rann biryani, dum biryani, a plate full of kebabs (sugandhi kebabs specially), and of course rezala and chanp. And never to forget try the awesome firni. Caution: if you are a lover of kolkata style biryani, order only "dum biryani" even if it is suggested to try an awadhi one. 

Elegant decor and attentive waiters get the joint additional brownies. 

Go and enjoy.

This restaurant has created a lot of good buzz so I decided to visit here on a wekend with my family. We had to wait for a few minutes till we got a table owing to the weekend rush. The interior is amazingly done, however the tables are too closely placed. 
Coming to the food now. The shahi dahi kabab was amazing. The veg galawti kababs lacked flavour and the texture was weird to the palate. The dhania chutney too seemed a bit off as it was too tangy. We ordered for vegetable biryani and loved the aroma and the taste. The awadhi dum aloo had a very nice gravy but the potatoes could do with more stuffing and the stuffing itself could use some flavour. Subz makhkhan masala was quite a hit and surely recommended. The breads were nice and it was evident that they were made with fresh dough. 
Even though not many would go to this outlet for vegetarian food, the restaurant should work on improving on it nonetheless.

I hear that this restaurant serves very good Biriyani. I love Biriyani, so we planed to go there. We went there at a weekday lunchtime. We saw an almost full house which is really surprising us. Next thing is ambience. Nice Lucknow environment. Some ghazals playing in the background, a feeling of mughal era you may find in there. But the lights are too dim which is not good. We can't see what we eat. Next is food, we ordered Awadhi Handi Gosht Biriyani and Gosht Rogan Josh. Both are so tasty and well cooked. We miss the Rann Biriyani, next time I definitely try this. The prices are on the higher side. Overall, a must visit for Biriyani lovers and the rest must give a try.

I have been trying different restaurants in my pursuit for good food. I experienced good food at many places.. But.. the Wao factor was missing. I could not get that sense of satisfaction.. Finally today at Oudh 1590, it was a complete gastronomical delight. I ordered galawati kebab, bhuna mutton, rumali roti and Awadhi Handi Biryani and one sahi tukra. The galawati kebab was the best in the city.. Biryani is out of the world.. The sahi tukra was yummy .. Considering the quality of food, I would say its value for money.  The decor is very good. wooden panels and matching designs on wall, the furnitures and the background music will take you to the Nawabi era.  
This is a milestone for any foodie and a landmark of Kolkata. I will keep coming to this place again and again.

Been there on 28th Feb with family. Went for dinner. First impression was good. Nice decoration with music. We ordered 2 types of Biriyani, starter, rate, and sahi tukra. The problem is The light inside the restaurant was very very low. Can't even see the food, How can One enjoy the food if it's not visible. Price wise the quality of food is very poor. Dint get any special aroma and taste. The person attending the table was in a hurry, I don't know what but he has no time to listen. And finally, when I received the bill an extra item was added. How can be? I went there because I have heard that name  "Oudh 1590"
But my experience is really very bad.

To keep it short, even though the place is small,the ambience is mind blowing.
Must try is galoti kebab with paratha. 
Their biryani is Oh so good and enough for two adults.
DO NOT and I repeat, do not make the mistake of trying their shahi tukra. 
This dessert will definitely not end your fabulous meal here on a sweet note.:)

The entrance looks grandeur with a dressed up security guard having a great moustache...wished us with a warm smile.. :)
Then...entering the place.... Ah! The ambience is lovely with Begam Akhtar ghazals playing in background...n dim lights..perfectly soothing!
The waiter welcomed us courtesly.. We ordered Rann Biryani , Gawlauti Kabab, Soda sikanji, Phirni in desserts. 
Gawlauti kabab is so awesome that it just melts in mouth... Perfectly made :)
Rann biryani is their signature dish... Biriyani filled with shredded mutton ...just I felt the "ghee" was more. 
Phirni was awesome.

Pros : Great food , Good quantity , Awesome ambience
Cons : Parking , waiting for a table

Took a me a year to finally visit this "highly praised" restaurant , but the wait was compensated in gold by the quality of food served. 
The ambience was exquisite. Thumri playing on the stereo , the artwork on the walls , intricate woodwork, transport you to the lucknowy gharana and mood. 
We started off with the famous Galawati Kabaab and Zafrani Murg Kabaab. The Galawati is a soft creamy melt-in-your-mouth delight , forcing you to crave for more. Do take a slice of Lucknowy Paratha with it (Galawati), to make things more interesting. I did not like the zafrani kabaab much , the meat was a bit chewy. 
The Awadhi Handi Biriyani was enough for 2 people and had a very light feel to it contrary to our usual perception of a biriyani. The biriyani was cooked with grace to go brilliantly with the sides. For those who treat biriyani as a stand-alone dish , this one needs a side. 
The Chicken Kassa , a very popular dish , was thoroughly reinvented in oudh. It had an unmatched flavour and impeccable taste. Though on the drier side compared to the popular recipe , it was worth every penny and will keep u asking for more. 
The Nargisi Kofta had a bland keema gravy. A dish that had immense scope and was subjected to poor execution.

This is one  of the best restaurant of the city. Awesome ambience. Great lighting matched with the beautiful background music. Tried their Galoti Kebab, Rann Biriyani, Chicken Chap and Rezala...The Rann Biriyani was exceptionally good...The taste still lingers in my mouth.. All the other items were great as well.

It was due for the longest possible time, and I finally visited it after pujo! And to my surprise, on a Monday evening, around 9pm, we had to wait for around 10minutes to get a seat for 4! Which clearly shows the popularity of this place.. 
Coming to the food and atmosphere, it's ROYAL! great food, great varieties, great service..

Pretty well decorated interior with good taste of background music, soothing to the environment making it feel royal. The staff was really hospitable, very humble and cooperative. Now coming to the food, I had been with my friend we order moti biriyani and murg kassa. A decent taste of food,quantity of biriyani was decent too but I expected to have bigger pieces of chicken in the murg kassa wasn't satisfied with that at all. Overall gives a royal ambience. But will punch a hole in your pocket though.

Food was exotic with right balance of flavour and taste.. ambience with perfect blend of music gives you experience of nawabi era.. Staff s were really very cordial... Also I must say presentation of food like biriyani served in hundi is good thinking. . Overall love the concepts. . Would love to visit again soon...

Went there with best of my friends. Enjoyed a evening with delicious foods. Background gazal, mughal environment feel better.
We tried Raan biriyani, nehari khas, peas pulao.
Raan biriyani just awesome. Don't miss this. Nehari khas was also very delicious. A good combination though. Pocket friendly.
Worth giving money and try atleast once. U will not feel bad.

And I will say it was one of the best biryani I ever tasted in my life. Nehaari Khas was quite good too. I will suggest people coming here to have a try at Raan biryani. Overall wonderful experience.

This place is just over-hyped because of the decor and good marketing. The food is definitely quality stuff but not really as good as the reviews seem to suggest. The ambiance is good but I reiterate that the food fails to impress. Prices are on the higher side. Reservations are recommended because they generally tend to go housefull.

Overall a nice place for a indian dinner or lunch. Only con is lack of space. There space is a bit cramped. So mostly there will long waiting time. Otherwise great for food and ambiance.

Wanted to take my guests from Pune to lunch somewhere nice. After some initial research, zeroed in Oudh 1590 at Deshapriyo Park. Zomato advised to reserve table before dropping in. However, on ringing them up, I was told that they do not take reservations and it is strictly First Come First Serve. We went there around 1245 hrs just to make sure that we do not have to wait outside for our turn. On getting in, found couple of six-seaters were marked as Reserved. They explained that the tables were marked on Corporate booking. That was news to me. We, however, preferred to park ourselves at one of these Reserved tables and that was arranged. 
We were really amazed at the internal decor. The place is not very big with about 60-62 covers only but very tastefully done up in a period theme. 
The staff were reasonably courteous and kept our request to scale up the lighting in our part of the place since we had a toddler with us.
We ordered Galawati Kabab and Paneer Sugandhi Kebab to start with followed by Nehari Khaas, Rann Biriyani, Sabz Makkhan Masala with Tandoori Roti and capped with Phirni. The food was superb and our guests were quite impressed with everything.
I was happy that they found the place and the food to their liking since they were foodies themselves.
I would have given Oudh 1590 a five-star but for the reservation bit. It's a four and a half star from me but hopefully it would be all of five next time.

All the hardcore food lovers out there, fasten your seat belts for you're sure to soar high at a place like this one! Oudh 1590, that one place that will take you on a regal tour right from the start of the Mughal era in India! The lavish and elegant decor, the classic traditional cutlery, the royal nawaabi ghazals,the grandiose furnishing, the extravagant chandeliers and the outstanding paintings successfully depicting the majestic epoch of the Nawabs will anyways hypnotise you and compel you to have a reserved spot in your hearts for this absolutely delightful restaurant! If you make the right choice of food and go for the signature dishes, you might as well have the best experience ever! The chief highlights here are the Raan biryani,Moti biryani,Lucknowi paratha that goes best with the Mutton Galawati kebab, and the Gosht (Mutton) Rogan Josh. This is the best place for an appetising meal.

My experience with obdhi 1590, Desapriya Park is not at all a good one.. 
1) One table is cared by multiple workers. So there is a big lag of coordination between them. I had to wait for my foods longer. Even I had to ask for my orders multiple times to multiple caretakers. 
2) I ordered galawati kababs which was tasting bitter. When I complained to food server his reply was like if you take it with paratha, it will be tastier. How a bitter dish tastes delicious with paratha? 
3) When my main course was serving by one of their workers, another server came with another dish, which was also ordered by me, put it in the middle of the table with a rush and went back. Mannerisms very poor.. 
My experience is very poor with them. I will never visit their outlets again.. Thank you..

Food as always was awesome and fulfilled everybody's expectations. We had ordered tangdi kebabs which is my personal favorite and would recommend this highly. Amongst others we had kakori kebab which was okay types, lucknowi paratha is there speciality which is really good. Which really got every members appreciation was the sahi dal. Also tried the bhuna gosth, pardah biriyani, firni and sahi tukda. Special thanks to Mr.Rabi who suggested items that we had ordered and really appreciate his services.

Had a lunch two weeks back on a Sunday with my family...Reading the reviews expectations were pretty high but it did not satisfy my taste buds...
First we ordered zafrani kabab, galawati kabab, qalmi kabab & awadhi sughandhi mahi....fish kababs were good but the other ones were just okay...Then we took ghost bhuna, gosht shahi qorma, murgh irani, nehari khas along with tandoori roti & butter naan...muttons could be more tender & taste were okay for the dishes....we took anaras raita to gulp down these...raita comes in good quantity but tastes just like dahi of dahi bada...so way to go for the raita....in drinks we took aam khaas, badam sarbat, doodh gulab sarbat & soda sikhanji....I have had better of each kind....so oudh can improve on this segment too....for dinner we packed their famous raan biriyani....before coming to the taste let me say they charge INR 20/- for each handi....that is simply irritating....taste wise raan biriyani is good enough & also it comes with huge quantity...now coming to ambiance it is good with dim light....service is helpful & suggestive...overall experience is okay but considering the hype food part needs improvement...

Great deco. Good ambience. And above all - great food. The 4 of us ordered 4 or 5 plates of Galouti kebab, a plate of Zafrani fish kebab and raan biriyani. Attention to detail - was the standout feature in all the dishes. The galouti was especially super tasty. I will be back to the place for more. Soon.

Finally gave a visit to Oudh 1590. First coming to the decoration and ambience...both are classy and elegant...prefectly goes with the theme Awadhi. The staffs very caring, friendly and courteous. Now the food...it was very good. The galawti kebab was delicious and really goes well with the luckhnowi paratha (suggested by the staff). Fish shammi kebab is too good bud I dis not like their sugandhi murgh tikka that much. Their Awadhi aloo dum is also good. But I loved the Moti Biriyani the most. It was amazing...please give it a try. Price is a bit high but compliments the food well.

Heard about this restaurant a lot but after lunch I felt that it is much over hyped. I didn't like the taste of the food much.

Plus point: It is giving the Kolkatans' an exposure of the delicacy of the North Indian cuisine which is good with varieties of kebabs.

Negative Point: The quantity of food is good but it lacks taste which is a big concern whether is it nehari khaas or parathas or biriyani !! They should be much concerned with the taste of the food which is lacking.

This review is based on their outlet at Calcutta Club. It was a Sunday afternoon my aunt wanted to treat us. She said Oudh has started in the club , heard a lot about their food. .let's give it a try. Firstly I opened zomato to see the recommended dishes. We ordered Galawati Kebab, Lucknowi Paratha, Zafrani Jheenga Kebab. The Galawati Kebabs were truly gourmet absolute melt in mouth and delicious. The Lucknowi Paratha went well with that. Crispy exterior and soft inside.The Zafrani Jheenga Kebab was another well crafted appetizer. Tiger prawns marinated in saffron ,charcoal grilled to perfection. It's mild but utterly delicious. Main course we tried Awadhi Mutton and Chicken Biriyanis, Mutton Bhuna, Chicken Rezala and Chicken Kasa. The Awadhi Biriyanis were brilliant. The aroma of ghee, saffron with aromatic basmati rice was mesmerizing. It had two pieces of tender meat and an egg . A dynamic experience as we are so accustomed to Kolkata Biriyani. The mutton Bhuna was good , the Chicken Kasa was mundane but I disliked the Chicken Rezala. The gravy tasted like "chhana" or homemade cottage cheese floating in oil. Absolute spoiler after the great stuff tasted previously. Desserts, they ran out of phirni so ordered Gajar ka halwa. It was super rich with dry fruits, ghee and mawa. Also tasted excellent to the palate. My verdict for their food..close ur eyes and experience the Galawati. ..then wander with the flavours of the Biriyani. ..last but not the least have phirni or Gajar ka halwa to finish ur meal.Enough for food divination. The con is ,the place is so overhyped that expectations are sky high. My "WoW" is limited to the Galawati Kebab and the Awadhi Biriyani.

I paid my second visit to Oudh, Deshapriya  Park as I couldn`t resist the delicious taste of the handi biryani I had had during my first visit.  The second visit also was worth it. The Awadhi special handi biryani was awesome. I , being a biryani fan ,would suggest  you the same if you ever happen to visit the place. The various chicken and mutton kebabs were equally good .The staff was courteous and well groomed.

First thing's first, the ambience. Very soothing and as authentic as possible. No words for their biriyani, of course. Prices may seem a little on the higher side but you can actually split a plate of biriyani. It's sufficient for two. So, that makes up for it. Service and hospitality is truly praise-worthy. So, all in all, an entire package, if you ask me.

Absolutely mouth watering, excellent 'royal Awadhi khana'.... with perfect ambience created by the music which was indeed refreshing and pleasurable. The galauti kebabs melts the moment it enters your mouth. Equally good are the sheekh kebabs. The biriyanis served in 'handi' tastes authentically fantastic. One must try the nargisi kofta which in one word was just superb! A must visit for those who are kebab and biriyani lovers. 😍 The only complain with this restraunt is that it has no such sitting arrangements for the people waiting outside in the que.😔 Another wonderful experience was to witness the huge moustached 'Darwan'... Who was very amusing! 😜

Had heard about this place and their famous Galawati Kebab" for long and finally we ended up dining our 1st anniversary dinner here. First of all the ambiance was good, i wont say it's exceptional. though it was little congested and clumsy. We tried the Awadi thing first. Heard about the cuisine from many people but didn't have chance to taste it out before.But i found out that is quite not my taste; maybe. though i love the north Indian dishes very much;)

In my opinion the place is little too Hyped, and specially the Galawati kebab.. as i don't think i'm into Awadi cuisine so i don't find it that tasty.

We ordered Galawati kebab, Murg tandoori, Murg Pardah biriyani, murg irani and phirni.

As i told; the kebab didn't impressed me(may be because the cuisine isn't a thing of mine). Tandoori was good (there's no chance that it could taste bad anywhere, as the dish is itself tasty) again the biriyani was just ok. it was too spicy and too wet. Murg irani was quite good though. and Phirni  again this can't be bad. 

******But the worst thing i found that Oudh charge Rs.40 for a bottle of water on which the printed maximum retail price is Rs.20. so isn't it illegal??( there's no chance of any taxes as printed price is including all taxes). I rad about a same scenario in the paper where a hotel charged double for a bottle of water and a customer just sued the hotel and won. May be i'll trying sue them and in the consumer forum and win.LOL (pun intended)*******

Starting with the mutton Galawati Kebabs which just melt in your mouth. Must have!
And then comes the Raan Biriyani mutton again, had such an interesting mixture of flavours. Makes you go just wow!
Mutton Nihari Khaas.. really good. Tender pieces of mutton with so much packed in one dish.
The Irani Chicken was also a delight to have!
Chicken biriyani, ordered for our friend who doesn't have mutton.. Poor him! That tasted just normal.
Overall a wonderful experience with great food. Looking forward to my next visit!

Finally managed to go to Oudh 1590 today. Tried the fish tikka and Shahi tangri Kabab. The fish tikka was good, the fish was fresh and the flavours were beautifully balanced. However, the chicken was quite disappointing. I was expecting melt-in-the mouth kind of soft chicken but it was not so. The chicken was considerably hard and the flavours did not delight me at all. Moving on...We had ordered Awadhi dal, Murg Kassa and Tandoori rotis for the main course. the dal was delicious, the Murg Kassa had very robust flavours as well. Oudh could add a bit more flavours to their dishes I feel. The items on the menu do entice the taste buds but the execution is not as one hopes it would be. 
P.S the staff and servers are extremely courteous and deserve a special mention.

I have heard about this place from my girlfriend. I didn't know where this is. But when i reached that place,i feel like i was entered in a mughal KING house. It is look like totally decorate with mughal's things. One thing which is attract me that is they colored their AC as a wooden color for much more mughal's effect. Food in excellent. There staff is really good. Excellent in decoration. And the CHERRY ON THE CAKE is GALAWATI KABAB and the BACKGROUND SUFI SONG. This place is always memorable for me. Thank you zomato for help me found out such a nice place.

This one has been on my list for quite some time and finally visited the place one fine evening. First thing that surprised me was the doorman with a huge mustache,who opened the door for us,well too gladly (more on that later). Then the interior took me off my feet. I must say,they have spent good money on decor. Starting from the music to the lighting to the chairs and tables and tableware, everything was perfectly in sync with the theme of the place. So here we go :

The Pros :
1. Awesome ambience. The feel of the place is perfect. Every design element incorporated takes you to the golden era of the mughals and I must say, nothing about the ambient set-up is disappointing.
2. The order taker was good to handle the orders and everything he suggested turned out to be good.
3. Coming to the food, the badam sharbat served in the beginning was less chilled than required and sweeter than usual. What followed was mutton galawati kebab, chicken sheekh kebab and veg galawati kebab. The latter two were okay but the mutton galawati kebab completely blew me away. The lamb was perfectly cooked, tender, adequately spiced,with not one flavor overpowering the other. I was pleasantly surprised . Then we had the daal, which was not great but okay, it seriously could have been better, creamer. I have had better daal makhani at banquets. The mutton handi Biriani was a lot of portion, adequate for two moderate eaters. For dessert, we had double ka meetha and gajar ka halwa. The former one was good but the gajar ka halwa really wasn't upto the mark. It tasted more like carrot custard than gajar ka halwa. See, if you're serving awadhi cuisine, it has to be rich. A light dessert made of milk and carrots, which I must not say wasn't bad at all, was not what you expect gajar ka halwa to be.
4. Service was okay. Not fast enough.
5. The banarasi pan shop outside is a real add-on. 

The Cons :
1. Service staff were not trained enough to act with proper composure - a fine dining set up like this should have really really good service people. Composed and polite. That's what we are looking for. They didn't live upto the standard expected. The only person who impressed us was the order taker.
2. You guys should look into the tax structure while billing. Something had gone wrong with the tax levied upon the food bill and I'm not aware of what exactly was wrong since this was a family dinner hosted by Mr. Partho Protim Mitra, GM, Philips, East India and he was the one settling the bill. The service guys quickly (and all too promptly ) modified the check with a new lesser amount. I don't know why they did it if the tax levied was genuine. If it was to avoid displeasing a guest , I would say good service recovery. But then again , doubts persist since nobody from the staff could explain to my host why what tax was charged and how.
3. NO BAR. A big let-down for a place like this. This place should have a bar. I guess it's not there because of the school that's just a stone's throw away from the restaurant, but I must say, decor and ambience and food like this...a bar is a must have.
4. The pocket pinch is gonna pinch. We were 8 adults and 1 nine-year old and bill was approximately Rs. 10,000. That is for a 3 course menu. For a place that doesn't serve alcohol, this is not gonna be easy on your pocket.
5.The gate keeper (the guy mentioned in the beginning,the one with the huge moustache ) , was all too keen for a tip. I don't mind tipping a gate man a mere 20 rupees but I really dislike the fact that they ask for it. Nonetheless, we tipped him and he did open our car doors for us. Nice chap he is,by the way. But asking for a tip-a strict no-no. You don't want every place to become like Oly Pub,right?

All in all, a good place to have great food, marred by a few minor faults, which I'm very sure they will look into. Nothing they can do about the pricing, or the bar but they should really look into training the service staff for a better guest experience. Gonna be back for Awadhi food. 
Cheers.

Went for dinner on our wedding anniversary. The ambience and decor was amazing. Tried galauti kebab with paratha and also Afghani chicken kebab, both were awesome. One of the best galauti I ever had. Tried handi biriyani. It was OK. One should visit the Restaurant, specially because it is 1st of its kind in Kolkata. Looking forward to visiting again

An awesome Nawabi food escapade indeed! The entire atmosphere with its setting around thrust in u the Hyderabadi Nawabiyana..especially the paintings and the slow ghazal that hung over this place takes you to back in the Nawab era relishing cuisines at the darbar! As suggested by zomato raan biriyani, galawati kebab and nehari khaas are a must in your order list. The food is really good. But don't go for firni, that won't keep up to much of ur expectations though! Overall a place that you should visit and carry back an experience of ultimate satisfaction for your mughlai cravings!

Went for lunch on a cold january afternoon.Had to wait outside for a table and my hunger increased ten-folds when I saw people coming out after lunch, all smilling and content.As I went in I immediately liked the decor but too many people were talking happily among themselves so could just faintly hear the ghazal.

The first thing that came was an Achar Daani with one sweet and one mixed pickle.I just fell in love with the sweet "Aamsattha achar"(Achar of sun-dried mango cubes) and kept on tasting it.Then came Rang Biriwani;it was nice and smelled really good.Then we ordered Moti Biriwani.This had Keema Mutton balls and they tasted wonderful along with the biriwani.But the thing which I realy liked most was Mutton Bhuna.This 6 pieces mutton preparation and its curry was just mindblowing.

The quantity they serve is good and the staffs are really friendly.

The interior was awesome,reminding historical indian dynasties,background gazal also set the tone to that..we ordered chicken shahi tangri kabab,mutton galawati kabab,rann biriyani,tandoori rooti,nehari khaas and salad.
All attendants were polite,well behaved,served efficiently and promptly...biriyani was the best(less oily),nehari khaas was so well prepared,pieces of mutton were very good,galawati kabab is definitely worth mentioning..would love to vistit again in near future..

I've always been a die hard fan of the Biryani and Chicken chap of Arsalan. It's been quite some time I've been planning to come to this place about which the whole city was going gaga.
As I was lucky to treat my taste buds at Oudh yesterday afternoon I must admit this is so far the BEST biryani that I've had. It was not at all greasy nor there was any heaviness of dalda post lunch. The Biryani had a different flavor all together. So did the chicken chap. Although I won't say the Arsalan chap is not my favorite any more. But this tasted different. I would now rather make a combo of biryani from Oudh and chap from Arsalan.
Ambience was good. The light ghazal at the@ background sets the mood right. Probably the space was a bit crunched and service was a bit too late. But nonetheless the taste was awesome. Oudh & Arsalan will keep me busy for quite some time now :)

A long wait to dine here finally ended with a sumptuous lunch. Heard a lot of positive reviews about this place and hence was eager to try some of their famous delicacies. Ordered for a portion of Galawti Kebab to start with and it was brilliant to say the least. The Mutton paste was prepared to perfection with the right amount of spices mixed. The kebab was literally melting in my mouth. My only suggestion would be to look if the typical smell of mutton can be lowered as it kinda hampers the entire experience. For the main course i ordered for a portion of Mutton Raan Biriyani and a portion of Chicken Kassa. The Biriyani was pretty good and tasty with the mutton pieces absolutely soft and juicy. Somehow i felt this item is kinda overhyped as it is not extraordinary in terms of both taste and preparation. The Chicken Kassa was mild spicy and again the chicken was soft which made the item a treat to the tastebuds. I would suggest people to order this item with Roti/Naan as the gravy looked suitable for it. The place is kinda small and the tables are placed very close to each other. This is not a typical fine dining place. The staff was quiet prompt and coordial. Overall i was satisfied with the experience and would look forward to my next visit to try some of their other kebab items.

PS - Couldn't click pictures as the place is very dimly lit.

Had heard about the place a lot and read a few rave reviews. Compared to the expectations built up, the delivery was disappointing. Caveat, this was a delivered meal and hence its all about the food and not the ambiance.

The Galawati kebabs were definitely one of the best I have ever had. Close to the perfect ghutwa kebab with a lot of sincere respect to the recipe. Very poorly packed, and they charge for packing!

The Awadhi Handi Mutton Biryani was passably OKAY. Nothing to write home about. The description reads "served in Handis" - but they charge Rs20 per Handi. That's a first! And a bad one. 

The Nihari Khaas was just about decent. The person who took the order insisted it was their best dish. I think the chef has never had a Nihari in his life. Yes, this was edible - period.

The Daal makhani with its fancy name and Butter naan were inedibly bad. Definitely avoidable.

The 'complimentary raitha' (I was shamelessly reminded by the order handler thrice that it was so) was a horribly made taste-alike cousin of the footpath Dahi Vada dahi of central Kolkata.

Overall, eminently avoidable place. The fact that they need a minimum order of 1500 bucks' worth food to deliver 2.15km away also tells me that these guys have VC money behind them and the intent to bring quality Awadhi cuisine to Kolkata is totally absent.

Pass on this place if you are a foodie.

Briyani served in a hot earthen handi. We ordered 2 plate of briyani but after seeing the quantity I suggest that 1 plate is enough for 2 foodies. galawati kabab and rezala both are awesome. If it is your first time please taste the galawati kabab.

I went to this place couple of times and they serve great food doubtlessly! If you are a fan of spicy mughlai and awadhi cuisine this is a place to be!

Food: We had a Galawati kebab for starters as it came highly recommended and I can't say I was disappointed, we also had chicken Seekh kebab which was delightful. In main course we ordered Keema Paratha with Chicken Rezala and Tandoori Roti with Gosth Roghan josh. The experience was quite fulfilling. You can enjoy a firni but I was quite full so I missed out.

Service: They will serve you quite well as I had experienced and you can also wash hands in a brass finger bowl going with the theme which was fun.

Ambiance: One of a kind ambiance , its a fully themed dimly lit restaurant with the old age background music and all. The ambiance is a huge bonus all together. 

Verdict: Highly recommended for family and friends to have a treat or celebrate an occasion. Definitely try their kebabs and biryanis.

Before I write a review on you, I must tell you I loved your decor. Now why should I start with the decor? It is difficult for me to rate your Biryani. I am an avid Biryani Fan and a cook myself (not professional though). 
You know what, the most important thing in Biryani is it's rice. Please for heaven's sake, change that. You CANNOT MAKE BIRYANI with this small grains of rice. I heard you also owns a Chinese Restaurant. Please understand the quality of rice you use to make Fried Rice should not be used in making Biryani specially when you promote yourself as an authentic Awadhi Biryani maker. 
I would like to understand why did you say it is Awadhi? The Awadh Biryani is made in home made real ghee. Not the artificial flavours. 
Anyway, if I may rate your Biryani in a scale of 1 - 5, my rating would be 2. I gave you 3 only on your decor. I think most of the people who rated you are influenced with your decor. It is a good way to divert. 
Anyway, I should not sound too negative. Gentlemen, my aim is not to demotivate you but to point out an important aspects which is missing in your food. Sorry to say but I somehow missed the soul from your food.

Waited for an hour to be seated, hoping that the food will take away that sorrow..alas. except for the galawti kebab everything was bland..fish tikka , afghani murg..all blah..biggest  disappointment was the prawn biriyani..even  with the wonderful decor and lovely music we couldn't stop wondering why this place is soooo popular.. Last but definitely not the least, the waiters all dressed in black long kurtas are extremely rude and have no clue about serving etiquette..

Heard a lot about the good food at this place and the rumours were true. Have been to Oudh 1590, ordered mutton gelouti kebab, raan biriyany, nihari khaas and butter naan. All of them were equally good and delicious.
Along with this, couple of things needed improvement. The lighting in the dining area could be better. Sometimes, we had to ask what's being served. 2ndly, there was a mild music being played but that was not distributed equally. Somebody could hear, some tables could not. 3rd and most importantly, the bill produced was incorrect, both in terms of item names and numbers. After proper scrutiny, a bill of Rs. 2280 came down to Rs. 1714.
So, I would ask everyone to visit this place but check the bill before payment.

Recently I went to my native Kolkata for a holiday and got the chance to experience the nawabi dishes served here. Before I have heard of this place and also thoroughly followed the reviews given here. Well while giving my review regarding this place I must say that one should definitely experience this kind of nawabi and Delicious dishes once in a lifetime.
I have really  become a fan of this place. The dishes are surely yummy, extremely tasty and filling.
I went there twice and was not at all dissapointed. Though there is a big queue every time and you have to wait for at least 20 mins, but it is worth it.
Both the times I had the famous Galawati Kabab which is just awesome. It melts in your mouth like anything and tastes heavenly.
Next is the Raan Biriyani. The quantity is huge,enough for 2 people accompanied with Mahi Kaliya which is super tasty.
Biriyani tastes like heaven with right amount of spices and boneless mutton pieces. I liked there serving style in clay handi

I also had the nargisi kofta which tastes good.

Overall I am in love with this place and want to come here whenever I visit my native Kolkata

Afghani culinary tr8's. Look no where else my friends. Galawati kebabs is the one you should definitely try it here. Simply AWESOME 👌
Also tried in kebabs :
Burrah Kebabs, seekh kebabs, qalmi and jafrani kebabs. These were good too. 
After all these for starters, we had to rest a bit as we tried to gather our breath. Really awesome kebabs. 
Next we ordered Gosht biryani and lucknowi paratha, on the sides nehari khas (another gem in their menu)  and gosht kundan kaliya. 
Biryani was good, not too good. Paratha tastes different (a try). 

Well after our tummy full and pockets empty, we were still left with a slight grin to show as this food'ing experience is here to stay 😁

And when the Nawab comes back home after a long time. A magestic ambience starting with the gatekeeper who is very polite and flaunts a huge moustache. As soon as you step in the timeline is set to 1590 somewhere in a Nawab's place in Lucknow. The kebabs are A class. Galauti Kebab is everyone's favourite. And the Awadhi Fish Kebab with Gondhoraj Lebu gives your taste buds an orgasm. The whole thing feels like you are in a gastronomical journey in the past. And then for the main course enters the Rann Biriyani. I have never had so much flavours in a biriyani before. Served in an earthen pot and it is sufficient for two people, this biriyani beats every other biriyani by miles. And then for dessert the Gajar ka Halwa was good. I would highly recommend everyone to try out the wide variety of biriyani and kebabs here.

Never had a worst meal like yesterday. I went there yesterday with my husband. Both of us are good foodies. We ordered galawti kebab, nibu shikanji, raan biryani ang murgh Irani. I went there with huge expectations as from the reviews I was quite sure that the biryani would be amazing. But it was a total waste, nothing special in it, shredded mutton pieces were extra salty. Same for galawti kebab, nothing special. Only murgh Irani was okay. I ended 
up with vomiting at midnight though I've a happy appetite and my husband also felt uneasy to digest the food. I'm not saying that the other reviewers are wrong. But it was my personal experience which was horrible. Mainland Chaina, Barbeque Nation, Harvey's, 6 Ballygaunge Place are far better than it.

The food, the ambience, the people were good... But I felt though the food quality was great, quantity wise I felt it should have been a bit more, going by the price I am paying for the food. Overall a lovely experience..

Oh god, the biriyani at this place is out of this world. Galawati kabab, kakori kabab is highly recommended. The service is brilliant and the waiters are very courteous. The decoration and ambience inside is perfect. Also personally, the benarasi pan shop outside the restaurant is perfectly located to satisfy a bengali's palate.
P.S. early bird doesn't get to stand in line.

what an amazing place located at Deshapriya Park! I went on the Saptami to have a grand lunch and needless to say this place just pleased me a lot. We had to wait for more than one hour as the place was jam packed. After getting in my eyes were stuck into a big mirror on the wall. The place was perfectly set for a nawabi mood with all its decorations and artifacts. Although the place is not very spacious inside. foods were being served in the traditional utensils. We had the great Galawati Kabab as starter. It was heavenly good!!! so soft and juicy and was perfectly cooked. As main course we had Raan Biriyani and Awadhi biriyani accompanied by Gosht kundan kaliya. All were beautifully spiced up and too good to have. we had Phirni which was also quite tasty. Staffs were well behaved abd quite prompt with the service. Overall this place is  must try for all Biriyani lovers. Will be back soon :)

This is indeed one of the defining restaurants in kolkata. Located near desapriya park in the next lane to Tamarind is easily accessible for most of the people.The decor is essentially nawabi in essence. The feel of lucknow oozes out from the beautiful external view of the restaurant. The same is maintained with vintage artistry in tables, wall frescos, curtain n even the culinary. The gazal playing the background enchants the feeling. The space is really crowded most of the time n we had to wait in the que.Serving staffs are really mediocre at work as good behaviour is much desired.
The food is quitessentialy of nawabi genre.We ordered raan biriyani, Ghost shahi korma, lucknawi paratha, Galauti kebab n awadhi kebab.This is arguably the best biriyani that I hv ever tasted.The ghee clad biriyani triumphs over any best eatery in town n is sufficient for two to share.Lucknawi paratha appears like hand napkins and are feathery which needs to b eaten with kebabs.Galauti kebab are four peaces of tikiyas which are truly exotic in taste.Awadhi kebabs were truly mindblowing n melted in mouth in jiffy.The food is truly an experience for the foodie but they do loose out on the service front which does needs an overhaul to be rated highest in all categories.

My last stop before I say goodbye to Kolkata. Oudh 1590. 
Cant really say that I have any complains. Its an all round good place. Very good period décor, though a bit too small to give the royal feeling, which I believe, is what they had set out to achieve.
The food was very good.
 We had the galauti kabab, kakori kabab, the raan biryani, nihari khaas, keema kaleji along with lakhnawi parantha, plain naan, peas pulao( cuz they don't serve steamed rice) and firni for dessert. 
The galauti kabab was very nice but the kakori kabab felt a bit insubstantial ( u know what I mean?) It was not very meaty perhaps. A little better than mutton paper in my mouth. And the paper kinda tasted like the galauti kabab 😏
The keema kaleji was very good and the nehari khas was even better! Lakhnawi paratha was loved by everyone. The naan very fresh and crisp. The pulao was very good as well. The biryani, not bad. Pretty good actually if u don't compare it with any other biryani you've had before. The firni, though very good consistency and texture wise, was too sweet for me. I believe firni is supposed to have a subtle sweetness about it and not be loaded with sugar, like payesh. 

Coming to the service. This was definitely my favourite part. The speed! Oh I'm pretty sure that I've never seen faster service in all my yrs of dining! 
The staff was courteous and very well dressed. Strangely enough though, my server was more "casual" than "courteous"  .... Ah well....
All in all a very  satisfactory end to my Kolkata food sojourn.

This is the fifth time I have dropped in here and this time with my family. This time I also decided to write something about this favourite place of mine. I like their authentic culture inside, especially the food. The galawati kebab, kakori kebab, raan biriyani, mutton dishes, keema stuffed paratha and shahi tukra are mouthwatering. I would never stop myself from going there again and again.

I am a big fan of biriyani. The only place in whole kolkata where I loved enjoying "raan biriyani" after mom made home special biriyani. I guess I will never force my mom to cook for me or rush to any other place except this place when it comes to awadhi biriyani. Ambience reminds you of the mughal period. The background music of Begam Akhtar ji added an extra charm to the ambience to enjoy the dinner :)

Serving the best Biriyani in town, this restaurant with its food definitely hit your spot.. I would not say that they serve best biriyani at a moderate rate, because that place is well guarded by Royal, but if you have a few extra bucks in your pocket then I would go to Oudh without any secon@d thought... Suggested dishes are Awadhi Handi Biriyani with Lucknow paratha with Galouti or Kakori Kebab... Biriyani quantity is 2 plates for three people and so on

Location - If you come from Gariahat side you need to get down at Deshapriya Park, cross the road and take a right.  Take the second lane on Lansdown side and walk till its end and you will find Oudh 1590. Similarly if you come from Kalighat side, you need take a left after getting down at Desapriya park and follow the above steps.

Ambiance and Decor- On a very ordinary Sunday ,after waiting for one and a half hour , we finally went into the restaurant. The restaurant is wonderfully decorated with melodious thungri being the added cream to comply with the environment.

Food ordered :  We ordered : 
                          1) Galwati Kebab 2) Raan Biriyani 3) Chicken Irani and Aerated drinks.
Food quality and Quantity : Oudh 1590 serves 4 mouth watering Galwati kebab per plate; which is very good(although I expected better)
The Raan biriyani is adequate for 2 (unless you have a too big stomach). It is served with slowly  cooked shredded mutton raan and rice. The taste and smell will make you come to this place again and again. And as a side dish Chicken Irani was just  perfect in taste with Raan Biriyani. But only 2 pcs of Chicken was too less for the price they ask for.

Behaviour : Oudh 1590 has very well groomed staffs from the  gatekeeper to each of the  waiters. They will all give you a homely feeling. Overall, its a must try for all non-vegetarians!!

Had waited long to visit this place and chose to do so on 26th Dec... The rush was phenomenal.. Waited almost 75 minutes with my family in the cold to get in!!!But then..It was peak season time and most good places in Kolkata have long queues.. 
The food.. well that is what it was all about. Started with Galawati Kebabs with Lucknawi Paratha...Tasted like heaven!Then came the Butter Naan and Chicken Irani.. Naan was really nice and the chicken was spiced beautifully..Next up, Raan Biriyani and Nehari Khaas... The biriyani is true Awadhi style one and the Nehari was top notch too...All in all, a really pleasant and filling dining experience..! Will be back for sure!

Heard a lot about this Awadhi restaurant.
Went there recently for my brothers birthday.
The exterior looked quite beautiful and royal , luring enough to take you inside to explore the place
You are welcomed by a guard with a huuuge moustache . Give you the royal pinch
Once i entered , i was quite disappointed with the cramped space but it is beautifully decorated with woodworks and dim yellow lights.
Coming to the food , we tasted a lot of kababs
The fish kabab was good and the sizes were big so were the chicken kebabs.
Their signature dish the mutton galouti kabab was very soft , tender and tasty.
We ordered chicken awadhi biryani and irani chicken. The irani chicken is a sweetish preparation , the awadhi biryani i loved ! Many who do not prefer awadhi might not love it.
We had fresh lime soda sweet and salty and the aam ras. The drinks were good too.
The staff were properly trained coruteous and fast as well
Worth a visit!

This is a nice cozy place to have dinner and lunch with friends and family. Because of its size it looks overcrowded during weekends but worth the wait. Price wise at par with others of the same category. Dum biriyani is pretty decent both in terms of quality and quantity. Galoti kebab is okay, but not comparable to some authentic Awadhi joints of Delhi NCR especially Dilli Haat. Overall good!

This was my first visit to Oudh and I'm actually very pleased or rather I'm extremely happy. The first impression of this place to me was that it was a bit small. But the service was quite good. The food we ordered was served to us quickly. First, we ordered some starters, namely, Afghani Kebab and Zafrani Kebab. Both were good but not up to my expectations. Previously I heard a lot about the quality and taste of the food. But the starters failed to surprise me. It was actually the main course which took me by surprise. It was the Awadhi Handi Biriyani which was ecstatic to taste and the amount was more than sufficient. 
Overall I'm extremely happy as I said before and I would definitely recommend others to try out here. But I still wish if the kebabs were better!!

A place of heaven for food-o-holics. Since months this place was on my 'to-visit list' and finally went there with family and experienced the real flavours of mughal-e-azam. 

Although we waited for sometime, thanks to the rush @ dinner time, no complains came from our side once we had our food aka:
1. Mouth watering soft kebabs exactly matching our gastronomical levels
2. Rann Handi Biriyani being just yummy
3. Pulao with the actual mughal touch, and,
4. Kofta curry which was again..so good.

Lastly, this should be mentioned that the staffs were really warm-hearted and should get a wave of positivity from my side. Thumbs-up till we meet again for sure. Cheers!

I visited this place for lunch with a colleague.

Its not difficult to locate this place. 2nd left on sarat bose road from deshapriya park. The place is not very big. 
Liked the ambiance. Nice woodwork, the lamps and chandeliers create a nice feel of lucknowi benarasi era.. A light background music of sarangi and tabla completes it.
Wait staff are dressed in traditional kurtas.. 
The menu card is real heavy to even lift. Anyways we ordered murg malai kebab and awadh handi biriyani.
The kebabs were excellent. Soft and subtle flavours. The handi, i learnt was actually for mutton. If you wish to have it prepared with chicken, you need to let the staff know. 

The biriyani tastes good. Generous amount of ghee, 2 eggs and good amount of chicken. 
Overall, loved the place.
Shall i visit again? Yes.

Oudh 1590. At last. Loved the ambience and interior, loved the courteous staff.

About the food. We had Mutton Galawati Kabab, Murgh Zafrani Kabab, Awadhi Handi Biriyani, and Chicken Irani.

Biriyani was enough for two people. it was not the usual preparation, the one we are used to in Kolkata and that was the best thing about it. I am not so fond of mutton but I had to take the risk and it was a risk worth taking and next time I am going to use my hands for the mutton.

Galawati Kabab again was something that I tasted for the first time and it didn't disappoint. But will be trying the other Kababs made with mutton on my next visit.

Murgh Irani. A flavoursome dish. Definitely recommended.

Murgh Zafrani Kabab. It was delicious but not surprising.

Visited this place after hearing a lot about it from almost everybody. This place is very popular. We visited this place on a tuesday night, at around 8 Pm but still there were people waiting to get in. So book a table in advance if you can. We had galauti kabab, chicken sheekh kabab abd raan biriyani all the food items were excellent I must say. The galauti kabab deserves a special mention. The biriyani had very less oil but tatsted heavenly. The cons would inculde slow service, I had to ask 4 times for getting a glass of water and the seating is cramped.

I heard about this restaurant from someone outside of Kolkata. Then I search for it and read the menu. Thought it is bit overpriced among the all the biryani makers of Kolkata. Then I go there and try awadhi handi biryani and I must say that money matters. Matters for taste, presentation, service, ambience. I am very much happy and want to try again.

The only reason I visited the place was the extraordinary review on Zomato. The ambience was mesmerizing. I loved the Nawabi decor and the Ghazals that they play to set the Nawabi mood. We ordered raan Biriyani, murgh Biriyani, gosht roghan josh, mahi chaap and anaras raita. I was very disappointed with their food but the Anaras raita was good. Service was good.

I was visiting Kolkata for the first time in my life and so my brother-in law along with my sis-in law treated my wife and I at this place. He wanted us to taste the famous Raan Biryani. So we ended up ordering that along with Zafrani kebab for starters and Gajar-ka-halwa for desert. We were seated in a nice corner. The decor if you see the pics makes you feel like you're part of some Mughal era. The only downside I felt was the lighting. The corners are dim lit and it tries to kill your appetite. I seriously feel they should change the tone of the lights and instead lighten it up.

The very first bite of each food made different flavors literally explode in your mouth. The kebabs were succulent and what I liked more was the subtle taste of yogurt and saffron.The minute I tasted the biryani I could instantly taste the saffron, rose essence and yogurt. Its served in a earthen pot which in itself adds another flavor to it.
I usually don't eat gajar-ka-halwa but I made an exception that day as it was simply mouth watering. Like me if you're visiting Kolkata for the first time do make it a point to visit this place. You won't regret it. If I revisit Kolkata I will definitely visit this place wanting for more.

A highly rated place on zomato for period dining ,oudh1590 was on a visit list for a very long time .finally made it on birthday eve and it didn't disappoint .We had to wait for half an hour to get a seat and the ambience took us back to days of awadhi nawabs .Food is good ..specially the signature dish of Lucknow gaulauti kebab is superb ..instant melt in mouth preparation. Awadhi handi biriyanis is good too and sufficient amount for two to eat .Irani chicken is bit on the sweeter side with cashew base for the curry but nevertheless compliments the biriyani well.The service is rather quick ,the staffs are good but the space is bit crammed up and there is very little space for them to move ..while serving and taking orders .Its better if they can get rid of one seat and make it a bit spacious ,but then again its one of the busiest dine-out places and business matters ;)

This was my 1st visit in this outlet overall second.The ambiance was good.

We order Galawati kabab and Kakori kabab, they were as usual a delight for the taste buds then  in  main course we had Raan Biriyani and Moti Biriyani along with Butter naan murgh irani and gosht bhuna.

murgh irani and the gosht buna were good how ever the main reason for these rating is-we were served Luke warm biriyani and that ruined our taste and the mood though they gave an extra raan biriyani after it was been reported how ever by then it has spoiled the mood and top of that fresh lime soda was too sweet as compared to any other place and coke was as usual.

The overall experience wasn't that good.

Last time in the salt lake outlet we had a GREAT experience however with the crowd of Sunday and the festive loving people OUDH 1590 DESAPRIYA PARK failed to live up to the expectation.

Oudh ,the legendary abode of the nawab isn't after all a mythical state.I realised this after visiting this mini oudh at desapriya park.The ambience here takes you to 1590A.D. and the the decor makes you feel like a royal guest of the nawab himself!!!!Well ,the utensils feel even from the same era!We ordered the galoti kebab as starters along with the kalmi kebab. They were really good.But what made this restaurant apart from the others???Yepps,, the awadhi handi biriyani. ....ooh ..how can I forget that desi ghee aroma and layer of desi ghee sprinkled on it..The spices, the mutton , the rice, all blended in the most perfect way possible.Dont know whether the real awadhi biriyani during the nawabi era was served with egg...but it went well with the bengali palate like mine..what you can't miss here is definitely this handi biriyani.I think you don't need any other side dish with it. (They serve a raita like curd with it).I completed my meal with the shahi tukda.It was good but I ve had a much cheaper n more delicious version at India restaurant at khidderpore.Heard that their nalli nihari is also famous.Ought to give it a try someday.(Didnt had any sq. Millimeter space in my gut that day....oo oh I didn't eat that all my self...had my buddy with me).Well ,when I left the place with my gut and heart satisfied, the tune of lucknowi classical SANGEET still echoed in my ears.Thanks Oudh 1590.! !!!😊😊😊😆😆😆 (But the food here is a bit costly...still they serve enough quantity for two to share from a single plate..💸💸💸)

As usual the christmas evening nowadays, comprises an "evening walk" along the park street main road. Santa caps and HORNY looks.. Hence to round of the day, we paid a visit to ths beautiful place. OUDH 1590..

Yes, i admit occasions like these get these type of places crowdy and people queue up. But the biriyani and mussalams that were being served were worth the wait, compounded by the behaviour of the waiters, present.. :) 

Nutshell, too good a place to eat.. not just 3, but 1590cheers.. :)

Ordered few dishes to sample the menu:

Chicken zafrani: 2/5 - meat wasn't much tender and lacked any character. Was not that great.

Mutton Gelwati: 3/5 - was nice bit a little too salty for my taste

Veg Gelwati: 1.5/5 - just did not get this dish. This missed the boat.

Raan Biryani: 4/5 - really good, flavorful, tender meat. 

Palak Biryani: 4/5 - Really good and knocked the socks off. Never expected it to be so good. Really flavorful, smoky, creamy and prefect.

Dum Aloo: 3.5/5 - pretty good. Felt that potato could have been of better quality. Lacked the softness and creamy texture.

Nargisi Kofta: 4/5 - scotched eggs in real awadhi sources and curry. Rasht liked it.

Murg Musalam: 4/5 - loved it. The curry/gravy was really rich, creamy and nice. Not sure if the chicken was marinated for long. The flavor might not have reached all the way.

Hats off for the decor and ambience its a true period dining experience as they call it, but I feel there is little need of light its a bit dark. The food is just awesome and so it is the service. Keep up the good taste....wish to visit in near future too as a lot many delicacies are yet to be tasted...

Oudh 1590 opens its doors to the most beautiful 16th century Awadhi cuisine. The immediate change of atmosphere, once you step inside the restaurant would make you wonder whether you just time travelled.
From the most intricate wood carvings to the mughal paintings donning the walls, Oudh would give you a feeling of dining with the Royals.
The quality of food is of royal standard too. Their galwati kabab is something you cannot miss. Please don't. Followed by the dum pukht style biriyani. My favourite being the Raan Biriyani, served in an earthen clay pot. Nehari Khaas could also be included under the Naav Ratan. To end on a sweet note, their Firni is to die for, a bit low-key on the sugary side yet so delicious and of course their Shahi Tukra, if you are craving for something sweeter.
Oudh 1590 is a wonder when it comes to the Mughlai cuisine. They know they are great and they live up to their fame. A must visit if you are looking for a high end dinner with your family or friends.

One of the best biriyani I have ever had and the quantity was sufficient enough. One biriyani is enough for 2 people. The quality was brilliant and it lived up to the expectation. Looking forward to visiting it again.

Impressed with decoration and servicing. There is a touch of Mughal dynasty everywhere. From chair, table, glass to that paan masala box.

Quality food but a bit costly I felt. Thoroughly enjoyed though.

Restaurant with lucknowi essence and ambience. 
Ambience wise am rating it as 4, food is ok or may be they are not interested to serve their best. 
It is Very disappointing when they have served their speciality half cooked

I was planning to try out this one for a very long time but it wasn't happening for some reason or the other. First of all, I found the lighting to be too dim for my liking. It was too dark. I was excited to try out the famous galawati kabab, but i found its way too overrated. In fact, the murgh malai kabab was superb and perhaps the best I have had till date. The awadhi handi biriyani was okay. I really cant term this place as amazing. Overall its an okay sort of restaurant and I would prefer aminia or arsalan over this anyday. I was kind of disappointed after all the expectations that I had. Nevertheless one should try out this place at least once.

Had chicken kabab  and raan biryani here. Both were so delicious... best biryani of my life so far. Biryani was very light yet tasty. It has rich flavour of kesar, rose water and the meat was well cooked. For dessert we had gajar halwa...it was heavenly. Will definitely visit this place again when. Thanks Oudh 1590 for such aweeeeesome flavours. :)

I visited this place with my family..it was so crowded and we had to wait outside for an hour.Anybody coming on a sunday evening keep an hour handy.
Ambience is great,the slow classical music reminded me of the nawabi gharana of lucknow..
Food was great too,the handi biriyani being served in real earthen 'handi's.The dishes were of heavy steel and the water glasses were made of brass.We had 'galawati kabab' and it really did melt in my mouth..sooo tastyy....
Must must must visit Oudh 1590!!!!

Being a bong, living away from home & Kolkata, always means that you have a bucket list of restaurants for your next home-coming trip. OUDH-1590 was amongst the top of my list, and I must say I will keep this in my list for my upcoming visits too. 
The restaurant is tucked away in a residential locale of south Kolkata, but its unique decor gives it a character and raises expectations of cuisine to be served. The entire decor (outside & inside) has been immaculately done and shows that a lot of planning has been done, which will take you back in time. 
Once inside you are greeted with light classical indian music, or rather music from Lucknowi gharana. I was also very impressed with dinnerware chose, and once again there has not been a single stone unturned to take you back in time and make u feel seated in a 16th century haveli in Lucknow. 
We ordered - Mutton Awadi Handi Biriyani, Nihari Gost, Firni & Sahi Tukra. Food was really well done. Biriyani was lightly flavored and  well done. I won't say that its the best biriyani I have ever tried but its good. But, according to me 'Nihari Gost' was absolutely mind boggling and the earthen nutty smoky flavor will leave you craving for more. The only thing I noted, their quality of mutton/meat could be better and also the meat was far too bony to my liking. Desserts were also very well done. The service was prompt, attentive & very courteous. 
Given the quality of food & their great value for money; I would definitely recommend this to anyone. You can't be wrong no matter whatever you order here.

In 1590, Oudh was very much Awadh & would continue to be so for a century or more. That apart, this place is without a blemish. Or perhaps, the Nawabi decor, heavily wooded & dimly lit with some ghazal playing in the background, was a little overwhelming.

But the Raan Briyani packed a delectable pukht, the Irani chicken was beyond delicious & the Phirni might have pacified Aurangzeb as he was plotting the murder of Dara Shikoh. All this came with first class service & a very reasonable bill.

Also, after a meal like this, it is quite impossible to enjoy a game of shatranj - but that flaw in the story lies squarely with Premchand in his tale on the Awadhi nawabs.

Retire & nap - pull the blanket close a wee bit; that's what you gotta do after this.

I am not much of a Mughlai/North Indian foodie. But, tastes demand a change and so do I live to pamper them with a twist at times.

This Mughlai Restuarant came after my visit to Kaafila, the one in City Center. Going on the lines of comparison, I must say these traditionally well-known Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata have a better interior decoration than food. I ain't saying that food is not good but when you compare the interior decoration and ambience with the food quality and taste, you would mostly find them ranking higher on ambience than food. So, lets breakdown Oudh 1590 for what it is.

Ambience (4/5) - Classic Lanterns and wall decors trying to give you a possible Mughal dining experience. Sitting is neither too clumsy nor spacious. Somehow, because of the Mughal Guns hanging on the walls, I do find the decor of Kaafila better than this one.

Food (3.5/5) - The Dum ki Rann is a speciality here and so is the Galawti Kabab and Rann Biriyani. The Dum ki Rann was good. Comparing it to a similar speciality available at Kaafila, I would say this one is way better. The big bone with meat on it is never provided at Kaafila but here at Oudh they provided two Rann pieces with shredded Rann meat at only 800. I remember that's around 1200 at Kaafila and not as good as the one I had here.
The Galawti Kabab had a different pungent taste which did not suit my buds that much. As I said, I am not that much of a Mughal Food person.
We had the Murgh Malai Kabab which was a good suggestion by the waiter. I prefer mutton more, but among these 3 starters that we had, I liked this one the most.
For main course, we unanimously voted for the Rann Biriyani except our non-mutton guy who went for a simple Murgh Biriyani. The Rann Biriyani consists of shredded mutton bits and although Zomato suggests that one as a speciality, I did not find that much of a 'wow' factor in it.
As side dishes we had Mugh Irani and Gosht Bhuna both of which were just good.

Overall, the Dum ki Rann was the top notch stuff. Apart from that there was no 'wow' factor. 

Service (3/5) - Not too late, neither too fast. A peak evening time works good in this way.

Cost (2.5/5) - Not a Value for Money place, neither a top notch premium one.

Finally, although Mughlai food fans could find multiple reasons to step into this place, I doubt I would walk here again. Not because this place is bad or not worthy in any way. But, there's nothing too special for me here to savour again.

Heard a lot about this restaurant for about a year while I was away from my hometown. So made it a point to visit the place while I was back to the city for a break only to feel utterly disappointed. The taste of the food was barely mediocre to me and the least I say about the quality of meat/chicken served the better. This was the disappointment of the season to me.

Interior - Marvelously decorated, a lil dim lighting, wooden architect & old paintings, soft old music.. And the dishes of old ruling age.. 
It feels you are sitting in a museum..  (5 of 5)
Service - The guys are good, served very well.. (4.5 of 5)
Expense - Yeah, out here i gotta say, they charged some extra fee on my bill.. I checked when i got back home.. They charged me for water.. Which i actually asked them not to give.. 
Food charges for 2 will be approx Rs. 800..

I really wanted to go to this place for a very long time. Finally I succeeded, went there with my in-laws for the anniversary treat. Location was very easy to find. Very nice interiors. But I have a problem with dimly lit restaurant as I can't see the food colour properly, which is imp to know how the food will be and what to expect. Firstly we ordered tandoori chicken and qalmi kebab for starters. Tandoori was very delicious and properly Cooked. Qalmi was disappointing as the chicken was smelling a bit. For main course we ordered Irani murgh, murgh kassa, butter naan, lucknavi paratha, tandoori roti and gosht biryani. Both Irani and kassa was very tasty. Gosht biryani is not up to the mark. I think its not worth 300, its not properly dum. Even the meat that came with it had very little meat in it, more bone and fat Should have been little more drier as well. Same with other biryani. Over rated place for biryani. Special mention again for the tandoori chicken which I just loved it. Will be visiting again for that. Staffs very courteous and service was nice.
One more problem was they serve the second starter with the main course. Or I should say after coz they brought everything and then kebab.

A very unique place which takes you back to the world of old charm of awadh beautifully setup in the age of modern era. Oudh 1590 is a place which sets high standard when it comes to north indian cuisine is concerned & stands out very far ahead of the crowd.

So had the pleasure of visiting this place today afternoon with my foodie friend. At first we were doubtful about getting a place since from the reviews here we had seen that normally people would have to wait to get their seats. So as expected we had to wait for 25mins approx. But the moment came soon after & we both were awestuck upon entering the place. Eye catching interior with buzzing crowd & soft gaazal music playing in the background just set the mood for a delightful lunch.

So we quickly gave our order which consisted of:-

1. Aam khaas - Refreshing drink using aam panna & masala which went very well with our lunch.

2. Galawati kebabs - Simply "outstanding" if described in one word. We had never tasted anything like this before. The subtle taste & the texture of the dish was spot on. They melted as soon as we touched them. They were served with pickled onions which complemented the dish very much. Also the pudina chutney & some curd type of chutney also went very well with the kebabs.

3. Murgh tandoori half - Nothing to brag about this dish but we liked the charring of the chicken. The chicken was perfctly charred with neither being under nor too over. The balance was perfect & the tenderness of the chicken was maintained very well.

4. Rann biriyani - A speciality of oudh. We ordered this on the recommendation of fellow zomatians. This dish really lived up to its reputation. Served in a small handi but trust me its quantity is huge which could easily satisfy the hunger of two gluttons. The unique masala used in this biriyani is different from the orthodox kolkata biriyani. There were generous amounts of mutton which were very tender. Another point to be noted that they dont use(very little) oil which is negligible.

5. Nehari khaas - Another speciality of their's. 4 meaty pieces of mutton cooked in rich & tasty gravy served with coriander. Great dish to have with biriyani. Not spicy at all but the taste would surely leave a lasting impression on the eater. The muttons were perfectly cooked & was coming off so easily from the bone. Just brilliant.

6. Phirni - Last but not the least we ended our royal feast with a desert. The phirnis were served with badaam toppings which gave that crunch. The phirnis were smooth & weren't dense.

The total bill came to rs.1786 inc all taxes. The service deserves special mention. Very attentive,fast & the guys were trained very well to cope up with the crowd rush. So to sum up i would say that oudh has given us a benchmark when it comes to tasting biriyanis. Would happily visit again! Keep up the good work.

The periodic dining experience rings true. 

Went on a Sunday afternoon to check all the hype and hoopla on what is apparently the new star on the blocks on the Kolkata food map . The ambience and decor were signs of a winning combo from the start , the lighting , seating and soft jhankaars of ghazal in the background , it was royalty on a platter . 

Speaking of platters , let's get to the true stars . The Galawati kebab is Oudh's signature dish in terms of popularity and boy did it live upto the expectations . Beautifully prepared with a melt in mouth texture, it was a knock out from the first bite . 

The Biriyani was beautifully done , the hint of various flavours and spices , distinct with one another to create a domino effect inside your tastebuds . The main course "Nihar-E-Khaas", chunks of soft mutton beautifully cooked in rich gravy complemented the biriyani perfectly . These two are known hits among the Zomato folks and would not disappoint. 

We also took Tandoori Chicken and phirni , which , while nothing exceptional, was beautifully done . The entire meal including the rose petal finger bowl and the cutlery gives you the periodic premium dining feel and the final pricing leaves your wallet happier that most other places . 

Great atmosphere . Fantastic food . Premium service . The only downside being the long wait times ( ours was about 30 minutes ) , Oudh 1590 has royalty written all over it . No matter what your expectations are , it will live up to it and more . 

Happy dining !

Had Awadhi Handi biriyani, the aroma & subtle taste was a delight, also had Nargisi kofta & sorbets as suggested by the waiter. The staff of the restaurant were courteous & efficient, a strong add-on. This place will definitely be revisited by us for kebabs & parathas. :-)

Took takeaway from here recently. We ordered Galawti Kebab, Murgh Biryani, 1 laccha paratha , Rumali Roti and Chicken Irani. The Galawti Kebab was extremely soft, melts in the mouth like butter. However it was too salty for my taste. The biryani and laccha paratha were pretty average. Chicken Irani was recommended by the waiters, it was very good, however slightly sweet. Food was served fast, within 15 mins. Recommend this place, try galawti kebab

If you are a connoisseur of Biryani and North Indian food, you have a reason to go gaga over this place. We went there for an "Awadhi" dinner and guess what, it didn't disappoint us. The dim lights, Nawabi paintings, gazal played at the background, mughal utensils gave us that "1590 era". We ordered Gelawati kebab, Fish jafrani kebab, Ran biryani, Awadhi handi biryani, Tandoori roti, Murgh irani, Nehari khaas. Gelawati kebab was so delicious, it just melted in our mouth. Ran and awadhi handi biryani was awesome with its utterly-butterly taste. You will certainly crave for more. Lastly we took Gajar ka Halwa which had a tantalising yummy taste. A must visit for foodies...

Must say no doubt why its in the biryani special collection of zomato. The taste is awesome. So is the quantity. Good ambience. But this desapriya branch has very limited space. I might say its a bit conjusted. Also the service aint that good. As they try to serve and bring you the bill fast without trying to know what you want. So that they can let you out fast and line can be cleared. Good for business but not for the person eating. You dont get to enjoy the place much. Also the pricing is way to hig compared to the food and service. Still wasnt a bad experience. Need to check out the sector 1 branch now.

Oudh 1590 is one of the best in town in North Indian Mughlai and Awadhi cuisine. The dishes were way too delicious than what we think it would be... the gelwati kababs will just melt in mouth... the best dishes were gelwati kabab, Fish jafrani kabab, Nehari khas, Ran biriyani,Murg irani and last but not the least Gajar ka halwa...
Gajar ka halwa is mouth watering...
Ambience was too good ...the background music , the wall paintings of Kings and Queens and the glass , plates and spoons all over there was a touch of Mughals and Awadh...
Only problem we faced was we had to wait for half an hour to get a table...

I was there during Durga puja, so we had to wait in a long queue for at least one hour. And that was a tough test for our patience. But that long wait did not go in vain. The food was awesome. We tasted various items. But among them Lukhnowi paratha with Mutton galwati kebabs was out of the world. Moto biriyani was good too. Considering the quality of food served price was okay, hospitality was awesome, ambience was nice but there was shortage of space. Overall a good experience.

I recently visited the place with my parents on their 25th wedding anniversary. To begin with, the decor..ambiance...music...it was beautiful. We had ordered Qalmi Kabab,Moti Biriyani and Musgh Kassa. The food took approx 15minutes to arrive. The kabab was lovely. The biriyani was sufficient for two and was very tasty. Murgh kassa was also very nice with huge chicken pieces and a lot of rich gravy. Pocket pinch for two will be around 1200-1500 (including the VAT n all). The servers were most courteous and very attentive. Overall the experience was very very good. Happy dining :)

The decor is mesmerizing. Even the waiters are dressed in traditional attire. I've heard a lot about this place but I was disappointed . 
We ordered galauti kebabs and a chicken biryani (Kolkata style) both the kebab and biryani were just average. The price you need to pay for this is not worth it at all. The biryani specially was very disappointing.

Not recommend.

A 15 min of waiting on Monday night makes u think of 2 possibilities. 1. U have arrived at the most popular mughlai restaurant in town &/or 2. A small overhyped one with delays in service.
Well I'm sure after going thru the review u will b sure of one of the options.
Push the door and u enter into a dim lighted restaurant. Decorated in old moghal style with paintings and electric lanterns. A soft ghazal plays in the background instantly makes ur mood and ur olfaction confirms u that ur at the right place.
The menu card is huge. And is better u leave it to them and zomato for suggestions.We too did the same. U have 1 waiter appointed per table n he's polite and attentive.
After a brief waiting period came the Galauti kabab. And it was perfect. Galauti kabab is meant to b soft n should melt into ur mouth instantaneously and so did it. The dips and pickles were distinctively good.
In the main course we had Lucknowi paratha , Rann Biriyani and Nihar e khaas. The paratha comes in good proportions and can fill u up if ur not accustomed to overeating :P . The Rann Biriyani is the best mutton Biriyani I've had till date. Generous portions of mutton will leave u overly satisfied. Taste of biriyani too is distinct from the regular ones u have. Nihar e khas contains chunks of mutton cooked in typical north Indian style. U can distinctly feel the taste of spices used. Amount is again quite good. 1 paratha 1 Biriyani 1 Nihar e khaas and 1 Galauti kabab(4 pieces) should serve at least 2.5 ppl. In our case it did 3.
And how come a meal b complete without a dessert. However since the popular Shahi tukra wasn't available we had to satisfy ourselves with firni only. Proportions were agn good.
We too had Aam khaas to start off. Well if u avoid dat u won't miss much to be frank.
A wholesome meal costs around 1200 - 1500 for 2 persons.
Definitely a must visit restaurant. Definitely worth ur time and money.
P.S. The way to the washroom shudnt have to b the way it is.

I celebrated my birthday with my girlfriend at OUDH(desapriya park);the food was so good that we will definitely visit again there to try their other delicacies...more over the low lit ambience is perfect for couples to spend quality time together..Their hospitality and catering is commendable...At first I was a little bit nervous about how the restaurant would be,but it completely satisfied me.

From the makers of the Chowman, this young food joint grabbed kolkata's attention pretty quickly. It was always in my 'To-Do-List'. Finally the chance came as a birthday treat from one of my buddies. We three headed for a dinner. The beautifully crafted interior (exterior too) will take you straight to the era of nawabs n mughals. We ordered 'Aam sharbat' and 'Soda shikanji' to start with. Both were good with perfect blend of soda, flavours and spices. Our main course took off with the famous 'Galauti kebab' and 'Lucknowi paratha'. O man...!! The kebab truly melted in our mouth making us craving for more. Paratha was huge, almost 40cm in diameter. But it was thinner than we expected a paratha to be. Next we moved on to "Raan biriyani" and "Nehari khaas". Biriyani was pure lucknowi in style, though they served raita with it. The best part was that the tender mutton leg was shredded. It beautifully avoided the fight for pieces between us ;) Nehari khaas was as usual to taste buds. But one thing for sure, I have never seen that much soft and succulent mutton in other restaurants. We decided to end our medieval adventure with 'Phirni'. To tell the truth, very happy with their food and service. Amount per plate did a very good justice to the cost of it. A must try for kolkata's food lovers :)

Oudh 1590 stole my heart as soon as i entered the restaurant...  The ambience, the dim lighting, the painting on the walls and the music had instantly set the mood for exploring the awesomeness of some awadhi delicacies..  Even the cutlery sets managed to add to the mughal feel... Coming to the food we bad ordered galowti kebab with lucknowi paratha..the galowti kebab tasted heavenly.. It was soft amazingly flavoured and melted in the mouth...for the main course we had ordered raan biriyani which came with complimentary raita and paneer qorma... The biriyani was brilliantly done with beautiful flavours that one can never forget... The paneer qorma is the best i have had till date...the staffs were courteous and the service was prompt...had a great experience there and would definitely love to visit again...

Had been here a couple of times, latest being yesterday. Food is very good. Decor is super. Staff are polite. Tried Galauti Kebab with Lucknowi parathas. Melts in your mouth! A must try. Rest we tried fish chap, mutton chap, raan biryani, murg biryani. All are pretty good. Portions are also sufficient. Was disappointed since neither Gajar ka Halwa nor Kulfi Falooda was available. The waiter told us it was never available here. Kindly modify the menu accordingly. Overall good experience except the dessert part of it.

The "saahii" interior, the soft gazal playing in the background and the waiters wearing black pathan suits totally sums up your Mughal experience. Each and every dish, be it galouti kebab or biriyani or as a matter of fact be it firni, they utterly delicious. And not to forget that moustache of the gatekeeper - just adds to the omph factor of this place.

The ambience is superb, the Mughal era touch, themed cutlery and cordial Islamic hospitality immediately creates an emotional connection. And then the food is quite wonderful. The Biryani is great, so is the original Lucknowi Galawati. However, please take a note, the Kakori Kebab is a mess. The ingredients seem to be wrong - it is stiffer than desired and the over-indulgence of saffron kills the taste completely. The gravy dishes specially the rezala is exquisite. Overall, nice!

First of all this was awesome experience for me. I had to throw a dinner party to very close relatives and after much deliberation choose Oudh. 

Place was very near convenient from my house in South Kolkata. I am happy that I choose this place. here are my feedback/

1. Ambience - 4/5

2. Service - 4/5

3. Food - 4.5/5

Awesome food, the Mutton Galauti kabab, with lukhnow paratha just melts into your mouth, we ordered 3 plates!!!

Mutton Nihari is one more dish you must try... add to it chicken parda biriyani awesome!!!

We have had enough Kolkata Biryani this one was like breath of fresh air...

will visit again, when I am back in Kolkata

I can guarantee that this is the best place for having biriyanis.. Yes, if you are a true biriyani lover one should definately visit this place. the Galawti kebabs tasted excellent, it was  made up of soft tender minced mutton with all kinds of spices which melts easily to  your mouth.. They were definately brilliant.. coming to the main course we ordered the famous Rann biriyani ,Nihari khaas (awadhi special) and Gosht Shahi Qorma.
 The rann biriyani tasted brilliant, it was served in a big handi which was more than enough for two persons, it had small tender pieces of mutton well cooked with the yellow coloured rice which tasted yummy . Raitas were also served with the biriyani, coming to nehari khaas it had an egg and mutton kebabs dipped in delicious gravy, this dish is something which one should definitely try. Now the gosht shahi qorma was also very tasty despite of the fact the mutton pieces had more of bones then the flesh.. Yes this was the only dish which disappointed us a lil, but overall I think this is the best place for Awadhi Cuisine and it deserves a 4.5 rating :D

Ouch 1590 is the best place to have Awadhi cuisine in Kolkata. Their Galawti Kabab and Lucknowy paratha is just brilliant. The ambience transports you back to a bygone era. The soft Gazals in the background is brilliant. Oudh 1590 is a complete dining experience.

As soon as you will enter this place, its dreamy lights, seating arrangements, decorations and the background music, will take to the era of nawabs of Oudh ( Awadh). The variety of kebabs and biryani they serve are surely going to satisfy your taste buds. My personal favourites are Galauti kebab and rann biryani.
Service is also good. All in all this place is a must visit for all foodies.

Although Kolkatans have always been spoilt for choice when it comes to biriyani, there hasn't been a theme-based biriyani house to the best of my knowledge. Oudh 1590 tries to fill in this gap with its Awadhi style biriyani. The name has been going around for quite some time and we finally visited this place during last Durga Puja, a couple of days before Panchami. It was quite crowded, but the management had very thoughtfully constructed a make-shift waiting arrangement just outside the eatery. The half-an-hour wait to enter the restaurant didn't seem too tedious thanks to the readily available chairs.

Oudh tries to create an ambience that will transport one to the days of yore. The space inside wasn't much, but they managed to crowd in as many tables as possible. Chandeliers adorned the ceiling, and small curious reminiscent of olden time decorated the dining area. The lighting was exceedingly dim, and the soft melody playing in the background further helped in setting the desired mood. Even the artistically crafted wooden furniture and the heavy brass cutlery sets were tuned to the period that they tried to portray. 

Speaking about the food, we wanted to try out something in fish for starter, and picked the Awadhi Sugandhi Mahi. The fish pieces were very tender, and the preparation was decent, but not exceptional. I also had a glass of Aam Panna from the beverages on offer. Main course consisted of a full plate of Awadhi Handi Biriyani, which was sufficient for the two of us. It was served in an earthen pot sealed with aluminium foil. The biriyani rice was tasty and the mutton pieces were well cooked, but once again not extraordinary. We also ordered the Nehari Khaas (to go with the rice), which consisted of juicy pieces of meat immersed in a thick gravy. 
We rounded off the meal with a plate of Shahi Tukra. The bread had a thick layer of cream over it, imparting a delicious flavour to the dessert. In fact, this turned out to be the highlight of our dinner.
 

Oudh offers a fantastic dining ambience, and the staff members were thoroughly courteous. However, none of the items we had really stood out. It was a slightly disappointing experience actually, given the good things we had heard about this place. That said, this place provides a nice alternative to the existing choices when it comes to biriyani, and I would like to try out some of the other items on their menu.

Located at deshapriya park which is near to my home, i have been planning to visit this place for a long time. Finally on a sunday afternoon after a well worth wait of 1 hour we could get in. To start with, the ambience was authentic awadhi lucknow style. Would inatantly remind you of maganraj meghlal from  feluda movie. The slow background gazal matched with the decor, would set the mood perfectly. We had galawati kabab and zafrani chicken in starters. In maincourse, tried awadhi handi biriyani, a mutton biriyani enough for 2 people, and chikhen biriyani lucknow style. We wanted to try rann biriyani but it was not available. Both of them taste really different and really good.along with it we tried nehaari khaad and its a must try.
Service is good and promt as well.
But i am going to cut .5 from their overall rating as we found a small cockroach near our table,so there must be some maintenance issue below the impressive decor.
Recommedation: try galawati kabab with roomali roti. Its awesome.
Overall rating: 4/5
=================
Location: 4.5/5 just opposite carmel primary school at deshapriya park.
Cost to quality ratio: 4.5/5 each main course portion is enough for 2 people.
Service : 4.5/5

 Would definitely visit again.

Excellent decor is the first thing which strikes you as you enter the restraurant. Ornated table tops, wonderful carvings and beautiful paintings on the walls , strains of Begum Akhter ghazals in the background---- the mood is made even before you see the menu card (that, by the way is huge and heavy -almost a luggage). The lighting during the evenings seemed to be a little less I felt . Now for the food -- The Galawati kebabs were soft and melted in the mouth --- a must have with thin less oily Lucknowi parathas. The sugandhi mahi kebabs (bhetki) were good but not extra ordinary The Raan Biryani is the signature dish and one must have it --- lovely aroma and excellent taste with shredded pieces of well cooked mutton from the "raan". The highlight was the Nihari Khaas, mutton cooked in bone marrow. Overall, a satisfying experience.

I had heard a lot about the place and the food. However the experience was not upto the expected standards. For lunch we reached around 2.30pm which was late but the crowd waiting outside was huge. We were told we would be seated in 30 mins, but the waiting time reached to over an hour. This raised the expectation further high up considering so many people were waiting for so long to enter.  Now the orders...galawati kabab, mutton hand biriyani and chicken kasha.  The kabab was very soft and had a good taste but they had lost shape and it was served broken. Next came the biriyani. The mutton of the biriyani was cooked very well but rice quality was not so great. It was definitely not the long grained rice hence the look of the biriyani was missing. However the taste was good. Overall experience:
Food- taste is good but presentation is missing. 
Ambience- lights should be brighter. ( I spotted a little cockroach on the wall if it was in food I would not be able to see it)
Value for money- yes definitely value for money.

Decor and food was good. But they have to keep in mind the Saturday rush and move it to a bigger place. The standard waiting time of 45 minutes have to be reduced. Worst of all their card machines were not working and I had to get in my car drive to the ATM and get back to make the payment. Big disappointment. I was visiting this outlet after an amazing experience at their Salt Lake premises.

There are a number of reasons to avoid this place and not all of them are this place's fault. But the review should start where the experience started.

I came here with my family on a Sat. The restro gave us a waiting time of 1.5 hrs. I mean, you can't be serious! I know Kolkatans have got this creating a hoopla about eating places but creating a crowd in front of an eatery serving as everyday dishes as Mughlai dishes! Thats kind of strange. Anyway the wait got over after I wasted 90 mins of my life outside. 

the ambiance is great. Looks like some Oudh and all. With brass cutlery and all that. the food. We ordered a Galowti kabab. trust me, they don't know the recipe. I would recommend Khiva to try Galawti. Zafran chicken was a sweet cute chicken kebab. Very ordinary. Raan biriyani! My god. pathetic rice and chicken. Made me feel sheepish for taking people to this place. The prices were however pretty high. I mean, thats the worst combination.

Reasons to avoid:
1. Hype w/o base. People will queue up on a normal day like its the last show of Mr. PC Sorcar. Typical of Kolkata where people have enough time and more to wile away to eat at a place that doesnt give a differentiated dish. Eg: Peter Cat, Mocambo blah blah
2. Lack of culinary skills: No idea about dishes like Galaowti raan biriyani
3. prices are high for the product they serve.

All in all, I will go out of my way and be generous and give them a 1.5 considering the first point is not their fault and they are simply riding the wave not creating it.

The fact that this place has already achieved a cult status in Kolkata,is evident from the long queue me and my friends witnessed outside it,at 12:30 in the afternoon. After an hour long wait we were finally seated and we started with the legendary Galawati Kebabs. They were mouth watering and a perfect start to the meal. In the main course we ordered the Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Murgh Irani. I have had Biriyani in Kolkata, Kashmiri and Hyderabadi style, and this one wins hands down. Penning down its taste wouldn't do justice to its uniqueness. One must experience it to appreciate its fine nature. One handi is more than enough for two people. The Murgh Irani was also delicious. The spices are well balanced and compliments the biriyani well. In dessert we had firni and it was a perfect ending to the meal. The Nawabi decor, soulful thumri played in background takes you back in time. I thank the owner and the management of Oudh 1590 for giving Kolkata a slice of Nawabi cuisine, and wish them a wonderful journey ahead. However seeing the increasing craze for their food among all age groups, it would be appreciated if they provide some  seating arrangement for senior citizens outside the joint.

But again..nothing that I would remember for long...!

This was my first time at Oudh 1590 after hearing so many good things about it we finally came here for dinner. The décor is beautiful and dining there takes you back to the bygone era. The staff is polite and service is prompt. 

Now to the main part, we had ordered chicken Tangdi kabab, galawuti kabab and Amm panna shorbet for starters. In the main course we had Rann biryani and Nehari Khaas. I must say I loved the galawti kabab, it was yummy, melt in your mouth and one can just keep eating it. I loved the Nehari Khaas also- it had a flavour and taste that I have not had earlier. It had succulent pieces of meat in a delicious gravy that takes you to seventh heaven really! The chicken Tangdi kabab was okay so was the Rann biryani- it was decent.

I am looking forward to going back soon for galawti kabab n nehari khaas and will definitely try out the Awadh biryani next time. Overall it was a nice experience.

Located very near to deshpriya park, this little reminiscent of Awadhi cuisine. The fine dining experience presented by the restaurant is sumthing very new to Kolkata food culture. The interiors of the restaurant didn't give the feelings of Awadhi culture. So on the theme front much work is still desired.

Being a small restaurant there is a waitime associated to get inside the restaurant.

But food wise quality is good the flavours of this Awadhi briyani is totally different. U will hv to miss out on your favorite ALU. But who likes ALU anyhow. The gosht of the briyani was tender and tasted really good. The rezala was a bit disappointing. U can also take cool appetizers or drinks which was indeed very nice.

Visited the restaurant on 6th November. We reached the place around 7.30 pm. For a three member adult group table was readily available so we did not have to wait. The décor was very good and Indian classical music was being played matching the regal setup. We ordered Zafrani Kabab, Galawti Kabab, Ulte Tawa ka Parantha, Rann Biriyani, and Nahari Khas. I will go one by on commenting on each dish-Zafrani Kabab-There were 4 large pieces of boneless chicken in one dish. The kabab has subtle smell of zafran. But the pieces were not soft and succulent. Therefore only 3 stars to this dish. Galawti Kabab- 4 round pieces of kabab in one dish. Taste was very good, soft and spicy. It went well with crispy parantha. So 4.5 stars to Galawti Kabab and Parantha. Rann Biriyani- Excellent ! Very tasty with small succulent boneless pieces of mutton. One handi is enough for two adults. 5 stars to this. Nahari Khas- This was the devil of the treat. Meat was grossly undercooked. Tasted very ordinary. Not more than 1.5 stars. Better avoid the same. We told the person serving us about the meat being undercooked but it seems the restaurant people did not bother to even talk to us ! We felt bad about the same. Expected better hospitality going by the discussion on this platform. Given the mixed experience 3.5 stars to the restaurant.

The interiors and the decor was overwhelming; putting you into that jalshaghar era starting with the Lucknowi music in the background, the coloured glass-panelled windows, the paintings and even, the attire of the waiters.
However, the food failed to impress highly.
The Zafrani Kabab(4 pcs) were unlike something i ever tasted before with a generous dose of saffron n very moist n tender chicken.
The Galawti Kebab, though a very resonating dish, did not really delight me. And the Murgh Purdah Biriyani ordered for main course, was an utter disappoint for the price paid(350 INR); low in qty, also the flavours did not intrigue much. The bill came close to some 1100 INR for two people.
I might visit this place again, this time with a different biriyani choice for sure.

Every time I think of Biriyani,the only name that comes to my mind is Oudh 1590. I'v been there many a times and have also made it a point to drag my friends there. And my non-kolkatan friends liked the place so much that every time they are in Kolkata, an Awadhi lunch at Oudh is a must. Most importantly, the décor and the utensils and the ambience is simply awesome. The food is equally good and I loved the Afghani kabab and handi biriyani but the firni is very average. The last time I was there was during the Pujas and they had reduced the number of items and I was really disappointed to find Afghani kabab missing. Keeping everything in mind I would rate it with a 4.

My second visit to the place within one week - ordered Murgh Pardah Biriyani both times and I must say it's one of the best biriyanis in town. Must try for biriyani lovers!

The first thing I would like to mention that the food was bad and much below the standard we get in different mughlai restaurants.the rann biriyani was tasteless ,even roadside eateries make better biriyani.The kebabs were too spicy and the mutton nehari was more like mutton soup .Please do not go....even the other couple sitting opposite to us could not eat what was served to them...

The only reason I visited this place was the extraordinary review on zomato! Few of my friends also suggested me this restaurant for dinning out. But unfortunately it wasn't that appealing for me on the very day we visited. Though the Mughal-ish interior, Lucknowi songs in the background, the attire of the waiters, the utensils will make you feel in that era, but the food was pretty disappointing. Too much oil and zafraan smell spoiled the entire main course. Though kebabs were okay, but unfortunately I didn't like the biriyani or paranthas we ordered.
Most probably not going to visit again. I have had Mughalai cuisines before ofcourse, but too much oily and spicy smelled food are not what that mean!

I have heard about this place for a long time and so decided to try the food here on 24th Oct. Since it was Puja time, the doors opened a bit late(7:45 pm) but they were prompt in allotting seats to the diners. Coming to the food, we loved the Gosht Biryani(Rs 310)and Raan Biryani(Rs 395) but Awadhi Handi Biryani(Rs 370) was a major let down. It was full of ghee/animal fat and didn't taste good. Among the kebabs, Chicken Zafrani Kabab(Rs 280) and Chicken Qalmi Kabab(Rs 265) deserves special mention. I didn't like mutton Galawati Kabab(Rs 275) much. The portions were good and was sufficient for a family meal. The stewards were well dressed, looked good and was very well-mannered. I would love to come here again in future.

Location: Desapriya Park (West), Near Lake Market
Pros: An extended family of Chowman. Now what to say about this restaurant which has already got so much acclamation in a small time. Just visit n enjoy a regale! Everything is made perfect from interiors to lightings. The service is pretty good! Order Galawati Kabab (which is already quite famous), Raan Biriyani, Awadhi Handi Biriyani, Gosht Rogan Josh. The real nawabi khana. The Bengalis are very sensitive about their taste buds n to win their hearts in such a short span is never easy!
Cons: Seatin' area is clumsy, need a proper washroom so that we never have to cross the servicin' area again
Don't leave the place without: Havin' the Phirni n believe me it is the best I've tasted

A must visit for any Biriyani lover, as it provides huge variety of Biriyani. Can have any kabab, biriyani or chicken, everything tastes perfect and fine. but please dont miss Nehari khaas, and Shahi tukra. They taste divine. The décor, ambiance, costumes of waiters, everything will give you a feelling that u r indeed in Oudh. The only thing which seems problematic is the space crunch, resulting into long queues outside the restaurant.

This place was on my list since quite some time, so at last me and my equally foodie best friend paid a visit on the day of Nabami of durga puja. Due to the much hype about this place, we had to wait for half an hour for our turn to come, but that is the usual waiting time for any restaurant during the pujas. Firstly, the ambiance mesmerized us. Low lights, with brightly colored window panes, paintings on the wall and that oh so alluring thumri song playing in the background. Coming to the food, we had ordered Galowti Kebab and Lucknowi Paratha, Zafrani Fish Kebab, Raan Biryani and Mutton Roghan Josh. Each item was utterly delicious. The galowti kebab melts in your mouth, and we could actually taste the saffron in the zafrani fish kebab. Loved the rich taste of desi ghee in the biryani and the mutton fell off the bone in roghan josh, it was that succulent and tender. Totally worth the wait, waiting for my second visit. Staff is very attentive, courteous and service is prompt.

Finally this past week i got here. The ambience is wonderful and the decor is right outta 19th century.
The food is exotic. Galawati kabab for starter is just wow! I then ordered chicken pardah biryani, it just blew me.. it tasted so good.
We then finished it off with phirni and gajar halwa.. which were awesome..
All in all its a must go place.

The ambience is just so much nawabi with all the magnificent wood work around and thumris played softly in the background..... It is a place for biriyani lovers... They have a good variety of the same.... Biriyani served there tastes a bit different than the typical Kolkata style.... It's a good place for change of taste...... I just love the food they serve But when I take a home delivery from the very same restaurant I found that the food smelt stale ( only the biriyani), for the first time when food 
smelt stale I thought that it must have happened by mistake but recently when I again took a home delivery the same thing repeated..... I think they should check on this because this never happened when they had newly opened their restaurant..... Everything else than the home delivery is just perfect.

I was in Kolkata for the Puja holidays. I decided to pay a visit to this restaurant which was picking up a flurry of rave reviews among Calcuttans.

Once you step in , you cannot but be impressed by the superb ambience. The antique furniture and classic woodwork, the glass chandeliers, the Mughal paintings adorning the walls, the ghazals and thumris  playing softly in the background, the waiters dressed as courtiers in a Nawabi court, all seem to transport you to an era of the Nawabs and leave you in awe.

Once we let the ambience seep in, we proceeded to give the orders. For starters, we had Galawati Kebab with Lucknawi Ulta Tawa ke Paratha. The Galawati Kebab is amazing, with the melt-in-the-mouth minced meat busting with flavors and made to perfection. It goes perfectly with the crisp and flaky paratha. In the mains, we ordered Raan Biryani and Nalli Nihari, both of which were top notch. The Biryani was more of the classic awadhi biryani , without the potato of the Kolkata biryani. It is relatively light with a wonderful aroma, and the mutton pieces are tender and absolutely delicious. The Mutton Nihari has a rich gravy and is quite tasty. For dessert, we had Shahi Tukda, which was an apt ending to the delicious meal.

The service was polite, prompt and efficient. The prices are a bit steep, but seem to be justified given the quality of the meal and the ambience.

Here are my ratings for the restaurant :
Ambience : 5/5
Food : 4.5/5
Service : 5/5
VFM : 4/5
Overall : 4.5/5

This surely falls in the category of must-visit restaurants.

Highly disappointed. The food that they serve tasted stale. And the pungent smell made me feel pukish. We ordered Zafrani chicken kebab, chicken kassa and naan. Everything tasted stale and I actually puked after leaving the restaurant. They really need to check the quality of the food that they serve. The only saving grace was the staff. Because they were warm and attentive. But all in all, it was a horrible experience.

My second visit and OUDH 1590 impressed me yet again. According to me this place serves the best North Indian food in the city.
We ordered GALAWATI KABAB, MOTI BIRIYANI & NARGEESI KOFTA.
GALAWATI KABAB just melts inside your mouth as the name suggests. But I think I liked QUALMI KABAB better which I had the previous time.
When it comes to biriyani this place serves one the best biriyanis. MOTI BIRIYANI was just awesome and it contained 6 stuffed chicken balls. And the amount they serve is more than enough for 2 persons and even may serve upto 3 persons. But the best among biriyanis is surely RANN BIRIYANI which I had the previous time.
NARGISI KOFTA - Oh!!! Its just too much delicious. It contains eggs coated with lamb in a gravy containing minced mutton. My mouth is still watering as I am writing about it.
Not only the food on the menu even a mango chutney they serve as extra was so delicious that we ordered a refill.
And now to talk about ambience- Its just awesome. You'll really have the ancient AWADHI feel. The interior looks like an Awadhi palace with soft gazals playing all the time. The staffs are dressed to suit the ambience and they are very well behaved and always happy to help.
So in short OUDH 1590 has always been a great experience- an experience which I've loved every bit from very first to last. Maybe the price is a bit on the higher side but the food is so tasty that you'll not think about it after you've finished eating. And also the amount is more than adequate and if you go in a group of 4 or 5 the price will be cut down as you can share and still that'll be adequate.
My suggestion- Just save some cash and even if you are not an Indian cuisine lover you must pay this place a little visit maybe you'll change your mind after that. And if you love Indian spicy food thrn you're surely going to have a "Foodgasm".
Happy eating....

One of the best Mughlai Cuisine joints with magnificent ambience, Oudh 1590 is a sure target for all the Biryani lovers! They specialise in Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines, so naturally you get a wide variety in their menu and the taste is absolutely mouth watering. We ordered their Awadhi Handi Biryani and Gosht Bhuna as side dish and the food was totally mind blowing. Even their staff and service is very pleasing. Though a bit costly a place but the food, the ambience and decor makes it worth the visit! :)

Good Ambience Coupled with nice notes of classical music makes up a great atmosphere to satiate your gastronomical desires.
Though the serving staff at salt lake joint do need a lil tuning with respect to service. Found them lil less prompt and professional.
However the KARIGARS (chefs) as they are better known in Awadh (U.P.) know their job pretty well. Subtle notes of saffron on awadhi dishes makes having food an experience.
Go for Biryanis, Nehari and Raan & for Veggies choices of Awadhi Dal & Paneer Qoorma or Koftas can make the day.

But dessert was out-of-stock, so ... But food was too yummy !! I am really delighted to rate it 4.5. And highly recommend friends to be there. This place will make your special-day very special.

I came across this place recently and decided to give it a visit.. Boy was i pleasantly surprised. As soon as u enter.. U feel like u have travelled back to the 1600s.the decor is so fantastic and detailed. Even the plates look rustc and i must say that the management have given a lot of thought to the decor. Kudos for that... Now coming to the food.... It is heavenly... I ordered for starters kakori kebab and for the main course their rann biriyani and murgh ki rani.... The kebab was flavourful, soft and tender..... The biriyani was amazing and the mutton in it melted in my mouth... And the chicken sidedish was also very good..... This place is pretty amazing if u want some good biriyani.... I admit the prices are a little on the steep side but i guarantee u 
..it is absolutely worth it..... You wont reget if u try this place... And i would love to visit this place again.... In my book this establishment is aces.....

This place serves the best biriyani I have ever tasted in Kolkata. The price is bit high but it's worth it. The galwati kabab was the best. The minced meat was so tender and in mouth it felt creamy. I would just recommend any biriyani lover or mughlai cuisine enthusiast to visit this place. :)

We ordered Raan Biriyani and Oudh Biriyani. Both tasted flawless and exotic to my bengalee tongue. Sadly zero out of four desserts were available at that time. Would recommend.

Interior decor is sooo soo good..
We ordered a sheek kebab..though galwati kebab is famous here..that was so so type..
Then We ordered one murgh biryani as I heard the quantity of biryani is huge..but found it average and had to order another one..but biryani was really good..
And we had murgh irani..that was really amaaaaazing..superb..guys give it try..
And last but not the least firni was way too good..one of the best in kolkata I can bet..

Heard a lot of good reviews about this place so I wanted to try it eagerly. So finally on astami’s night I visited this place with my friends, and yes there is no doubt that it lives up to its reputation.

Location:

The location of this place is a bit odd. 

If you are coming via Sarat Bose Road (going towards Monohar Pukur) then cross the Desopriya Park signal take the second left turn after the signal. You will find it on your left hand side at the end of the ally.

If are coming via Rashbihari Avenue from Kalighat direction then you have to take the left turn before the Desopriya signal. You will find it at the corner of the third right turn junction.

Ambiance:

When we were there, it was quite late though the place was full of crowd. The light was too dimmed. It would have been better to put more light.

The plate, wall, chairs, tables and lights will definitely give you the feel of dining at an old fashioned royal mansion. The overall ambiance was great.

Rating: 4.5/5

Service:

It was puja time. The crowd was buzzing around. It took almost one hour to get a table, but yes the waiting was worth the followed by experience.

Another thing needs to be mentioned that they specially arranged extra chairs, fans for the waiting people outside their restaurant. Also they did not delay a moment to reduce the waiting time for the next group of people. They maintained the waiting list properly such that there would not be any discrepancy.

Everyone was dressed in black kurta. The server was courteous and had the curtsey to serve on our plate.

Rating: 4.5/5

Cost:

They accept both cards and cash. Cost for two approx. 1200 rupees. Even though the cost is on the higher side, but the food they serve that deserves it.

Rating: 3.5/5

Food:

We ordered Mutton Galawati Kabab, Nehari Khaas and Raan Biryani. They provided Pickle, Pudina Raita and Plain Raita to accompany the food. We were quite hungry at that time and these items were too good to resist ourselves from eating those without any food.

Mutton Galawati Kabab was great, but the size of the pieces were small and they served only four in a plate which was the major drawback of this dish. Another drawback was that it was broken when it was served to us. But taste-wise, it beats all the criticisms against it. It made from mutton keema and poppy seed. Strongly recommended item. Rating: 4/5

Raan Biryani: One plate of it can serve two people. Undoubtedly it was one of the best biryani that I ever had. The mutton pieces were succulent. It melted down as soon as we had it into our mouth. Another strongly recommended dish. Rating: 5/5

Nehari Khas was a mutton based dish. Taste was good. The pieces were not good. Rating: 4/5

Rating: 4.5/5

Overall rating: 4.25/5 ---> 4.5/5

Situated in the vicinity of deshpriya park/lake market, this place is a definite favorite when I crave for larger than life experience. Although, the dimensions of the establishment are somewhat confined, their culinary skills surely makes up for that. Specializing in Awadhi cuisine, this place is for those who look for authenticity and are not ready to settle for anything less. Galoti Kebab, Lucknowi Parantha, Murgh Mussallam, Irani Kebab, Murgh Purdah Biryani, Shahi Firni are some of the dishes worth mentioning among the long list of popular items. Pocket will pinch a bit, but then again, quality comes at a price !! Happy Eating to all who plan to visit in future.

To be honest, i love biriyani. So when a friend of mine told about this place and it's magnificence, I couldn't help but go there on a very short notice. 
The famous Mughal dynasty ruled most of northern India from the early 16th to the mid-18th century. So the year 1590 has some connection with the mughal era and its quite evident from the décor & the theme of the place. The gatekeeper with a grand moustache is bound to make you feel different. We ordered raan biriyani and murgh parda biriyani. We also took gosht chaap as a side dish. We were 3, so these were enough for us. The smell of both the biriyanis took me to another world and I finished them off within a jiffy. Those were the best biriyanis I ever had in my life. I took a badam lassi in the end and it was awesome too. The prices were a bit high but the foods were worth the price. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. If you love biriyani then please goooo and please have. Also don't forget to give a review. ;)

This restaurant is situated in Deshapriya Park near Lake Mall.. This is mainly a themed mughlai restaurant .. As soon as you entered in this restaurant you feel that you have entered in 16th Century 

The interiors gives u the feeling of mughlai and the plates,glass all the utensils are periodic...

Now come to the food,we ordered Awadhi Handi Biryani which was just ok,you can have much better in different parts of Kolkata.. May be u can try Raan Biryani or Murgh Biryani or you can also try Lucknowi Paratha and Gulawti Kebab.

We have to wait around 40 mins as there was full pack inside the restaurant.. The staff service is good and co-operative..

Yes ,this is the most favourite place for friends,family and loved ones hangout.
Go and experience the real 16th century Mughlai Period and mughlai food.

Oudh,the name suggests its Lucknow roots n it doesn't lets it down. I visited the place before but recently I went to the rashbehari outlet during pujas. There were some changes the price was reduced but subsequently the quantity was also dramatically reduced n taste was also not quite Lk before but it maybe puja madness which I hope will end by now.
Ambience: Amazing to say the least. Very authentic Lucknowe nawabi feel n music is spot on with the era.
Food: As I mentioned before the quantity has reduced which was not good. The taste is good specially rann biryani n rogan josh n bhuna ghosth.
Service: Satisfactory
Price: The price has been reduced from before but still on the higher side. If they want to reduce then reduce some more or else increase quantity.
Overall special place which can grow with strength. I will b looking forward to dining here soon.
P.s: I loved the way they gv mouth fresheners in that old box thing.

Went there to hunt for Awadhi biryani, which turned out to be average on taste, not as delicious as its counterpart from Kolkata. It contained commendable amount of shredded mutton which is a pro, but did not have the potato hidden within layers of rice, contrary to how we are used to having biryani in Kolkata. The galawati kebab were supposed to be special at Oudh, but they were overrated, spicy, and quite ordinary, except that they were soft to the tongue.
Overall ambience was that of the Mughal gharana during the era of Nawabs, from the dim lit lanterns to the fancifully colored glasses, the wooden furniture and the ghazals playing in the background. Hope to visit again to try something else perhaps..

Food: 4-out of-5. Great afghan/mughlai-style food. In starters, we tried out the trademark Galawti Kebab with thin paratha, which was outstanding. It's a must-try in here. Afghani Kebab also was mouth-watering. Awadhi handi biryani in main course was kinda okayish,  as you can find much better quality biryani at lots of places all over Kolkata. I'll recommend runn biryani over the awadhi one. Murgh Irani in side dish was also delicious. Overall a nice foodly experience.                                 Ambience: Just one word, superb! The 16th century came out so lovely and lively!                    Service: Not satisfactory. Can be much better. In fact, we had to wait for atleast half-an hour, before we could enter, only because the restaurant was not ready. Huh!

first time visit there it was and the experience was awesome. the nawab style ambience was supra-awesome :D . we (6) ordered zafrani kabab, qalmi kabab, and the famous galawati kabab for starters. then ordered the famous AWADHI biryani, rann biriyani and one chicken biryani.  all kebabs were superb in taste especially galawati kabab.. very soft and spicy too. and awadhi biriyani was excellent.   the mutton submerged in the biryani was very soft . last we ordered firni as dessert.   everyone should go and ordered galawati kebab and awadhi biriyani must :)

Even though the puja's are partly over the que was long enough to make us wait for an hour. Was a bit curious about the Lucknawi Paratha as have heard a bit about its finesse , slim & being oil free nature though it didn't disappointed with its taste . The second item on our list was Galawati Kabab awesome in taste with a soft texture contained a bit of black pepper & herbs with minced mutton  that made it sour but spicy in taste with onion covered with red chilli powder . The last but not the least came Awadhi Handi Biriyani  ( 2 eggs , 2pcs mutton ) enough for two as it was for us , made in desi ghee & the thumri being played with great decoration summed up a total Nawabi Lunch experience .....................

Went there for the first time on the occasion of a family lunch. They did not take pre-booking so we had to wait for nearly an hour before we could get in. But rest of the experience was simply superb. The staffs I must say are excellent and very courteous. They provide good suggestions based on individual tastes and were very helpful with our large group of 15 members. Now coming to the food part the quality is superb. It is the only awadhi restaurant in Kolkata so I cant benchmark but alsmot everything tasted perfect. There was Zomato recommendation for Galawati Kabab but I personally didn't like it much. Everything else was awesome. Their biriyanis wont have "Alu" (potato)  so it might be a big blow to some but the taste was lip-smacking. The quantity is sufficient for 2. The Chicken and Fish starters were also good. Do try the "Keema Kaleji" preparation if you are fond of mutton. The ambiance is also superb and they play nice ghazals to give you the Lucknow feel which I liked. So overall a big thumbs up and a must visit for biriyani lovers.

Recently visited this restaurant for lunch to taste Awadhi cuisine.
The ambiance is good, portraying the great Nawabi style. 
We ordered Zafrani Kebab - Murg Biryani - Murg Irani and Firni. 
The food came in a reasonable time and the taste is great. 
Ratings :
Kebab - 5/5 ; Biriyani - 3/5 ; Irani - 4/5 and Firni - 4/5 
Service - 3/5 ( staffs seems to have a laid-back attitude)

One thing i would like to point out that this place is having insufficient ambient light. 
Requests management to make this place a little more illuminated, if there is a scope to do so.

Had lunch on 19/10 but very much disappointed. Reached around 1.30 PM, as there was big crowd waiting for their turn, manager suggested us to give parcel order.
I was originally interested in Galgoti Kebab, Nehari khas, Run Biriyani but to my surprise manager told us to take kalmi kebab instead of Galgoti kebab. When we started eating with lot of enthusiasm we discovered that Kalmi Kebab which was suggested by the manager was completely rotten, awful smelly. My total lunch was spoiled and huge embarrassment in front of the guest. I spent almost 2 hr to reach to the restaurant convinced everyone to have lunch there but totally disappointed. Not to mention the Run Biriyani, Nihari Khas also not very good in taste. So overall I would say this place is over hyped and over rated, if you are nearby Deshopriya park its kind of visit but not for the people like me to travel long distance and have food there. I found a very good North Indian food restaurant near my house Panjabi Rasoi (opposite acropolis mall), not much advertised but food was awesome.

Let me get this straight: I visited on nabami afternoon. I was absolutely ready to wait in the queue as this has traditionally been the norm across every known restaurant in the city.  I am also fully aware that they rush through the orders with minimum focus on quality of service. I still visit just for enjoying this chaos while having lunch. But what was absolutely disgusting is how they managed the crowd. They gave us a waiting number. After almost two hours suddenly they call up my name and i was relieved as hunger was reaching an unprecedented levels.But suddenly while entering they said you have to share a table of 4. Now this is something which I expected when u visit aminia or zeeshan or restaurants of those sort. When you claim to be a luxury dining with double the price of a biriyani how could you even think of telling such things? Me and my partner are not someone who eats out only during pujas. We traditionally visit only proper restaurants and have never been mentioned things like sharing a table. Not during Christmas at Mocambo nor in Pujas at other restaurants like Sigree, Marco Polo. So on what logic was I asked to share I fail to understand.Would the service tax, service charge, vat everything be halved? Would it be fine if the tip is shared? If those things I have to pay individually why do I share the table? And how come a restaurant which charges in excess of 400 for  a plate of biriyani even treat its customers like this? Disgusted!!!Absolutely !!!

An awesome experience with an extraordinary ambience. This place has a very unique take on the original biriyani concept. The service is excellent and the food is definitely brilliant. The biriyani is served in earthen clay plots which provide  definite experience and nostalgia. The raita is definitely recommended here as well as well as the firni. The mutton dishes and kebabs are recommended for people visiting this restaurant. Come to this restaurant for an overall pleasant experience.

The only deduction in rating is due to the fact that we had to share the table with another couple on Astami evening. However once the Mutton Giwlati Kebab was served, all the uneasiness whisked away. It was followed up with Mutton Raan Biryani and Murgh Irani which was cooked to perfection, enough to make us travel to the 1590s with the beautiful Awadhi ambience created through the wooden antique interiors and matched with a Begum Akhtar Thumri which indeed completes the period dining experience.

We went there with a lot of expectations having heard a lot about Oudh . After waiting for two and a half hours(considering Pujas it was ok) , we got our tables. We tried the Zafrani and Galawati kebabs which were neither original recipes nor mouth watering . The Raan biryani was okayish , so was the Irani Murgh . On top of that the quantity was less considering the cost. Extremely over rated restaurant. This comes from a foodie who's tasted a lot of biryanis and kebabs. 
The only plus point was the ambience and the service was top notch.

Its one of the very few restaurants in Kolkata which serves Awadhi cuisine. The food was simply "delicious". It's one of the very few restaurants which serves awesome Awadhi and Mughlai food. The Zafrani Kebab and Galawati Kebab is a must try. The biriyani were mouth-watering. The side-dishes were equally tasty and rich in taste. Overall, I don't think you should have any complaint about the quality of food if you are a fan of Mughlai food and don't have any budget restrictions as the restaurant is a bit pocket-pinching.

Ordered galawati,kakori kababs in starter & rann biriyani & oudh handi biriyani in main course. I found the galawati kabab n rann biriyani awesome. The ambience & service were also too good. Will certainly visit the place once again to have some more expeditions on kababs.

Me and my friend went to Oudh on Saturday 30th September ie on Doshomi Night. We didn't had to wait long because we had to share table with two other groups which was ok with us. So coming on to the food, we ordered 

Galauti Kababs
Lucknowi Paratha
Awadhi Handi Biryani
Nehari
Firni

The Kababs were really good... Very soft and nicely spiced . And so were the parathas. Very tender and not oily. Over all the starters were a very good one. Now came the turn for the main course. The Biryani was plain and simple "BLAND". It was dry. Seriously dry. No flavours or spices as such. The mutton in the Biryani was good, soft and juicy but the rice was just not anywhere to satisfaction. Then came the Nehari..I really don't know but is it supposed to be so watery? Again not much in taste. Moreover it had a slight bitterness due to over fried onion fries on the top. The Firni was good but was of almost freezing temperature. 

During puja many restaurants serve not so great food because of rush but that's not expected when the restaurants is charging a premium price for its food.

And why is plain water not available as informed by the waiters. Only
packaged bottled water and that too @40-45INR/litre. 
Over-all pretty much unhappy with my this visit.

Went there for lunch on panchami. The ambience is just great. Your eyes will get glued to the interior art. It feels like being in a lucknowi palace. We had galawti kabab,qalmi kabab,rann biryani,awadhi murgh biryani,murgh irani,murgh rezala,paneer qorma. The kababs will just melt in your mouth. The qalmi kabab was so succulent. Paneer qorma and murgh irani tasted delicious. Murgh rezala was a bit tasteless. Their biryanis does not deserve a special mention. They are just ok. The main usp of thus place is their ambience and kababs. One must visit this place and have all their kababs. They are the best in this city.

I went on the occasion of "MahaSashthi" fortunate enough to get seated. The ambience was tantalizing, with my friend and sister we sat comfortably. The dim light, background music all added to its regal appeal. The glasses and plate reminds clearly of the royal state one now is. The service was excellent. We ordered Galawati Kabab as starter, the kabab just melted in mouth. Next as main course we ordered Raan Biryani, Awadi handi Biryani and Nehari Khaas. The biryani can set any one to lick his finger clean. Nehari Khaas was excellent too, mouth watering and we ensured the gravy was absorbed and none left. Now coming to the dessert the widely recommended Shahi Tukra was available and we loved it, mesmerized my friends very much. To my dismay the washroom was a common one so I decided not a full five but still a visit worth to cherish for times till the next visit.

I've been dying to get here, for long now and finally went there yesterday. The first thing I noticed was, it's too dark inside! Gone are the days when restaurants used to harbour darkness within. Everybody's trying to soak up all the light they can, but no one told these guys about the 'light revolution', I guess!
Now, the food. We had galauti kebabs with paranthas and kakori kebab with rumali roti.. Both the kebabs were 'melt-in-your' soft. It's a shame, that they don't serve beef galauti. The kebabs were well done and succulent.
Then we ordered mutton raan biryani and nehari. The biryani was true to it's awadhi form. Much more 'chiknai' than its Kolkata cousin! It was fragrant and fluffy. My only complaint would be, the rice grains were not long enough for biryani, I felt. Over all, it had great taste. The meat was falling off the bone. The nehari was a little sweet-n-sour in taste. Goes really well with biryani, as salan. It'd go really with sheermaal, but unfortunately they dont serve sheermal.
Then we went for shahi tukda, but were told that they can only serve firni, as they didn't have shahi tukda. That was a let down though.
Over all report card:
Ambience: 3.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5

Its situated just beside the Carmel primary school.When we entered the restaurant we were astonished by its thematic ambience.It will appear like u have come to a Mughal house in 1590 era. We ordered Raan Biriyani with Nehari Khas  their two signature dishes. Raan Biriyani tasted just awesome..there will be no comparison to that biriyani..just class apart.Nehari Khaas also tasted delicious a bit spicy but good.

To end your grand feast one can have firni or shahi tukra !!!

So it was our team lunch, and we decided to try out the new flavor in town, Oudh 1590. The place enamoured us from the word go, with exquisitely carved wooden interiors, wall paintings, dim lighted chandeliers with soothing Begum Akhter gazals at the background, that take you back to the bygone era. The lightings were dim but never posed a problem, rather soothed ous from the broad daylight and provided the subtle ambience. We tried the famous and must-haves of Awadhi cuisine~ Galouti Kebabs, that melted in our mouths. The Rann Biriyani was another favorite and well recommended. Murgh Irani and Keema Kaleji followed suit and we preferred the latter, which was aromatic and tasty. To add to this, we loved the traditional way of serving in brass plates and glasses, which added to much loved ambience. Surprisingly enough, the bill was affordable enough around 500 pax. The desserts of aam khas and phirni were deleicious and provided a sweet ending. 

P.S. Do try out the chutney they serve with the opening pickles. It’s yummy!

Downside: They do take a long time to serve. So its better if you place the order of the main course too along with your starters! It’s a tip I tried out myself on the second visit.

For the best mughlai in town please do visit Oudh! Be it the biryanis, the kababs or the salaans..every item on the menu is lipsmacking. Service tends to be a little slow and the place is absolutely packed during weekends..but overall a great little place that doesn't burn a hole in your pockets. Highly recommend.

Ambience: Absolutely brilliant. The lighting and the music is refreshing.
Service: Extremely prompt and they help you choose, incase you are in two minds!
Food: On my first visit, we had Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Kababs. The mutton pieces are juicy and the kababs were perfect. Second time, we ordered Butter Naan and Irani Chicken. It tasted heavenly!

Oudh 1590 is a place you will wanna go back to, especially for their kababs!

Had Galawati Kabab with Lukhnowi Paratha.
And finally the long awaited Ran Biryani...Awesome food.
The dining tables could have been a bit more lighted as it was a bit dark.

Empty vessels sound much. ....This is just the right sentence about  Oudh 1590. I heard so much about this place so I go there with my family for a birthday lunch. I ordered there 1 murgh biriyani & 1 awadhi handi biriyani. The mutton pieces  ( 2 )  total weight is about 20 grams & also the taste of biriyani is just like street biriyani. Staff behaviour is very good. It is just a waste of money to go there. For Rs 650 bill amount the cheaters take service charge  of Rs 185.

This is my 5th visit here on 11th oct, Sunday around 1 pm, I invited some guest from North Kolkata and explained my previous experience and they came with high expectations. The starters were good with paratha, fish kabab and Gulati kabab then real disappointment started. Ordered drinks, they served four of us and then fifth person got it after 30 mins and several follow ups. Then we moved to main course with three types of biriyani as recommended by the waiter. The mutton run biriyani was good, the Murgh Pardah Biriyani was served cold, rice not cooked properly and the pieces of chicken were cold like just taken out of deep fridge. A serious decline in quality than what we experienced during last visit 5 months ago. They realized the problem and decided to change it with Awadhi Mutton Biriyani which never came while we eating so we decided to pack. The 3rd Biriyani also came with rice not cooked properly only served hot to save my prestige as the host. Lastly none of the biriyani came with the complimentary raita, only the packed one got it when we started asking, the waiter mentioned that since its not ready hence we could not serve it. The water bowl came with cold water, everytime we have to ask for water and then waited several minutes to get it. No desserts available by 2 pm, then why keeping in the menu. When complained the manager said sorry, we will do better job next time. There is no sorry reflected on the bill, I refused to pay the tips which the waiter waited eagerly for. I will not take my guests here anymore, its such a shame a restaurant of this standard and reputation has started taking customers taken for granted. No doubt decline is in near horizon.

We went there this afternoon and the food was great. We had galauti kabab & lucknowi paratha for starters. The kebabs were delicious and had that 'melt in the mouth' thing. The lucknowi paratha was nice. #musttryit.

For main course we had rann biryani , nihari khaas & butter naan. They were awesome.

The service was slow and the place is but tightly packed. Overall it was a great experience.

However wish to try some other options on the menu the next time.

I agree its fantastic food. But sometimes when a customer comes in 10:50 ( last order is at 10:30). And has relatives along with him and is a regular patron. I believe that the manager should not allow the patron to actually beg for a table and then refuse him and once he feels that he is disrespected he should not be allowed to create a scene and the manager should not really act so smart that he loses his job. The least the manager could do was tell him that," Sir, cant give u a table, but pack some food for you."
But no he had to give attitude. My dear friend, that's not how you operate in the service industry. Thank you.

The place is nawabi in its true essence. The music enhances the ambience as well as the food. The taste of ran biriyani was truly exotic along with the other dishes.. Lastly when the dessert part came I was at first disheartened as kulfi faluda was not being served but the firni made me happy with its taste and texture..

Frankly speaking, on my first visit( and hopefully not the last one) to this place i found it to be over-hyped.
Ambience is good, service is slow.

It was my birthday treat and my friends wanted to try out the pudina sherbat but sadly, it wasn't available.
We ordered almost all the famous dishes including the Galawati Kebab, Raan biryani, Lucknowi paratha and  Murgh irani. The galawati kebab tasted out of the world. The raan biryani was also good, the mutton pieces were oh-so-soft. But i would prefer arsalan biryani anyday! The murgh irani was okayish. 



Overall a satisfying but not extraordinary experience.

One of the best Awadhi Cuisines I have ever tasted here. Galauti Kabab, Kakori kabab were simply awesome. The Biriyani was separately cooked in a small earthen pot and was served removing the Atta seal. The lighting inside is not very bright. The doorman who welcomes you while you enter has a very long moustache. It is a bit costly but the food is really awesome

legend says nawab of lucknow was too old to eat meat.. so he ordered his royal chef to cook some meat dish which will melt in the mouth.. thus was born our very own galawati kabab ...

this is the best item of this restaurant..

ran biriyani was awesome and massive in amount... badam sherbet was too good... and lastly on dessert shahi tukra just to make it a happy ending..... 
we also ordered murgh biriyani and oudh handi biriyani which were not upto my expectations..... mutton nihar and ghost bhurna were good...

cons are:
very expensive ..
we waited for more than 2 hours to get a 6 sitting table.... slow service....

enjoy :)

Heard a lot about Oudh and its biriyani...so finally made my way to Oudh with my family...
The ambience is good and the food quality is good but i didn't find any extra twist in their Biriyani. We order for Galaoti Kebab and Oudh Biriyani...actually we had planned to have Rann Biriyani but they ran out of Biriyani...felt a bit disappointed...but their service is really good and they show the extra care for their customer. 
An extra advice if you plan for an Weekend visit i would ask u to visit the place 1 hr to 2 hr prior your dinner time...cause the rush is too much and we had to wait for almost 1 and Half Hour!!!

For a really very long time i was having a biriyani craving and thus from my sister's recommendation and also through zomato's listing of this restaurant in their `brilliant biriyanis' collection,i decided to give this place a shot today. In 1 word my experience there was "fantabulous". We had to wait in the queue for 30mins or so since today was a sunday,but that was the only difficulty we faced here today. Apart from this,nothing here disappointed me.
My experience here from the moment i entered this place was `awadhi'. The place from outside only looks like an old rajasthani bunglow. We entered and people with long moustaches greeted us. We were seated on our table...i loved every nook and corner of this place. The ambience and the lovely decoration of the restaurant was really soothing and catchy to the eyes. The place was decorated with mirrors in every possible corner..the whole place had a touch of brown..even the ac was coloured brown to match the texture of the rest of the place. There were 3 chambers where people were seated. We were given a table in the middle chamber and frankly there was a little space crunch in that particular area which made it difficult for people to walk through..which is the only reason i deducted 0.5 from here. We were served in bronze plates and glasses which pulled us deeper into the awadh style. 

We ordered mutton galawti kebab and nun for starters. I was really blown off by the starter preparation! The mutton was made into keema and given round shapes which had the perfect combination of spices amd flavours. The kebab just melted in the mouth and from the waiter's recommendation,the nun increased the taste even more and so did the achaars. 
For main course we ordered mutton awadhi biriyani,chicken awadhi biriyani,murgh irani and mutton rezala. The biriyani was what i had been waiting for since i entered this place. When the biriyani arrived i just dived into it.:-P
The biriyani was truly out of the world and the place had really lived upto my expectation. And what more...the mutton biriyani had 4 pcs of tasty soft and irresistible mutton pieces along with 2 eggs! This is the 1st place which i had seen providing so much in 1 plate of biriyani...really it was worth every penny. The chicken biriyani had 2 large chicken pieces along with 2 eggs. The taste of the biriyani was totally different from the usual biriyanis...its what they call the awadhi style! The smell,the taste everything was different and believe me it will give u 1 awesome impression. 1 plate is more than enough for 2 people...they did not compromise with either the quality or the quantity. The mutton as usual had a lot of soft meat and came out on the touch of a fork. The chicken irani was also an excellent preparation...flawless. The buttery smell in mutton rezala attracted me a lot. The raita provided along with the dishes was the perfect accompaniment.
In all,the place left a lasting impression on me. I would love to come back to this place and its new outlet in salt lake a couple or more times. Other than the space crunch,i felt this is the perfect place for any romantic date,family gatherings etc. Keep up the good work!:-D

I have been here twice and the Lucknow-y theme totally soothes you. Fell in love with the Rann biriyani and maahi chap combination during my first visit. Mainly the success of the first time made me Oudh-bound for the second time. Tried the Galawati kebab according to popular suggestions, but I must say, it was extremely over-hyped. None of us found it as tasty as expected.

As a food buff, there is nothing quite as satisfying as a full stomach and the lingering taste of the mouth watering food playing Beethoven's 9th symphony on your taste buds! Oudh 1590 delivers on that and HOW!!!! We had ordered the Galawati kebab (duh!), the Rann Biriyani (duh!), Nargisi Kofta, Gosht Rogan Josh and the Gosht Shahi Korma. The Galawati kebabs melt and fall apart in your mouth! The Rann biriyani is highly impressive... shredded mutton with fluffy rice, its one of the best biriyanis in the city. The quantity of the Rann Biriyani is something to be marveled at as well!!  The extremely rich nargisi kofta was awesome as well.... it went really well with the biriyani. The rogan josh and the korma were good too but for me they were kind of like Abhishek Bachchan of the Dhoom series. They were there but no one thought of them as the main attraction.  The decor was fantastic as well and added to the royal ambiance the place tried desperately to exude with its soft background music and  bronze plated cutlery. The waiters are courteous and accommodating as well, providing us with prompt suggestions whenever we needed it. A few things can be improved upon. The mutton pieces in the shahi korma were just plain bones.... little meat was on them.... but I have decided to give it a pass as it may well have been an anomaly! On the whole- Really Impressive!!! Highly recommended and I wont be thinking twice before going there again!

I am a North Indian food buff. I love the cuisine so much that I never fail to hit any new North Indian joint that comes up in the city. Oudh 1590 was in my bucketlist for quite a long time. So, I finally decided to visit the eatery for lunch with a friend. A man with a big moustache opened the door for us. We were greeted warmly inside. I loved the hanging lanterns, the Mughal wall art and lamps inside. It will instantly give you a mughal feel. But I would appreciate if they can enhance the lighting inside. Its unnecessarily a bit more darker than required. So for the food part, we ordered Rann biriyani which was teeming with tender pieces of shredded mutton. We ordered some tandoori and zafrani kebab and murgh irani and ended up with shahi tukra. Rann biriyani blew me away. Highly recommended if you hit this place. Murgh irani was beautiful as were the kebabs. Shahi tukra was a win-win. My friend ended up ordering another. Since then I keep hitting this place to try more of the awadhi delicacies. The Nargisi kofta, seekh kebab and shammi kebab are beautiful too. This restaurant is on ths expensive side and for good reasons. If you swear by biriyani you will love this place. Can't wait to hit again. :)

Went in there when I was having a big craving for Kolkata's biriyani. Honestly disappointed, it's very Lucknow style stuff. Nevertheless galuti kabab was fantastic. Service is average not of the standards expected from such a place. Must be a local favorite, as I saw quite a few who's who of Bengal there.

If you are craving for Mughlai cuisine in and around Gariahat, then you should definitely visit Oudh. Table reservation is recommended as it attracts a lot of crowd at any point of the day. First, I would like to talk about the ambiance. In one word, it is very royal and goes perfectly with the cuisine. The lights could be a bit brighter though. Now coming to food, I had the Qalmi kebabs which were not bad but the Awadhi Handi Biriyani was superb. As I am a biriyani lover, I completely fell for it. Perfect flavour. The meat was soft and tender. I am planning to visit the new outlet in Salt Lake as it is near my place. Coming back soon. Keep up the work.

My daughter and I were celebrating her end of exams last week and we visited this place which is en route. We ordered aam khaas sharbat, gulawati kebab, raan biriyani, awadh handi biriyani and murgh irani and ended with firni of course. First off the ambiance tries too hard. it is dark, dark, so dark that I needed to read the menu with my mobile phone torchlight :) The waiters are none too polite and rather familiar. The music gets annoying after a while. The tables are too close for comfort. The decor is good but the darkness is stifling. SO unless one is comfortable, can one really enjoy one's food? I always believe that Indians eat the most evolved way, savouring the food with the five senses- see, smell, taste, touch and hear. Of these, the darkness prevents you from seeing the mass on your plate; the smell of your spread is disturbed by the smell from other tables therefore you end up smelling what you may not be eating; you cannot hear the food (crunchy, squishy, crisp, soft, fibrous etc. etc. ). So you end up feeling (provided you eat with your hands (I don't know why people prefer to eat Indian food with cutlery) your food and of course taste it. Now, that is where Oudh wins big time. The kabas are soft and the taste,explodes in your mouth. The sharbat was strong but aromatic. The biriyanis were generous and came in nice handis (in fact we parcelled one and could bring home a handi in which it is probably cooked and served (?). The murgh irani was also yumm. The firni was shahi, with dry fruits, not your run-of-the-mill kind and really soft and fragrant. Overall it was a good experience but for the waiters who are truly irritating.

Being always a food junkie, I keep searching for restaurants that can offer good tandoori food, kebabs, biriyani etc. From those preference perspective, Oudh is a great place to try. I visited Oudh in September 2015 and here is what I feel :

Ambience : 5/5. Interior is very well decorated and themed to give you a feel of authentic traditional Lucknow restaurant. Wooden (or at least it looks like) carvings on the wall and ceiling, staff dressed in Lucknowi Kurta  and dim lit chandeliers take you back to Nawab era. This is topped by careful selection of classy Thumri at the background. Mindblowing !!!

Food : 4.2/5. There is a reason I am rating it 4 and not 5. Not all preparations are equally good. I tried Mutton Biriyani and Nihaar e khaas. Both were outstanding. Awadhi Dum aloo was good too. Lucknowi paratha was ok. Veg Gatawali kebab was below average. Chicken tandoori is like any other restaurant. 

Service : 3/5. Sorry, but I cant agree on the great service thing. Staff are very courteous indeed, however, I found them often not paying attention. I ordered a dish of Dum Aloo and Paratha which I think they forgot and took almost 25 mins to get. That was also after several follow ups and reminders. And the staff are running from one table to another. It is difficult to catch hold of them. 

Price : 4/5. It is bit pricey. We two had to shell out around 2100 bucks. And you are going to pay that as well if you try few dishes. If you just get one Biriyani and one mutton dish and share it within two, then 1000 bucks is enough. Quantity is sufficient for two. 

Overall, I will recommend this restaurant. One of the good ones in Kolkata and surely worth a try.

The place has a nice ambiance which goes with their awadhi theme. The number of tables is less so there can be queue at times but the food makes up for that since they are able to tastefully replicate the awadhi biryani to make the taste linger on your taste buds. Definitely recommending for Biryani and Indian food lovers.

One of the best places in kolkata for authentic Indian cuisine. The location is little odd , in the alleys still it can be compromised for their splendid and sumptuous dishes. I just loved their matki biriyani , though i forgot the name. But it was Amazing . I will keep going their again and again.

Food and quality excellent, specially the biriyani...number of Biriyàni types....I tasted Ran Biriyàni and Handi Biriyàni.... Starters are also very good.....but one issue is there...due to smaller space inside , have to wait long time outside at least one hour. Unless and until that issue is solved ...attraction hard to improve. ....pls look in this issue.@

This is amongst one such place I waited long to step inside. A very nice ambience with soothing music which creates a nawabi mood. I loved the crockeries. We ordered galawati kabab, lucknowi paratha, awadhi handi biryani  and moti biryani. The quantity was huge, but would not prefer to go for moti biryani anymore. Overall it was like so-so experience.

Excellent value for money.. Great food and great ambience. Loved the interior. Tried galauti kebab with Lucknowi paratha. The combination is awesome. Then ordered raan biryani.. It contains shredded mutton pieces. One plate is sufficient for two adults. At last came kesar firni. All over experience is too good. Highly recommended.

I always wanted to visit this place since i got to know about it. When finally i got a chance, i would say "What a place". It is absolutely fantastic be it the service, be it the ambiance, last but not the least "The Food". I am a hardcore biryani lover and arsalan seemed to be the best place for my cravings till i visited Oudh 1590.  We had galawati kebab and awadhi handi biryani which was delicious. It is a themed restaurant with a touch of royalty even on your spoon and glass. You feel like you are having food at some mughal palace with the music, the waiters serving around and the place itself. I recommend all foodies especially the mughlai food lovers to visit this place. It is a complete package.

Kolkata being a city of biryani lovers has got enough options to choose its biryani from..from nizam to shiraz to arsalan to ali baba to zam zam etc..these joints have been present for decades to please the ever watering tastebuds of kolkatans..the addition of this place simply justifies its place as amongst the best in modern times..the decor, the warm hospitality, the utter detailed precision in every aspect makes oudh 1590 stand out..we ordered galawati kabab..jus wow..the sumptuous raan biryani..truly a royal experience served in an earthen pot..and nihaari khaas..must say the mutton was so very tender that it took a single stroke of the fork to get it into pieces and tastes heavenly..followed up by phirni..though priced higher bt u get a true awadh experience in the most royal manner ever..hats off to the management..more outlets expected..

Rarely do I try out a new place without wifey by the side but had to make an exception this time since she was at my in laws in Ranchi. So now on to the experience at Oudh 1590. The decor and ambience is nice. The background mix of accompanying music of Thumri and Gazals is pretty eclectic- mom loved it. Went there looking for their signature Raan Biriyani, but they were out of the Raan. Had to try the Awadhi Mutton Dum Biriyani. It's different from the signature Kolkata biriyani- Doesn't come with the mandatory potato. Does come with eggs, 2 of them though. Slightly less oily and spicy compared to the Kolkata biriyani but more flavourful. Lighter on the stomach too - Doesn't make you feel too heavy. The mutton pieces were pretty wanting though-Hardly any mutton on them, just bones. That was pretty disappointing.
Mom tried the Peas Pulao and a Bhetki fish preparation. She loved it. I topped it off with a phirni which was nice. 
And we got the leftovers parcelled. But what's with Packing Charges for the same. Have seen very high brow and exclusive restaurants charge the same- Oudh did not have the requisite class neither the exclusivity to do that.

Oudh 1590 ..Kolkata's best debut restro..and I was here yesterday with my wife.After only 15 minutes wait we got our seat. We ordered the below items...
Aam Khaas --- very good and recommend it.
Gulwati kabab -- awesome
Murg Irani -- good
Raan Biriyani -- disappointing..very disappointed.I almost tried all the biriyanis in Kolkata ...Their Raan biriyani is just a mutton biriyani ...and it does not match the quality and quantity.The price was also high ..
Now regarding service-- very fast.
This place has got the popularity in last few months and it is attracting many VIPs.some of the waiter was very busy in serving them specially.

Oudh 1590, a perfect dinner destination. Serves one of the best Biriyanis in the city along with delicious Mughlai cuisine which satisfies a gourmet. Ambience is typically Rajasthani with slow music and dim lighting.Staffs are very polite and seeks every opportunity to serve you to their best. The Raan biriyani is highly recommended - it's a leg of lamb well spiced, marinated and prepared in dum phukt style and severed in a clay pot!

Overall the experience wasn't bad. It could have been a lot better. The Gulati kebab lived up to its name but it could have been a little less acidic (too khatta). The biryani came to us luke warm instead of piping hot. The chicken chaanp consisted of very bony pieces of chicken. The only dish which I have no feed back about is the firni. Sure, I had a good meal, but it didn't leave me feeling amazed. Not a place that I would come back to again.  A very over rated place.

This is one of those few places that makes you feel special even if for a few moment. The ambiance and the friendly hospitality starting from the gate-man to the manager himself is simply worth mentioning. The soothing thumri playing in the background adds to the mood and you will feel like staying for a little while more and absorb the beauty of this simple yet beautiful place.Coming to the food, we ordered Zafrani Kebab and Kakori Kebab for starters and Mutton Rann Biriyani along with Mutton Nehari Khaas. In one word the food was exquisite. The perfectly cooked mutton melted instantly in the mouth. I am happy to say this place has one of the best biriyani in kolkata. Everything was just right in it and quantity is easily enough for two. To end it all we had Phirni. It just gave the perfect ending to an awesome meal.This is a must for all who love to eat. Prices are a little high, so bring a bit heavy pocket, but its really worth it. I am going back very soon to have another awesome meal.

For anyone who goes crazy about BIRYANI, this place is a paradise. Enjoy an over sized hunger while you sit to order. Inviting sharbats, yummy kababs, outstanding biryanis, wholesome platters and mouth-watering desserts...Oudh 1590 is just first-class in its servings. 
It's only here that you will feel like a Maharaja and actually pamper your taste buds in kingly style. From decors to cutlery, you will luxuriate in the grandness of a palace in contrary to the concrete jungle outside.  
Recommendations here won't work, because everything in their menu needs a try!!

You HAVE to try the Galawti Kabab and the Raan Biriyani here. The Kabab is soft and flavoursome and it just melts in your mouth. The Kakori Kebab is great too! The Phirni is well-balanced, not too sweet. The service is excellent. They tried to make the place look as Awadhi as possible. But you have to wait in line for quite some time. We could only eat at Oudh at our second attempt. But it's surely worth the wait.

I have always been a Biriyani lover..and ever since I had read about this place in one I was keen to visit it and finally after 2 years finally got a chance..I had come to this place with a lot of expectation owing to the recent hype..They do not make any table reservations and the average waiting time to get a table is 30mins and it mostly exceeds to 1hour and sometimes maybe more than that. The place is very small with good interiors and ambience..good lightings..staff service is excellent. Now coming to the most important part i.e. Food..We ordered for Shahi Tangri Kebab, Galauti Kebab, Rann Biriyani, Irani Chicken and Firni. The food was good but not something extraordinary. The rice used in Biriyani was not the usual long grains. I am a great Biriyani lover and I would say I had better Biriyanis and Kebabs in Kolkata in other restaurants. And surely I am not coming for a second visit.

The only cons is that it is quite small in size and they don't take booking over the phone so you might have to wait hours outside for your turn if you have gone with your full family ..otherwise great place to visit

We were quite eager to visit oudh and finally we reached this place at 6:30 pm, and we got to know that the restaurant opens at 7 so we had to wait outside as there was a meeting going on and on top of that it started to rain so our excitement was gradually decreasing! Finally on entering the place, the first thing which stole my attention was the decor of the place, it was just amazing and I really liked the concept. Everything about this place was unique and the ambience was just perfect. We ordered the chicken zafrani kebab, the gawloti kebab, chicken biriyani and one sharbat (forgot the name). The kebabs were just brilliant and the biriyani was delicious, not too oily and enough to fill two people. The service was very prompt and the waiters were courteous. Our bill was around 1100 but they forgot to include the sharbat and i had to remind them about it so the actual bill was around 1300! Overall it was a great experience., :-)

Overall experience has been great.

The biriyani is different from the usual Calcutta Biriyani as expected. Won't find any potatoes in the Awadhi biriyani. 

The Awadhi themed decor and music along with the lighting just the icing on the cake.

Only downside is the waiting time to get a table. But that's just because of the good quality of food and service.

Located just opposite the Carmel Junior school, this is a excellent restaurant for the Awadhi and Mughlai dishes. Excellent décor, ambience and service, with great food; the background music is icing on the cake. The high rating goes for the delicious food with reasonable portions having mind blowing aroma and flavour but still exceptionally light on the tummy. Also the very courteous service personnel, deserves praise as many of the erstwhile leading Kolkata restaurants have lost that quality in recent times.
Will recommend and visit again!

As soon as I stepped into this restaurant Hum toh Oudh k diwaane ho gaye!!! 😂😂
Loved the decor. Loved the fact that even the staff were dressed in sherwanis keeping in sync with the Nawabi theme of the restaurant.
We had moti biriyani, Gulawati Kebabs, Nargisi kofta, firni and gajar ka halwa. Every food item tasted marvellous. The quantity is huge. In fact, we were told that a single handi of biriyani serves 2. But when the handi arrived at our table, we realised that it could very well serve 3. The Gulawati Kebabs, staying true to its name, melted in our mouths. Nargisi kofta tasted good but was way too greasy for my liking. The gajar ka halwa was fabulous.
If you are looking for good Awadhi food this is the place for you.

This is one of the better places to go for if you are indeed looking for exceptionally delicious Indian fares. It predominantly serves Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines. Tantalizingly aromatic and rich in flavors yet devoid of the many other hazards that accompany eating such rich food. I loved the Chicken Biriyani- it was one of the better I have tasted in Kolkata. The fragrant rice was sublime yet full of jaunty flavors which did not erode on the senses. A syou may have guessed, I am not a fan of the rich, ghee-dripping biriyanis rich in flavor of rose and keora water that is churned out in the name of “best biriyanis” across the town. 

Other than that, we had ordered the Rann Biriyani, Zafrani Kebab, Murgh Irani, Gosht Roghan Josh and Arghani Kebab. Was thoroughly impressed with the food. The décor is also quite tastefully done, barring the very low lighting conditions. I especially liked the way in which they presented the bill- in a wooden spice box with intricate carvings. Just so befitting the overall theme. 

Certainly would love to return for a visit again.

The staff is the most courteous I've seen in a while. And the food is simply mouth watering. The galawati kabab and the raan biriyani is to die for. Everything is soft and juicy and tastes fresh. Bought my grandmother here and she too loved the place. 
Also huge shoutout to the doorman with the awesome moustache. Coolest doorman ever and extremely helpful.

This is a fantastic theme restaurant that houses the best awadhi food in kolkata. Though they have a constrained menu for vegans but whatever veg food they serve blows you away. Their ambience and background music take you back in time and the service is also top notch. I had the veg galauti kebab and it tasted extraordinarily good. Some melt in the mouth stuff. A special mention for the awadhi palak biryani. Unreal taste and amazing overall hospitality. Prices are also humble. A must visit for one and all.

We have booked the table for 14 people but I dont know why the representative forgt to say about this to manager and also he lost the booking sheet as well and after reaching that place they are telling we dont have any booking with ur name sir..
Really disappointed ... we cant expect this from a brand like 'Oudh'...
After an hour we got the place and behaviour of that service person was good but food quality not so hifi... could have been better...

The ambience is absolutely fantastic and breathe taking complete with antique vases, chandeliers, mirrors giving us a truly nawabi experience. The murgh tandoori was succulent and moist with the hero being the khatta lal mirch pyaaz. The rann biriyani was to die for and gives arsalan a run for its money. The service is top notch though the sharbats need massive improvement. Pricey but bang for the buck. Enjoyed thoroughly...

Beautiful ambiance. Awesome food. The  biryani and the Galawati Kabab was just magnificent. Galawati Kabab is just "makhon". Must visit place for all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .

Wonderful decor, lovely ambiance, galawati kabab and lucknowi paratha: thses all sums up to Oudh 1590 to me. The place became instantly dear to me after I tasted their mouth watering and mouth melting galawati kabab. We visited here only once during last year's puja and as my partner is not a fan of mutton, we ordered moti biriyani which was not  up to the mark.Gosht Kundan kaliya was tasty but the mutton pieces were not good. In desert we asked for firni or shahi tukra but both were unavailable so we had to go with gajar ka halwa which was good though. Will definitely visit again to have their raan biryani.

Probably the best biriyani in town. They are a bit high on budget but the food, the decor, the ambience ( Lucknowi gharana feeling) they have, will surely take your eating experience to another level. Getting a vacant table on the first go....you gotta try your luck for that. Undoubtedly this is one of my favorite eating out destination in Kolkata.

Oudh is my ultimate biriyani rescue place. Hunger is quite unpredictable, especially mine. Being only 12 steps away from my house, Oudh 1590 it's the best place in town for Mughlai food. Their Dum Pukht Biryanis are one of a kind. Love the service and interior. Worth driving to the other end of the city and queuing for absolute delicious meal. And don't forget to get a snap with the Moustache Man.😉

I should first comment on the first sight of the place--you would almost feel like some descendant of nawab when you sit there & order for kabab platter....slurrpp! & that nawabi music behind is an unique feature of the place.
Then comes the biryani with very soft pieces of mutton & raita.
To accompany the biryani, next came murgh irani..another reason to visit again n again.
I have been there thrice but never tried raan biryani which is in my wishlist & I heard they have opened an opened an outlet in salt lake..so hoping to go there & write something more.

Situated near Desapriya Park, this big-group-friendly contemporary restaurant serves authentic muglai food with a twist. If you like well-spiced and extremely generous portions of biryani, then Oudh 1590 will hit the spot with its intoxicating masala & flavours. They cook their chicken and mutton briyani’s traditionally in dum style, which flavours the rice immensely. If you think you're rather well-acquainted with Muglai food, allow the unique, lip-smacking food at Oudh 1590 to open your eyes.

Upon entering we were welcomed by pleasing smile, at a glance ambiance felt fantastic though little bit shady, decoration and interior definitely give you a feel of Mugal era. Sitting arrangements were also comfortable and background music was perfect to my ear. The menu was full of gentle surprises, with unexpected Muglai twists that seem to genuinely come from the heart.

From their vast menu we finally selected ‘Shammi Kebab’ as starter side by side ‘Aam Khaas’ and ‘Badam Sharbat’ as thirst-quencher. For main we opted for their two signature dishes ‘Raan Biryani’ and ‘Gosht Kundan Kaliya’. I was bit surprise to see a wait staff for our table, normally muglai restaurant don’t bother about these curtsey.

We started off with their Mutton Shammi Kebab made with finely minced mutton with herbs and spices then mixed with yoghurt and slowly fried. This slow-fried royal kebab served with spiced marinated onions. If mouth-watering mutton kebab you yearn for, then their delicious Shammi Kebab definitely satisfies your inner lust.

Badam Sharbat had monotonous sweet taste but flavour wise awesome and in the other hand Aam Khaas was indeed interesting. Sweet yet hint of sour and mix of hand grind spices made it more fascinating. To me taste of Aam Khaas dominants Badam Sharbat to some extents.

Finally it’s time for their signature Raan Biryani — leg pieces of mutton and rice prepared in ‘Dum Pukht’ style, encased in earthen pot, was a true royal Awadhi delicacy. Their Raan Biryani boasts melt-in-your-mouth soft meat and beautifully fragrant rice that gives you a hug on the inside and was perfect for sharing between two.

From their many side dishes, Gosht Kundan Kaliya was unique find and definitely made you excited with its distinct flavour. Tender and well marinated mutton pieces bathed in a heavenly golden colour, smooth thick creamy paste will drag your foodie soul towards it. The gosht kundan kaliya was a well-balanced, flavour packed dish. One bite and its felt like heaven, you heart undeniably carving for more and more.

Your Oudh 1590 experience will be incomplete without trying the savoury Gosht Kundan Kaliya with Raan Biryani. Combinations were made after contemplating how one item would fit perfectly with the other.

I was bit surprised when they offered us complementary ‘Sahi Tukra’. Even I was planning to order a dessert that time to spend some time there as it started raining heavily outside. Sahi Tukra not only looks gorgeous but also toothsome and lovely balance of taste and texture. Don't expect this dessert to die for here, but it certainly does hit the spot.

Drop by for lunch or dinner and get mesmerised by their flavourful biryanis. It doesn't matter if you've chosen Royal, Arsalan or Shiraz and have stuck to it loyally for your entire lifetime - if you want a darn good Raan Biryani, put your loyalty aside and march over to Oudh 1590 for this gorgeous creation.

I am a big foodie for mughal dishes. i am still on a quest to find kolkata's best biriyani. On that quest i have had many many biriyani's. Right now after visiting Oudh twice i do pass my verdict. I would rate oudh's raan biriyani at number 2.The aroma, the tenderness of the meat, the taste every thing was perfect. Then you people would suggest why the second place. Well in simple words iv had a better. But that is a different story. If you are a mughal foodie id say Oudh would be one of your best period dining experience. 
The galawati kawab is certainly very very good. And i also tasted the nihari khass. they were fantastic and foodgasmic. The meat again was so tender that you can cut a piece of just with your spoon. In Short i am looking forward to visiting Oudh for a 3rd time.

A few days back I had been here for lunch with my family. Like every quintessential Bangali my father was late and confused which way to take to reach. The servers aided my father over phone with directions very efficiently. Such friendly service surely got us hooked. The Galawati kebab melt as one takes the first bite. A must for every gastronome. Even with a packed floor our food reached us fast.

After a real baithak session at mu gurujis place I and my friend decided to go there, it's a really very good restaurant,from warm welcome to fast service,a very nice ambience with extraordinary music which creates the nawabi mood...the interiors just takes to a different era...kinda,mughal or nawabi era...now coming to the food we ordered fish awadhi sugandhi mahi as the starter,ilt was very well marinated,and tasted equally good and the best part is that you get the food on your table too fast,as main course and side dish we took chicken awadh handi biriyani and irani chicken... Amd also a green salad,They were equally good though the irani chicken has a sweeter taste,but it tasted really good...totally satisfied... A must try..

Visited this place first time ever on a scorching hot Sunday afternoon in September 2015 after hearing a lot of positive reviews.Since it was a sunday,we had to wait about 15-20 minutes outside to get a table which is acceptable.The decoration inside the restaurant is truly amazing.Dim lights accompanied with old songs in a low volume and all the dishes having a a copper base giving us a good old Nawaabi feeling.Coming to the service,the staff here is very friendly and courteous,you cannot expect any better service than this.We ordered mutton galawati kabab,lucknowi paratha as in starters,awadhi handi biryani and murgh kassa as in main course and phirni as in dessert.The galawati kabab stands out as it was delicious and it melted in the mouth with the paratha so it is a must try if someone visits this place for the first time.Coming to the biryani,as me being a big fan of biryanis have to say that it was nothing extra special but was definitely quite good.To our surprise the biryani did not have any potato pieces which is a rarity in kolkata biryanis,it had 2 pieces of mutton,2 pieces of egg and enough quantity of rice for 2 persons and the murgh kassa was good too.We ended our meal with phirni which was terrific,all in all a perfect place for kabab,north indian and biryani lovers,I bet no one will leave this place dissappointed.

I waited well over an year to finally step inside this joint, and thankfully, got the chance last Saturday afternoon. Luckily, our party didn't have to wait outside for too long... was called in within 5 minutes. The decor, along with the thumri, has been complimented in almost every other review. But I can't help but emphasize it again. Great job in setting up the mood!

If I've biryani cravings from now on, I'll try to go for Oudh 1590. Yes I know that one plate costs almost double to that of other reputed biryani joints of the city. But the quantity offered here is almost double to what we receive, too. So that gets compensated. Moreover, the quality is obviously much better. It's a win-win situation...

What we ordered were:

1. Gulaab Sharbat - Nothing special really. In fact, it was too sweet for my taste buds. I don't know whether a gulaab sharbat is supposed to taste like this, but I was not happy with the end result.

2. Galawati Kebab - Long back, a friend of mine told me that Kolkata has finally reached the authenticity of the original galawati kebabs of Lucknow via Oudh 1590. This legendary dish is the only reason why I've been so desperate. And man oh man, did it deliver with a bang! From the smooth texture to the spices used in it, the dish was everything I had heard about it. Just too good.....

3. Rann Biryani - Feels great to be served biryani in an earthen handi. The taste was so unlike the ones I'm used to having. The overabundance of kewra wasn't there, but it was lacked its usual aroma a little bit. It also didn't have any oiliness... without compromising the taste an inch. The well-cooked minced mutton strips added that extra special touch.

4. Nehari Khaas - When we ordered the first two items from the 'What should you order?' sidebar display, why leave the last one out, huh? Nehari Khaas is everything you would want in an Awadhi mutton dish. Four large, soft mutton pieces dripping in a spicy gravy is a perfect side dish to go with biryani. And it indeed was...! Quite rich and very flavorsome!

5. Shahi Tukra - We didn't plan on ordering a dessert, but were forced to do it when people on the next table ordered an Awadhi cheesecake kind of thing and went ballistic. We ordered the same to get a taste.... and oh my goodness! Perhaps the best of the lot...! I don't know about the phirni or the kulfi, but you must give this a try when you're here. Or else, you'll be missing out on something really mouthwatering!

Overall, a very satisfactory experience with very courteous and helpful staff members. Had an amazing time here... I hope to come back and get a chance to gobble on the things we couldn't order this time because of limited tummy space.

Cons:

2. Staff behaviour needs to be more polished.
3. Booking system in rush hours needs to be more transparent.

The atmosphere is a little claustrophobic with the wooden panels in a not so large space. The food though is very good with both non veg and veg fare appealing to the palate. The staff are very courteous and helpful. Wish they would take reservations (which they don't)  because the waiting can be killing. Reach by 7.30 pm if you wish to avoid the rush. Overall excellent value for money.

Dined at Oudh 1590, Deshapriya Park. I think it's the best place to have Afgani/Mughlai cuisines at Kolkata. The ambience of the restaurant is just awesome, silent & peaceful. Dim lights, calm and quite surrounding with soft melodious Akhtari ghazals been played. The hospitality is kind of different and unique compared to that of other restaurants..ordered Aam Panna sharbat with Afgani chicken kebabs, Zafrani Chicken kebabs, Galawti kebabs with Lucknowi Paranthas..also tried the delicious & heavy Badam Sharbat and shahi phirni, the quality of food is just out of the world. The kebabs just melts in your mouth as it's so well cooked. The perfect destination for Afgani cuisine lovers!!

I have been a regular customer of various restaurants in deshapriya park area but somehow I missed this place. One week ago, I visited this place and was instantly impressed by the effort put in by restaurant. The decor , the lighting, the music, the chandelier, the mirror, the dress, even the decor in the washroom. The eye for detail was visible in each n every aspect. Kudos to the management ! Now , onto the food. It was even better . I had the galouti kabab and the lucknowi paratta. I have to confess , I expected that there would be a lot of oil. But it was just awesome. Almost a homemade feel. The mutton was just yum
Pros:
1. Tasty Food - check
2. Ambience and decor - check
3. Courteous staff - check 
4. Parking space- check 
Cons: 
1. Not much cons here. Just that they could market better. Even a die hard foodie like me couldn't find the place for 2 years!
Must try items :
The galouti kabab, which reminded me a lot of the tundey kabab.

Read the reviews and decided to bug my fiance to have my birthday lunch in oudh 1590...big mistake.. The food was so terrible that both of us got sick and had to cancel our plans for the entire day..basically ruined my birthday.. We had ordered the tandoori fish and gulati kebabs.. Both of them tasted bland and acidic.next we ordered the mutton biryalni and a chicken side dish..every thing we tasted seemed to be acidic or floury.my fiancé who is an expert cook himself understood the problem.. The curd in which the marinated the meat in had turned sour. They had cooked it without checking.the Shahi tukri was horribly overcoated in ghee & it missed the golden syrup. However the ambience is wonderful and the staff are very welcoming and warm.I just think they had a bad day in the kitchen.

Oudh 1590 boasts of rich mughlai/ north Indian preparations and it does deliver to its name..the kebabs are excellent...mutton galawti kebab melts in your mouth, the raan biriyani is excellent and the nihar e khaas, gravy of which is prepared from the mutton bone marrow is quite delicious...the restaurant scores 5/5 in food quality , taste and ambience...the only where it lacks is the service which I found is utmost casual..the restaurant is doing well now a days so it ain't a problem but once it establishes a name for itself it is going to be very difficult to keep up the brand specially if this kind of service continues from the waiters..

The perfect themed restaurant in the city where the ambiance and food are equally commendable.I loved the Handi Biriyani and the seekh kabab was unimaginably soft and juicy. The chutneys they offer are in themselves lip smacking.
On my second visit the tandoori chicken stole my heart. Budget being in the higher side, this place is recommended for an ideal romantic and lavish dinner date.

Visited this restaurant on Sunday (30th August) to celebrate the birthday of my friend. We were a group on nine heads. It was relay nice that we got the seat pretty early as we did not have to wait.

Decor

The décor is really nice. Well mixed with the theme. All the cutlery had a copper plating / color. Anyways, they were really heavy. The entire lighting could have been a bit brighter. Otherwise it was good enough.

Food

As starters, we had Galauti Kebab, Zafrani Fish, Seekh Kebab.

They were awesome. The Galauti Kebab was cooked to perfection. The pieces actually melted in your mouth. The Zafrani fish was also juicy and was done beautifully. Next was my favorite, Seekh Kebab. It was not very soft, rather a bit hard, but it tasted great.

For the main course, we ordered,  Awadhi Handi Biriyani, Lucknowi Parantha, Murgh Irani, Gosht Bhuna, Gosht Kundan Kalia, Nehari Khaas.

The parantha was good, but personally I did not like the biriyani. It could have been better. The other side dishes were good. Nehari Khaas and Murgh Irani being extraordinary. 

P.s. – We heard that Raan Biriyani was their signature dish. Too bad, it did get over by 08:45 p.m. I mean seriously, you do not complete your signature dish so fast. Also we did order a Keema Parantha which they replied would take a lot of time (They informed us of the scenario after 20 mins of order).

 

Staff

Though the staff were well behaved, I sensed a feeling that they were really very much hurry to complete the service. This cannot be acceptable. Please change this attitude. You are not a fast food joint, that you expect people to gulp. Let their taste buds enjoy the flavors you offer with time. After all, they are there to enjoy their Sunday dinner. 

Thus overall a 4 from my side.

Oudh 1590 is a little place around Deshapriya Park, which serves authentic Awadhi cuisine. Since I have never been to Lucknow, I can't guarantee on the 'authentic' part. But yes, the food is definitely delicious. The decor is pleasing, the staff is courteous and helpful. But above all, the place offers a great menu... A lot of options for us to choose from. Galawati kabab is a must try, the super-fine minced mutton and spices will simply melt in your mouth. Rann biryani is also superb, the mild aroma of ghee and well-cooked meat is a real treat. The prices are a bit on the higher side, but considering the portions and the taste, I would say it's worth it. Looking forward to try out the dishes I couldn't taste the last time!

A bit pricey considering its a north indian restaurant yet the decor, hospitality and food will make you visit this place again. 
The awadhi daal (daal fry) and nihari khaas (mutton with bone and gravy made with the bone marrow of mutton) won the best dishes for me. The nun's are big and one plate will get you 4 pieces. So two can easily share. The raan biryani was good but did not really catch my attention. For starters the galawati kebab and the awadhi kebab both were splendid. Will recommend that. 
The staff was friendly. 
This place is not that big so on a sunday you might have to wait.

Really a nice ambience, style of Luckhnow gharana...had been there for dinner. their specialty is the Galawati kebab, one must taste this, its really good. However, i didn't like their Biryani do much, it tastes different, but the serving was in a different style, they serve it in a earthen pot wrapped in a red piece of cloth. They are tagged their biryani a much higher price but its not worth eating.

A must visit for Brilliant biriyani. Maybe the best in town. The ambience is superb. Mughal age decorations with background music and antique furnishings. The ambience is very beautiful and soothing. The best dishes are Rann biriyani, galawati kabab, fish zafrani kabab, awadhi handi biriyani, murg Irani. The Raan biriyani is a signature dish undoubtedly the best in town. One plate is sufficient for 2 people although u won't like to share it with anyone. The fish items are awesome. They give fresh bhetki very well marinated and tastes out of the world. 
Located in good location near deshoprio park, although for first time u may have to search for the exact lane. But once u come u will become a regular one mainly for the biriyani.

Had been following this place for a long time and heard rave reviews. We had once planned a visit but unfortunately the place was being renovated. Finally one Sunday, the two of us decided to finally tick it off the list and went for an early dinner.
Thankfully we went early because within half an hour the place was almost full and by the time we left there were people waiting outside.
Going non-traditional we decided against sampling their famous biryanis and instead go with the legendary Galawati kabab and the Burrah Kabab along with the recommended Lucknowi Paratha and also a plate of Brain Masala.
With the first bite we knew why this place is the talk of the town. The amazing flavours of the kababs, rich, texturally succulent and melting at the same time. 
Quantities are generous and we were completely full at the end of the meal.
Fully appreciate the effort that has been taken to achieve and maintain such high standards of food quality along with the ambience and service.
Looking forward to returning soon to sample the biryanis.

Decor is pretty decent. I am in awe of the maître d' with the stache. A good first impression. 

Food was alright. The star attraction is the galawati kebab which is good. The raan briyani was also nice. Probably not a vegetarian's pit stop since all the vegetarian dishes we ordered were terrible (corn kebab was too sweet and tastes particularly bad). The only problem with the food is that it is really really difficult to digest. Out of the 12 of us, 6 of us had problems the next day. So while it tastes good, it doesn't feel good. 

Service for large tables will be slow, confused and full of orders you did not make. They're more accustomed to tables of four, so if you are planning a party, this is absolutely not a good place to go.

We wanted food to be delivered at our office from Oudh on Monday Lunch time  ! We placed the order on Saturday (22nd August) which they accepted ! But they did not deliver and called us only on Monday morning around 12 noon that they can't deliver ! We were left in a lurch ! The excuse was very lame ! We were really at our wits end to decide what next step to take as we ordered food for almost 30 people ! Very unprofessional

We visited the deshopriya park outlet. The first time we visited the place that was around 1 year back. The ambiance is awesome that gives you the feeling of you presence somewhere in Lucknow. Let's come to the staffs, they are friendly and organised. We ordered tengri kebab, awadhi biryani and a mutton preparation that I can't recall. The food tasted awesome specifically the biryani. The moment they started serving the biryani in our plates we got the smell of ghee which was really awesome. In one word I can say it was a foodgasimic experience. We ended on a sweet note with gajar ka halwa which was undercooked. Overall a good experience.

Most disappointing experience ever in kolkata ....could not make it to the table... Reached at about 2.30 in the afternoon and was told it would take about 30 minutes to get a table 55 minutes later had to leave when I was told it would take another 15 minutes absolutely mismanaged by the staff who should have an idea of how long it takes for an average table to finish their meal....they seemed to be more interested in keeping people hanging rather than telling them upfront how long it would take.....no food is worth this hassle

Take the left turn from Banana Leaf opposite Lake Market , and continue up to Carmel School. The destination is on the right. Authentic Awadhi and Mughlai cuisined restaurant. Since i stay far from Calcutta , i prefer takeaways. We ordered Chicken Seekh Kebab , Murgh Pardah Biriyani , Murgh Biriyani , Chicken Kassa , Chicken Irani , Mahi Kalia,
                                   Chicken Seekh Kebab was nothing unusual as such , although we liked the Murgh Pardah Biriyani and Mahi Kalia . Chicken Biriyani (Kolkata style) was as usual .The Chicken Irani tasted well enough , but Chicken Kassa was too oily.                                                                        In short , not a bad experience.Location - 5/5   Food    - 3/5Ambience -4/5.

Finally after so many hurdles and obstacles we went to oudh 1590.It has been on my list for a long time.Its a nice restaurant nearby camel school in deshapriya park.It has got authentic awadhi styled people and decor to welcome the guests out there. To start with the very entrance itself a guy in a black kabuli wala kurta with big moustache opened the door of my car in a very humble and polite way.Was having a kind of royal feeling like entering in my own palace😁😊
The decor was superb as if i have gone to a medivial period..the time of mughals!
Light was dim with big chandeliers and old styled paintings around with the mesmerising wooden work around.It was a great ambience.
Coming to the food. .at the starters we orderd qalmi kabab and d authentic galauti kabab with aam khaas.Aam khaas was a aam panna.a normal aam panna which nothing different in taste..kababs were Nicely prepared and d galauti was melting in mouth with the touch of arabian and awadhi flavours . Then v orderd rann biryani along with Nehari khaas (mutton).The rann biryani was having shredded mutton and was very light and so aromatic!The nehari khaas was a mutton preparation with a thick gravy.
Raan biryani: That was a real lucknowi nawabi styled biryani!!
we were already feeling full bt its never complete without a dessert .So we orderd phirni.Which was served cold .It was having right amount of sugar and was perfectly cooked.
Would surely visit again.😋

Well heard a lot about this traditional restaurant... & it's "Desi Maharaja Style cuisine"....... Nd i must say it's worth a visit.... Ambience.... Decor.... Very cozy.... Staff eager to help nd courteous.....
Coming to food.... Badam Sharbat.... Nvr had a better one than this.... Very refreshing... For starters we had Galawati kebab.... Very nicely minced nd cooked which just melts in your mouth... Nd Shahi tangri kebab...a very ordinary preparation just as u find at other places.... Main course - Awadhi Handi Biriyani..... Will just say one of the best biriyani's i had so far (though my fav is Hyderabadi Biriyani) .... One is sufficient for two...comes with two eggs nd two pieces of mutton... very well prepared specially the chawal nd the tenderness of mutton ... Nd side dish Murgh Irani.... Two pieces in cashew filled gravy... Little sweet little spicy in taste.... An excellent preparation..... Satisfied my taste buds.... Did not try the dessert.... Was full by then
But surely will visit once again to try it.... I would say one must go if one likes "Nawabi Style Khana in Nawabi presentation...."

Heard the name Oudh 1590 a lot from different sources. . So on last tuesday evening planned to visit there.
LOCATION : Compared to other restaurants the location though is quiet and calm but one can find a bit difficult to locate.. It is on the right turn after deshopriyo park while going towards Rashbihari avenue from gariahut.. Then left turn after Vijaya Bank.

Ambiance: Entering the restourant one will be amaized by the GREAT MOUSTASHE of the doorman..
All the waiters dressed in Black ethnic Punjabi and greeted us with a smile and showed us the table.. Soo for customer service this place is awsome.. Their friendly behaviour and suggestion for different menu as well as the way of service provided is quiet an example of their own..

Long awaited FOOD : We ordered Galauti Kebeb accompanied with Lucknowi Paratha Raan Biriyani which comes in a Earthen Pot and Nihari Khaas... The taste was HEAVENLY... One cannot describe the taste in any language known... One must try themselves to know.. Food quantity was enough for 2.. actually more than enough..

They also have home delivery service across kolkata. .. Soo this restaurant is a MUST TRY for Mughlai Cousine lovers...Thank You..

# Try to avoide on Saturdays & Sundays as well as Holidays.

A lot of people recommended this place for Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines. I figured this place merit a visit. I went there on a busy weekend night and had to wait to get a table. Once in, I quickly ordered a starter: Zafraani kebab. Well, the starter was served with flair but it was okay in flavor. It wasn't a one-of-a-kind dish nor was it memorable. With respect to the price, the quality wasn't all that special. Chicken pieces were soft but the saffron-y flavor was barely there. Next for the mains, I ordered the pardah biryani which is supposedly their specialty. The presentation was quite fancy. The biryani was served in a handi with a covering of atta. But again, the food itself fell short. It was just normal ghee-rice. It didn't have any biryani flavor at all. The chicken pieces were uncooked at the thicker portions. The rice didn't have the saffron color nor the flavor. It was a standard ghee rice dish with chicken pieces. 
I will not recommend this place to anyone. They just have a superficial fancy exterior but when it comes down to the food, they fail miserably.

I didn't expect that I have to rate it over 4.5 But from the very beginning after entering the place it made me overwhelmed. First the ambience, my god it will take you to the awadhi mood in two minutes. Excellent decors with Perfect music, made the ambience mind-blowing and will give you a different vibe. You can say, price is a bit high but what did they serve was priceless for me... Gwalati kabab. I can't explain it's taste with the paratha. Then the main course awadhi handi biriyani, superb... Very light but so much tasty. How could I miss the "shahi tukra" as a perfect ending of such awesome lunch..!!  The way they served and interacted with us was appreciable. May be I am wrong  but I didn't find any drawback after my first visit. I am pretty sure I will visit the place again and again. Love Indian Dishes.

And Finally Oudh 1590! Was planning to visit the place for a while after seeing numerous positive reviews on zomato! The place is exactly in the middle of Kalighat Metro & Deshopriyo Park, though it can be li'l bit tricky to find! Coming to the restaurant, the place has Mughliya decor inside & the background classical music makes the ambience top notch!
Coming to the food, had ordered Rann Biryani, Murgh Irani, and with Kulfi Falooda being unavailable, Phirni!
The quality & quantity of food was just amazing! The amount of food they served for one plate, was more than enough for two! The hospitality of waiters was great! Though the price might seem a high by looking at the menu, trust me after they serve you, it's worth your every penny!
Had an awesome lunch! Recommending to everyone up for Mughlai cuisine!

P.S:- The menu provided here in Zomato is outdated as the prices of some dishes have changed, so keep that mind!

This restaurant is located in between Deshopriyo Park and Rashbehari more.As we reached there, and the day being Sunday, we were made to wait a bit in rain. So that was a bit 'not okay' there. The staff, especially the one at the entrance is unfailingly courteous. As we entered the place, the inner decor looked impressive instantly. The ambiance there was a bit chaotic, though. Now that I got these details out of the way, here comes the food part.
For starters, we ordered afghani kabab, qalmi kabab and awadhi sugandhi mahi.Qalmi kabab was just perfect, served in a miniscule amount of creamy gravy and onions. It just melted in mouth. The Sugandhi mahi (a variety of fish kebab) was okay-ish and so was the afgani kabab, which was a bit too bony for my liking. Next, we ventured into biriyanis, but the oft-praised rann biriyani wasn't available. So we ordered Awadhi handi biriyani and murgh pardah biriyani. To blend with it, we also asked for murgh irani, murgh rezaala and of course the quintessential nehari khaas. The biriyanis were as aromatic and as sensually pleasing as it could get. It was rich in taste and yet smooth. Definitely one of the best in South Calcutta. Murgh Irani was great too ,especially its flavour. And the murgh rezaala, well the thick gravy they gave us made us feel that it was pure molten cashew nuts cooked a bit and nothing else. Yes you guessed it right, it was tremendous, a hidden gem of sorts in the menu. Nehari khas was a bit rich (obviously) but maybe not quite upto its billing. The desserts here were pretty generic, and many of them were unavailable at the time so we decided not to order.
So to sum it up, this is a place you should absolutely visit if you are a foodie or if you aren't. For a couple, 1.2k should be enough to indulge in their awadhi and mughlai delectable delicacies coupled with fitting decor and lightings. Recommended. Totally.

You cant ask for a better place to have a bite Mughlain Style. The place is well decorated and it has a nice ambiance. The people there are really good. The dishes speak for themselves at Oudh 1590. I tried Galawati Kabab, Raan Biriyani and Nehari Khaas. Every dish is lip smacking. Will definitely visit this place when I want to dig into a 'royal' biriyani.
The only con about this place is that you have to wait. Sometimes, it may wear your patience down. Other that that, it is a must go to place for good food

Yes obviously it was a typical awadhi biriyani...very well cooked..but I think the mughal quisine in biriyani is the best. Awadhi has been always based on GHEE... so the taste was not upto the mark..

If authentic Mughlai food is on your mind then this is the place to visit. The kebaabs here are absolutely fantastic. The biryani is good but not as good as the Murg Masallam. That is one dish which is simply divine. My suggestion is to try the naans, the kebaabs and the Murg Masallam. The biryani could have been better, though. :)

The perfect Awadhi cuisine in Kolkata. Well, I heard a lot about this place. today was the first time I visited the place. The ambiance of the restaurant really made a mark. The plates,glasses, the way they serve the food, the surrounding music will all set the Awadhi temperament inside. Going by the zomtao reviews we tried the Rann Biriyani, Gulawati Kebab, Tandoori Roti and Murgh chaap. We also tried their Moti Biriyani and Mutton Rezala. The Rezala is awesome. Yes by quality each and everyone was awesome. But I found that the menu is slightly overpriced as per the quantity. The hospitality is great but the waiters are too busy talking among themselves which at times becomes irritating.

My sis took me to this place on 26th of July . We reached the restro around 7.30 pm. As it was a  Saturday ,there was a huge que and hence it was around 9.30 pm when we finally entered. The moment we set foot on this place ,our eyes were greeted by beautiful illumination and the  soothing music managed to  set the mood right. We ordered for mutton galawti kabab, chicken tandoor , chicken pardah biriyani and firni. The kebabs were fresh and succulent and the pardah biriyani worked wonders for our appetite. As for the firni , sweet cravers would love it. The quantity was good and so was their packaging. The staff was uber friendly. A big thumbs up from me! Will visit again definitely :)

I was very excited to go to this place after seeing the reviews and pictures on zomato. When I reached the restaurant,  excitement was at peak after seeing the outer looks giving an ancient mughal experience. As I entered inside after waiting for half an hour, I was damn confident that I am going to enjoy my lunch here. But it totally went opposite. The staff was serving the food as if they wanted us to eat as fast as we can and get out of there. Apart from shahi Dal everything I ordered in vegetarian dishes was tasteless including the veg biryani. Totally disappointed after my first and last visit.

Awesome food. Wonderful interior. Great service. I'm a happy customer and in love with Oudh 1590.

They serve the most amazing Galawati Kabab in the city for sure. Nice and meaty. The Seekh Kabab is also delicious, but slightly dry for my liking. I have become a fan of their Raan Biryani. My goodness, it's out of the world. The shredded mutton works brilliantly with the aromatic rice. Great quantity too. Loved the Nehari Khaas. Gravy is extremely rich and compliments the tender mutton pieces superbly. The waiters are nice and courteous. If you are looking to visit during weekends, make sure you reach an hour earlier than your intended time. You would not want to wait for long before you get treated to some unbelievable Awadhi dishes.

Dislike: The space is a little cramped up, may get chaotic if it's full house, which it always is.

Suggestion: They should make space for a waiting lounge. Most of the times, people are found waiting for a long time outside the restaurant, can get difficult under the sun or rain. Extension of the restaurant floor is also needed.

This is a long pending review and finally got time to publish this. Can be a outdated review as well. Kolkata has experienced a lot of Oudhi food with different banners and specialities. Also there are not much joints which serve Nawabi delicacies. May be one have  to roam around to get their taste buds into resting. This is one joint which came up with a package tour to Nawab's kitchen.
You can find few very old Kebab delicacies in the menu. I will recommend the bet part as the Dum Biriyani,, Shahi tukda. I had Paratha and Malai Chicken and which were awesome.
I just found the price on a bit higher side, though the food made it up for me.
The ambience deserves a 4.5

Today on my birthday went to this restaurant for second time with a friend. And definitely it won't be my last time.....
The ambience, food quality, is just gr8. We ordered aam ras, and for stater murg tandoori.... The taste is delicious, the chicken is moist, and the three different dips definitely earn xtra points...
In the main course we ordered awadhi handi biriyani and gosht shahi korma. The biriyani is as usual good, but the shahi korma is the winning dish tonight.... The mutton is well moist, cooked at par, and the gravy is mouth watering.
Last but not the least we ordered firni and shahi tukra.... Both r good.
Oudh is doing a really gr8 job, and the staff helps u a lot to choose the menu, and is very cordial. The quality of the food is excellent... Plizz keep up the good work, and the queue outside the restaurant is gonna increase by each passing day. :) Bon appetite. 
Sorry didnt get to click too many pictures.... All my fingers r dipped on those mouth watering dishes.... 😄

Not much of a mughlai lover myself, the high point here in this restaurant for me was the decor and the music which played. Lucknow paratha is really light. I loved it. Good value for money. They messed up the bill though. Added an extra firni which I had no clue where it came from.

Simply the best Biriyani makers in the city. 
Seating capacity is less. This is the only downside which means you have to wait really long outside to get your taste buds moving.
We had parda biriyani, mutton side dish (forgot the name) and shahi tukra. All were amazing. The desert was the best thing which i ever tasted. All the best guys as you should be lucky and should have patience to stand in the queue to try this amazing food.

Look no further if you are a Awadhi Cuisine fan. This restaurant has hit the right chord. The first thing you will notice is how well exteriors as well as interiors are done. They have paid great attention to detail and even the AC has wooden covering. This place is a little small but I have heard that they are expanding soon. I have been there twice. The first thing that you cant miss ordering is Jaljeera. It was as authentic as it can gets. A perfect blend. I was a bit disappointed with the Dahi Kababs as there was no Dahi coverings like we have in Punjabi By Nature or Pind Balluchi in Delhi but they said it is how it is cooked and served. 
What you can't miss there is ordering Biryani. They cook fresh biryani and takes upto 25-30 min to serve it in a Handi. Normally one biryani is enough for two people. It was one of the most authentic awadhi biryani I have ever tasted (Alright second most authentic after Kareem's). Chicken is as soft as it can get and it tasted awesome. We also ordered a Sahi Tukda for desserts and it tasted great too.  

Overall I am dying to visit that place again and to eat a full biryani all alone. Highly highly recommended.

I was new to kolkata.  So, one of friends suggested this place.  Without knowing abt this place,  we reached there arnd 2 pm on a sunday. We had to wait fr an hour. But the experience inside was brilliant. Food quality was very good. Especially  the raan biryani is a must try one.  The meat was cooked till it reached the right consistensy. 
Their service was commendable.  No too much waiting time, very courteous and patient.  Will definitely try during my next visit to kolkata.

Always wanted to come here and finally got the opportunity today. This place is worth the hype. The interiors are tastefully done with wooden carvings , chandeliers and beautiful paintings. The food comes in the traditional brass thalis and even the waiters are dressed to match the theme. Tou have classical music playing in the background to give an authentic   Nawabi experience. 
We ordered their popular galawti kebabs which were so soft n they simply melt into your mouth. The Zafraani kebab was succulent and smelled amazing. We also ordered their flagship Awadhi handi biryani which came with two eggs and two pretty decent sized mutton pieces. The aroma and the taste were extremely savoury. We also ordered the Murgh Irani and tandoori roti which again was of the best curries I've had in a long time.
The only minus point of the experience was the long wait outside even though there wasn't too much of a queue as compared to some mainstream restaurants. Thank god it stopped raining, otherwise the whole outing would have been a dampener.
Overall, I'm in love with this place and would definitely visit more. They have left me a happy customer as I sit writing this review, full to the brim even after two hours of leaving the place.

From the very outset, the front facade of the outlet coupled by the gatekeeper sets the tone for the next round of affairs. As you enter you feel as if you are transported to an era where life was simple yet flavoured; the interiors, the music, the cutlery & furniture corroborate it. Finally coming to the main course, the biryani is heavenly, the parathas are light and crispy and the kebabs are juicy and tender marinated with the secret spices. To sum it all up in a few  words: An orgasmic affair, which you can ill afford to miss.

<Updated on 13th Jan, 2016>

Recently visited Oudh again for an advance celebration of T's birthday. Both of us wanted to visit during their Awadhi Kebab Festival, and so we dropped here for lunch on 30th December, 2015.

We ordered Tandoori Teetar (quail) and Fish Shammi Kebab from their kebab festival menu. Both the kebabs were lipsmacking. Tandoori Teetar had 2 whole quails in a single plate and was delicious. The tandoori char, along with the delicious marination, made it taste truly great. One plate of Fish Shammi Kebab had 4 pieces of tikka-like fish kebabs, and this dish was equally good as the previous one.

For mains, we ordered an Awadhi Handi Biriyani and a Mutton Rogan Josh. The biriyani, containing 2 pieces of mutton and 2 boiled eggs, was good as usual, and the Rogan Josh was the best we have had till date. Even though we had become quite full, we just couldnt stop ourselves from digging our spoons into the gravy till the very end.

For dessert, we had a Shahi Tukda, which was very good as well.

It was an extremely satisfying lunch after a really long time, where not a single dish failed to marvel us.

On my other visits, I have had the following dishes.

Raan Biriyani - Containing shredded pieces of mutton, the Raan Biriyani was really very good. Lucknowi Biriyani is usually less spicy and milder in taste, so let me warn you - if you are headed to Oudh expecting a typical plate of Kolkata biriyani, you will be highly disappointed. But if you keep your mind open to trying other versions of biriyanis available, then you will definitely like it. Another major plus point is that the biriyani here is not very oily.

Gosht Bhuna - a mutton side dish, the gravy of which will please your taste buds very well.

Firni - quite good, but I personally like their Shahi Tukda more (I have a weak spot for shahi tukda!).

If I were to have any complain, it would be that their mutton tends to be slightly undercooked and chewy at times.

The service is very good everytime. They have recently expanded the size of their restaurant by adding another section where there are tables available for bigger groups.

Oudh 1590 has indeed become one of our favourite restaurants in a very short span of time :)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This place was in my wishlist for a long time. Finally after a long wait, T & I visited this place for lunch two weeks back.

The interiors of the place is truly a delight. Lucknowi gazals playing in the background, wooden panels lining the walls, the archways, the beautiful chandeliers, the huge mirror near the entrance, the paintings with a royal touch, the traditional utensils lined with copper - all these combine together to make you feel that you have indeed time-travelled to the Mughal era.

We were seated after a wait of about 10 minutes. Immediately we ordered a plate of Mutton Galawati Kebab, a Chicken Qalmi Kebab, Lucknowi Paranthas and a cold drink.

One single Lucknowi Parantha is divided into four big quarters. The parantha was light & not much oily. This was the first time both of us tried Galawati Kebab. Though it did not meet our extremely high expectations, it was not too bad a start to the meal. The Galawati Kebabs went well with the Paranthas. But I did not like the kebabs enough for me to order it again the next time I visit this place. I dont think this has got much to do with the preparation of this dish by this particular place. Maybe the concept of mutton paste just didnt suit my palate.

The Chicken Qalmi Kebab was delicious. Four pieces of tender, succulent & creamy chicken legs made for a great dish. The sliced onions pickled in vinegar that accompanied both the dishes complimented the kebabs really well. We wanted to try their Biriyanis but somehow we became full after having these.

In the end, we ordered a Shahi Tukda for dessert. This particular dessert holds a soft corner in my heart & after having the Shahi Tukda here, I fell in love with the dish all over again. The thick layer of khoya & slivers of almonds made this bread pudding taste truly regal.

The service of this place is really good. The staffs are very courteous & patient. We even noticed one of the waiters continously answering the questions of an elderly couple regarding the different Awadhi dishes & engaging in a detailed conversation with them about the restaurant very politely & patiently.

All in all, we loved the place & had a great dining experience. Looking forward to trying out their biriyanis & other dishes on my next visit :)

Had been there with family.the restaurant s pretty small.they do not take bookings over fone.so people has to easily wait for 2 to 3 hrs before their turn.too much mis managemnt.no time sense. Vowed not to go there again unless they increase their capacity and start taking bookings over fone.everybody has precious time.does not make sense to keep waited for 2 or 3 hrs,as the food is not great, only that lucknow food is availble. Their mutton curry dishes are not great.but galawaty kababs were good.

1. Ambience: Place is calm and beautiful. It has that dim light and Lucknowi gharana. Qawali song playing in the background makes it more special.
2.Courtesy: This restro will be in your top list because of its courtesy.
3. Food: Food was properly served. Waiters are very responsive. Nehri khass  Gosthbiryani and galwati kabab should be the order.

After a drive down from Rajarhat on a Sunday evening, me, hubby and mom decided to eat out for dinner. Hubby suggested Oudh 1590 and we readily agreed. It was around 7:30 pm when we entered Oudh, and we were immediately transported to a different era. The glass painted lamps, the classical music in the background and the decor created the ambiance of a city that was. We were promptly seated. The menu baffled us big time, and we finally settled in for sweet lime soda, badaam sharbat, galawati kabab, lucknowi paratha, awadhi handi biryani and murgh pardah biryani. The drinks were good, the biryanis brilliant. But the stealer of the show was the galawati kabab. Yumm was the word. Succulent mutton paste that was readily melting in the mouth imparting a feeling of content and happiness that I haven't experienced in galawati kabab anywhere else in Kolkata. Foodwise, it was an experience I would bask in for some time to come. The only glitch in the otherwise perfect evening was their inability to accept cards for payment due to some technical error. Otherwise it was an absolutely perfect evening. Looking forward to visiting again soon.

We, my wife and myself had gone to this Oudh 1590 near Deshopriyo Park on 25th July 2015, to celebrate my wife's birtday. When we reached ther it was raining cats and dogs. We had to wait as there was que. The manager was helpfull enough to took our name and told us to wait in our car . After 15 -20 mins we were escorted inside by resturant staff, who shielded us with rain with his huge umbrella. FInally we were in. First thing we ordered as starter was galouti kabab, with which the person taking order suggested lukhnowyee paratha. This combinition was great. The paratha was crisp and soft and the kabab just melted in mouth. For main course we had 1 Rann biriyani which was enough for two of us. and Gosht Nihari Khaash. This combinaition was also very good  but I think next time we would be plaaning the plukhnow paratha with nihari khash. The ambience and decoration is very good ,They were playin thungri which goes well with the decoration and food and created a soothing ambience. Only things I felt negetive are this place is very small and there is no separate restrooms for men and women.I mus say again food is slightly towards higher side but is very tasty and good looking. Behavior of all staff is also very good . their uniform is black kurta and patiwala pants. For food quality this place is a must try for people who love nawabi khana looking forward to visit this place again for sikandari raan and foods.

Yesterday we had a sumptuous dinner at Oudh. The Nawabi ambiance coupled with 'Thumri classical music' was soothing to eyes as well as ears. We ordered a Nawabi kabab platter, it had 6 types of kababs...prawn,chicken,fish and mutton. You  also get a choice to replace any of the above mentioned kabab with the legendary 'Galwati' kabab.And we did exactly the same.  The Galwati was too good and melts as soon as you put it inside your mouth. Moving on to the main course we ordered the legendary 'Awadhi biriyani' which was served in a clay Hundi with three types of dips and a raita. Then came the 'rann biriyani' , I loved it. Although the marginal utility was dipping still it tasted equally great like the Awadhi biriyani. Definitely try this restaurant to taste a royal cuisine from Lucknow. The tax structure goes like this. They charge approximately 14% service tax on 40% of the net bill amount, VAT extra. So i think now you can calculate how much you need to shell out. :)

First word that came out of my mouth as I entered - WOW! 
Amazing ambience. Gives you a whimsical old world feel. 
One of the few places you could go on a date to, and go with your family. 
Service is good. Even the waiters are dressed in sync with the Awadhi theme of the place.

What we tried:
•Mutton Kakori Kebab-
Now, I'm not a mutton fan. But this kebab has me going back for it. It melts in your mouth. Authentic Awadhi flavours and texture, intoxicating your tongue. Definitely a must try, especially for people who don't generally like mutton.
Presentation - 4/5
Taste - 4.6/5

•Murg Pardah Biryani-
I've tried so many variations of this dish from all over the world. There are over 50 different styles of biryani. 
This variation is so far the best to my tongue. The meat is coated with spices. And there exists a layer of vegetables, a little wet, heavily coated with spices. It comes steam locked by a 'pardah' which Is bread dough, in a clay pot. The rice is also slightly greased with 'Desi ghee', I believe.
As a Bengal-brought up person, I usually need a gravy with rice. This is the first time, that a biryani dish has been a complete meal. 
Presentation - 4.8/5
Taste - 4.8/5

•Shahi Tukda
It's a traditional Mughlai dessert. A bread pudding. Served cold. It is not too sweet. Anybody who doesn't like 'Rabdi', should avoid it. Anybody who loves 'Rabdi', should definitely go for it.
This is basically the Mughal's 'Rabdi on bread'.
Presentation - 4/5
Taste - 3.8/5

•Special Mention - The seasonal mango pickle, served as amuse-bouche is amazing. It's one of the best amongst the ones that I've tasted, so far.

This is definitely the place to try if you like North Indian food. Will be going back to delight myself with other dishes on the menu. 
Cheers!

This restaurant was a big let down.I was really hyped up after reading some of the reviews here but to my dismay the kebabs were not at all flavourful and the biriyani seemed like they made the rice and mutton separately and mixed it later.The lack of essential spices made the food seem like a low grade replication of Awadhi food.Just because you sprinkle some rose water on the kebabs and add some saffron doesn't mean it makes good  kebabs.The right balance of ingredients and the hand of an expert chef is what makes the food good.I had better kebabs on the streets of Lucknow for Rs 20-30.Those kebabs were much more flavourful that this stuff.Also I thought the kebabs served at Shiraz were much more tasteful than what was served here.Very disappointed.The only saving grace were the courteous staff and the mouth freshener at the end.

I had lunch at Oudh 1590 today.The ambience with the light music of lucknow took us back to the days of Nawab.The interior decoration was perfect to remind us the period of the Mughal nawabs.We had the galawati kabab with lucknowi paratha.The Galawati kabab was soft and tender and melted in our mouth.In the main course we had Awadhi Handi biriyani,Rann biriyani and murg irani.The biriyani was awesome and smelled of ghee throughout.Rann biriyani had many small mutton pieces and it tasted like a genuine awadhi  biriyani.We were 5 people in all and each plate of Handi biriyani or Rann biriyani can easily serve 2 people.Undoubtedly,oudh 1590 serves the best biriyani in Kolkata far superior than Arsalan,Shiraz,Aminia etc.The staff were very cordial and well behaved.Even the finger bowl served after we finished our lunch had rose petals and lime along with hot water.We had a great experience today.Being a biriyani lover I would like to visit this place very soon.

Heard a lot about this place,so finally decided to visit it with friends and as expected Oudh 1590 didn't let us down! If you love Biriyani, this place is a must visit. Located near Lake Mall, this place really lives up to it's name. The wooden furnish, the themed chandeliers and the Hindustani classical music they played in the background just creates the perfect ambiance. We were lucky enough to visit just at the right time (nearly 8:15 PM) so was able to avoid the long queue which we didn't know was kinda an everyday scenario. Anyway, once we settled down , we ordered Awadhi Handi Biriyani , Gosht Rogan Josh and Gosht Bhuna and everything tasted exquisite! The service was also good and prompt. In desserts we ordered Phirni and believe me, it surpasses every Phirni from every restaurant I had before. All in all it was a wonderful experience! So definitely looking forward for my next visit and this time with my family! :) 

P.S: Missed the Galawati Kebab this time so will definitely have it on my next visit!

Tasted Qalmi kabab,galauti kabab with lukhnowi parantha and zafrani fish.....highly recommended. Their biriyanis both Awadhi as well as Kolkata style are very good.tasted Nargisi kofta...superb.no option for deserts except Gajar ka halwa. Need some improvement . Keep going.

Visited this place  for lunch today.The interior decor seemed as if we entered some darbar of a mughal emperor.The background music added to it.Heard a lot about about this place, so I was little bit disappointed about few things.First of all the waiting time was too long we reached there at around 1pm and had to wait almost an hour.but was still expecting the items to be available.but to my disappointment few of my favourite items were unavailable like rann biriyani,for which I went,sahi tukda was olso unavailable.but the items which v had were also good.we hand handi biriyani,nehari khas,galawati kabab with Lucknow paratha,aam khas nd soda shikhanji ,which was mind blowing.would like to visit this place once more to explore rest of their famous awadhi dishes

Well this review is solely based on my personal experience.. Was at this place with family for lunch.. 

Reached at 12.35, but had to wait till 1.20 to get a table ... Well this hardly mattered as we came here for some lip smacking lucknowi and awadhi cuisines...

To begin with.. 
Galawti kebabs with Lucknowi paranthe: To be very honest, I felt it lacked the authentic tunday kebabi taste... But it was good...

Ordered Kakori kebabs --> Unavailable on the day...  

Ordered Raan Biryani --> Unavailable on the day

We decided to go for Handi Biryani and Murgh Irani.. Which was good... Biryani was excellent..

I was shocked when I ordered Shahi tukda and Phirni... They said even desserts are not available...

Overall, I am not sure what was wrong , but definitely was disappointed.. Hope the next time I dine in, the things in menu are available to be served...

The long wait in the queue was worthy enough even on a busy day like Eid and Ratha-Yatra festival. The royal class ambiance, the delicious dishes makes a good worth of the money you're spending. The Golawati Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha is a must try ! The biriyani genuinely tastes awesome. I would definitely continue visiting Oudh 1590.

I just can't describe this place in few words! Starting from food to ambience to their service, absolutely perfecto!
Let me start with the ambience. Just as you enter the restaurant the ambience hits you! The mughal decor, the huge mirror and the paintings! Just killed it!
Then the food, Had ordered aam panna, sweet lime soda.
Starters- galauti kabab and lucknowi paratha.
Main course- awandhi handi biryani, murgh irani and nargisi kofta.
Yes, i am stuffed to my neck. Food was smacking delicious, especially the biryani, kabab and murgh irani. Loved it.
Tip- before going to this place, will recommend you not to eat anything for at least a day! 😜😄😄

Was invited for a surprise treat by a friend. But didnt expect that it will be such a pleasant one. The interiors were beautiful. The hospitality was at its very best. Ordered gulauti kabab with lucknow paratha. I can still feel the flavour and texture of it. Then ordered awadhi biryani, nargis kofta and chicken irani. Couldnot estimate te quantity and landed up ordering more than what we could. Super stuffed.. But somehow managed to finish it because of its mesmerizing taste. Overall a very very nice food quality and service.

Right from the moment I stepped in, I fell in love with the place. The decor and the ambiance is simply marvelous. They have taken care of every minor details as far as the decor is concerned. You actually get the taste of 'period dining'.

Food: We ordered Galawti kabab and Lucknowi paratha for starters. Both tasted incredibly good. I could keep visiting this place only for the kebabs. And then we ordered Run Biryani (which was served with Raita). For the desserts we ordered firni and now here comes the best part...It was one of my friend's birthday, and we asked if they could arrange for some cake. Since cake was not available, they suggested that they would arrange for a shahi tukra instead. And then they delivered the most delicious Shahi tukra, along with a knife, to be used as a cake. And guess what? It was on the house!

Service: The staffs were extremely warm and well mannered. They took their turn to wish my friend which was really sweet. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience and i'm so happy we made the decision to visit this place for my friend's b'day.

Ryt from the entrance .... Its awsum
Generally the rajasthani darban style guard welcoming... Nd as u enter all with the peshawari look ; ambience is super awsum reminds u off the old age work nd art.. !!!

Crossing the lane from architecture and style to ala carte

1. Galawti kabab with parantha .... Surely melts after you have it as it is so soft and tasty... 👍 

2. Aam phaas nd soda sikanji- best ever refreshing drink of oudh

3. Nahari... Definitely a must try recipe in oudh if u r not a biriyani freak..

4. Phirni- if u hd everythng and not a phirni in desserts den its a loss ...

Awsum place...
Must visit with frends nd family ..!!!!

Went there for the first time tonight and since it was a friday night there was a queue long enough to keep us waiting for about 15 minutes..On entering the restaurant i was instantly taken aback by the grand nawabi decor of this place with all the paintings, the lamps and the seats. The ambience of this place really stood out. First we ordered some starters like Mutton Gulawati Kabab and Saahi Chicken Tangri and they totally lived up to our expectations. Passing on to the main course we ordered Awadhi Handi biriyani and Murgh irani..they were also decent enough..food quality is very good and the best thing is that it doesnt fill your stomach that quickly and I ended up eating more than I usually do.Cost is reasonable,staff is courteous..overally a great place to be!

We heard a lot about Oudh1590 in Zomato and T2,telegraph about its lovely mughlai dishes, inner decorations. Finally we had the chance to experience it. It was drizzling constantly with occasional heavy rain. We were searching for some mouth watering Biriyani in the month of Ramzan. We had thought about Rahamania, Arsalan and then finally decided upon this one with a medieval ambience, although it was quite a long journey amidst rain ☔ from Salt lake.
We landed there around 8.30, and the ambience made us spellbound. The paintings, wall decorations, jhar lantherns, and the Lucknow gazals made us believe that restaurant is not only about food but also about creating the perfect ambience.
We ordered the famous galouti kebab, raan biriyani and bhuna ghost. The waiter was well trained, he suggested us to have badam sarbat and one Lucknow paratha for the kebab, which we pleasantly ordered. Badam sarbat only increased our appetite. Then came the royal kebab, so soft...just mingled inside the mouth effortlessly. Raan biriyani came in a small hundy and was delicious 😋 and the quantity was more than enough for the two of us. We did not like the bhuna ghost that much, may be we are too delighted with our favourite biriyani and kebab 😄. We then ordered a fresh lime soda and relaxed a little after having so much food. The mukhsuddi came in a beautifully decorated wooden box and we loved that. The food seems to be a little bit overpriced with additional 14.5% service tax on 40% of the total bill besides vat, but still we loved it and curiously waiting for another great experience in this amazing restaurant.

Nice place for trying mughali cuisine. In deshopriya park branch they have very less sitting capacity and the services are very slow. The food is awesome. You have to wait in a long queue especially on Sundays.The interior décor is gorgeous and elegant . Added attraction- The man at the gate with his huge moustache. Overall a great place .

Visited after almost a year.. and ordered handi biryani and gosht(mutton) chaap. The chaap was the best I have tried until now...staffs courteous and food quality and quantity has not changed.

Visited this place on the recommendation of friends...and the place didn't disappoint.
Location----Located in Deshapriya Park West opposite Carmel Primary School and Chocolash dessert shop
Ambience---The ambience is one of the finest ever experienced...with traditional mughal decor and Begum Akhtar music playing in the background..the plates and glasses were bronze coated...and sitting arrangement was well enough and lighting was just perfect.
Food----Orderd galawaati kebab,raan biryani and chicken chaap...galawaati kebab was the best of the lot served with thin hot parathas..the ground mutton just melted in mouth..
Raan Biryani was very mediocre according to me and was very much comparable to arsalan where price is about half...but still the mutton was tender and succulent...and oil was less...and no potatoes!!!!
Chicken Chap was just wonderful...the chicken was tender,spicy but not too hot...and just cooked perfectly...
The biryani was served with raaita which was good.
Cost---3 of us went there bill came out rs 1200..a little overpriced according to me but ambience makes up for it...
Overall a place worth visiting.....

No better place to b if you want to try authentic awadhi biriyani..i find this place just awesome..the decors are unique..to start with the resraurant is quite easy to find..the staffs are very polite and helpful. I tried the awadi raan biriyani ,the chicken purdah biriyani and gulati kebab. The kebabs were juat brilliant..the awadhi raan was absolutely amazing in taste..the servings are good enough for 2people..the purdah biriyani was good but nowhere close to awadhi..overall 4.5 out of 5..the best biriyani joint in town hands down!!

We ordered awadhi handi biriyani and nehari khaas as main course and zafraani kabab as a starter. I just want to say that the biriyani was unbelievably good. So was the ambience. Only negative point was that since its so good, people flock from all over the city to this tiny joint and we had to wait for nearly an hour on a Sunday afternoon. So we stood there talking to the big moustached gatekeeper outside who was more than courteous and gentle than his appearance would suggest. All an all it was worth the wait!!!

They have taken care of little details of serving in copper and steel utensils... Galwati kebab is a must must... The boneless raan biryani that i. Ordered was bliss... This place is a definite next step towards indian food and is a exceptionally gud replacement to arsalan or aminia... A lil high priced than these places... Bt is completely worth every penny... Absolutely love it...

Had been there during durga puja so had prepared myself to wait in the que for long.. fortunately, we had to wait for jus 15 mins before we got a table.. Me and my boyfriend ordered tangri kebab, mutton biryani and a chicken side dish whose name i don't remember.. Interiors were really impressive.. Food was a killer! Completely blown over by the taste of each dish, especially the biryani.. we ordered shahi tukda for dessert and i made sure howmuchever full I was, I,d rather have it all... Next tome when I go, will have the raan biryani which is Oudh 1590's speciality.

I had heard a lot about this place and finally went on a Saturday with a friend of mine. Its located in a quaint lane opposite Deshapriya Park. Easy to spot cos the exterior is beautiful and cant be missed! After a short waiting period we were let it finally,

The interiors are absolutely stunning and very well appointed. There is even classical music playing in the background. The attention to detail is just fantastic!

We ordered the Zafrani Kebab, Murgh Pardah Biryani, Brain Masala and each was absolutely delicious. Mildly spiced with oodles of flavour in every bite. The kebabs melted in the mouth, The way they present and serve the Biryani in small earthen pots is unique and a sight to behold! Also, being a mutton lover i must say the Brain Masala was some of the best i have ever had. For dessert we ordered Shahi Tukra and Firni which again was top notch.

Finally, i would like to mention the staff. I have been to many places in Calcutta but trust me when i say this, THIS PLACE HAS THE MOST FRIENDLY STAFF EVER! Right from the gatekeeper to the waiter they are very friendly and make you feel at home. A huge shout out to them!

If you are a fan of Awadhi food, do not miss this place!

Visited this place twice. The ambience and decor is awesome and traditional giving you a different kind of vibes. The service is quite good. Only problem is you may to wait for long in certain festive seasons. The food is good, mainly The kebab and the runn biryani. The quantity is sufficient too. And the price reasonable. Looking forward to visit again.

Ok, have been here a couple of times but my last visit a day back was the best visit for me till date!!
Ambience and décor- 4.5 out of 5 is a fair deal, as the décor is kindof NAWABI as you would expect while having nawabi food
Staff- full marks, as we didn't face any such problem and the staff were always helpful every way possible, with a bright smile on they face!
Now the real deal, the FOOD
To start with a soda sikanji or a rose sarbat would be fair enough, as they are not really something off the charts
As for appetisers we took
Afgani kabab-tender pieces of chicken, with a sublime hint of tanginess in them,tastes great with the sweet chutney they provide
Qalmi kabab-basically chicken drumsticks roasted with numerous spices, no doubt the taste is quite good
Galawati kabab- but this might just be the best galawati kabab i have ever had in Kolkata till@ date, tastes great with Lucknowi paratha, its a must have
Now for main course
We had the famous Raan biryani, Murgh parda biryani,Awadhi handi biryani, Nargisi kofta,murgh irani and Brain masala
Oudh is famous for its Raan biryani so wasting words on it is useless
Parda biryani is something new for me, with shimla mirch and stuff in biryani, its a new thing for me
Awadhi handi biryani was really good but at the same time it was real rich in flavours
Nargisi kofta, heard a lot about it, and i did hear it all right, they are just marvellously brilliant, a must have
Murgh irani was good enough, with a tangy masala and tender chicken
But believe me the brain masala was was the show stopper by all way possible, no doubt its spicy, oily and stuff but the flavours are something you will have never tasted before, its a must have, obviously if you can set yourself to have brains!!
But sadly no full marks for food as we couldn't have any desert, as none were available at that moment.
.
Looking forward for my next visit
Oh, ya, last word of advise for people who cares about their health a lot, this place aint for you folks, but foodies, gear up, if you love nawabi food do come down here, this might be the best place to have some nawabi khana pina!!

The best biriyani place in the city..the quality of food is flawless...
had 3 kabas,Galawati,Qalmi&Zafraani...all were very delicious indeed,with there paratha,it tasted even better..then the biriyani <3
had murgh pardah,raan&awadhi gandi biriyani,all were very different and each one tasted damn good
Had Nagrisi kofta(a very new dish to me,super delicious),Brain masala,(another new dish,this was awesome...one of the best dish ever,the spices were preeetttyyy good)murgh irani was also praiseworthy

would have given 5/5 but deserts were not available that day..or else a perfect meal...

always visit in even numbers or else dishes will be hard too finish..1 pot of biriyani is more than enough for 2 people..

Dropped in for lunch yesterday with family;  ordered aam Khaas sherbat, bedam sherbat, Zafrani Fish, galawati kebab (mutton), Lucknowi paratha, mutton raan biryani, Nehari Khaas.
Ambience: Thematic and somewhat impressive 4/5.
Beverage: Aaam Khaas OK nothing to write back home about.
Starters: Zafrani fish had a strong flavor of attar, overpowering the taste of fish, Galawati Kebab though absolutely melt in the mouth mutton mince, but again with a over powering aroma of spices, The subtle after taste of Lucknowi galawati  was found nowhere. 
Main Course:mutton raan biryani: Not at all the best, pretty disappointing, over hyped, 4 pieces of dry shanks without any mutton on the bone. Mutton pieces were somewhat torn and  scrappy, not the soft chunks served as in Arsalan or Royal... very pedestrian, Like to add that I have never tasted such sour and overcooked biryani  rice ever in my life. I felt like crying my heart out at the injustice done to this classic work of art, that  has most pitiably dashed to such  abysmal depths especially at the hands of such ' big time authentic chefs'. Pity  that such a Biryani culture that rules the culinary world has been reduced to such ignominy at this Oudh . An apology from the chef to the gourmet visiting this place is long overdue. I cannot reconcile as to what prompted him to pour few drops of ghee  into overcooked rice with strands of vinegar tenderised mutton raan with dry bones, perhaps recycled served in a decorated foil wrapped handi to pass off as 'classic' raan biryani. This Biryani has been ravaged off its subtlety beyond shape. If a time warp was in motion and the  Great nawabs's were around, they would have lamented till eternity at the outcome of the 'khatirdari' done to the dish. This time around they would have literally 'died by the dish'. When asked for an explanation, the ever smiling steward justified that mutton being immersed in vinegar for tenderising had added to the sour taste of biryani. My buddy nodded thoughtfully. I could see the disbelief in his face. My wife who herself is an expert in Biryani cooking was too shocked to utter a word. I was dismayed beyond words on learning of the usage of vinegar in biryani, but restricted my self in covering my face to hide my innumerable emotions from the world. Where are heading? Have already reached the precipice yet?  Nehari Khaas was very 'aam', overheated microwaved gravy. Not impressed at all.
Desserts: At 2:00pm on a Sunday Lunch we wanted to end with a sweet note. Ordered for Shahi Tukra, inspired by earlier reviews. The steward smilingly and most politely, as always, informed that " It was very busy on Saturday evening, and all desserts were 'finished' as a result, the chef could not arrange any dessert till this point in time. somewhat Un Imaginable'.
Staff Attitude: Absolutely Rudimentary...Humble Suggestion: A little warmth in the smile a little eye contact with the guests, a question or two regarding feedback on food etc, would have made the day, suggest  infusion of some 'gyan' during day/evening  briefings  would certainly help break out from their poker faced zombie land mould... A sponsored day out to Barbeque Nation by the management to its staff would certainly work wonders both ways in terms of  enhancing staff morale and learning a rule or two in how to provide as they often say a 'Wah, Kya bat hai " experience.

Excellent place to have Awadhi Cuisine in Kolkata. Their Mutton Gilouti Kebab with Paratha is just too good. The Kebabs simply melts in the mouth. We had Raan Biriyani & Kesar Firni along wth that. The Biriyani was awesome too. 
Management should arrange for some sitting provision outside as one would definitely find a long queue anytime of the week.
I'll return time & again to this place...

It is the best place for a complete experience.
This place is not as cheap as the other favourite Indian restaurants in town, but when you consider its décor and the exclusive taste, I'm sure you will not feel the pinch on the pocket anymore.
They use exotic spices and herbs, and marinate the meat like no other place in Cal.
Their biryanis are not the best.
I recommend:
# Galoti Kebab (MUST TRY)
# mutton nehari khas
# Lucknowi Paratha
# Shahi Tukra (MUST TRY)

Okay so this is a typical Lucknowi restaurant in  Kolkata. Me being from lucknow, never thought of getting the same taste anywhere outside lucknow. But Oudh 1590 comes real close. Tried the galawati kebabs which are the original tundey from lucknow with rumali roti and then we had murg mussallam and biriyani for the main course. The food was really good. I wasn't expecting such a wonderful experience but then somethings just make you think again. I had an amazing time there and would definitely visit again next time I'm in Kolkata. Do try the murg mussallam. Its out of the world. I really wanted to try the sweet dishes but was unfortunately had no space left in my tummy. A must visit. Highly recommended.

The food is spectacular. I think the closest food from Lucknow in Kolkata is here. But one word of advise never order a biryani until u have a taste for that, cause u don't get our callcuta biryani over there. Otherwise the food over there is the best. The ambiance its also very nice, giving us a taste of mughal dining room.

Amazing place for divide biryani n awadhi food. The decor is amazing ,giving u a 1590 feeling. The cutlery used r also amazingly yesteryear's as well.
We ordered a simple tandoori chicken for starters n it was soft, juicy n amazing masala coated.
For the main courses we ordered murgh pardah biryani which they mentioned one plate will b sufficient for two n that it was, with two pc of tendor chicken though the size of chicken pcs cud hv been a bit bigger but then it wud nt have fitted to the earthen pot in which they dum n serve the biryani. The rice was good suttle with no alu n egg. We also took a side dish of irayani chicken the gravy was thick n amazingly tasty. 
Our sweet tooth also met the amazing phirni n soda shikanji helped digesting them all.
They have good service,though the place is very small as of now with few tables so whenever u go b sure to stand in queue for ur turn but they r extending the place might b for the coming Puja n we will get more of sitting tables.
Pocket pinch is reasonable for such good food.
Been there with friends.
Cost for 4 with 1 full tandoori, 2 murgh pardah biryani, 2 iryani chicken, 4 phirni n 2 soda shikanji was approx Rs 2500.

Been here for the first time today and I am already in love with this place.

The decor is superb and the ambience is too good. The pace is dimly lit, with very classy and colourful lamp shades. This place has a theme of an old Lukhnow palace and the wooden furniture and wall paintings are too apt. Even the ACs are coloured to disguise.

The staff is good, friendly and prompt.

Coming to food, everything served were heavenly. I had the Galawti Kebab with Lukhnowi paranthas, The best I ever had. The Biriyani that followed were marvelous. Lightly spiced, with soft mutton, totally cooked in ghee! The quantity was good enough but the food was light.

I also had Firni, again the best I ever have had.

Price is on the higher margin but it offers value for money.

I would recommend this place to all who loved north Indian cuisines, specially Biriyani. Looking forward towards another such indulgence soon!

Reviews have to be based on personal experience, and sadly, as much as I would like to give this place a higher rating, based on the feedback I received from friends and family, I can't do that. 

We visited the place on a Friday evening. The ambiance is amazing, the soft strum of a sitar adding to an overall atmosphere designed to give you a slice of what Awadhi nawabs would take for granted. 

The service was also impeccable. 

Now, for the main bit. We ordered a Qualmi Kebab and the Raan Biryani. The kebab was good. 4 leg pieces of chicken, soft, succulent and the meat as tender as any I've had. Obviously expectations were increased. Then came the biryani we had heard so much about. While the rice was up to the mark, it was the mutton we had a problem with. 

Two large pieces, on the bone had a putrid smell. It was disgusting how bad the meat smelt. Those were the leg, I think. The smell made us want to throw up and marred what would have been, otherwise, an incredible evening. 

When we informed the waiter, instead of promptly removing it from the plate they kept on calling on other waiters to verify, and after almost 15 minutes they removed the offending pieces of meat. 

To the restaurant's credit, they did serve us two pieces of mutton instead. But no apology was offered. And something like this isn't what you expect in the middle of dinner.

The awadhi handi biryani was extremely good even though I'm not a rice eater...their nargis kofta was d perfect recipe if u like d feeling of suffering from heartburn n indigestion... How can they call it one of their signature dishes... Service standards were horrible as they took an online payment for an order and later assured that the order would not be ready as per d online order as they do not accept such orders post 7pm on weekends... BTW had to order online coz they hardly bother to attend their designated phone numbers...after I had ordered food elsewhere and was having my dinner,I got a call from them stating dat my order wud b ready in 20 mins and I shud collect it as its time for them to close... On reaching I was given every possible lame excuse without a hint of genuity...those 2 points are for ur biryani otherwise ur service standards warrant a negative rating...poor management

I ordered food online via FoodPanda, I had ordered Murgh Irani, Gosht Shahi Qorma, Gosht Rogan Josh, Laccha Paratha & Tandoori Roti. The Tandoori Roti was hot but hard as brick, it spoiled the whole meal experience, this is expected from a restaurant of this standard, the rest of the items were decent, nothing great or exceptional. I doubt I'd try the food at Oudh 1590 again.

Had a lunch at Oudh 1590 with my brother. It is mughlai specialised restaurant and there ambience has a royal theme of lukcnow. The food price seems like high but when you have it, feels like worthy. The services was a bit slow but managed to make upto it. I loved the galauty kabab dish of Oudh 1590. Moreover they served a quality food and my experience is pretty nice, highly recommended to mughlai dish lovers.

The taste of their biriyanis and kababs differ greatly from the usuals found in Kolkata and that is precisely the reason to visit Oudh. Their application of special spices in the food makes you feel like a nawab. Their Rann biriyani and Galawati kabab are simply exquisite.

My 2nd visit to the place and honestly was a bit disappointed with the outcome.

Ambience - good. Special mention to the music being played in the background. It gives a 'mughal' kinda feel. The volume of the music though, could be reduced a bit

Food - Genuine paradise for Mughal cuisine lovers. Galawti kebab is their speciality but this time I found it a bit more salty. One can have it with lucknowi paratha or roti. Ordered mutton kakori kebab which was not bad but lacked the wow factor. The disappointment was SHAHI TUKRA since it was not available. The same thing occurred during my first visit. The server told me that due to weekend factor the dish got over. My suggestion to the management is that if you are putting up a dish in your menu card it should be available.
Verdict: People who haven't visited this restaurant yet must pay a visit to enjoy the awadhi delicacies.

The ambiance of this place is done with taste, the food is tastier. Mouth watering kebabs will keep you going for more. The Gulauti kebab takes the cake here. If you can get a crowd there try their different biriyanis as each is subtly, yet distinctly different from each other. My favorite is the raan biriyani. Oudh 1590 will even get their food delivered if you are close by.

Very poor management of the crowd waiting outside by the person of the restora,in charge of maintaining the queue.It came to our notice that people can enter the restora without entering their name in the queue but directly telephoning the person in charge. Moreover he is more concerned about his lunch rather than the guests waiting outside.This is our experience along with many others from 2:30-5:30 at deshopriyo park oudh outlet.

Periodic dining experience in a royal manner with great food and warm ambiance.

Ambiance: You will notice very warm and cozy environment the moment you'll step in. Dimly lit lights, periodic chandelier, wooden furniture make it perfect for great dining experience and then there is this aroma of mughlai cuisines, to top these all. 5/5

Service: Very prompt. The staffs are well behaved and I personally liked their dress code. Almost negligible waiting time. 4.5/5

Food: Ahh!!! Here comes the USP of Oudh. We ordered for fish zafrani kebab, jhinga biryani, murgh irani and murgh roganjosh.
Fish zafrani tasted kebabilicious, was very tender and cooked to perfection. Jhinga biryani was just perfect as it requires to be. The quantity was enough to feed two hungry souls. Well, we asked for extra potato as they don't serve one.  Murgh irani and roganjosh both were equally sumptuous. Loved every bit of their food. 4.5/5

Overall, a phenomenal gastronomic experience. I'd love to enjoy royal dining experience anytime soon.

Ok, now I agree too that if you are to taste mughlai in Kokata, you are to be here @Oudh 1590.
Decor + service : 5 out of 5, no doubt
Food : Awesome! We tried Galawti Kabab with Lucknow Paratha- I will say it's a must. The thin crispy paratha with the delicious kabab was a heavenly combination. But the kabab alone does not taste that special. Oudh may consider serving paratha with the kabab as all may not be aware of the combination.
We had Aam khas - which is almost equivalent to aam pora shorbot of bengal.
Then in main course we had Raan Biriyani + chicken irani :  I will again say I was happy with the combination. Raan biriyani was very good while I will not say chicken irani was that special. Quantity of one plate each was more than sufficient for two of us.
Finally with a full stomach we tried Saahi tukda as dessert- it was like a pudding but with oudh touch, it was really delicious!

One tip: try to reach as early as you can, we reached on Saturday for lunch around 12:45 PM and it was half full, but when we came out nearly at 2PM, there was huge queue outside!

The Gilawati Kebab is the show stopper. The decor takes you back to the era of Nawabs. I was there in a group and had ordered various types of Biriyanies. Trust me, all of themnwere distinctively good. Sufficient quantity is given in a serving to suffice two souls. Taste of the food is awesome coupled with the nostalgic ambiance.

Friday night, after office...we had a sudden urge of having some good biriyani... So thought of visiting this place. We had to wait for a good long hour before we got a table...So if you are planning to eat here, be prepared to stand in the queue.. :-) 
The afghani tune playing in the background , the staffs in traditional outfits, the brass and copper utensils , sepia lighting ...the ambience and interior will take you to a different era . 

After standing outside for such a long time, we were really hungry and luckily we didn't have to wait much and our order arrived pretty fast. We ordered Lucknowi paratha , Galauti kebab and Raan biriyani. The paratha and kebab made a very nice and tasty combo. The mutton kebab was minced and soft with lots of spices in it. Alongside the kebab , there was one curd raita , a pudina raita and a sweet mango chutney. 

After this the biriyani arrived in a big earthen pot. This dish priced @ Rs. 385 couldn't live up to my expectation.The amount they serve is pretty good and is more than sufficient for two people. Unlike one big chunk of mutton, here we found a generous amount of shredded pieces but the meat was fibrous. The rice was a little bit overcooked and it was more of a mutton pulao... I felt the "Biriyani feel and flavour" was missing. Though, my friend liked the taste a lot. 
So, I think you guys should go and try out this place ( At least for the galauti kebab!!) :-)

Awadhi ambience inside...huge crowd outside..finger licking quality...had gone there with wife hence could not take much items,but whatever we ordered was really awesome..galawti kabab,rann biriyani and Brain Masala ...believe me the biriyani can give any biriyani in Kolkata a run for its money :) ...I would say the best biriyani in Kolkata...the kabab melts inside the mouth and the Brain Masala was also delicious..in dessert we had Shahi Tukra.. Again too good...this place must not be missed :)

after hearing so many good things about this place we decided to go there on a weekend. 
ordered mutton kakori kebab, galawati kebab with paratha nd soda shikhanji.
soda shikhanji is nothing but a jaljira water. :\
galawati kebab was average but kakori kebab tasted bitter n horrible. way to much spices completely ruined the taste. unable to finish it up and decided to skip the main course n went from there. afterwards I had to take medicine bcz of this.
may be that wasn't our day but will never visit there again!

After lots of word of mouth, finally landed up at Oudh 1590. Warmly greeted by the tall dark moustached gentleman, got a place right at the corner. The brilliant decor attracted our attention and we were pleased to see the well-structured menu card! Started with mouth watering Chicken Afghani kabab and Fish Zafrani kabab... Being unsatisfied with the too much delicious kababs we ordered Fish Sugandhi kabab which was fantastic.. Lastly ended up with Murgh pardah Biryani, a totally unique taste.. Our taste buds were finally overwhelmed and awaits for the next visit soon! 
P.S- Staffs were immensely courteous 😊

Recently we went there to have dinner, waited for more than 1 hour hoping for a good Awadhi platter. We ordered Aam Khaas, kakori kabab, galauti kabab, Rann Biryani, Nihari Khass but they told that the Kakori Kabab is not available. Disappointed we ordered Zafrani Chicken kabab and galauti kabab. Both the kababs were good but the Sharbat was not at all impressive. A regular Aam Panna priced Rs. 95 a glass! The place was over crowded with very dim light. We were not enjoying much as we hope. Then came the Biryani and Nihari Khas. We could not enjoyed them because my daughter got two hair strands from the Biryani. It was about 10 O clock then. They apologised, wanted to give us one more fresh plate but we had already done with that and not feeling well. 
We went there with great expectation. Many of our friends recommended it but our first visit was really a disaster.

To begin with ambience, its bang on. You cannot ask for a better royal treatment . Everything is antique, just as you are revisiting to some old kingdom . 
But the food quality is average. It didn't cause my taste bud to dance ; i didn't feel like asking for more. 
But only for ambience i would revisit the place and for nothing else.

This has become my Biryani destination! Simply love their wide spread of kebabs and Biryanis. The decor is fabulous and the choice of Hindusthani music effortlessly weaves the feel of an authentic Awadhi ambience. The only downside is that one can't pre book tables hence you can have to wait for a long time. I make it a point to reach around 7pm, saves me the queue. My pick would be the Galawati kebab with crispy Lucknowi paraatha, Raan biryani,kanthal biryani (veggies arebin for a treat) and the firni/ shahi tukda for dessert. I got so busy eating that I forgot to take any pictures of the food on all of the occasions!! Lip-smacking.

It takes much to open up at the heart of south Calcutta, make Biryani your main attraction, take on decades old Biryani heavyweights, and make a name for yourself. Oudh 1590 manages all this with elan. We walked in for a late lunch, the girls and I. The first thing that I must mention is a 20 minute wait time but that was not unexpected. The decor is great and expansion is underway. Oudh's Biryani justifies its popularity. Light, non greasy, and fragrant. One of the best you can find in town. The rest of our order, with the exception of the dessert, was sadly disappointing. We picked Mahi Kalia (fish) and Subz Kofta Kalia to go with Tandoori and Roomali rotis. The fish was the worst of the lot. Subz Kofta was a tad better but overpowering spices rob the Awadhi cuisine of its signature subtlety and lightness. Tandoori rotis were rubbery while roomali was passable. Just as we were ready to give up, Oudh surprised us with its Phirni which was exquisite.

The one reason I will never go back to Oudh is the service. I understand we were among the last lunchtime guests but it does not excuse the sorry service. The gentleman serving us asked us to place the entire order at one go as the kitchen was closing up. Fair enough, but do serve us the subzi roti a bit late allowing us to try the Biryani first, we'd asked. After agreeing, the brought us all our dishes together. We asked again for the rotis to be served later and so they were left standing in the kitchen instead of being replaced. Or so we assume because they were cold and hard when we got them. No one checked on water refill or adequacy of spoons etc. Halfway, he quit and two others took turns to serve us. We weren't asked if we wanted dessert. Perhaps we looked like we needed to go on a diet. Sad, tired, and lousy service.

I think I might order in if I start to miss their Biryani anytime soon. Prices aren't exorbitant so that may be a good option.

Well, this place is one of my favourites when it comes to taste awadhi cuisine. The south kolkatans are blessed to have such a place which serves mouth watering handi biryani, mutton nehari khas, galawati kebab, shahi tangri kebab and many such items. Located opposite of carmel primary school, the place allows the foodies to soak in the essence of Lucknow with a period dining experience. Apart from the exquisite interior and brass glasses, I enjoy the Indian classical music they play in low volume. If anyone is yet to visit the place, I advice him not to leave the restaurant without having badam sharbat and shahi tukra.

First of all the place was super awesome and cosy. Just cross the door and you will be in a lucknowi place. well decorated. 
Ordered Rann Biriyani and Shikh kebab. Both served hot and well. Liked the lay pot of Rann Biriyani and the amount was so much (absolutely good for 2). But to my wonder the kebab was LA-JAWAB. It tasted sooo awesome that i literally closed my eyes while consuming that pieces of happiness. For that kebab i can give rating 10 out of 5. 
I am sure I will visit this place very soon for kebabs only.

Visited this place on a sultry monday afternoon,but were taken aback by the 60mins waiting time. It was worth the wait,amazing decor,dim lights,qawali songs playing in the background created the perfect ambiense. What caught the eyes were the neatly painted acs in accordance with the theme. Ordered moti biriyani along with gosht bhuna and lucknow paratha..The service was really good,food even better. The biriyani was lip-smacking though i didnt particularly like the mutton balls. Loved the masala box and the aam ka aachar.  A must visit for all the biriyani lovers,u wont regret it.

Faced an unpleasant happening when we entered the restaurant last night around 9.30 pm. At the gate there was no one. The gatekeeper was helping a kid to board a car  few feet away. An open diary with some name scribbled was lying on a small table on the footpath. I and my husband entered and some pleasant friendly boys showed us one of the two tables that were vacant. That was the moment a man with the restaurant dress and spectcle came charging us that why did we enter without his permission or without scribbling our name in his diary lying outside the restaurant. We tried to convince him that there was no one but failed. He then blamed the darwan and why did he allow us. When we were midway the darwan came inside charging us again. The man with specs seemed to pity us for not throwing us out. It was not overcrowded, one table was lying empty. But the behaviour was autrocious. Though the food was good we couldnt enjoy properly.

Situated near carmel primary, at deshapriya park, it is a well decorated restaurant, maintained the perfect awadhian style.
The beligium glasses and the background music played brings the the perfect mood of romanticism. 
Coming to the food, we ordered handi biriyani, gelotti kabab, mutton chap and firni at the last. The food was too good along with the behaviour of the staffs.
All together, this place needs a must visit or a twice.

This one is a must visit for people who love North Indian cuisine, specially Biriyani and mutton preparations. 
It is located right next to Carmel Primary School, close to Lake Market. We visited this restaurant on a Sunday and had to wait for 75 minutes to get a table. That says how popular this restaurant has become in a short span of time. However, it was worth the wait.
The ambiance is great, service was good and fast.
We ordered a Moti Biriyani, Butter Naan and Gosht Bhuna. The biriyanis here are served in handis and the Moti biriyani was enough to serve 2 people. The biriyani had 6 minced mutton balls and the biriyani tasted heavenly. The Gosht Bhuna was spicy and was really good to taste.
I would definitely recommend people to try this out. One of the best Biriyanis in town. Cheers!!

I read a lot of positive reviews on Zomato and decides to take my family over. At 7:45 in the evening there was a long que of people waiting to get in. Finally went in at 8:30 PM ordered Afghani kebabs, Kakori Kebabs and raan biryani. Tasted all but the food is mediocre at best. Seriously I love the food scene in Kolkata but if the food I tasted in here is 5 star then seriously people have not tasted real good food. Not worth the hype. The decor and courteous staff cannot suffice for bad food.

A place for all mutton lovers... Starting from galawati kebab to their speciality nargisi kofta..
Handi biriyani is a must try... Both mutton and chicken... The meat melts in your mouth..

we waited for almost one and half hour to get a seat at the restaurant. well, the wait didn't go in vain . the food was really good... we ordered rann biryani which was pretty much different.. we also ordered some kabab which was too soft.. the paratha was good too but was pretty over priced... the food quality and ambience of the restaurant is really good..it felt like we r in the mughal era by ourselves :p....one thing the food came very late...we almost waited for 30mins to get the biryani and honestly I'm not happy with the service!the firni also came late... and they took 15mins to deliver the bill!

The best biriyani I have ever had in kolkata. It has to be a 5 star rating from me. Delicious food, awsome interior, brilliant hospitality I must say. I went to this place with my friends and had lucknowi paratha, galoti kabab, ran and handi biriyani and neheri khas. One should definitely try all these dishes. These are all speciality of Oudh 1590.

I had been there with my friends. The ambience is amazing. Regarding the good I really liked their Galauti Kebab, however the much hyped Raan Biryani, I didn't like that much. I'm a big fan of biryani, however I felt like having ghee rice with mutton on it. The smell of ghee was overpowering the taste of biryani. May be the awadhi style biryani tastes like that only.However,I felt that they should put a check on the amount of ghee poured in it.

This place is mecca for the people who love mutton. The restaurant has rightly kept the awadhi tradition alive with a very decorative ambience and lipsmacking cuisine 

Location: It is just next to the carmel primaryly school.the nearest landmark will be the tamarind restaurant in deshapriya park.

Ambience: A total five on the ambience .The entire decor makes you feel that you have travelled back to lucknow during those golden ages of classical music.

Food : We ordered two starters namely galauti kabab  and afghani kabab.  And i was satisfied with the flavour.the galauti kabab had the right amount of spice and sooo soft that it would just melt in your mouth.the afghani kabab was good but the show stopper was the galauti kabab.i would suggest to accompany galauti kabab with nan,trust we it shall be a heavenly experience.

In mincourse we ordered for raan biryani, nan ,adghani paneer,shahi daal.The quantity id this restaurant provides is huge so the raan biryani can be shared by two persons easily.
Raan biryani deserves a special mention as it the most authentic lucknow biryani i have tasted in the city.It comes in a clay pot neatly covered with foil and the moment you open that foil a sweet aroma of saphron enters you nose and make you hungry.The mutton is juicy and tender and the biryani comes with a huge bone! Its is really huge.

The awghani paneer and shahi dal was good and we ordered for aam khas which was quite an unique drink.

Overall an amazing experience and price is good !

I have visited this place countless times. On each of my visits I contemplated ordering something different than the mutton awadhi biryani but could not stick to my plans. I feel the mutton awadhi biryani served here is indeed the best served in Kolkata. Its aromatic and the mutton pieces are so soft that one doesn't need to use fork and can simply be torn with the spoon. 
I have experimented with the side dishes and kebabs though.
I highly recommend the chicken zafrani kebabs and the mutton roganjosh to go with the biryani.
Happy Eating Fellas :)

They don't take reservations on phone, wow! The place was packed, right upto the last table on a Monday afternoon. Signs of an amazing place and we were in for a treat.

The kebab platter was a great sampler, all the mutton and the one prawn kebab were  outstanding, the chicken and fish ones not in the same league.

For main course, the Zomato recommended Raan Biryani was amazing, as was the Brain Masala, Chicken Chaamp and Regular Kolkata Biryani. And if there is a mocktail on Earth, it is here. The Aam Khaas lived up to its name, I had two rounds of it.

Oh but never mind that there was no dessert, they had a hectic Sunday and weren't upto it. 

In the end, a nice experience, good value for money alright.

My personal favourites include Galawati kebab with Lucknowi paratha and the Gosht biryani. Areas that can be improved upon include the number of covers and the waiting time.

The BEST restaurant in Kolkata for Kebabs and Biryani. Value for money :5/5

Ambience: 5/5
Biryani :5/5
Kebabs: 5/5
Behavious of waiters : 5/5(You would be treated so well by the person at the door you would surely give him some tips)
Waiting time: 4/5
Space:4/5

Go there with an empty stomach and fill it up with the most amazing stuff ever.
What to order:
1) Galawti Kabab - The best Mutton kebab one could have. Mutton mashed and marinated and roasted to perfection
2) Lucknow Paratha - Never have I had a paratha so light and devoid of any oil. Tastes best with the Galwti Kebab and is recommended by the waiters too. A must with the Kebabs
3) Rann Biryani - One Rann Biryani is enough for two people - light tasty and not at all oily. The Biryani was overflooded with delicious mutton shreds making it all the more delectable. 
4) Nehaari Khaas - Three pieces of mutton and one long mutton bone which you can suck onto for as long as you want to. Exquisite mixture of spices. Very good to go with the Biryani. 

If you want desserts please go early. You may taste the Firni which is really good. However the much sought after Shahi Ka Tukra was unavailable for some reason and as I heard it is a must . So next time surely.

The only sad part was the long wait to get into the restaurant which was not that big too. But the waiters said they are extending soon. On a Sunday night it would take you around an hour to get in if you reach after 7:30 PM. But your wait will be completely worth it. Do eat your heart out. Average Bill = Rs.500 per head for a hearty meal.

We visited Oudh 1590 today. The place has a very nice ambience depicting the Lucknow Nawab palace with the music suiting the ambience. Sitting arrangements are limited you need to have some time in hand as you might have to wait for sometime 

Coming to food : Galouti kabab with Lucknow paratha was awesome. Kababs were so soft and delicious just melted in mouth, accompanied with  kakori kabab , kalmi kabab along with Soda Shikanji was a great starter.
In Main Course we has Awadi Ghosht Biriyani and Nihari Ghosht. The Biriyani serves enough for two people but if u want to consume less even you can share with three
At end don't forget to try Firni its one of the best Firni I had after a long time
Only a small suggestion to Oudh team if you can work on the lighting specially for the corner tables its kind of dark .
That's all keep up the good work . All the best

Fancy name and place. That's it . This place comes under the Biryani category of zomato, so I expected it to be of that level. But no it is no where near it . The price also misleads into it , one may think it is delicious and so it is pricey . Haha good job marketing. Also the quantity of chicken in the Biryani was meh... Biryani is very normal and with that price there is no signature taste of their restaurant Extremely overrated? Hell yeah!!

On June 13 my visit to Oudh 1590 for the 4th time was highly disappointing. The previous experiences which had been gastronomic delights was totally spoiled. After a long wait of 1 n half-hours we're allowed into the restaurant at 10. 30pm. The staff was in a hurry to wrap up. There was no choice in the biriyani n dessert section, only awadhi haandi biriyani n phirni being available. In the salaan section the mutton was not tender enough. The galauti kebab was the only silver lining. There was egg shell attached to the egg in the biriyani. The long wait was just a waste of time n money. This is how the reputation n rating of a popular place go down.

No denying my growing impatience of stepping inside this place! Decor reminds you of any Royal Palace from the past, copper glasses,dim lights and classical songs playing in the background that would take you back in time. Menu is widespread, from kababs to biriyanis. Among the starters, Chicken Afghani Kabab was lip smacking. Raan Biriyani being non-oily, tasted great with mutton pieces, soft & just so perfectly cooked..the earthern pot looked small but the quantity is enough for two. Gosht Rezala had a creamy texture & was completely filling.. We had to pack it. The refreshing Soda Shikanji helped a lot after the sweet torture. Lastly, Phirni, was nothing I hadn't tasted before but didn't disappoint me either. :)

Reading the reviews here in zomato, I was tempted to try out this supposed biriyani haven. I was not disappointed. The decor along with the soothing mughal folk music was a pleasant surprise. The galawti kabab with the special thin parathas set the tone for a great dining experience. The Raan Biriyani that I ordered next deserves special mention for the flavoured rice and the tender meat which though a bit expensive is definitely worth the experience..topped off with a delicous firni packed with ground nuts...All in all a must visit for biriyani lovers...

Oudh, in a nutshell, was a wonderful experience. I specially liked the ambience of this place. Copper glasses, the lighting, the decor and the music. Everything complemented each other really well. The staff was very courteous. Possibly one of the best places in Kolkata for mughlai and awadhi delicacies. I would highly recommend the Awadhi biryani. The flavour was just right with the perfect blend of spices and it wasn't oily. Damn, I had always been looking for a non-oily biryani. Thank you, oudh. :'D For starters, we ordered a chicken tengri kebab and it was absolutely lip smacking. Definitely worth the price. One wouldn't be disappointed/disheartened after a meal at this place. Keep up the amazing service.  Highly recommended. :)

The only flip side is the space is limited n one has to wait for a good half an hr to get a table on a weekend rush hour.

The place is beautifully decorated in the raajgharana style... Now coming to the food... Raan biriyani was the best... With loads of shredded mutton and a bit rich though, Murgh Irani as suggested by the dada who took our order, complimented well with the biriyani... The aam panna was good too but the soda shikanji was the best... 
Excellent experience :-D

I went to Oudh because it has managed to generate huge hype. Sadly, it wasn't able to live upto my expectations.

I tasted their Galawati Kebab (known popularly as Tunday Kebab) with Lucknowi Paratha (known popularly as Warqi Paratha), Qalmi Kebab, Mahi Sugandhi Kebab, Moti Biryani and Shahi Tukra. Their only standout was the Biryani which was very good but could have done with better quality rice (the one's they used were pretty thick). Their Galawati was slightly sour for my palate and was average in taste. Their fish kebab used slightly pungent fish (probably lower quality Bekti fish).

But overall, spending just under Rs 1600 was definitely VFM. My recommendation for this place is neutral but people will probably like it given that their Biryani is very good.

Starting from their Galawti Kebabs, Mutton Seekh Kebabs,Lucknowe Paratha and whole lot of different biriyanis followed by an amazing Shaahi Tukra or Gajar Ka Halwa. Best things about the placeNot too pricey on the pocket.Wide variety of mughal delicacies not found in the menus of most restaurants.Prompt Serving team and ever smiling face of Munna Da. :)

One of the best restuarants in south kolkata for Non-vegetarian.3 dishes i would like to visit the place again and again.
1.Gelawti kebab.
2. Paper parantha.
3. Zaafraani murgh.
Needs some improvement - Very low lighting,barely can see the food.Too dark ambience for a restuarant.The background score either needs to be stopped palying or the volume should be reduced.
Highly recommended for their kebab and parantha.Must visit atleast once.
PS : If one is really hungry.Please try to go a little early as there's always a huge que outside to get in.Good food with great taste comes with a long que.Be patient.

Just visit this place before 8 on any weekend eve and the standard waiting time is 1 hour or more....so it did for us. They albeit has a small place, but the decor is very nice and goes with the dining mood completely. We preferred to have it parceled though, and awesome food it was man!!! from raan biriyani to galauti kebabs, from murgh irani to shahi tukda, all were lip smacking...the good news is they are opening near my home. I see the management commenting in a few posts here..so would like to know from them if it is opened already..the guy who was attending us said it will take another 2-3 days...

Serving Awadhi cuisine, that makes Oudh 1590 unique already, as good Awadhi cuisine is very rare.

Went there on Friday night to find it very crowded, but luckily didn't have to wait.

We had Mutton Galouti Kabab with Lucknowi Paratha for starters. The taste and texture was flawless.
Next we had Awadhi Handi Biriyani, which was good, but nothing too special. We also had Nargisi Kofta, which was really good.

The design and ambience is pretty authentic, but the space is very small. Service was quick and prompt. Prices are pretty reasonable too.

Would recommend and would visit again.

Oudh 1590_thematic ambience with awadhi flavours on the menu...
But I'm highly disappointed by its biriyani... It seemed as if the flavours did not come together!! :(

In a comparison taste-wise, I would rate arsalan's biriyani way above Oudh!! Although their style of biriyani is miles apart.

And statutory warning:  you are going to miss out on the all important ALOO  that features in the signature biriyani found in Kolkata!!! :

Ambience: 8/10(the place really small, hence the rush____I had to wait 45mins; that too on a weekday!!)
Service: 7/10
Food: 3/10(biriyani's really disappointing!!! :( )

When you here the name of this joint, you immediately picture Awadh like it used to be in pre historic times. That is exactly the feeling you get when you step inside Oudh. Although not very spacious, the interiors done in dim yellow lights with props that have a sort of antiquity and the choice of mellifluous classical music Oudh will definitely make you time travel. 
Have you ever had Galauti kebab so good that you feel you'll die from excessive satisfaction? :D Well, I definitely got that feeling. Pair it up with the thin paratha/roti the waiter suggests to ensure certain and happy death. The raan biriyani is perfect and the quantity is great as well. The firni is exquisite and must be tried. In love with this joint. 
 P.S. The guard with the huge mustache is a cool touch. :)

Galawati kebabs was mouth melting...seemed to set out a series of fire works within the mouth...just awsm...raan biriyani is a special mention... As side dish we tried nehari khas and bhuna gohst...both of which were mouth watering...so a must go place and i myself will visit der again to taste other items from awadhi kitchen... Cons-a little over priced.. But can be ignored considering the serving amount and taste of the food.... Happy fooding..:-) :-) :-)

After hearing great reviews from friends , we finally visited the restro on this Saturday . It's opposite Carmel Primary School after you take the lane opposite Lake Market.
Had heard complaints about waiting time from lot of people , however we had reached around 1 pm and go a table for 6 instantly . People are not dining out in the heat it seems !
Ambience is calm and gives you an old world feel. Seating area is not very huge but everything is well decorated .
Like other Mughlai restaurants elsewhere , they serve you a combination of achars and chutneys which tastes yum.
Coming to food , we ordered Galauti kebab, Shahi Tangri kebab and Afghani Fish . Chcken and mutton starters were pleasure to the taste buds , however didn't like the fish much as it lacked spice .
Having heard that biriyani is their speciality , we ordered a veg biriyani , Prawn biriyani , Rann biriyani . Except the prawn biriyani , which lacked any taste , other two were good. Quantity is more than enough for two.
Chicken and Fish sides were good as per expectations.
Gajar ka halwa as desert was perfect ending to the sumptuous lunch.

This restro creates a lits of gimic in the market...and being a foodie a feel a bit of shame that I didn't visit this one...so from my way back home from a tiring duty I suddenly took the turn to visit this one..now what I get.....
Ambience: so much of jafri work,elegant and classy and royal but I think a bit stuffy
Reception: from the pathan looking darowan to pathan looking waiter reception is up to the mark
Price: a bit on higher side but I bet you won't complain after having the food.
Food: mouth watering and delicious..its a journey from kebab to biriyani to sahi tukra..just a pleasure to have...so highly recommended.

It is the best mughlai restaurant in southern avenue I had been there two weeks ago. I felt gud with the typical Mughal ambience which is quite unique. Food quality is definitely good. According to me raan biriyani is the best dish of dis place but when u will be going through the menu u will find cost of biriyani is much higher than other restaurant but they provide a good quantity.

Well! What an amazing expirience it was. Lovely ambience. We tried galauti kebab, chicken tandoori, parantha, ran biryani and their special biryani. Parantha is exceptionally good.. Galauti kebab is brilliant with the right amount of spices and its so tender that it melts in your mouth. The tandoori chicken is the best here with the perfect blend of spices. The only thing i did not like is their special biryani. The raan biryani was very good on the other hand. With very very tender meet. The special biryani lacked the flavours. The service is a little slow. Otherwise it is just perfect.

Exhilarating place,  with great ambience, nicely made.  Food was excellent.  The Rann biryani was delicious and the Murgh masallam was equally mind being blowing.  And both of them blended really well too.  The only drawback being the place is small and so pre table booking is recommended

This is one good place for trying out the awadhi cuisine in this city. The galawati kebab, rann biryani, awadhi myth biryani and the jhinga gravy is just beautiful. I also like their gajar ka halwa and firni. The decor and the ambience is just so good. The music played takes you to the world of nababs from Lucknow. They serve a very delicious mango pickle in the complimentary platter. It's a very nice eating joint. A must visit. Happy Dining! :)

Heard so much about this place, and like everyone, all I have to give about this place is, positive feedback.
The ambience would remind you of old eateries in the streets of Lucknow. The colored windowpanes, dim lighting, old-style furniture, brass utensils, Begam Akhtar thumris and ghazals playing in the background, would automatically enhance one's appetite.
The place serves high quality authentic Awadhi cuisine which is excellent in quality and sufficient in quantity.
The staff is courteous, prompt and the service is fast. :)
Would highly recommend their Raan Biryani, Yakhni Pulao, Nehari Khas, Galaoti kebabs, Afghani Kebabs, Shahi Tukra.

It was a long time plan & finally me and my husband managed our time to step here in. I heard a lot about Oudh 1590. & I felt interesting due to this name. & my husband is a foodie and specially he likes Moghlai Dishes. So, we was waiting for this visit. I am coming later to the food, first I want to tell about the ambiance. Oh! it's absolutely lovely. The interior is perfect to give you the essence of mughal time. & classical songs is an icing of the cake. Staffs are very good, as well as service. Even the washroom has also a touch of ancient look. I really liked it.

Now, come to the main point, that is food. I must say, they offer perfect moghlai dishes. We ordered Galauti Kabab, Moti Biriyani, Murg Irani, and Shahi Tukra. Kabab was superb. Proper blend and taste. My mouth is still watering! I am not a Biriyani lover, rather I don't like Biriyani. But I liked that biriyani. Meat Balls with the Rice were very tasty. Murgh Irani was also tasteful, specially the gravy was yummy. Shahi Tukra was also very good.

Overall I am very much satisfied with their food, ambiance and service. Oh, I can't write anymore, feeling so hungry!!! :)

I was longing to have Biryani for a long time, and since I'm a vegan, a good Biryani is quite difficult to find.!

If you don't want to face much trouble finding this place, reach Banana Leaf, take a left, and you'll find this place right opposite to Choco Lust.!

We had to wait around 15-20 minutes in the summer heat outside because they didn't open on time.! 
The ambience of this place is quite different, dark, but nice.

We ordered Veg Biryani and it was tasty, and I don't think I can find a better Biryani, as I'm a vegan and we don't get good Veg Biryani around.!
We also ordered Shahi Dahi Kabab and it was also tasty.!

The place is very pocket friendly, they good provide reasonably good service, the ambience is good, the portions were adequate, still the prices were not very high.

Oudh 1590=Ghee,ghee and more ghee!
The galawati kebab is delicious and filling.The zafrani chicken kebab is juicy and different.The Rann biriyani is really rich and does not taste like conventional biriyani. Its good though.The aam khas was too sweet for my liking...But no one,NO ONE tops Arsalan when it comes to biriyani.

This was my second visit to this awadhi food heaven. As soon as you enter the ambience, mixed with the aroma of spices and pure ghee backed with ghazal just helps the mood to set in.The Raan Biriyani and the Gosht Rezalla is  to die for. Wrapping up in short promt courteous service, Rich ,flavorful  and tastebud-enlightening food and moderately priced ... Giving a overall good experience...All you awadhi cuisine lovers must give it a shot

The caption of 'oudh 1590' is "period dining experience"...If you want to get a pleasured fragrance of that era then you must come to Oudh...
Location - it's a 5 min walking distance from kalighat metro station just opposite the Carmel School at deshpriya park...
Cons- but there is a little problem in sitting capacity there, so you might have to wait for sometime (30 mins around) to satisfy your tummy lust...
Ambience- the whole interior of the restaurant reflects the mughal era as the owners claim to be... you feel like nabab or someone having sahi lunch with your dear ones... I exactly felt it so...An undescribably amazing light lime odour satisfied our olfactory sensation throughput the time we were in... 6/5
Service- the services provided by black sooted waiters there was extremely good at both their behaviour nd service quality... 4.5/5
Food- we ordered galawti kebab at starter which pleasures my taste-buds so very that I could not think about... All the items that played the deed well are ' lucknowi paratha ( which was so thin that melts in a second in my mouth & excellent in taste ) , Raan biriyani ( some folks told me oudh biriyani is best in class in kolkata, after eating here I will support it totally ), Nehari Khaas ( an all time best ), Phirni ( this is a classic one )... 4.5/5
Prices are totally reasonable against the quality and services provided... I am looking forward to come very soon with my friends in Oudh 1590... @Srimanta Halder

This place has a lot of regard for theatricality and not much else. Food and service are overrated and average at best. I have tasted better Mughlai at Peter Cat. Sadly, food is the upside here. Service is the real downer! My parents and I were made to wait in the sweltering heat for half an hour on a hot summer noon while we found out later that there were plenty of seats available but no one even bothered to tell us. When we finally entered at 3:05 pm, the waiter dressed in black kurta pyjama (notice the theatricality) urged us to order the food quickly as they would be closing the kitchen soon. They did not let us go through the menu properly and kept suggesting this and that. The plates they served us food on were dirty. I had to tell them to change it; even then they only wiped them with a cloth. Yes! Nothing more! To top it all off, the food was late. I am not exaggerating even one bit. I had high hopes from this place after the rave reviews from my friends. I would certainly be avoiding the place after the below par hospitality and overpriced food.

I had been to this place recently with a lot of expectations of tasting really royal Moghul and Awadhi cuisine. Let me tell you the decor of the restaurant is very attractive with its wooden door, mystic lightings and of course, great music. You can treat your ears with the best ghazals and thumris if you are a fan of them.
We ordered badam sherbet, zafrani murg for starters and Awadhi mutton handi biryani with mutton bhuna for main course.  The sherbet was just too good, the starter was just OK ish, something that you can easily get at your local Mughal cuisine outlet. The Awadhi biryani was different from the normal Kolkata biryani and maybe that is what it is supposed to be. It was light, a tad sweet and overall not bad but somehow I really did not get the feeling of having a plate of biryani in front of me. There was no captivating smell of the Royal rice. Gosht bhuna was nice though. I found the waiters not really welcoming although I will not say that they were not courteous. All in all, I believe this is not really a value for money restaurant and experiencing the ambience might only be a reason to go there.

We stood in queue to get chance. The galouti kabab was good. Biriyani has no potato. Egg in chicken biriyani. Tastes good. Different from normal Kolkata biriyani which smells of golapjol. I strongly dislike this smell of golapjol in biriyani.

Coming to d food,since it was my first time,went with d already popular dishes- Galawati kebabs with Lucknowi Paratha,Raan biriyani n Nehari Khaas. I strongly recommend d combo of galawati kebabs with d lucknowi paratha,tastes amazing. And the Raan biriyani stands upto all d hype. The smell of the ghee lingers in ur mouth even long after having d dish. I was a bit disappointed with Nehari khaas but all in all great quality of food. Lastly,I must mention dt d staff is very promt and quick with their serve.

A place like this deserves a regular visit from a true biryani lover. Those people who have been intimate with the awadhi culture can relate themselves very much with this dine-in outlet off deshapriya park. the intricate decor to bring alive the awadhi charm is something to applause for. the staff dressed in kurta churidaar adds to this effort of the owners. the food may appear a bit heavy on pocket /wallet but the aroma and the taste complements everything. Raan biryaani  and galawti kebab are  must try ... and am sure our very own regular kolkata biryani will not disappoint you either.

Very well decorated restaurant. Each and every thing is in mughlai theme.. Staring from the glass to salt pepper containers. Service was good - prompt and polite. We ordered zafrani kabab as starter, moti biriyani, raan biriyani, murg chap. Raan biriyani was ecstatic. One of the best ever biriyani I had in Kolkata.

Price is moderate. On an average 650 per head. 
This is a must visit for the biriyani lovers.

The restaurant is really very good if you want to enjoy Special and a variety of Awadhi food. The food, the service, the ambiance, the price were all commendable. We had ordered 2 plate galouti kebab, 3 Lucknowi parathas and 2 plate Awadhi Biriyani which is of course a specialty of Oudh. The Galouti kebab is also a specialty made up of minced mutton and is served with chilled, spiced onions. The parathas were really good as they were thin and crisp. A plate of Awadhi biriyani consists of 2 eggs, 2 pieces of mutton and rice. The biriyani was could have better if the mutton pieces were a bit better. Because almost half [ or more ] was a solid bone. But apart from that it was very light and we enjoyed a sumptuous lunch.

We ordered the house special galouti kebab but the fish tikka bowled us over. The gondhoraj fish tikka wasn't available so we ordered the zaffrani tikka and the fish simply melts in the mouth.
The awadhi biriyani is light and packs in so much taste at the same time. The portions easily cover 3 people with moderate helpings. 
The only downside is the small seating area leading to huge queues. But once you manage to find a place, you'd never regret it

Biryani. Had many variations from the top places in and around Kolkata and outside my city, but Oudh special is one of a kind when you want to celebrate the moments by relishing the awadhi khaas khana. That wooden work interior is the extra advantage during the awadhi period of dining experience. The Biryani was nicely cooked though i went for gosht biryani, Kolkata special. The veggie version, dahi kabab were tasty according to the price. Biryani can be shared between two but you can eat alone if hungry. Gosht had multiple mutton pieces finely savored in mughlai flavors. I enjoyed everything i had. The place opens at 7 not at 6:30om and they have merely 50 seats to grab. I enjoyed my weekday stroll and have yours once at this place if you are fond of Kolkata biryani.

****Went there on a Saturday evening for dinner... The quality and the taste of the food was decent .. I have ordered galawti kebab with paratha, moti biriyani and chicken afgani. Apart from the parartha and ckn afgani the other two dishes were Average as per thr standard.. Out of this the behavior of the gatekeeper was really appreciable he has been a real gentleman and the person inside the restaurant as well.. But the person managing the people outside who all were waiting for their table was a bit odd...it is understood that on a Saturday evening there will be rush but try to check these aspects.

Lets start by saying I am self proclaimed Biriyani & tasted Biriyani pan Kolkata , Pan India & abroad , & not among those "havateys" to whom all those shiraaz-rehmania-arsalan ..et el  rubbish  tons of gulab keora sprinkled dalda rice  tastes heavenly. I wanted to taste the Biriyani of Oudh, quite some , it came as a sweet surprise when my sister treated me at her residence with a Oudh Mutton Biriyani & a side dish of Mutton in a thick red gravy. The Biriyani was just good , but I felt the mutton way slightly hard &,elastic , here the QA should step in , the raita was realy good ,the side dish was a few mutton pieces in a thick so called tomato,curd gravy , I was not amazed by it's taste , it was too sour. But , in my ellite Biriyani club , Oudh should enter , My ellite club consists of (rank wise) ITC Sonar, Mezwan, Nausijaan kasba,Astor,Aslam (Near Baruipur station) . Oudh 1590. The worst Biriyani club (rank wise)- Rang De Basanti Salt lake, Arsalan ,Rehmania , Shiraz

It's the only restaurant among the multitude present in Kolkata that I have been to thrice simply because of their mutton dum biryani. It's a treat for the taste buds. By far, no other restaurant provides the same flavorful biryani at this price. The ambience will take you back to the mughal era and the picture is completed with the soothing strum of elect music.

The biriyani here is very different from what I've been eating all these years, it's worth a try . They have unique biriyanis which I bet you won't get anywhere else , for example the biriyani with quail meat ! Some fine starters and a range of sharbats too! A beautiful ambiance needless to say . I wish I could name the dishes we had , anyway a thumbs up to this place ! Oh and you may have to wait for a while before you get a table !!

The only con i could find here was that they don't serve chicken items as much as mutton. Nevertheless we were satisfied! +1 for ambience, +1 for service! Both were great ??

I had heard a lot about this place and finally when I had decided to pay a visit, I came to know why. Located near Deshapriya Park, Carmel High School, this place is beyond words. From the moment one steps inside, the sense of time loses its meaning as one is brought back in a time of kings and emperors. From the big yet dimly lit chandeliers, to the brass crockery, everything is reminiscent of a time long forgotten. A++ for the Ambiance. 
As for the food, no matter what I say and how I say it, I wont do much justice to the delicious Awadhi delicacies they serve. We had Galawati Kabab, Kakori Kabab, Rann Biriyani and Nehari Khaas. The Galawati Kabab and the Rann Biriyani deserve special mention. They were just fantabulous in taste. 
All in all, from the ambiance to the food, it was an awesome experience.

The worst thing about this place is that if you go on a holiday or during festivals, there will be an endless queue and you will have probably lost your appetite by the time you enter the restaurant. The best thing is even after you have lost the appetite, the food will taste delicious and worth every penny you are paying.

Situated near Lake Mall. If you are coming from Kalighat Metro Station, just opposite of Lake Mall, take left beside Zeeshan and go straight till Carmel High School, you will find it on your right side.

Oudh 1590 is known for its Awadhi cuisine in the city. They have decorated this place so nicely that you will get a fell Nawabi Atmosphere. The wall paintings deem lighting, even the waiters match with the theme. Perfect for dining with your loved ones.

Coming to the foods, we ordered Galwati Kabab (mutton), it was yumm!!! It simply melts in your mouth, perfectly cooked soft and juicy with nice aroma and served with ghee; with the chutney they provide it was amazing. Next Awadhi Handi Biryani, first let me tell you its good enough to feed two hungry souls, one of the best biryani in town with good amount of mutton slices in it.

Again, the Awadhi ambience will give you a “Royal” experience.
Do try their Galwati Kabab, which is best in town, highly recommended for dining.

Price: It’s expensive but yes you will get what you paid for, the ambience, décor and most importantly the food worth every penny.

I have had their biryani previously, but its only yesterday that i got a taste of their other delicacies.. And to tell the truth i was quite dissapointed.. The galawati kabab was ok( i have had better), so was the fish kabab.. The most dissapointing dish turned out to be Murgh Rezala, chicken was severely undercooked(though the waiter replaced it), and the whole thing did'nt taste at all like a rezala.. The only saving grace was the Rann Biryani which was quite awesome...Go for their biryani only, the rest is quite average..
P.S- Almost all of their dishes have an overpowering taste of ghee.

Finally made it to this place! Oudh 1590 has an easy location and a relatively small seating arrangement. The moment you step in, all your senses are saturated with the rich Awadhi heritage this place boasts of : the smell of ghee laden kababs, saffron, the soulful renditions of Begum Akhtar , lamps, chandeliers, evrything! We dint take much time to order(as well as to eat) because we were in a hurry.
Coming to the food, galawati kabab was our first order : and it was orgasmic! The way it simply melts in your mouth leaving behind a heavy aftertaste, and the accompanying velvety paratha is to die for ! Next we ordered for Murgh pardah biriyani which was a lightly spiced biriyani and not quite surprising. However, the Rogan Josht was a winner too ! The rich silky gravy and the extremely soft meat was one of the best I had in town.
For desserts, I had predecided on Shahi Tukda;  unfortunately it wasn't available. But there's always a second time and this place is worth visiting a million times over.
Other than the food, the service was very prompt and I loved how they take care of every detail : the various Chutneys on the table, the finger bowl containing fragrant Rose petals, the embroidered walls and menu, and lastly the box containing various mouth Fresheners which looked like a tiny treasure Trove.
The experience was wonderful botei gastronomically and economically as its worth the money.
Kudos Oudh :) maintain your consistency !

Oudh1590 symbolises excellence..serving awadhi cuisine of the highest order..I am literally in love with this place..I have tasted quite a few items on their menu and honestly I have found each one to be flawless..delicious and cooked with utmost perfection..I must say they are doing a great job in satisfying the hunger for proper Awadhi cuisine in the city..First you enter you seemed to be somewhere in medieval lucknow..they have decorated these place with minute details..the wall paintings,lightings,the tables,the servers,even the fragrance will give you a perfect "Period Dining" experience..even the ac's are coloured to match with the themes..
Coming to the food,the servers are well informed and advised us to select:
Mutton Galouti Kebab: As soft and tender as it can get,literally breaks of while serving,nice aroma of ghee and authentic spices..tasted heavenly with Lucknowi Paratha..
Chicken Qalmi Kebab: Another perfect tandoor preparation of Chicken tangri..the marination was perfect..nice assortment of flavours..
Mutton Nihari: Another of their signature dish..loved the reddish texture..the oil floating on top..a thick brownish gravy..instantly makes you hungry..only issue felt was the nihari a way too thick..while I had a lighter version in Lucknow..
Mutton Raan Biriyani: Well being a biriyani lover and having tatsed biriyani in almost all famous outlets in kolkata, i feel this is simply out of the world..felt like a nawab myself after having this..just delicate flavours,perfectly cooked..special mention to the delicate and soft mutton pieces..
Mahi Chaap: A tangy,hot and spicy dish..a bit of sourness..nice aroma..the fried onions kind of elevated the dish..
Shahi Tukra: A perfect end to a superlicious dining experience..kheer was nice..not too much sweet..and there was gajar halwa stuffed beneath the bread..
Other Highly Recommended items are Mutton Kakori Kebab,Mutton Chaap and Jheenga Biriyani..
Overall Cheque comes to 2200/- for four of us..Highly Recommended..

Pricing: 4.5/5

Well. Well. 5. Yes. Too highly rated? Maybe. But i am in love with this place and Awadhi delicacies. This was on my list for more than a year or so and today i finally went am so happy.

I keep things short. So. We ordered the specialities or the one's they're really good at. Rann Biriyani, Galawati Kebab and Nehari Khaas.

The Biriyani was fantastic and quantity was good enough for two people, three if you eat less. With slices of mutton in it, it's too good. Best Biriyani I have had in quite some time. Missed the Aloo though.

The Nehari Khas was equally good. A bit tikha and they give four pieces of mutton and it's really good. Should try it. Much different from the mutton preparations we are used to having.

The best thing? Galawati Kebab. It's just too good. We had to wait to get this but it's worth it. It literally melts in your mouth and is soft and served hot. They give you somw flavoured onions with it. Adds to the taste. Mostly for the looks though. Just have it with paratha or tandoori roti. It's better that way.

The ambience is fantastic. Dimly lit and beautifully decorated, with awadhi style dressed waiters. This place rocks. Is perfect for a classy and reasonable dining. The waiters are really nice and well behaved.

The price given on the menu card is including tax and it's reasonable enough. So just go and eat here. For a ' Royal ' Awadhi experience.

The food is nawaabi! You get that essence of lucknow when you indulge yourself in galawti kebab and you just cant miss the oudh spcl biryani. Good food is all that you will get in this place...the interiors are are great too! As soon as you are done with the mughal era you could stop by that banarasi paan shop for that "khaike paan banaras wala" feeling! In short this place might just act as a catalyst to the love that you have for food!

The only good thing is the amount of hype it has managed to create. Otherwise it's a pretty basic place in terms of both ambience and food. It's cramped, so every time the waiters have to pass, they ask you to shift! To basically you are always getting up and settling down while having dinner. The music and the cacophony of co-eaters will irritate the shit out of you after 15 minutes. Because the place is small, everything seems to be too loud after a point. The food is ok. I repeat just ok. The biryani is very normal. In fact the seekh kebabs only taste of daal! Even the raita can be improved. All this since they call it a fine dining. 

My verdict: live long Naushijaan!

After many failed planning I finally landed up at Oudh 1590 on a drizzly Saturday evening. Oudh welcomed us in, and the ambiance took me to a periodic Nawabi palace, the light classical music, the wooden decors, the low lit lamb, copper cutlery, everything had that royal touch.
We ordered, Gulab Sharbat, Galauti Kebabs, Raan Biriyani, Chicken Irani and Firni.
Our bill : 1248

The Galawti Kebabs were so soft. they melted in mouth, they served it with some onions but the bread was missing, which you can see in their official pictures. Then came the show stealer, the famous Raan Biriyani. I have no words to praise how good it was, the mutton pieces were tender, juicy and the flavoured rice was out of the world. We even ordered the Irani chicken, but later realized this biriyani is better consumed solo. The the Irani chicken was ordinary, less spicy for people preferring the same. The firni was like the commonly available ones, but nevertheless good.
Overall, we had a lovely time having this period dinner at Oudh. Would definitely come back for the other dishes.

Oudh 1590 is not just any restaurant. It's an experience.  From the security guard outside to the waiters inside everyone is not only well mannered but well behaved too.
The presentation of food is just awesome and so is the quality.
The Awadhi Biriyani is something you won't forget in a long time. 
The atmosphere is also very impressive.
The only drawback of Oudh 1590 is accommodation. Can't hold a big number of customers. 
Excluding that it is a restaurant very one should visit! :)

The name is some sort of a code I'm yet to decode. Beyond that the restaurant is good. There is a drawback, they do not serve alcohol. Well they have yet another drawback, its kinda small and has only 2 tables for 6 people and all other for 4. So families with > 4 members, might be in for a long wait. Now that I've covered the drawbacks let's get to the point, the food. My friend was not severed biryani since  he was the only person eating it. Two lessons; don't waste food and their biryani portions are overwhelming. There is a veg palak biryani, even non vegetarians are suggested to try this. Beyond that the overall mughlai food is brilliant. The service was good. There is a drink, the name escapes my mind as of, a mango based I recall is good. The ambience is great and even the music is of the era.

Enjoy!

We also ordered Murg Zafrani Kabab,Awadhi Handi Biryani ,Roomali Roti And Bhuna Gosht.So yummy were all the dishes.We wrapped our lunch with Aam Panna and Soda Sikanji.Keep it up Oudh.Hoping to visit more often.

Very few period restaurants are  present in kolkata, among them Oudh 1590 is a reputed one. The decor and ambience perfectly matches with the theme of the restaurant. And their hospitality is the best it can ever be. Now coming to the main purpose of visit - the food - it's really delicious and mouth watering. One must try galauti kebab with lucknow Paratha as well as their signature biriyani. I tried keema biriyani which tasted great though it was a bit rich and spicy [biriyanis always are :-P ]. Zafrani kebab was not that great and is not supposed to be so highly priced. It is high budget restaurant but with the quality of food and the hospitality one won't mind that. 
P.S :- one must try out a pan from the adjacent pan shop

went to this royal treat last week with childhood friends. not so easily approachable location and 10-minutes waiting time were the only things that were not perfect. otherwise the soda sikhanji, the awadhi biryani, the tangri kebab and fine paratha were brilliant. the awesome decor with classical music added to the mughal feel. even the guards had huge moustache going with the royal theme. but the best thing of the evening was galawati kebab, one of the best mutton kebabs i have ever had. highly recommended.

After much waiting, atlast I visited Oudh! I wont forget the excitement I had for this place and it truly exceeded my expectations. It is in the lane next to Tamarind. The place looks magical with beautiful chandeliers around the place, royal paintings and ghazal playing in the background. It has to get 5/5 for ambience. The service is swift and the guys are very friendly. Me and my friend wanted to try the Qalmi Kebab so we ordered it along with softdrinks. The Qalmi came in a while , juicy and hot.. the legs were big and yummm! Creamy and succulent it was a delight. We heard so much about Rann Biriyani that we dint want to try anythng else but that only. Rann Biriyani is served in a good sized clay pot. Its steaming hot biriyani with shredded muttons in it.  Simply heavenly. Best part there wasnt much oil or grease. And     a meal is not over till you have the sweet dish. We got the Sahi Tukra which is a stuffed rice bread pudding and melted in our mouths. It was like a beautiful mystery dish packed with so many nice spices. Over all a great experience. Beautiful ambience and the food totally worth craving for. <3 Visiting soon!

Thanks to zomato I came to know about this "Royal" place!! As soon as you enter through the wood-like doors you will feel a Nawabi experience!!! The decoration, the utensils, the attire of the waiters, the tables, the paintings on the walls and the soft Ghazal n the background all add to make this place a perfect one!!! The quality of the food is also too good. Just, I think, in the Biriyani, the ghee is a bit more than required. However it is delicious!!!! Zafrani kabab!!! A must try!!!!

After getting a review from friends n zomato I took my family here.. There was a line where we had to wait for 45 min (commonly practiced in Kolkata). The prices were quite expected.. We ordered three mocktails which the waiter was confused n got us the wrong ones.. We ordered galauti kebabs and chicken briyani.. The food was not Wat I expected after the review I read. The waited dropped gravey on my dress while serving the food, n didn't even apologize for the same.. 
I visited Kolkata n make a point I explore a new restaurant or eating joints. This time I was bit disappointed.

It was  because of  Bengali new year's dinner we went at Oudh 1590. After waiting outside for more than two hours the food , decor, ambience didnot disappointed us. We orderd galawati kebab , luknowi paratha , mutton seekh kebab for the starters. The paratha was amazing . Both the kebabs were nice ., tender and juicy. Though I find galawati kebab to be little bit overrated.  Then comes the biriyani. We orderd for moti biriyani and raan biriyani and irani chicken. Moti biriyani is not that magnificent as I expected. But raan biriyani and chicken irani were too good. It is because these two items I am rating oudh 4 outof 5. A friend suggested keema biriyani and brain curry. Next time I will be looking forward for these items. Price is reasonable.  And I really love the music.

Awsmmm mughlai nd awadhi dishes... Specially the biriyanis.... Plenty of variety nd each one is better than another.
Pros- The ambience is nice.
Staffs are very helpful.
Service is quite fast.
Dishes r delicious.( we ordered badam sarbat, galawati kabab with lucknowi parota , fish zafrani kabab, awathi handi mutton biriyani, jheenga biriyani, murgh mosollam, mutton roghan josh, mutton bhuna, chickn irani nd soda sikanji). Biriyanis were really good and also the kababs... Murgh mosollam was excellent.
Regret no desert was available except gajar ka halua.. So we didnt try any desert this time.
There was plenty of space to park my car outside the restaurant.
CONS- The only cons is the place is not big enough nd inspite of airconditioned we felt warm with the spicy foods we ordered ?
Conclusion- nice place to have moghlai dishes with friends and relatives?☺?

visited Oudh during the pujas. Although it was over crowded and we had to wait for an hour but it was truly worth it. The ambiance and decor was really classic. It was instantly take you back in the 1500s. the staffs are very courteous and literally analyse all the menus like how it is prepared and which nawabs feasted etc. Now coming to the food. We ordered Zafrani Kabab which was okay nothing extraordinary follwed by Gallouti kebab which was mind blowing. It was succulent and cooked to perfection and it was accompanied with Lucknowi paratha(suggested by the waiter) which was thin layer of paratha made in ulta tawa. The combination was heaven. For the main course we ordered Raan Biriyani and Nihari gosht. The quantity was huge, one Raan biriyani was enough for three of us. The biriyani has a nice fragrance not too much spicy and the nihari was superb. Lastly we tried Sahhi tukda which was again mouth watering. I would love to visit again and again.

Always being a lover of Biryani I had to try this place. And what better day than on Bengali's New Years Day. But I made a good decision to try take away rather than wait for more than an hour for a table like many were. It was 1 pm and there were at least 10 groups standing outside, such was the craze. I took the biryani and it did not take long.
The food was brilliant. After a long time I tasted biryani in Kolkata that can match the evergreen Arsalan. Yes it was that good.
The service was something that caught my eye. There was so much of rush and they had may be 5 waiters and 4 people working inside the kitchen, so they were always running around. Yet for my small order they were so courteous, in fact 3 people came up to me and asked for my bill so that they can give my parcels, such good was their service. 
A must recommend for everyone, not just biryani lovers.

This restaurant serves quality food but the waiters are not at all cordial, I visited with my fiancee a month back and we were offered a place to dine which is just near the entrance and it was not at all comfortable..

Oudh was a plc tht was on my wishlist fr an extrmly long period of tym may b bcoz of its distnc i was not bng able to step into this plc.. But finallly we dcdd to visit this plc day bfr ystrdy.. As i had already read in the reviews tht this plc is always pre loaded i dcdd to book the table bfr venturing out.. But to my dissapointmnt thy kpt thr fone buzy continuously fr almost 1 hour and wen finally the ring was gng thy didnt bother to receive the call.. I was utterly dissapointed by thr way of handling things.. Lvng all this aside we took a chance to visit this plc as i was too adamant to go.. Wen we rchd out thr as expctd thr was a huge crowd gathered outside the plc.. The gatekeeper asked us to wait fr atlst 45 mins but i was fortunate enuf to gt the table within 15 mins... The place is a bit small compared to the demand which the management can surely work upon. The ambience is superb, starting from the decors to the music played inside. The ACs are colored to match the theme. The pictures of the nawabs and rani and the music of the mughal times in the background gives a very theme based experience..Cumng to the food we ordered galawati Kabab along with a spcl paratha which had no ghee as per the suggestions of the waiters, chicken zafrani kabab, chicken tandoori, murgh pardah biryani, thr famous raan biryani, murgh kassa, rumali roti along wid shahi tukra for dessert. Galawti Kabab stands out among the starters - the awesome feeling as the kabab melts in the mouth.. The tandoori along with the zafrani kabab were great too.. Cumng to the main course- the rann biryani was simply excellent though the mutton had an extra pinch of salt in it, it didnt dissapoint us at all... The murgh pardah biryani was grttt tooo... Simply mouthwatering... What came as a surprise was murgh kassa.. It was simply the best chicken kassa tht i hv evr had.. The masala was sismoly yummm... The rumali roti was simply soft and well made... The soda lime was the ussual self.. The shahi tukra was not tht excellent though.. I hv had btr shahi tukra bfr..overall the food gts a thumbs up.. The service was grtt too.. The waiters were cheerful and courteous.. I wud dfntly recommend this plc to my frnfds who ever want to try the awadhi food.. Its simply delicious and mouth watering!

I recently went there for my birthday dinner with my family. It being a Sunday we had to wait for about 30 mins before we could get in. The decor was great,has a Lucknowi darbaar kinda feel complete with gazals in the air,and heavy metal plates and glasses on the table. 
We chose Galawati and Kakori Kebabs with Lucknowi parantha, Raan Biriyani and Nehari khaas.
The galawati kebab just melts in your mouth and is delightful to have with the oil free parantha. The kakori kebab was not as good though.
Next came the biriyani and the Nehari Khaas and I will just say they are in the recommendations for a reason. The biriyani was the best I ever had and the nehari was just amazing,scrumptious and fragnant. Overall had a great experience here.

Basically zomato helps me to find out this restaurant.i have tried the items which were referred at zomato and i am truly satisfied with those items.the biriyani and the kabab was just extra ordinary.i also tried the paratha and that was the first time i had a paratha like this one...over all this is a awesome restaurant..

Ok, to start off, i am not too fond of Biriyani, but when it comes to Oudh's Biryani, i totally love it. 

I have tried out the Handi biriyanis, The Raan Biryani , the Nehari Khas and was satisfied each time. Delicious food coupled with lovely theme, provides the customer with a nice fulfilling experience. Oh ! and watch out for their Soda Sikanji, its a bomb !try it !

The only backdraw would be the lack of space, Oudh should look to expand and make space for more people.

I enjoyed my dinner at Oudh 1590. Both of us being poultry eaters, we stuck to chicken dishes all through. We tried the deliciously spiced Murgh Tangri Kababs which were succulent and well-grilled. For the main we shared a Murgh Pardah Biryani and Murgh Irani. I loved the nuanced gravy of the Murgh Irani, a well-rounded creamy taste that had not lost the kick from the spices. 
The ambience is worth mentioning. From the Hindustani Classical music to the Nawabi paintings on the walls, they truly managed to give us a feel of  Awadh. 
I would definitely visit again if I am in the mood for some biryani!

Decor 5 out of 5 
Location - fabulous 
Choice of Menu - Superb

But I am sorry, a biryani made with small grain rice - calling themselves as authentic Awadhi Biryani is not done. Again I am sorry.. if you remove aroma from the Biryani and do not concentrate on an essential part of Biryani which is rice and if you fry the potato in a biryani - Cannot be termed as Biryani.
And please write some where that you don't take orders after 3.00 pm.

Thrice that I have been there have realized that ghee is all this place is about. We found Awadhi Handi Biryani, supposedly a much sought-after dish, thoroughly overpowered with ghee,. Even a dish as light as Mutton Rezala was indecently ghee-laden. On the other hand, Galawati Kebab was just what we wanted it to be, optimally spicy, juicy, and melt-in-mouth. 

One reason I avoid this restaurant in summer is that this establishment does not accept reservations. Waiting outside in the sweltering heat of Kolkata is not a pleasant experience.

Oudh came as a beautiful surprise for biryani love like me . Being a biryani snob, I've been very critical of most places and rejected most of them. As soon as we step outside the car, the facade in front is beautiful and ornate and a very attentive door keeper greets you. It will  give a royal feeling . The minute you step in, an ornate mirror on the left decorated with red and green stones is very pretty.  Wood carved arches will adorn the restaurant and tinted glass windows add to the feel . I adored the light fittings and utensils too
A very mughal decor is created and adds to the entire feel . 

Coming to the food :

The galauti kebabs are the closest I have eaten to those cooked at Lucknow . And the texture of the paratha was velvety. The fragrance in the galauti did not over power the meat and was very well balanced. The awadhi biriyani was stunning too and we loved the pineapple raita. 

The dessert stole the show. One of the best shahi tukdas ever . 

What I loved about it was that when we came out, we saw a long queue and the staff made no hurry and we were allowed to take our own sweet time. Very commendable.

Good food... Even better service . Kudos !

Awadhi Handi Biriyani was really tasty yet light & not spicy. The biriyanis are served in clay pots.

Visited the place on Good Friday 2015 with huge expectation and Oudh manages to fulfill every bit of them. Anticipating a large queue at the outlet, we reached the place as early as 7:30 PM. We were shown right in but immediately saw the queue building up outside. The place is a bit small compared to the demand which the management can surely work upon. The ambience is superb, starting from the decors to the music played inside. The ACs are colored to match the theme. 

Galawti Kabab stands out among the starters - the awesome feeling as the kabab melts in the mouth, Kakori kabab is a bit spicy but tastes good, didn't like the zafrani kabab that much. Kakori kabab in one of the servings were burnt out which were promptly changed after we pointed out the same. Among the mains, I just loved the Keema Biryani. They have taken an awful long amount of time to serve the main dishes though. Unfortunately couldn't taste Raan biryani, Firni and other much-talked-about-dishes. I will surely visit again to finish my unfinished run on awadhi dishes.

Food is our main concern so I will start with that; its awesome.  The runn biryani is a must have and the handi biryani is also very nice. This restaurant can boast of having one of the best decors and the ambience created by the rajasthani music and the odour of food creates a perfect juxtaposition of heavenly appetite.  Its a must visit at least once food joint!

The place itself has a very royal ambience with its  interiors, beautiful paintings and chandeliers which gives it a feel of a palatial dining room. Now coming to the food, the proportions are quite generous and the taste will leave you hungry for more. The Afgani Kabab especially, with its blend of rich tastes melts in your mouth and the Moti Biriyani here is unparalleled. The prices are little bit high but the service is impeccable.

Visited with my family for dinner.

Located at the dark lane , not even over main road, still the crowd in that place will tell you how much good that restaurant is.

According to me, the rating goes like this :

Ambiance : 4.5/5

Service : 4/5

Food : 4.5/5

When you look at the ambiance from outside, it will look like some authentic mughal entrance. The interior must be bigger. But when you get in you will see it is basically a small house floor plan, yet the utilization they did with welcoming stand and tables and kitchen is at par excellent. It gives the full mughal theme which makes you feel that " yes ! I have come to eat my biriyani and kebabs !"

The pictures of the nawabs and rani and the music of the mughal times in the background gives a very theme based experience.

Service : First of the dress code of the staff is so cool and interesting. They went a great deal to maintain their theme properly. It was black nawabi kurta. It was overflowing with crowd that day. YEt, the service they gave was prompt and perfect.

Food : Excellent taste. Perfect marinated chicken. We ordered Tandoori Chicken , 2 Mutton Awadhi Biriyani, 1 Murg Irani and 1 Nehari Khash. And for sweet dish it was the delicious Phirni. The amount was enough for 4 of us to divide and eat. It was a very yummy dinner and I really enjoyed trying out this new place.

Will suggest everyone to go and eat there to experience the Awadhi nature.

Am sure, everyone will enjoy it.

Happy Eatings :)

Visited Oudh 1590 for lunch today afternoon. The waiting time outside was around 45 mins. However,  once we got inside the order was taken pretty quickly. We bring vegetarians are initially a bit sceptical of the Veg options available. Ordered Veg Gulawati Kabab, Lucknowi Paratha,  Multani Kathal Biryani & Sabz Salaan . The kebab was very disappointing and left a bitter after taste in the mouth. However,  the rest of the dishes are amazing. The Paratha just melted in the mouth and Biryani was awesome. The salaan was good too. The interiors are a dark and cramped and chairs are placed extremely close-by, making the experience very noisy. But the rest of the decor matches with the theme and food is amazing. Will definitely visit again.

Visited OUDH 1590 on 29th March with my family. The experience was not good for us.

We had to wait for almost 1.5 hours outside restaurant to get in.

Mutton Galawati Kabab was good but taste of Chicken Zafrani Kabab was not good at all.

The most frustrating and disappointing experience we had after having Awadahi Handi Biriyani.

The taste of that Biriyani is really bad and it is not upto the quality of the price  Awadhi Handi Biriyani is having and that too waiting outside for a long time.

The ambience is good but OUDH needs more extra space to allow their guests sit comfortably.

I have heard about this place from a friend of mine and desperately wanted to taste their biriyani. The location is quite prominent. The decor is very traditional with paintings and music which gives a very positive and different vibes. The galauti kebab was the show stopper and the aampanna drink deserves a refreshing mention. Both moti and runn biriyani were awesome and filling. I will visit this place again for more mutton items.

A place for awadhi cuisines. Kababs are nice specially Gulwati kababs, kakori kabab, zafrani, shammi. I have always went the awadhi handi biriyani and never disappointed me but I would not rate it as fantastic.
The ambience and the awadhi decor is lovely though I found the sitting to be a little crampy.
One of the main problem of the place is the quality of service and food varies (read degrades) during weekends. Service I can understand, may be due to high crowd, but why food? It should not be the case.
Lastly, though food is nice, but the pricing is a little bad in respect to "value for money"

Dropped in with fellow zoman @Petal. for lunch and Oudh you didn't fail to impress us. The period decor the music the crockery the whole ambiance everything is top notch perfect and in line with what you would expect from a restaurant who flaunt their Lucknow-e specialties. We started of with aam khas to be honest it didn't taste much different then jal-jera but the badam sharbat is definetly one to try. The shami kabbas were perfectly shallow fried no extra oil when cut or pressed and in perfect bind with potato. The gosht biriyani(Kolkata style) was good as well. The spices were in even mix and the mutton very well steamed to be tender no rubberish feel to it. One must try there laccha parathas perfectly crisp thin and you can peel out the spirlas (sign of a true laccha) although the mutton razela was not up to the mark fo me a bit to much yogurt I suppose and a slimy heavy sour feeling to it. The rogun josh would be a good choice. We finished off with fhirni and damn we were impressed. Not to hard not flowing either a perfect set with a grainy texture and bite to it and just the right amount of sweetness. We will visit you again.

Oudh 1590 is an experience which will undoubtedly soak you in mixed emotion.. their service levels are quite pathetic like it has been pointed out by several foodies.. but the only reason to keep going to this place is their Raan Biriyani and Galawati Kababs (soft as a baby' skin, you can never be satisfied... it's really that good).. their waiters will serve food as if its past midnight and they have to rush home.. they will LITERALLY force you to gulp down the food... they will keep standing next to you with the main course while you are just about starting to have the kababs.. not just that, the service can be painfully slow at times... e.g. I received the soda shikanji after waiting for 20 mins! However, if you are really into biriyanis, this place is a must visit on all counts.. their raan biriyani will transport you straight into Menaka's arms with guilty pleasure on your mind.. it's simply orgasmic! The perfectly cooked boneless mutton, and the perfectly infused smell of zafraan is hard to ignore.. one plate is enough for two unless you are visiting this place after a 2-day fast.. as far as side dishes go, i have had the gosht rogan josh (average) and the murgh irani (pretty good). The firni is good as a finisher and not overly sweet, just perfect! Only downside is the price which is on the higher side.. you only get 4 pieces of kababs for the money, 2 and 4 pieces of chicken and mutton respectively for the side dishes.. but do not expect good service here because you will likely to not get that here.. however, once you taste the biriyani, you will forgive them of the gravest sins.. had the service been half as good as the biriyani, I would visit this place once every month at least!

This place is something...i had been hearing bout this place for quiet sometime and we finally decided to visit the place last year on the 31st.. One thing that u will notice is that the place is small....really small...but the ambiance is just amazing...they've tried to give you the feel of how it is to have dined as the name suggests in the 1950s. Everything from the waiter to the heavy metal glasses to the copper thaali,its an experience. Now coming to the food, its good, you know its good when the ingredients used are good. Me and my frnds are really fond of mughlai and the food here has set a benchmark when it comes to taste. If your visiting this place try the kebabs, the mutton barra kebab is a treat not to be missed, the biryani though isn't that great because the use of rosewater is too over powering and you can  feel the bitterness of the rosewater hit the back of your throat.. Over all its an experience you shud have atleast once.

If you want to enjoy good Mughlai Lucknow-e Gharana food... you can certainly visit Oudh. The ambience is good and the service is courteous. Oudh for me does not excel in the taste... but keeps a high quality. One should definitely try Gulwati kebabs .. but since they are very rich in oil and butter.. one should also have plain paper parathas with them.. these two compliment each other very well. 3.8 would have been my rating if the provissions were there.

Having heard rave reviews about their "awadhi 

cuisine" this was my second time in oudh.While it is 

easy to locate (take the lane just beside Tamarind 

near deshopriyo park crossing)... i really have a 

issue about the waiting time here especially on the 

weekends . Honestly the 1and half hour long wait 

for that biriyani i had been fancying was quite a 

turn off in the first place . Though i cannot deny 

that i absolutely went swooning over the MUTTON 

GALAWATI KABAB and the YAKHNI BIRIYANI , i 

would seriously like to use zomato as a place to 

voice something that hugely irked me - i went there 

on a sunday with my family anticipating a fine 

dining experience - 1) we had to wait for 1 hr 45 

mins for a table and eventually got ourselves seated 

at 945 pm 2) the waiters were clearly in a rush not 

even "allowing" us to enjoy our kebabs and literally 

dumping off the main course on our plates before 

we could have finished 3) i even asked one of them 

politely that we will serve it ourselves once we are 

through the starters and then i heard another staff 

saying "sesh hoyeni to ki hoyeche diye de" -and that 

was it ! i hate to be harsh but i had to -if they are 

having people wait for such a long they should 

respect their expectations and provide an adequate 

service -when i am paying those extra bucks for my 

food and service tax i am not going to accept 

biriyani piled of on my starters- i think the 

management should spare a thought on this-may be 

they can increase their seating or train their staff 

better !

Well today was my first tryst with the Awadhi biryani at Oudh 1590,
One word that describes the place is delightful. We had to wait for half an hour the wait was worthwhile. Firstly we chose chicken Zafrani kebab.. it was a melt in the mouth experience. Then it was the turn of Awadhi handi biryani, which was a great treat for my taste buds, neither too heavy nor too bland..just perfect!  happy from within, a true biryani lovers 'mecca'. Then it was Nehari khas..the name tells it all. 'Khas'
was my experience. Although I'm not a connoisseur but I think it was Awadhi delicacy at its zenith. Lastly had Shahi tukra, which was a cherry on top of our "Shahi lunch".....  Finally I should mention about the ambiance and the courtesy of the employees which was touching.  I definitely recommend this place and surely I will visit again.

We went to Oudh with family on my mother's birthday... The birthday treat went just perfect with awesome food, good environment and services. Its a Mughlai concept restaurant with very good decorations inside. Coming to the main section - food... You will get the Lucknow Awadhi taste, that you are expecting. We had their specialities , Raan Biriyani, Galawati kabab, Awadhi paratha , keema... Every items were delicious. The location is also good , near Deshapriya park. But the only thing you may not like is the small space inside and so the waiting line outside. If you are going on some holidays, keep some time for waiting and it will be worthy.

Am not a avid or vociferous supporter of the Indian/Mughlai/Awadhi kind of cuisine, but for this one, I will take a recourse. I never knew meat could be cooked so tender, that a paratha could be so soft.

It was during the Biriyani festival that we planned a visit here. Located at the intersection of the lanes beside two authentic South Indian restaurants, one pure veg (The Banana Leaf) and one non-veg (Tamarind), this place provides a different taste altogether. The restaurant is snugly located in a residential area, the decors are all out of a Mughal palace, the food served on copper plated plates provide an authentic feel.

Coming to the food, its great, the meats are tender, served hot and the flavours are just fine. The biriyanis were really good. We ordered two varieties of biriyani, the mutton one being really good. The galawati kebab is to die for, minced meat balls flavoured in spices. The afghani kebab, kalmi kebab and zafrani kebab all offer a different taste. A special mention for the paratha for its softness. And the choice of sahi tukda for the dessert makes me just want to visit this place again only for this. Over all the food experience was great.

Well, of course this place is worth many more visits but then some things could still be tuned up. The staff are courteous but then at times a bit haphazard. They could be a bit more attentive and prompt. And beware of reaching this place in a large group, their seating is congested to be true. With it being a week day dinner the place was teeming with people trying to get a seat, and a large group hampers your chances adversely and being congested, the privacy and peace is affected. The lighting could be a bit more bright as well.

Overall the food just takes away the minuses, at least on my visit it did. I would surely recommend a visit, with the galawati kebab and sahi tukda being a must try. Happy eating!!

Had ordered for home delivery at Oudh.. One word tht I can say is rubbish shit food... Don't know why did I opt for food from OUDH... To start with their so called speciality stater" Galawati kebab "...the name says it all.. Gala hua kebab , sour n not well made.. No dip to accompany it n the salad that I got was stale onions...
The main course:-  paneer Qorma- I asked the person taking my order over the phone as to if this dish was spicy or not n he himself said " if u need spicy go for paneer Qorma..." N wht i recievd waz bland paneer...
Shahi dal :- it should b garnishesh with a dash of cream n butter... But u got to trust me it was filled with a bowl a big bowl of oil( whtever it is butter or cream)... I removed tht oil n still oil was pouring out...
The only thing which we could eat rather edible was subz makhan masala... Thank God.. 
Breads:- had ordered for butter naan... Which was ok... And
Lucknowi paratha... Again disapointed coz it was under cooked... Not well roasted n kaccha... 
Last but not the least.... We three i.e me my husband n my 3 yrs old had to sleep eating a portion of veg biryani... With nothing to accomplish it....
It's a criminal waste of money n it's like murdering ur taste glands...
Highly disappointed....

Oudh... The name itself brings the sight of exotically serene awadhi biryanis & kababs & payas and sharbats...
So how can I not be tempted with the word 'Oudh' the restaurant in Kolkata...???
Ah...!!!
What an interior... The moment I stepped in the restaurant, I felt like I am shooting for Jodha Akbar... ;) It actually gave me that feeling... Plates, glasses were of brass. It was an authentic place to have the moghlai dishes... Really???
No!!! Not at all!!!
A complete waste of money and time. I would have gone to some museum or library in order to feel the Mughals. Why have I come to a restaurant??? For the most important reason is "Foooooood", & the real Facttttt is it's pathetic there. Afghani kabab, or some parda biryani... Not a pinch in one's pocket but a hammer on the head, the price of those items were supremely high. It's a no no restaurant. I don't understand why the biryanis so greasy and full of curry. Half cooked and spice less kabab... Confused waiters!!!
Never on my list anymore.

Thank You

Oudh 1590 - the name itself brings up sublime images of everything royal with a subtle hint of Hindustani Classical music in the backdrop. The slightest passing whiff from one of their kitchens would give away the presence of a delicate aroma emanating from an all-Awadhi fare, made with love from a land far far away. No wonder we were famished to the core when we finally set foot inside their hallowed restaurant. 

Waiting outside this place for a seat on the second last night of the year was simply treacherous to begin with. Every time the door was left ajar, the night air would be filled with the rich fragrance of ghee, spices and rosewater, making my tummy rumble even harder.  

Oudh is a pretty place with a moderate seating capacity. The décor is in full sync with the theme of the place. The waiters were extremely well behaved, friendly and clearly knew the food that they serve. 

Our orders comprised of Chicken Zafrani Kebab, Galouti Kebab, Lucknowi Paratha, Raan biryani, Chicken Pardah biryani and Gosht Shahi Qorma. Both the kebabs, when teamed with the soft Lucknowi parathas, tasted AMAZING. The parathas which are typically made on an inverted tawa, had a superb melt in your mouth texture with a charred flavor. Individually, the chicken zafrani kebab based on a white sauce had a perfectly balanced taste but the galouti kebab was a bit too salty. The biryani arrived in earthen pots, covered with flour dough and foil. The first spoon of the lavishly made biryani proved why Lucknow is known so much for its food. The raan biryani had the leg portion of goat’s meat and was spicier than the chicken biryani.  Both of the biryanis were deliciously ghee-laden to the core - clearly not for the weak hearted. The mutton qorma however was the best I’ve ever had. Even after the few pieces of meat had vanished, we didn’t hesitate to wipe off the gravy with the parathas. This dish is HIGHLY recommended. 

I only felt that the quantity could be increased a bit, given the price they charge for every dish. Everything else over here deserves to be applauded again and again.

Oudh 1590- Indian cuisine doesn't get better than this. It may not be a very spacious restaurant and yes, unfortunately you dont get to pre-book a table here..so you might find yourself waiting in a long queue for 30 minutes on weekends or having to share a table with a couple of strangers 'cause the smell of biriyani was too much on your patience. The place itself has a very royal ambience with its grand interiors, beautiful paintings and chandeliers which gives it a feel of a palatial dining room. Now coming to the food, the proportions are quite generous and the taste will leave you hungry for more. The Galawati Kabab especially, with its blend of rich tastes melts in your mouth and the chicken tandoori here is unparalleled. However, their famously recommended Rann Biriyani turned out to be a disappointment as it was a tad bit salty. The Murgh Irani though, was absolutely fabulous. We finished off with a classic Phirni, an all time favourite. The prices are very reasonable and the service is impeccable. I am already looking forward to my next date with this place.

Oudh 1590, wid d name we went, thought it would b different & yes it was. All together a classic mughal fell & ambience. Right out it ill give u different perspective of a Restraunt.  To starts with we went there after following d review at zomato. Lost twice in search of restro. Wen reached greeted warmly. We were told that ours will b last order as some board meeting will take place. And from there it lacked in service. Biryani were served in handi  tasted yum, the kabab were just too gud. There tandoori chicken got a added flavour , which was really gud. But mutton were a bit under cooked . worst part was the there is no cold drink :( . over it was a decent time spend Worth second visit but better place for mughlai dishes are there.

Had to wait one n half hour to get the luxury of sitting inside. But as "sabar ka fal mitha hota hain", witnessed one of the finest cuisines so far. From biryanies to the variety of dishes, felt every distinct taste. The only Regret was our wait for the famous "shaahi tukra" continued as we missed out on it again.Interiors were artistic and justified the tag "period dining experience".

Absolutely phenomenal food. We ordered Mutton galouti kababs, Chicken Afghani and Raan Biryani. Have never had better biryani.  Very good service. The only minus point was the music.  They were playing  Begum Akhtar which is not something I would I would like to listen to while having lunch.  Some nice soft Indian instrumental music would have been better.

Had to wait for at least 40 mins To get a table. Have ordered Badam Sarbat, Mutton Galoti Kabab, Ck. Zafrani Kabab, Mutton Ran Biriyani & Newri Khaas. The Galoti kababs had melt in the plate itself before it reached my mouth. It was very deformative . Zafrani Kababs are so so. I found Reshmi kababs are much better in Arsalan or Aminia than this compared to cost and taste. Now the Biriyani , I would say I never had such Biriyani. It was awsum and so was the Newark khaas. Overall over hyped yet some goodness.

People often calls me a man who only reviews Biryanis. Now that is what I love to eat and that is what I have learnt over many years. I have tasted Biryanis in almost all the places including the footpaths near dalhousi. I have a very simple logic to describe a good Biryani - Good quality of Rice (long grains) and nicely cooked Mutton as I don't consider Chicken Biryani as Biryani. 
I know the owners of Oudh runs Chowman but that doesn't mean you will use the same rice to make Biryanis. Man.. this is an art. Making Biryanis with those small grains of rice is an insult to Biryani. This is rediculous to see so many so called great foodies have recommended your Biryani. And on top of that the pirce - oooffff!! I totally understand that you need to cover your investment soon. But that doesn't support this unreasonable pricing. 
And another important piece of information : Please keep a disclaimer somewhere saying you stop taking orders after 3.30 pm. Your people came to us and told us to place the order quickly as they will not accept any orders after 3.30. You may be a big name in Chinese but you have miles to go before you establish yourself as a biryani joint. Spend some quality time in your food than publicity. I am sure that will help. 
I am not mentioning the chicken side dish. It is boiled chicken mixed into a gravy. I know all the restaurants prepare it in the similar fashion. But this is not acceptable. Check the photos of a Chicken Biryani. After being disappointed with their mutton biryani, I thought of tasting their chicken biryani as well.. and equally got disappointed. 
Common..Oudh not everyone will get deceived by the sheer decorations.

We finally decided to visit the place after reading so many reviews. We have ordered

 1. Galawati Kabab --- test - Average: Price - Bit high, But suggested to try it as it comes with little different test.

2. Ran Biryani -- Test - Most delicious item, Biryani made with selected mutton (ran portion), One plate is enough for Two people and I suggested every one to try this. Price - As one plate is enough for two people and comes with selected part, the price is not so high. I really enjoy the biryani and comes again and again to test this item.

3. Shahi Tukra --  Test - Deliciou, I first time try this item and it is awesome. 
Price - Ok!

I want to comes again for Ran Biryani and Shahi Tukra, Ambience is like inside Maharaja Palace, with copper spoon, heavy build metal plates and glasses and serve with warm reception. If any one have little high budget, I suggested to never miss the place. You can feel like a 'Raja' inside the place.

Cost - Approx 500 - 900 per person including vat (as on 15.03.2015)

Correctly featured in brilliant biryanis in zomato. The awadhi biryanis are really brilliant here. Try the raan biryani, one of the best in Kolkata. The ambience too goes with the food. Had to wait in queue for around 40 mins to get in on a saturday afternoon, such is the popularity now. Another outlet is a must in north Kolkata for people from the northern part of the city. 

Really liked the presentation too. The biryanis are served in earthen pots. The take away biryanis are also served and packed in earthen pots. This is really unique.

We have heard about this Restaurant even before visiting the country. Hence it was a must go for us when we visited Kolkata. And we were definitely not disappointed !! But mind it that before you reach the food you have to face queue for a minimum 45 mins. It can stretch upto 1 hour !! And they do not take any reservations as this joint only has got 10 tables. I hope the next time we visit there will be a bigger place. Or another option is to go there at 6.30pm so that you avoid the queue !Now coming back to the food & service - Once inside the waiters are all attentive & suggest dishes which is so helpful. We had few kebabs & all were outstanding. It makes you go back again & again!! Kalmi & gelawati kebabs stood out for us. We did not get to taste Raan biriyani but had Awadi Handi Biriyani. This was truly special. Fantastic to say the least. Next time we will definitely try to have Raan Biriyani. However Murgh Purdah  Biriyani was a disappointment as it had peppers on it which is not so palatable. We were too full for desert but still tried to order Shahi Tukda but that was finished too!! Shame.Will definitely visit when in town.

First of all, Oudh 1590 takes you back to the history and the culture of the mughal age and makes you feel as if you are from the mughal era. The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are extremely helpful in choosing  the perfect kababs for you if you are a first timer. The place makes one feel at home whether you visit with your family or your friends. Secondly, the food is excellent and well served. The Gulati Kabab and the Lucknow e paratha are a must have to start off with things. The Biriyani is also very good and one of the best biriyanis one can find in the city in this price. Please go to the place if you are planning for a royal dinner. You will have a great time.

Good food. Galawati Kebab with Lucknowi parantha is a brilliant combination… Pretty much all kebabs are soft and succulent. For the vegetarians, I’d recommend the Dahi Kebab as a must try. Oudh is one of those places that make them well… For the main course, Gosht Biryani is the obvious choice. The portions are not too big, hence it gives you a chance to sample multiple dishes. Never tried fish, but mutton and chicken dishes are quite decent. The Nehari Khaas gravy is delicious.

The negatives? Well… Usually a long wait, both, to dine in, or for home delivery, is an off-putter… Most times their home delivery/ reservation numbers do not work (or no one picks up!). You have to diligently keep at it for some time if you really want to have food from this place.
A one-time visit, definitely. A repeat affair? Maybe not…

After getting quite few good reviews of this place I decided to take my cousins and my family for dinner . After quite a long waiting we were given a table that actually felt small for us , we kind of had to snug into . Service I found to be mediocre and behaviour of staff not very courteous. 
We had ordered galouti kebabs with ulta tawa Partha and zanfrani kebabs. Boths starters were quite tasty , specially the galouti and paratha was the finest I have tasted in kolkata. For main course it was raan biriyani and nihari gosht. The biriyani served was absolutely cold , after complaining the second servings were hot and hence tasted better . The nihari gosht was quite tasty.The desserts were probably the worst part . What was served as sahi tukda was soggy bread sandwich of rabri , and the firni wasn't exciting either. Overall above average experience . Price and quality/ quantity do justify . I plan to visit again .

When they claim to provide "Period  Dining Experience", they mean it. This place is an example of great food, great ambience. Right from the Mughal wood work and paintings to the perfect Biriyani and the light Lucknowi music, this place is sure to take you to a walk through the gallis of the Nawabs. As for the food, it is mild yet powerful. I particularly  loved the Shah Tukda and the Badam  Sharbat. No words for the Biriyani as well! Major love!

The biriyani here is not the stereotype you have everywhere and tastes awesome. The mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani, chicken chap were super yummy. The biriyani was well cooked with the perfect combination of spices and leaves you yearning for more. The shahi tukra was a royal affair!! The phirni is tasty too. In all the ambience, service and food is one of the best in Kolkata.

After their renovation gap We 3 went for lunch incl. my NRI elder s-in-law. 
    All of my friends praised a lot, so it'll save my face. We ordered Oudhi Mutton Biriyany , Galouti Kabab , Aam pana drink & lastly Firni . Biriyany was ordinary , nothing special, Galauti Kabab- spices were not well cooked,raw smell with bitter in tastes. To say the least such high price qty. Is surprisingly quite less. Fish tikka Kabab ( better than these lots, qty. Less as usual, as per such high price.) It is a hype people created.  Ambience is darkish & very stuffy. Very small for a reasonable family. No point in going there 2nd. Time in addition to this very reserve type waiter doesn't help us to go for more good dishes. Their Earthen Pot Service of Biriyany looks good outwardly but you get less Qty. How very disgusting !

When one comes across a restaurant name that has a connection with the age old nawabi era of India, all one wants to do is have a kebab experience there. 

As I entered, I was awed by the ambience. Very smooth but royalty in expression. A must try for kebab connoisseurs.

Though their Zafrani Kebab is succulent but their Afghani kebab transcends. Loved it!

It is good food and worthy of payment.

The interiors were just amazing. The staffs were very friendly and really helped us with the ordering. The Biriyani was good. But i didn't liked the taste of capsicum in the biriyani. The chicken side dish and kababs were good. Dessert 'Shahi-Tukra' is the showstopper. After having food at this restaurant i can say that i prefer the kolkata styled biriyani more but i would only go back to this place only for the dessert ~ 'Shahi-Tukra' ...

Oudh can definitely boast of its decor; an awesome place with authentic north indian dishes and some fantastic varieties of biriyani  they offered during the biriyani festival that was going on then. Galawati kabab with paratha is a must and I must mention the badam sarbat which one should order everytime he/she visits the restaurant.

A restaurant which spends money to ensure its washroom and acs also look d part of authentic awadh doesn't need my approval. It has become my favorite avadhi/muglai place (my earlier fav was Karims, Jama Masjid). 
The gawlati kebab was almost as good as Lucknow's famous Tundey Kebab. It jus melts in d mouth and with their famous ulte tawe ka paratha it goes to a diff level.
Zafrani kebab had tat amazing smell and sweetness of zafran (saffron), chicken was soft and wonderful.
Since I went went with two hard core kaali daal lovers had to order daal and it was simply amazing. Not loaded wid cream and butter but with amazing spices and the veg kofta was the best. Even though I am not a kofta fan I couldn't stop myself from taking a 2nd helping.
Service was amazing and the servers were courteous.

It's a nice little place tucked away in a quiet corner, the decor is modest and the staff courteous & polite.
Their cutlery is a bit dull and so are the tables which gives a very second hand feel but as far as the food is concerned it's really good or at least  can be.
We ordered chicken seekh kebabs which were soft and succulent, dal makhani where the rajma was undercooked, butter nun which was very nice and of course the much talked about mutton biriyani again which is of admirable standard but then the potato was undercooked as well. We did mention about the rajma being undercooked, to which one of the staff just said "ummm okay" and left to fetch the bill! Which was quite funny. 
Rash Behari Avenue has hardly any good Mughlai restaurants to boast about, so this one compared to the rest is pretty good but definitely can be better.

It was a Saturday afternoon after a long search of this particular restaurant i finally managed to find this restaurant. It is located inside very awkward alley, besides "TAMARIND”, Deshapriya Park branch.

So I reached there with an almost empty stomach and luckily got a seat instantly on that holiday. The interior of the restaurant was full of antique decoration from the fresco to the wall hangings .Specially the lucknow gharana music, Thumri, Toppa songs and music of Shenai will bring the mood of real lucknow gharana food. 

The waiters were very courteous and helped me out to get their best dishes.

So i ordered Mutton Galwati Kebab with Lucknow Paratha as starters.There were 4 big pics of the Kebab and the one Lucknow paratha is enough for me(For any normal people one kebab is and one paratha is enough)

Next i moved on to the main dishes and ordered Murgh Irani with Rann Biriyani.

I must say The Biriyani was superb (One thing I must say the Amount of Biriyani in one handi is sufficient for Two normal people so guys be careful while ordering).It was the Best Biriyani i have ever been tasted in Kolkata.But the Murg Irani was a disappointing. The Chicken is well cooked but the Spices are not well mixed and the sweetness of the coconut milk was coming front instead of the actual masala flavor.

So over all experience was good and the restaurant was Cost effective.

The place is awesome and did meet my expectations, in fact, its was worth waiting for more than any hour to grab a table...the place is small and cosy designed with perfections to give a nawabi experience while dining along with beautiful music playing in the background.
For starters,One must try Galauti kebabs with lucknowi paranthas.They are simply delicious...Well,the awadhi handi biryani(for which the place is known for) is a dish that no other restaurant can match with it but if want to have kolkata  style biryani over there I would say arsalan would be a better choice for that...
Not only they do excel in biryani of oudhi style their side dishes are too deserves complement.....To end with kesari firni can a delight especially when the waiters are so courteous nd eager to provide you the best service they came along with some delicious suggestions.......
Well,the one and only negative side I would like to point for this place is the  waiting time due to seat constraints.

Near Deshapriya Park..

Must have = 
Drinks - Badam Sharbat 
Starter - Galauti Kebab (suggestion ,have it with paratha)

In main course you have various option in chicken and mutton along with Roti,Paratha,Nan etc .....or else you can also opt for various types of Biryani,which they will serve in clay pot.
The staffs are friendly and courteous but the restaurant is very cramped. 
The interiors of the restaurant will give you a feeling of SAHI GHARANA......
Lastly have a look at their DARWAN....MUCHHEY HO TO NATHHURAM JI JASEY....(when you will visit this place you will agree with my last  statement )

Its a small cosy place which during busy hours can feel very overwhelming. However the anticipation of this place was sky high but unfortunately could not meet our expectations. Sadly none of the items left behind its taste, for starters we ordered the kalmi and galawati the second was so soft that it wud fall apart even before it reached our plates. For main course we ordered chicken irani, nihari, and mutton and chicken biriyanis. Of all these chicken irani managed to stand out. The lucknowi parathas are a must try. Long way to work on making the tastes distinctive considering the price being charged.

Interiors are mesmerizing, I feel like a king of mughal period. The food and the decoration is just spellbinding. Every foodie should visit this place. Though the prices are little high but once you be here you will realize its worth every penny. I recommend each and every foodie to visit once.

On a sultry sunday noon, we went there to have lunch. We had Chicken Tandoori and Murg Pardah Biriyani. The Chicken Tandoori was the juiciest one that I have ever had. With the accompanying dips( a pudina/dahi chatni) , the succulent Chicken Pieces tasted heavenly. It bore the rendering taste of all the spices and marination that it had been subjected to. The Murg pardah biriyani was another beauty. We could not miss the subtle aroma of pure ghee in it. Mildly spiced and with no scent/keora-water being used, it tasted miles apart from the Kolkata's famous Biriyanis(Arsalan, Siraz, Aminia et al.). The biriyani had two solid succulent chicken pieces and the rice was just enough for two of us. The food was so good that it made us forget the half an hour ordeal of waiting in scorching heat.

To sum up my overall experience here, I can say Oudh 1590 is unique in every possible way . Although the price here, is a bit steep but the quantity of the food and a charming ambience can well make up for that. 

This place is worth visiting again and again and is highly recommended.

Been here yesterday with my buddies. Spellbound, overwhelmed. We started with mutton galwati kabab, mutton kakori kabab & fish zafrani kabab. Muttons were melted inside our mouths... Fish was as soft as 'sondesh'.
Yakhni gosht biriyani, shahi paya biriyani & mutton nehari khaas were ordered for mains. Yakhni gosht biriyani is the best biriyani I have ever had in the city. So tasty, so delicious, I am running out of words..
Badam sarbat, aam khas & firni to wrap up. Badam sarbat was the best amongst all I had yesterday. Overall the nawabi ambience was superb... And food was just awe...... But the mustache of the darwan is not real, I bet :P Love u Oudh :D

Should be identified as a place serving one of the best Afghani dishes in Kolkata. Mesmerizing ambiance with soulful tunes of Mujras and a well maintained Nawabi decor. They just excel in Firni, Qalmi kabab and Awadhi Biriyani with all of them served in time. A suitable dine destination providing a universal atmosphere allthrough.

One of the best restaurant opened in the last 2 years.......Nice ambiance and great food......Parantha, Kebabs & Moti Biryani is a must try.......however they need to seriously increase the seating capacity as the waiting time on weekend is not less than 1 hr....

Whenever i craved biryani, my choice was quite unidirectional. Well not any more. Oudh 1590 has brought the authentic nawabi biryanis to our city and has done a marvelous job at that. Have been hearing about it a lot, and so finally landed there for dinner on a Saturday night. Well finding the restaurant can be a bit of work, but not very difficult. Coming to the restaurant, it is advisable that prior reservation is made, as the place is quite small and waiting period can be up to a whooping 1 hour(as it was in our case). But once inside you forget the agony of the long wait. The decor is simply amazing and authentic. coming down to the most important part, food. We ordered Kakori kabab, Qalmi kabab, Shammi kabab, Rann Biryani and Murgh Pardah biryani. The Rann biryani is simply awesome. I have never had anything like that, and i have had a lot of different biryanis. It is a different class altogether, a must have for anyone who visits. As far as the kababs were concerned, the qalmi kabab was good, but the renowned kakori kabab could have done with a little less spices. Shammikababs were nice too. We were a bit disappointed as they had stopped serving the badam sharbat. As for dessert, we ordered the shahi tukda, and it definitely deserves special mention. It just melts in your mouth, was so good that my sister couldn't actually believe that the base was bread.All in all, a very wonderful experiance.P.S-Check out the moustache on the doorman..:-)

“If it's Awadhi it has to be Oudh 1590..”It was my birthday treat from my parents. After a lot of research we decided Oudh 1590. It is located just opposite to Carmel junior school and could be easily located. Also parking wasnt a problem as it is located a little away from the main road. We were astonished to see the security guard who had a moustache matching to the era of Nawabs It was a little problem as we entered the restaurant as it was low lit and the entrance were not spacious enough. Also the tables are so closely placed so that there were little space in between.The decor was really nice and even the ac machine was given a brown touch to match the interiors.We ordered mutton galawti kebab and qalmi kebab. The server suggested we should have lucknawi paratha with the galawti kebab. Trust me it was heavenly! Having kebabs sitting in such a beautiful wooden decor with ghazals playing in background was truely mesmerising.In the main course we had pulao accompanied with murgh irani and mutton nehari khas. All were well cooked. But i however had liked the starter more. Next i wanted to order shahi tukra but i was told that it was not available. We had firni and soda shikanji. The average cost for each person was around INR 600 but it matched the quality of food served.Only thing for improvement is they can increase the space a bit more and service was a little slow when there was a rush. It can be made faster. Otherwise it bags a 5 star from me..

The decor is lovely.The interiors blend with the lucknowee music giving you a rich nawabi feel. We ordered their signature dishes..starting with galawati kabab coupled with lucknowi parathas.The kababs melted in the mouth.It had exceptional taste and texture.Next was Rann Biriyani which was not as good as anticipated.Naushijaan serves you much better biriyanis.However the Nehar-e-khaas was different..it did taste awesome.Finally we ordered shaahi tukda which stole the show..dinner would have been incomplete without that.It needs to be mentioned that every item were served in impressive quantities.Overall satisfactory experience.

Arguably the best biriyani served in Kolkata... Loved their rann biriyani served in earthen pots.. mesmerizing... same goes for nehari khaas and galouti kebab..Could not give 5 out of 5 for one disadvantage they have... Space..had to stand in queues for nearly 2 hours to get a seat...

Oudh 1590 - The awadhi and Mughlai delicacy!
=====
Location and Intro: It is located on the lane behind the famous restaurant 'Tamarind' on the sarat bose road. Oudh had been on my wish list for quite a long time and i really want to try this restaurant as i wanted to try a pure mughlai/awadhi food. As you reach this place, there is a small shop attached to it called the Banarasi Paan which is well made to keep in par with the Oudh so that it does not look a bit different. There is a man with a really amazing style moustache on the main gate who greets you. Last time i came here, i had to disappointingly leave seeing the cue. However, on 22.02.2015 i.e. this sunday, i somehow managed to get a place in the afternoon. 

When i entered the restaurant, the ambience really mesmerised me. However, it was quite dim. I probably though a bit of light would be a little better. Nevertheless, this place had a really good vibe to it. All the tables were filled as in Kolkata, we all know that people are crazy about mughlai food specially the non vegetarians. I really liked the ceiling's which were decorated with hanging lights and the waiters well quite dressed to serve to us customers. However, i probably felt that waiter's could be more polite and more courteous towards the customer and not just serve them for serving. If a person is genuinely courteous, it shows up on the face. Nevertheless, we continued with our order.  

The a la carte had a lot of servings. It was really nicely designed. 
=====
Food ordered: 

1) Veg Sheekh Kebab - The kebab was not at all good. I mean for the vegetarians specially. However, it was well presented with onions. It tasted really pathetic. 

2) Chicken Tandoori (half) - The BEST Tandoori I EVER HAD. Believe me. It was so succulent, hot and mouth melting that even words fail to describe it. Perfectly basted with mustard oil. The masala's had perfectly seeped in inside. However, as the lights were dim, i could still make out the oil content. #HIGHLYRECOMMENDED #MUSTTRY

3) Shahi Daal - The daal was yummy and very creamy. #musttryforvegans
4) Tandoori Roti - The roti was a bit thick. I would love it if they make it a bit more thin. 
5) Roomali Roti - It was well ok.
6) Firni - It was amazing. #asignaturedessert #mouthmelting #cold  
=====
Pros:
1) Location is a win win.
2) Food is delish.
3) Hygiene is maintained.
4) Quality of preparation could be measured with taste. Really good quality food.
5) Ambience was too good. However, a bit more light could do wonders.
6) A paradise for the non vegetarians.

Cons:
1) I did not personally like the veg sheekh kebab. I would further look into other vegetarian snacks when i visit next time and review about the same then. 
2) The waiters and staffs could be more courteous towards the customers. 
=====
Suggestions:
1) Lighting should be a bit more. 
2) Hospitality needs a bit of improvement.
3) Continue with food consistency. Keep serving hot. 
=====
Summary:
Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4.2/5
Taste 4.6/5 (Specially tandoori chicken) 
Hygiene 4.5/5
Value for money 3.9/5
Hospitality 3.6/5
=====
Meal for two: 800-1300 max
=====
Conclusion: I would LOVE to visit it again in the near future and try their special biriyanis. I was too full with this only. My bill came to somewhat around 800. We finished and washed our hands with the bowl containing lemon wedge and rose petal. It is a perfect place to dine in with family, friends or you know. :P :) 
=====
Special Recommendation: Don't miss the tandoori chicken. It's too good. 
=====
Note: Unbiased review on my dining experience.
* Pardon for the duplicate pictures. Something wrong with the zomato page. can't upload menu pictures. Shall be rectified shortly.
=====
29.05.2015 - Recently, i visited oudh with family. Ordered:

1) Fish Zafrani Kebab - It was bhetki. At first, i found a piece of small sharp bone in Bhetki which is unusual and also it was served cold. They immediately changed it with no questions asked and served us again with their special masala onions. It was good enough. 

2) Chicken Kassa - It was one of the BEST main course item. It had onion fried. The only issue it had was the oil. I wanted to bring it to the notice of the management to make the pieces to 4 and not just 2 big pieces.  #musttry 

3) Chicken Irani - It was good too. It came in subtle gravy of cashew nut and cream. Was simple and did not had much oil content as the kassa. #musttry

4) Shahi Daal - As usual ordered again. It was good too. Creamy and mouth melting. 

5) Mix Veg - It was superb. The gravy had vegetables perfectly sauted in it and was really mixed well. #Reallygoodforvegetarians.

6) Chicken Purdah Biriyani - This was one of the best awadhi biriyani i had ever had and trust me i ain't joking. It came in the handi and had enough pieces of chicken. Good for two people. Tasted simply SUPERB. #musttry
=====
13 July' 2015 - Visit Oudh 1590 Again with one of my fried. What i tried: 

1) Kakori Kebab - Soft, minced mutton seekh in their own awadhi style with very different taste to it. Loved the preparation even though i am not a big fan of mutton.

2) Chicken Purdah Biriyani - It was served a bit cold. However, it was good.

3) Shahi Tukda - It was superb!! Soft and mouth melting. 

Preparations at oudh are quality food. Really good. Must try place for mughlai food lovers.

The tag of the restaurant "period dinning experience" goes well with the interior, waiter appearance, and off course with the delicious food. I and my family ordered shahi tangri kebab, awadhi sugandhi mahi (bhetki kabab) in starter, then we had that famous galawati kabab with Lucknow paratha, then raan biriyani with nehari khaas and Pudina juice(mocktail). Food was awesome, tasty! I think I had taste the tastiest biriyani in my life... arsalaan, shiraz are just brand but I must say try this biriyani! More than yummy! But that Pudina juice was just like mouth freshner.eww!

After hearing so much, today finally I could visit this place.
Well the interior, music and the outfits of the staffs just suited the name. 
We ordered Galawati kebab along with Lucknowi paratha(suggested by them) at first. The kebab was really soft,well cooked and delicious. 
For the main course we opted for Ran biriyani with Nehari khaas. The biriyani was served in a earthen pot. It was basically a biriyani having shredded mutton and lots of rice (more than enough for two).
Nehari khaas was basically the bone marrow of mutton came with a very very tasty gravy.
Shahi tukda was our choice for dessert which really proved good.
The one thing which really impressed me is their 'wash bowl' hot water,'gandharaj' lemon and rose petal:D
P.S. Do try the mitha pan just outside the resturent :)

No words can describe the beauty of the food served here. The lavish taste would simply make you forgive them that you were made to wait outside to get a table for yourself when they call out your name.
The ambience is very classic reminding you of the old lucknow era. Classical music. Dark interiors. Well mannered waiters.
We ordered for lucknowi parathas with mutton galawati kebabs. That was served hot with unlimited supply of three varieties of chutneys. We ordered nargisi khaas which is mutton cooked in wonder spices with mutton Biriyani.
It was worth an experience.
Lajawab.
I shall try each of its items in the future. Fingers crossed.

After reading my review some of you might think, I don't know my North Indian food or Awadhi Biriyani. Well I would say to you guys I have had meals at quiet a few good restaurants in Delhi, Gurgaon, Jaipur and Chandigarh. And my experience at the over hyped Oudh was not even close to them.

I would site the following reasons:
1-The hospitality was below par at best. 3 of us were waiting to get a table and a 6 seater was available with no particular reservation. The maitre d told and I am quoting him, "10 min is no biggie. aap 10 min khade ho gaye toh kya hua, log 2-3 ghante wait karte hain line main."

2-Probably it was a bad hair day for the chef or I just picked the chef's weak suit when I ordered Galawati Kabab, Brain Masala and Raan biriyani.

3- The place was hot and congested. But we had to tell the witer 4-5 times before he switched on the AC.

All in all disappointing experience. Maybe you guys will have a better experience, but for me it would be a one time affair.

Always wanted to visit this place atlast it was on Rose Day. The ambience is super cool, felt trully like the lucknow nabab.The food was super tasty, specially the mutton pieces inside the Rann Biriyani, just melted in my mouth. The quantity was such that a plate of biriyani could be shared by two people easily. The only place I visited which served Raita along with the Biriyani. A must go place for every biriyani lover.

Service- great. fast and efficient!
Value- totally decent for the food.
Usp- the ambience the food and the overall feeling of eating there
The shahi tukra!
Quality- everything was tasty and hot!
I ordered the awadhi biryani they gave ample pieces of mutton! The luckhnawi parathas were all light as air! The icing on the cake was the shahi tukra which was just too good to be true! I ate 3!!

I've been to Karim's (jams masjid) in Delhi many times and can say Oudh serves biriyanis as good as theirs. Definitely a must visit for Biryani lovers. :)

Ambience was great , nice decor with pictures and all. A quite place , appropriate for a family eat out or friends .
Now for the food , it was in a way i didn't expect (in a good way i mean). Ordered two types of kababs, roomali roti(the roti was quite thin and very good)and two types of biriyani one was rann biriyani and the other was awadhi handi biriyani. Well the kababs melted in my mouth and the rotis were nice. Now, the two biriyani's were of opposite polarity, by that i mean the rann had a mild familiar aroma of kesar(but not too strong) it was light to taste . The awadi biriyani was a little spicy ( for people who like spicy biriyani) the mutton were shredded and mixed with the rice , it also had  a strong aroma(little strong for me). In the end we had shahi tukra , it was also delicious but couldn't eat it all as we were too full (still regret it ).
Prices vary with the items. Quantity of kababs and roti is like 4 kababs aand 2-3 rotis per plate.  The amount of biriyani was good(that's why we couldn't have our dessert). 

Its a small homely place nice ambience , there a guard with a big thick mustache to open the gate for you, great place to visit with family and girlfriend(for the women  who love biriyani :D)

Galawati kabab was perfect, soft juicy & tender & Lucknowi paratha is the perfect accompaniment for it.Had ordered for Awadhi handi Biriyani, Rann Biriyani,Nihari khaas & Murg Irani for the main course.The Awadhi handi Biriyani tastes superb 7 it & along with chicken it also has eggs.(Bongs have to mention if the Biriyani has an egg added to it..;)) .Murg irani was a bit disappointing because the quantity served was too little.For the dessert went for Gajar ka Halwa, it was heavenly.

Ambience is good wood decorations and located in a good place and good surroundings.
Menu card doesn't have much items so don't be suprised to see it probably one page.
Now i tried most dishes some kababs are really nice and tasty less spicy well cooked soft really amazing and some are tasteless like afgani tikka but you can try who knows you might like it.
Now biryani column has great varieties to offer you different types of biryani you can try any one of them it is tasty and delicious all served in a different way.
Now this restaurant is not for all people the kababs tikka biryani are all priced high if you are 4 people expect a bill around 2500 or more.
This restaurant is small and not much tables.
Quantity of kababs and tikka is less you get around four pieces for such highly priced dishes.
Main course dishes are good, gravy items are yum yum.
End conclusion it is good to try out food is different and not value for money you can say but value for taste and good taste is really what is offers us.
Recommended with family and girlfriends.
If like my comment or review  do give a like .

Well, yesterday was my second visit at this lovely outlet beside Desapriya Park. We went there at around 9 PM for dinner and we were being courteously informed to wait for about 1 to 1.5 hours. Since it was my second visit, so I was not keen on waiting there, however my brother and some other members of my family insisted all of us to wait to have an experience of this place. So we all agreed to wait, until 10.20 PM, we could enter inside the outlet. We were given a comfortable place deep inside.
So what I experienced after the entrance is described in the various parameters mentioned below :

1. AMBIENCE & DECOR - No need to mentioned how the decor of Oudh is, as the outlet speaks for itself ! A lavish Mughal styled decor with precise wood works all around the walls and furniture. The curtlery were all brass made and suited their concept of "Period dining" very well. Ambiance was also nice and the tables mostly comprised of families. Moreover, the background music of Lucknowi gharana gives an added touch to the period you had already flown into by the time you had settled in this magical place called Oudh 1590.

2. FOOD - Coming to the food, we ordered Galawati Kebab, which was the best I ever had in Kolkata. It is synonymous to the Tunday Kebabs of Lucknow and Aminabad. I simply loved it having with the Lucknowi paratha which complimented it very well. However, the Sugandhi Kebab though being nicely cooked, failed to evoke the flavor of Kaafir lime that it was supposed to be. Coming to the Mutton Awadhi Biriyani, the rice was nice and had proper flavors. However, the Mutton was harder than expected and was not a melt in the mouth stuff. Among the side dishes, we ordered Mutton Kundan Kaliya which was awsome, with a unique taste and the mutton pieces were succulent and juicy. We also ordered Chicken Kassa which came with 2 pieces per place. The pieces were large and satisfactory. However the taste was disappointing to me as I didn't expect a sour punch in a dish as traditional as Kassa. It could have been given some other name if that was how they intended to prepare. Coming to the desserts, we ordered Firni and Kulfi falooda, in which Firni was horribly sweet to my standards and Kulfi was too ordinary for a place like Oudh. 

3. SERVICE - Service was okayish with the attendants having decent behaviour and carried a smile throughout the evening which added to my experience. The price seemed okay to the outlet's standards and hence I dont have any complains on that front.

All in all, the place having one of the mammoth fame in the Kolkata food retail world, needs to boost up to the point  of culinary excellence which they used to possess, as food lovers like me can distinctly differentiate between their delivery during the first few months of the enterprise vs the current delivery. So, buck up guys. Long way to go !

Excellent value for money, beautiful ambience. Went there on a non-eventful Saturday, had to wait for 45 minutes to get a seat. This denotes how popular the restaurant already is, despite it being new. Had rumali roti & murgh kassa. Too good food, loved it. Would love to come back to have fine dining here everytime I come to Kolkata.
No wifi is available here, as mentioned in Oudh 1590's page on Zomato.
Gave 3.5/5 stars because the attitude od the waiters were on the arrogant side. Didn't like the taste of the biryani at all. Not accustomed to having biryani with bell peppers & capsicum in it.

'Oudh 1590' is my favourite Awadhi restauarnt in kolkata.It is located at Desapriya Park road near Desapriya park.The ambiance of this restaurant is very attractive.All decoration made with wooden.The ambiance is the lucknowi style.Waiters are also nawabi dress.They are well behaved & polite.Food quality is great.I've visited here with my friends & lover.Atfirst we ordered Chicken Qalmi Kebab.This is the leg pieces of chicken frilled in creamy sauce.This tastes delicious.Then we ordered Awadhi Handi Biryani,Moti Biryani,Murgh Irani,Gosht Shahi Qorma,Lucknowi Paratha & Laccha Paratha.Moti Biryani is just outstanding.I loved it so much.Murgh Irani is just awesome.service is fast.price is medium expensive.A tasty benarasi pan shop is outside of this restaurant.Don't miss it.

Splendid Awadhi dishes, specially Galawati kabab, Kakori Kabab & Nargisi Kofta. The biriyani is also fabulous. And needless to mention, the place & its interior decoration, simply Woooow!!!! Overall, a place worth spending.

Oudh 1590 offers a variety of biriyanis and kebabs unlike the Kolkata biriyanis of famous arsalan or shiraz. The place is a bit costlier and the usp is the environment of serving food in the background of Mughal era and hence the wooden interiors and the utensils of heavy metals along with the dim lighted and various raga based background scores takes you to the same age and make you feel sitting at some Royal Palace dining.

The noticeable part is the friendly and assisting nature of the attendants who often help you choosing the right option from the heavy weighted menu card although the list is not too long and choices are limited. The place is cozy and privacy can be maintained thoroughly but one will definitely find the less number of seating arrangements which creates a long queue waited at the outside and at times that can be of hours.

We tried chicken zafrani kebab and the tenderness of the chicken and the flavour of the zafran makes it so different. The Galawati kebab with lucknowi paratha is recommended and it was yummy. We also tried the delicacies of Rann biriyani along with Mutton Nehari Khaas, I definitely liked the biriyani which can be no way compared with the typical Kolkata Biriyani as they dont put Potato or strong aroma of keora water. The small pieces of mutton is all over in the ice portion and the rice is so nicely cooked that, you can just keep them in your mouth and the taste of the desi ghee will sooth your tastebuds along with the aroma of the spices. The biriyani is served in an earthen pot and I wonder when I just washed my hands after eating with normal water without any soaps, there was no sticky feeling at all, it is that much light.

Definitely will come back again, but a few things need to be taken care by the management -1) The timing they maintain very strictly and that can be a problem for a person who wants to try things who stay far away from the location.
2) The location is although near to Desapriya Park, but not easy finding for first time visit.
3) The small place of seating creates long waiting which is tiresome.
4) The cost is on a bit higher side compared to the quantity.
5) The Kolkata biriyani lovers will never like the style of biriyani.
6) The deserts and drink section is pretty ordinary.

Note : I got one information that soon they will open one branch at some different location.

If you want to taste, the best Awadhi cuisine in this city, Oudh 1590 is the place for you. Finest food, thematic ambiance, and amicable service give you the feeling of quintessential Awadhi Darbar.
Oudh's wooden interior consisting of some nice paintings of Lucknowi darbar and brilliant woodwork and mild daadra and thumri goes perfectly with the thematic ambiance of awadhi gharana and gives you the feeling of dining inside the nawabi darbar. It was really delightful sitting inside the restaurant. 
Now comes the food. we ordered Raan biriyani, kakori kebab , nihari khas and Shahi tukda. 
Raan Biriyani- 4.8/5 
kakori kebab- 3.8/5 . would have been better. 
Nihari khas- 4.2/5 
Shahi tukda(Dessert) - 5/5. 
I would recommend every one to try Raan Biriyani and Shahi tukda.
Staffs are very cordial and well-behaved . 
Pocket pinch: I think reasonable, considering the quality of food they serve. 
Overall brilliant experience. I would rate- 4.5/5.

It was the awadhi magic on the christmas eve with cousins !! 
We had zafrani kabab , qalmi kabab ,  afghani kabab , galawati kabab , awadhi handi biriyani , lucknowi paratha , murgh irani & shahi tukra on our platter . 

Starting with the biriyani , 2 handis sufficient for 3 , and the taste ..... awesome ! Among the kababs , afghani was my favorite , murgh irani along with paratha was good .The best desert I ever had  'SHAHI TUKRA'  ..... one word for it - " excellent " , you won't feel it unless you have it ! 
We took home delivery , the service & delivery was steady and swift , within the time we requested . The items were well packed and hot . 
Altogether , eager to dine once more at the place .....

Visited on 25th January 2015 which wax also being celebrated as Saraswati puja and had to wait for 1hr 58mins sharp
Though they close at 3pm they extended till 4pm to take the last order
Food quality satisfactory,nothing to die for
Kolkata has tasted same and better at other eateries too
Service ok (they start to rush you towards their closing time)
Service promptness needs improvement
Galauti kebab and mahi tikka grt
But main course did not attract much
Overall ok
Will visit max once or twice for a person coming from the other end of the city
Somehow very hyped and overrated
Royal bill for 4 heads with 3 diff starters and 4 diff main course costs 3k inclosing tax and vat

Was suggested by many so one day decided to go and check it out by myself.. At a mere walking distance away from kalighat metro station. The moment you enter this place you see people roaming here and there in pathani suits and the interior also takes you to a mughal era. 
The food here is good but the mutton here is too good, the tender juicy flesh just melts in you mouth. 

The service is also good. People here are good aswell, would like to visit this place once again.

I've to say the interiors, ambience, decorum the overall look of a period dining was top notch.. The aroma of the varieties of biryanis going around the hall did get my mouth watering from the moment I laid eyes on the menu.. The quality and presentations of the dishes were real good.. but the galowti kabab was a disappointment for me though, highly recommended by others.. But really happy with the biryani as it packed a powerful punch from the first bite.. So I'd say am a satisfied customer.. But since the pricing is a bit on the higher side, I'd be a customer no doubt but a rare one here.. Also the soda sikanji was superb..

Went there on Republic day for lunch with parents with lots of hope. The food was amazing but the service was very disappointing. I called them beforehand to reserve seats but they don't have that facility. Had to wait for forty five minutes to get a seat. Rann biriyani was not available. So ordered Awadi handi biriyani, nawari khaas, rumali roti , galawati kabab and lucknowi paratha. The waiter brought the main course before the starter which created inconvenience. The galawati kabab was amazing with lucknowi paratha. It was sheer brilliance. The biriyani was the best I had in Kolkata. Way better than the iconic Arsalan . The nawari khaas was awesome but the mutton had lots of bones. The waiter brought us wrong number of rumali rotis. Except the service everything was good.. We had the firni for dinner.. It was also very good.

Went along with my partner early evening on the 20 th. This was my and our first visit to the place. 

Following are our observations in brief:

1. It was quite empty at 7 pm on a Tuesday evening. I was happy to avoid the weekend and holiday rush I had heard about from some Zomatians. I like to have my dinner in peace. 

2. The decor and the background music does seem to have an effect and makes one anticipate that good things are coming to play with the taste buds. 

3. The Galaouti kebabs as starter were really soft and were miles ahead in quality than the  ones I had the last time at Alibaba Gold. The Murgh Pardah Biriyani as main dish was something novel for both of us.  For people who swear by Arsalan Biriyani , it might take some getting used to. Murgh Pardah Biriyani is all about appreciating the flavors of the myriad differnt spices used in the preparation. The Firni as dessert  was one of the best ones we had in recent times. 

4. Our waiter was polite and knowledgeable . One thing I didn't like was that he seemed to be in undue haste to serve the Biriyani and we were served on the same dish from which we were having our kebabs . A different set of cutlery  for the starters and the main dish ; is what I expect in a Fine Dining Restaurant. 

5. I made a brief visit to the wash room and was happy to notice that even the cistern on the western commode has got a stone like appearance in tune with the whole restaurant. 

6. Our total bill including all taxes for the three course meal and a bottle of water was INR 860 . I would describe the whole experience as value for money. 

We hope to be back soon to continue our culinary journey through Mughlai Food.

1590 in the name refers to the year they renamed Oudh to Awadh. Lovely place.
The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the old Indian decor. I've never been to Awadh, so I cannot confirm the authenticity of the decor, but it's comfortable and so is the seating.
We were told to try the Biryani for sure, and the Nehari mutton as well. We started off with Kakori and Gilawati kebabs, both of which were well made, however were not spectacular. I ordered Raan Biryani and Murgh Awadhi Biryani along with the Nehari mutton. The Biryani is indeed spectacular! Perfectly cooked with a scent of ghee. The mutton also compliments the biryani well. I cannot fault the food. The portions served are large as well, 1 biryani and a side is more than enough for 1 person. 
My overall experience was good, the food was satisfactory, by which I mean it is worth coming back for.
The biggest plus is the efficiency of the staff. Fast and friendly, and hardly puts a foot wrong.
Thanks for reading and excuse me if I've made an grammatical mmistakes :)

Tragedy first.....

we visited OUDH to compensate our cancelled Lucknow trip where we literally planned for 2 days of "ONLY AWADHI" food and nothing else to do!!!!

&

bang on.....we were right there at the best place in town and of course at the right time, no one could even get close to pure awadhi delicacies in Kolkata the way OUDH did. From its lakhmi paratha to galwati kebabs and of course the RANN BIRIYANI, all were phenomenon. and finally came the desserts .... it was the saahi tukra and gajaar ka haalwa which blew our little remaining senses off ( after enjoying the biriyani of course ).

Their biriyani is the best in the town to me and all the biggies in Kolkata comes second best to OUDH.Its bit expensive, but the quantity is good enough to feed two adults and in the end I must quote... THEY WORTH IT

Casual bistros in Europe and the U.S. often have "house" wines — easy-drinking, unfancy bottles that go with a wide variety of foods. Our faves, below, are perfect to keep on hand and uncork with your meal after a long day's work — or to offer to an impromptu dinner guest.

A great place to have biriyanis....one of the best places in town.The mutton preparations are the best and fish is not less than that.The ambience is bit dark but not so gloomy...one will not feel sleepy.The staff is quite friendly.One should try galawati kabab and fish chap(quite a new concept).  And you will be a fool if you miss the biriyani.

One of the restaurants I would like to visit quite often. One of the best Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines I've ever tasted. Had a dine on its opening day day they didnt disappoint. The quality of food and service id extremely well. The taste of each item be it vegetarian or non vegetarian is good enough to remember for a few days to come. The ambiance lives upto its name with food being served on brass/copper cutlery. One of the most exciting features of the restaurant was that, owing to its location, the restaurant doesnt have a looooong queue of waiting list. I love the food here and would definitely recommend any person to visit there.My Recommendation : Zafrani/Afgani Kebab

I have visited this place around 4 times as of yet and every time I have truly enjoyed myself. 

Oudh 1590 is a place where you will get biryani but prepared with good quality ingredients, not the ones used in chain restaurants like Arsalan and Zeeshan etc. Oudh uses good quality ghee to prepare their biryanis with, and the outcome of that is magnificent.

The dishes I have had their include their must eat Raan Biryani which is cooked in the dum pukht style with tender boneless meat of mutton from the leg portion. This dish particularly is one delicious and damn fulfilling treat. Another great biryani in their menu is the Parde Waali Murgh Biryani. This is prepared with tender and juicy chicken meat with a covered layer on the top. 

Kebab lovers, DO NOT MISS OUT THE GALOUTI KEBAB! You haven't lived until you've tried it. Also ask the waiter for a naan they provide with the kebab.

One suggestion. Try your best to visit the place on a weekday as the weekends are jam packed! 

Overall an amazing place to get your money's worth. 

PS: Keep an eye out for a moustache beside the entrance door!  :P

I hope this is the 530th review I am gonna post here, not 531 by the time I am finished writing it!! Such is the damned craze abt this place. Started few years back, this restaurant is one of the cult favourites now. 
The best biriyanis n kebabs of lucknowy origin is served here. Won't go in to how the oudish the decor is or how authentically scaring the doorman with his veerapan styled moustache looks, this place serves awe f...some food. 
Lemme order for you:
Starters: mutton kakori kebab with parathas (paste like spicy mutton with oil less parathas: ummmmm, that's the way to describe it), zafrani chicken kebabs ( big awesome tasting pieces of chicken)
Main course: Ran biriyani(for 2ppl), a huge leg piece of the mutton (not the whole leg !!) served in dum pukht biriyani style. Not your regular arsalan (Kolkata) biriyani, it is different, without any bong favourite "aloo". The mutton piece is so soft , so tender that the flesh will mix with biriyani rice. One word, its heaven.
Or the keema parantha ( if you dont feel biriyanish). Its delicious.
Side dish: Gosht bhuna, big tender pieces of mutton served in a thick spicy curry which would double up your cholesterol level the moment you see it. : D But its worth it!
Or the murgh Irani....perfectly cooked light gravy chicken dish.
Its one of the places which will keep alluring you towards itself every now n then. Make sure you visit well b4 your eating time cos surely there will be a big queue. Don't visit during the pujas, the queue would be more than that of suruchi sangha :D 
PS it always cost me 1200 bux for 2ppl. I can't help but order many dishes esp the kebabs.

Heard a lot about this place so here goes my review. Amazing nawabi interiors, not a huge space but comfortable enough to accomodate guests. staff is helpful. hindustani classical music in the background adds to the nawabi ambience. Awadhi biriyani is awesome, infact you can taste the kolkata style biriyani and understand the difference instantly. Quantity and price towards a costlier affair. Overall satisfies. Suggestion- either increase the quantity or reduce the price.

Great food.....the place is not that well spread...but the ambience has been put up well according to its theme. The meats we had were tenderly spiced and cooked, parathas were soft. I liked the biriyani they served and the galauti kebab was great. Having a sweet tooth, what really stole the show for me was the shahi tukda....simply great. A place to be if you like north indian, awadhi cuisine.

This place was long under my scanner and I was waiting for some occasion to visit this awesome restaurant. Finally today I went there with my family to celebrate my university results.

Now, talking about the restaurant, as the name suggests "Oudh" serves all kinds of royal cuisines like Awadhi, Lucknowi, Afgani and Mughlai. The place is known for it's regional ambiance and mouthwatering kebabs and biryanis. The place is located near Deshapriya Park, towards Lansdowne.

For starters, we tried out the Chicken Zafrani Kebab and the very famous Mutton Galawati Kebab with some Lucknowi parantha. Kebabs were served quite swiftly along with the parantha. As far as the taste goes, it was just out of the world. Perfect juiciness, tenderness of the chicken and the flavours. You can't just define this in one word.

We also tried out the Awadhi Handi Biryani which was also great along with raita. The biryani came along with two eggs and two extremely soft pieces of mutton. Surprisingly enough, the biryani was very less oily and was quite unique in taste, a taste that is not to be found in typical Kolkata's biryani joints. Our main course dish included Mutton Nehari Khaas as recommended by the waiter. It was also brilliant in it's preparation.

Ambiance of the place was sure a hit. Old 'shahi' (royal) decor has been kept in mind. Everything including the lighting and utensils give this place a premium look 'n' feel. Lighting is dim, so had to struggle to click some nice pictures. 

Only problem comes if you visit the place in large groups, the capacity is not that large to accommodate large groups and neither they entertain pre-booking. The capacity is just about 40-42 seats, so on Sundays and other festive seasons, you may have to wait for a while.

Service is quite descent, the kebabs are served almost instantly. The main course order takes say 15 minutes at the max. They also do home delivery but the bill should be above Rs.3000 for far areas.

Also coming to pricing, it is really heavy on pockets but with the kind of stuff they have to offer, I wonder if anyone's going to mind this.

So in conclusion, the best place for Awadhi cuisine, paradise for non-veg lovers especially kebabs and biryanis. Believe me, I am giving a rating of 5.0 to any restaurant after long time. Pocket pinch may be higher but then, of-course this restaurant cannot treated as a regular dine restaurant. One will have to find occasions to visit here.

I started my new year with a grand lunch at this awesome place. In deshapriya park, it pinches the pocket quite a bit but who cares when you are up for good food. The name and the decor is in perfect sync. It gives a feeling of transcending into the lucknowi ambience. The music is perfect too. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken biriyani, the usual ones and chicken kassa. Both were tasty enough. Raita was served with biriyani. I expected food to be a tad better but nevertheless that can be least expected on 1st January when long queues waited at the gate. Overall the experience was as grand as the name suggests.

Well the front facade is just outstanding and a photographer's friendly...!!! The woodwork, lighting and especially the paintings took the ambience to a new level never felt before. Coming to the main issue, table was decorated and the waiters were well dressed and versatile. Started the innings with mouth watering mutton galwati kebab with paper thin lucknowi paratha. It was just bang bang. Middle innings was well taken care by Awadhi Handi Biryani, Mahi Kaliya, Nehari Khaas (Mutton), Peas Pulao & utterly butterly Butter Naan. Simply blasted the tasted buds well beyond imagination..... mmmwwaaahhhh.....!!!!! The well crafted innings concluded with lip smacking scoops  of delicious n yummy Shahi Tukra. Ove@rall a nice lunch in a fortress and a complete  value of each penny spent. Had left today to return back again......!!!!

Avoid unless you are friends of the 'management'!

We had planned a family get together and tried booking in advance - only to be curtly told "FIRST COME FIRST SERVE - we don't take bookings". Thus we arrived at 6:50pm on the 30th of December, 2014 to get a table for 8 people. The restaurant was empty save for a family of three, but we were told we would have to finish by 9:00 pm as the tables were booked for "MANAGEMENT GUESTS" and they could not accommodate us. We had to change our venue at very short notice and redirect all our guests at great inconvenience.

Oudh 1590 seems to be stuck in feudal times!

I totally liked this place. It is a bit small but the food will totally make you happy. We ordered seekh kabab, gosht biriyani, luckowi paratha, and a mutton dish (don't remember the name). It was very tasty. They have some unique dishes in their menu. The luckowi paratha was actually oil free and was different and tasty. The waiters were good. The interiors are good, a kind of Mughal ambience is created with slight music, beautiful chandeliers. One drawback is that the menu card was very heavy. Will obviously visit this place again.

Oudh 1590 is perhaps one of the best restaurants in Desapriya Park. The kebabs are finger licking good.  The Galawati Kebab with the special paratha is a must try. The Quail Biriyani served during festive seasons is also one of my favourites.  Love to visit the place again and again.

A good place to enjoy the Awadhi cuisine. Located near to Deshapriyo Park, and very easy to reach here.

We ordered the Galawati Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha and I want to say its just a great combination. Then ordered the Raan and Moti Biriyani. Both are special (not like the common biriyani). The Raan Biriyani smells well and is really different than others and also better than Moti Biriyani. Moti Biriyani contains mutton balls. As a side dish, the Murgh Irani was the OK type. But the best surprise was for dessert. Both Phirni and Shahi Tukra was awesome. You can feel the aroma in your mouth even after your lunch/dinner.

A must visit place for all biriyani lovers.

Price for two: 1600/- approx (with tax)

This is located near Deshapriya park and one can easily find it. In terms of the ambiance, it is great but I felt that the light on the corner tables was much less. 

What we ordered, was shahi tangri kebab, galawati kebab among the starters. The galwati kebab was a wonder, absolutely delicious.  

On to the main course we ordered for the Awadhi handi biryani, murg biryani and both of them were awesome, however I found the murg biryani to be a tad dry. The side dishes included Ghost shahi korma and murg irani and both of them were great to have.

Overall a very nice experience for the family.

Tip: As the restaurant is really small and gets crowded in the wee hours in the evening, it becomes difficult to get seats. best if you can check in a bit early to this restaurant

Oudh 1590 was on my wishlist for a very long time.Finally managed to try it out a few days back when we celebrated the birthday of one of my friends here.My friend had reserved high praise for this restaurant and I went there with pretty high expectations.

Located in one of the lanes near Deshapriya Park this place does a fantastic job in recreating the ambience of the bygone Mughal era.Although the space inside is rather small,it is managed really well and the overall ambience and decor is nothing short of stunning.The guards at the entrance,the waiters dressed in black,the decor,the paintings and other fine details everything add up to a royal Mughal feel which you are sure to enjoy.

Coming to the food,we ordered a Mutton Galawati kabab,Lucknowi Paratha,Raan Biryani,Mutton Handi Biryani,Nehari Khaas and Mutton Rogan Josh.The Galawati kabab was a nice way to start off our meal.It was nice and tasty but I wished the sizes were a little bigger.The Lucknowi Paratha was brilliant.It was just the way it should have been-extremely thin and light.The Handi Biryani and Raan Biryani arrived next.They were served properly in earthern pots.The flavours were really good.One can get the lovely aroma of the Biryani once the foil is removed.Both tasted pretty good but I found them rather too similar and that was a tad disappointing.The mutton pieces were decent and quite well cooked.The nehari khaas was excellently done.The Mutton rogan josh though I felt was quite average.On the whole we were satisfied with our meal but I personally felt some areas could be improved upon further.

The service was swift.The waiters and staff were really friendly and helpful.The prices are slightly on the higher side.Since the space inside is not the biggest one may have to wait for a while to get a table specially during peak hours.

Overall Oudh 1590 with its wonderful themed ambience and lovely Awadhi flavours offer something different and appealing.The food is also pretty good.I dont know if it was my high expectations or what but I personally felt the food could have been even better in some areas.But All in all you are sure to have an enjoyable experience.

Had gone today in the afternoon. The decor and ambiance takes you back to the Mughal period. Its really wonderful. Had ordered two Rann ki Biriyani and one Qalmi kebab. The waiter served it really quickly. The Qalmi kebab is really great, and for the Rann ki biriyani , the odour of it is something that will take you back there again and again leave alone the taste of it. The meat was ultra tender and the biriyani itself as a whole  was too good. 
The service of the staff and the waiters are also very good and cordial.
Thumbs Up for this place. A must visit  for persons craving for some good Mughal cuisine in the city......

Despriya Park’s Oudh 1590 is a one such place where you can get not only delicious food but also desired ambience. The restaurant is famous for its moghlai items, biriyani, kebabs and many more. The last time when I was there with my friends, I was wowed by their menu which is full with mouth watering kebabs, rotis, nan, chaap, rezala etc. So without further delay I ordered Aam khaas, a yammy sharbat which was ideal to remove the entire day’s tiredness. The smoothi flavour of the aam khaas is simply irresistible. For starters we had Afhgani kabab, tender chicken marinated in white creamy sauce. While chatting with my pals, the restaurant ambience accompanies the tasty foods fine. Now come to the main course, for which we unanimously chose murgh biriyani and kakori mutton. The biriyani with mutton marinated with special spices and herbs was simply awesome. Fish is a must in Bengali ‘khana pina’, hence we ordered Zafrani kabab which is a recipe of grilled Kolkata Bhetki marinated with yogurt and saffron.

If you love Awadhi cuisine, you cannot miss this place. Let’s ignore their biryanis. We have better biryanis in Kolkata. But their kebabs and other dishes are absolutely lovely. You must order at least one dish of Kakori/Galawati/Shammi kebabs. And with the above mentioned kebabs, you should try Lucknowi Paratha. In the desserts section, go for Shahi Tukra. Oh just remembered another masterpiece – Keema Kaleji !!! 
Moreover, the ambience is absolutely top class-y.

The quality of food served is delicious but not in desired quantity in accordance to the price charged. Chicken Tandoori is a heavy pinch in pocket because they serve quater for a half plate order. Rann biriyani is well cooked and not enough for a foodie couple. Good food but a high price.

And the Galawati kebab-which defines softness of a kebab..and to top it all-Shahi tukda-Itz the 'The Mistimukh'..bengalis need so bdly. My menu ended here coz of a lightweight pocket..bt am surely comi@ng back to try the rest ..because the decor and the gazals that u get as an add on while eating...makes sure..u always have that ryt place to eat out on Oudh..without hesitation..great job Oudh.

Redefining everything Mughlai !

Location : Very close to Deshapriya Park . Anyone with half a brain can follow the Google Maps and reach there easily. 

Ambiance : The moment you lay your eyes on this place you know that you're about to enter a fort from a bygone era ! You are asked to register your name on the waiting list inside and within minutes you & your party are beckoned !. The inside is nothing short of spectacular. It's been redone to give you an authentic visual treat . The entire staff is extremely polite and wear black sherwanis with old rustic awadhi music plating in the background and the lights dimmed down !

Food : Was famished so ordered the Galawati Kabab ( since it was listed as a starter ) . The waiting time was considerable but the end product remarkable. Never have I tasted a Kebab this good ! This coming from someone who is an Arsalan addict mind you ! The Kebabs : 4 boneless balls of heaven . Add to that the Tandoori Roti and it was so juicy and aromatic you have no idea . The green chutney went along quite well with it. Was disappointed when the Raan Biriyani was not available but ordered the Awadhi Handi Biriyani and the Moti Biriyani. 

The Awadhi Biriyani was brought in a clay pot with two big pieces of mutton in it. Taste wise it was nothing out of this world ! But it was light and really refreshing. The moti Biriyani followed soon after and it had boneless balls of mutton with two eggs to accompany them. The quantity ofboth the biriyanis was fine but the moti biriyani really imparts that heavy feeling because of the huge amount of spices in it ! 

Cost for 2 : 1100/- 

Final : Good but nothing spectacular except for the GALAWATI Kebab ! Quantity could be better but quality wise no complaints at all . Overall they didn't disappoint me enough to rate them badly.

I was longing to be here for longtime & ultimately landed here today for a family lunch. Firstly Ambience and behaviour of all those who were serving were very pleasing. We ordered Raan Biryani, Awadhi Handi Biryani , Gosht Shahi Qorma & Roomali roti. Aroma & taste was awesome. Quality was the best I had so far in any biryani outlet. Then we ordered Shahi Tukra & Gajar ka halwa......which was just yummy... Overall it was a beautiful treat to our olfactory senses. I can go there again and again.

Well....We wanted to have the famous Lucknow-delicacies, the kakori kebab and the galawti kekbab and hence this visit.
As you enter the place on a bright sunny day, initially you will feel the place is dimly lit. As soon as your eyes adjust with it, you will realize that yo have actually entered some Nawabi dining hall. The interior decor is awesome, beautifully decorated. The furniture, wall-decors, silver boxes placed here and there, staffs wearing churidaars with zari work, the soft classical songs played in the background-everything gives you the feel...you will love it for sure.
The stuffs are always ready to attend you and often help to choose the right dish.
They take a little time to serve the food, but I won't complain as I believe good food needs time to be prepared.
We started of with Kakori kebab, soft and spicy. Next came Galawti kebab, the one that melts in your mouth. It's the best kebab I have tasted ever and the soft Lucknowi paratha perfectly complimented it. 
Next we had Raan biriyani, again truly a Brilliant Biriyani dish. It was accompanied by Nargisi Kofta... It is cooked in a unique style and will be a great one for Lamb-meat lovers. 
We were a group of three hungry souls and a plate of each item made us full and we did not have any space left in our tummy to have a dessert.
They serve complimentary Raitas and Aachar which are too tasty.
The masala box that they bring at the end is also worth mentioning.
Overall the food is great, though personally I feel a little more seasoning will make the kebabs and kofta perfect. The dishes are light, not too much oily or heavy. I will go back there again soon and try more things. 
P.S- Do notice the man at the gate and his mustache :P

The decor, the food, the staff , the ambience are mouthwatering at this joint. Fashioned with wooden carvings slow ghazals and and that amazing aroma of saffron , kesar, ghee. This is my fifth time here and nothing has changed! ..except that they dont make raan biryani in the afternoon anymore! But the shammi kababs, galawati kababs, lucknowi parathas and phirni just take your breath away. A bit on the pricey side but definitely worth it!

We didnt get to see the food... They dont take reservations and we were asked to turn up directly, upon reaching the wait was around 1 hr ... Ok we can wait , but surprise surprise out waiting time just went up due to a VIP party ... We were told they need to accommodate them at the cost of ordinary patrons ... At this point we decided to leave . This place might be serving good food but they certainly lack courtesy and good management.. Unless they only want to cater to the VIP patrons

Finally made a plan to Oudh 1590. Had 2 wait for our turn..but was merely f few minutes. Talking about the place..it was conjusted but well lit. We had a pre-decided order to place..as we could not help but run through the reviews before coming. So, we ordered the Galawati kababs, lucknowi paratha, awadhi handi biryani n shahi tukra. Galawati kabab what I felt was a bit bland..the spicy part was missing somewhere. .but with extra marinade addition it tasted delicious. Lucknowi paratha was undoubtedly great. We had Rann biryani in mind but actually had to order awadhi handi biryani as the former was unavailable. Dint have a clue that it would run out of stock..
The biryani we ordered was good..tasty n it was light...less oil content..
Even though u wud think u haven't hd anything. .but u surely won't be able to have a single other dish. The quantity is really good. Shahi tukra dint disappoint me much but there's a scope for improvement.
Lastly to talk about the service...it was quite pleasing and I am surely contented having @ oudh 1590.

This restuarant was on my list foe a very long time. I went there and it took me and my friend 1 hour to get a seat  and then 15 minutes before they gave us a menu card. The decor of the restuarant has this "period feel" which was great.

Coming to the food, we ordered galawati kabab and paratha ( as suggested by the waiter) and both of them were delicious. the kebab was soft,succulent and something new
then we went for awadhi Handi biriyani ( as they were out of stock of Rann biryani) which was really well wrapped up and everything but it was a disappointent. We didnt find the quantity appropriate nor was the quality so great to warrant such a huge price. We ordered Nehari khaas  which was good and had a very tasty gravy and succulent mutton pieces. We took a Murg Irani as well but the chicken was not cooked well and not satisfying enough.
we had no more space for dessert so cudnt try out the shahi tukda.
All in all an average experience but with a huge pocket pinch. I give it 3/5 on the basis of the decor and all the style of serving food but I hope they concentrate a bit more on the food.

Yesterday visited this place with my gf for the third time within a span of 4 months. This place serves one of best moglai dishes in my opinion. If it is moglai then for me its Oudh 1590. They have plenty of variations in their menu. We ordered lucknowi paratha, lachha paratha(great), keema kaleji(good) & awadhi handi biryani(awesome).. Their biryani is simply different from all others and tastes great.
       The ambience is great, you will feel that you are in the mughal era. The staffs are very courteous and nicely dressed. The only problem I have is in the dessert section, most of the time their desserts are not available. Last day we ordered gajar ka halwa but it was not available, but their sahi tukra is very good. 
       But one must visit this place if you love moglai dishes..

I had been planning to visit this place for a long time, and when i finally did, totally worth it. The decor goes with the awadhi cuisine served here. The staff are very nice and very friendly. The food arrived real fast. For the starters, we had the gulawati kabab  and the lucknowi paratha. The kabab was just awesome and awakens the tastebuds. It was soft, succulent and just amazing. The lucknowi paratha was also very good. Next came the rann biriyani. I really liked the way they serve biriyani in  earthen pots and the biriyani is the best in the city. Words are really not enough to describe it. The mutton in the biriyani were so well cooked. Just mouthwatering. The chicken irani we took as a side dish was okay types. The firni for the desserts is also worth trying. Overall an amazing experience.

Oudh has been on my wishlist for a while now, but something or the other always kept me away from visiting it. 
However, one of my friends took me out for a dinner to Oudh last night and boy, it was fab.
The decor is in line with the theme, infact I found the decor quite interesting. The restaurant is a bit small, but the wall paintings, lights, mirrors and jharokhas do not make it look cramped.
Now coming to the food, we ordered dor a chicken parda biriyani and irani murgh and tandoori rotis. The irani murgh is a rich creamy gravy with cashew paste and tastes good. Its a bit on the sweeter side, but the nuts infuse in a subtle flavor. The biriyani is great and sufficient for two persons. Two large chicken pieces ansd subtly flavoured rice make it a sure winner.
For deserts, we ordered firni and shahi tukra. The firni was ok, I have had better ones. The shahi tukra was the best dish of the day. I can anyday go back to Oudh just to have the shahi tukra.
We couldnt have the kebabs on our maiden visit, but I am sure I am going back to Oudh soon.

They claimed it would be a 'period dining experience', and rightly so, the stained glass decor, the intricate patterns, moghol school paintings, dim lighting and beautifully wafting thumri by Kishori Amonkar...ahh the true awadhi dastarkhwan is here for you!

We ordered Galawti Kebab, Raan Biryani, Gosht Chaap, and Phirni. Here are my thoughts:

Galawti Kebab: Awesomely succulent and tasty. The condiments were outstanding.

Raan Biryani: It was the show-stopper indeed. Dum-pukht done in neat handi, presented elegantly, nice big portion size with neat shredded pieces of juicy, tender mutton legs, texture of rice was perfect - soft yet very light, every grain shiny and whole. After a long, long time I tasted such perfectly done, aromatic and tasty biryani. Impressive!

Gosht Chaap: well cooked, a bit too yoghurty (which may be a little off-putting for the bengali palate). Also not recommended for people who avoid oily, spicy gravies. Overall OK.

Phirni: Average

Service was courteous and prompt. Pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side, about 1000 for 2, but definitely worth the experience. Do try the Raan Biryani. It is quite something!

heard of this place a lot and finally landed there for a family lunch...ambiance, cosy but well decorated though they were playing sufi music...but its okay as long as its not bothering you...reception great....service great...waiters are helpfull and were working wearing a smile so thumbs up....now about the food....badam sharbat was really exotic but that aam khas kuch khas nahin tha....tried zafrani kabab which was cooked to perfection but this place wat i heard was famous for mutton galawati which was a flop show...meat was not cooked properly and the salt proportion in galawati normally tends to be high but this was flying above oudhs's roof..may be the galawati specialist cook was not in a good mood that day...but they made it up with the awadhi handi biriyani...AWESOME a full 10/10 in every ways...every rice particle was evenly cooked along with the meat which was really tender and the taste was really exotic...along with that we took murgh irani which was also good but we were so awestruck with the biriyani that it realy had a very little space of applause...price wise- absolutely fine... i dont mind paying a bit more with the quality of biriyani they served and less for the galawati...overall a decent place to go no doubt..........

After a long pandal hopping...we went to Oudh 1590 for dinner on dashami during pujo time. I heard of the good fame of this restro so we choose to go thr. We took shahi tangri kebab, murgh biriyani and murgh irani. But i was not satisfied with the quality at all. I dnt know why they prepared tge food bad...may be due to pressure of puja. The quantity was vry less compared to the price. Interior is eye soothing and even the service is quiet good. But with the expectation i went thr.. i was disheartend. May be will get good food there...next time i go.

Did not have a very good experience. The place appeared too crowded and thus clumsy. The waiter did not attend to me properly. He was literally rushing me for the order. Behaviour was far from cordial. When i had filled the feedback sheet, he saw it started questioning me on why I have not given good feedback. I was taken aback. I am never going back to that place. The food is not that great either. Have had better.. Much better.. That too with better prices.

Yup. A five. Come to an experience that you will never forget. And will love to have again and again. Everything, from the hospitable Awadhi attired attendants, to the decor is breath taking. And God the food!! The Rann Biryani is a must try. Keep your ears open for some soulful ghazal and keep your bellies empty for some flavours delivered from the kitchens of the Nawabs, with love.

The food is too rich. We had a chicken biryani which was quite oily. The Mugh Zafrani (stongly suggested by the staff) was a let down. The Veg Galawti -supposedly made out of paneer was too spicy which killed the subtle flavour that it should have. The Lucknow Paratha was supposed to be 'no oil'. I doubt it. 
The firni tasted like a cold 'rice payesh'
Finally the staff insisted we leave the table as there were people waiting. Surprisingly, there were quite a few tables vacant at that time.
You can give the restaurant a pass, there are much better places to eat Indian food in kolkata

Oudh 1590 celebrates the calcuttan cuisine, history and tradition proudly. That wooden door is magical. It just leads you straight to a different era altogether. you would forget all your worries and almost fly through time to land in the age of nawabs. The traditional decor, the dim light and  the intricate wooden carvings add all the more to the romance. And with the   galwati kebabs, the qualmi chicken kebabs, awadhi handi biriyani and nehari khas , noone can stop you from feasting like a nawab here. ^_^

Wanted to visit this restaurant for a very long time!! Finally I visited this place today and it was simply worth visiting!! This place is actually best for non veg lovers!! My brother simply loved the Briyani  nd chicken kebab!! I had tried galawati kabab which was nice too!! Though we had to wait long to get the table since they were not taking table reservations!!

Kebab delight in Kolkata.  One of the best places in Kolkata to have kebabs and almost everything non vegetarian. Ambience is good so as hospitality. But as compared to Lucknow kebab and non veg food was very average but as per Kolkata outlets its a delight. For two cost aroung 900.

Well a delightful Moghlai food restaurant with a Nawab themed decor. Loved the starter mutton leg kababs, presented in the manner you see lamb chops getting served in New York's finest joints. Ran biriyani is a mouthwatering dish lined with beautiful boneless mutton shreds. I also tried mutton necch a side dish with the biriyani. Overall it's a fab place for an afternoon family lunch, and to experience the handi style of presentation.

We were probably a bit late for lunch: there were few tables occupied and the kitchen was about to shut down. The interiors looked grand mostly because of the intricately carved wood, and along with the dim lighting & classical song in the background it made for a delightful evening. Of course the food was great. We had the Mutton Galawati Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha for starters, which was actually suggested by a member of the serving staff. And it didn't disappoint us at all. The kebab, a patty of minced mutton, along with the parathas made for a delightful bite.

For the main course we ordered the Awadhi Handi Biryani and the Murgh Irani. The biryani came covered in earthen pot. A full plate would be sufficient for two people....with two pieces each of mutton and egg. Unlike other biryanis that I've had, I could smell the aroma of ghee which was different but was pleasant. The Murgh Irani however turned out to be on the sweeter side, which was a disappointment for me...

After the meal, we were offered different types of mouth fresheners in a wooden crafted box... The biryani was quite unorthodox in a good sense...A good time spent...

The place has awesome interiors and has a very ancient touch to the entire ambience.
We ordered awadh murg biryani and some dishes.
All the dishes were very tasty but at the same time very very rich in ghee.i would have preferred the dishes with a little less grease so that i could finish all the portions.
Only the chicken rezalla was not as per my expectations.the gravy was so rich that we could not even finish one-fourth of the portion we ordered.
Apart from this in their desert they mentioned kulfi faluda but the same was not present. It made me really very disappointed.
Overall it was a good experience for a first timer like me. But still it does not make me think that i should go again to this place as it was nothing so remarkable.

Visited this place for a birthday treat. Not very tough to locate, you take the left turn from Sharma Sweets and walk for a couple minutes. From the moment you open the door, you'll be full of awe and delight. The dim lighting, the gorgeous lamps and chandeliers, the decorations on the wall, the music which reminds you of the Mughal era, make the ambiance one of a kind. Then you are handed the quite heavy menu card by sherwani-clad waiters. We opted for the mutton galawati kebab with lucknowi paratha. There were bowls of aam achar, amsotto chatni, and one other chutney which I couldn't quite place on the table, and not to mention we went quite crazy over them. The amsotto chatni in particular, was exquisite. Galawati kebabs are melt in your mouth soft, the lucknowi paratha thin and crisp, one paratha is served in four pieces and enough for two people as a starter. Served with picked onions, they are indeed a royal duo. However when it came to drinks, we wanted to try out the badam sherbet, but that was unavailable. So we opted for aam khas instead. That turned out to be a disappointment. It was ordinary mango paana served with some ice, and it had too much salt in it. For main course we ordered a raan biriyani and a nargisi kofta. Now, I have never been a big fan or biriyanis, but I have to say this biriyani grabbed a hold on my heart. Served in an earthen pot, it had the wonderful aroma of generous amounts of ghee. The mutton was not served as a whole leg, but as soft and succulent little boneless pieces of mutton. This made me nearly weep with delight, because I absolutely abhor bones. There was a complimentary bowl of raita with it, which was a very sweet gesture. The nargisi kofta was four half pieces of egg covered with a soft mutton paste, served in a rich gravy, and it was great. But sadly, we could not finish more than half of the biriyani, which is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best in Kolkata. The pot seemed like a magic box from which a never ending supply of biriyani kept coming out. We packed the rest of it home. By then we were very full, but there is always room for dessert you know. We were really looking forward to trying out the gajar ka halwa and kulfi falooda, but alas, none of them were available and the waiter informed us that the only choices were firni and shahi tukra. We opted for a shahi tukra, which tasted smooth and very good, but I couldn't enjoy the taste very well because I was so very stuffed. Then they served hot water to wash our hands, which I never experienced in other restaurants. Saves you a trip to the washroom. The mouth fresheners were served in a big wooden box with a mirror on top of it. Pocket pinch was 1600 for a hearty meal for two and we had leftovers. There is really no room to complain except for the aam khas and the unavailability of certain drinks and desserts. But all in all, will definitely visit again, and again and again.

After sometime,I came to a restaurant to have mughlai dishes.
It was a very good experience...and i've got to say that the taste buds are satisfied...
Very good Ambience...proper behaved staff...fast wifi..
Would come back again
Ordered.
Raan biriyani...awadhi handi biriyani...chicken pharda biriyani....mutton something kalia(don't remember the correct name)...
The quantity was very nice...tasted really good. One of the best Biriyanis...better than Arsalan too...a lot better actually.
Quality of the Chicken P. Biriyani wasn't that good and it had a lump of spices...which nearly killed me...it was a ball of spices...
Aam Khaas...top class
Soda Shikanji...fabulous...
Wonderful experience.

Entrance and Ambiance: good and it's like nostalgic
Service: - good
Only one Washroom and it's common for Men and Women, too bad. 
It's hyped and that great taste. If someone say that here Biriyani is good, they might not have tasted good blend of Biriyani earlier. Their rice quality is fat. 
I and one of my friend visited the place with so much expectations from Oudh 1590. But sorry. I won't visit this place again. 
We ordered Galawati Kabab (Mutton): - yummy
Lucknowi Paratha : - good one 
But when they served Awadhi Hadni Biriyani full and waiter told us that one is sufficient for two....but it's not that..You need atleast 50% of that Handi again..Nehari Khas (Mutton): - not good....
Overall experience with Oudh is not good...
Only ambiance is good with music, utensils, wall paintings....but it won't feel your stomach...

Awesome ambience, awesome food ... deducted 0.5 rating because of the waiting time, which was on the higher side rather... but again, worth the wait. Easy to locate though not on the main road... you have to come to Deshapriya Park crossing , while you move towards Lansdowne through Sarat Bose Road... take the first left from Tamarind restaurant. Biriyani is the speciality but the kebabs and tandoori items were succulent nevertheless.

My friend and I, drenched in the October rains, decided to hop into this joint late one afternoon. It is well-known, and I'd been meaning to try it for quite some time. It was around 3, almost closing time, but the staff was courteous enough and seated us. May I just say, the decor was mesmerizing. Oudh 1490 is period dining at its best. Although the lighting was a bit TOO dark, the Awadhi-style decor was well-executed, and complimented by everything, from the music to the cutlery to the staff uniforms. 

Coming to the food, I'd genuinely wanted to sample the famous Raan biriyani of Oudh 1590, and the phirni as well, but they'd run out of both. The last bowl of phirni they had went to the only other table that was occupied besides ours, because they had ordered it first. Finally we settled on the Galawati kebab, Lucknowi parathas for the two of us, Soda shikanjis, Awadhi handi Biriyani and the Murgh Irani...the last one being suggested by our waiter himself. The Galawati kebab was succulent and mouth-watering, and we were instant fans, to say the least. The parathas were just the right kind of crispy and went great with the kebabs. My friend had also seemed to take a shine to the complimentary chutneys. The biriyani was a bit cold (only a little), but great to taste and the meat was cooked impeccably. I would definitely rate it among one of the best biriyanis in the city. One handi is more than enough for two. Frankly, neither of us liked the Murgh Irani too much. We packed most of it for home because we were too full. The soda shikanji was the usual.

The staff of Oudh 1590 are some of the friendliest restaurant staff we've met, who merrily chatted away with us about food and other things.  The bill was a bit on the higher side, but honestly, it did not matter much to us after such a mind-blowing gastronomic experience. We definitely plan on returning soon for the Raan biriyani and the phirni. Hopefully this time we'll be more on time and less, well, wet.

I just wanna say that its one of the best places to have biriyani in Kolkata.The places looks so elegant with the dim lights and the heavy woodwork on the walls.I have been here so many times but still not satisfied my biriyani hunger.They have so many varieties starting from Handi biriyani to Rann biriyani and many more.The smell of the biriyani itself sets it apart from the rest of the places.Each and every person I ahev recommended this place have loved it equally.Great job guys.

Oudh 1590 is one of the restaurants I had been wanting to try out for a long time, and I wasn't disappointed at all. Situated off the 'food street' of South Calcutta, Sarat Bose Road, Oudh 1590 lives up to its tagline of 'Period Dining Experience'. 

Perhaps because of the space crunch, the restaurant does not take reservations, so if you're don't want to wait, reach early....as the place fills up really fast. 

The interiors is beautifully done up with woodwork and stain glass window motifs, paintings, vases and ornate boxes. The lighting too is subtle, with soft lamps. Even the music is made to match the decor and ambiance. 

The staff is very, very courteous. 

Coming to the food, the must-tries are definitely the Galwati Kebab, with Lukhnowi paratha. We also had the Fish Zafrani, which was lightly spiced and full of flavour. The Raan Biryani is definitely the star on the menu. The perfectly marinated meat literally melts in the mouth.  In this regard, I'd like to add that we were initially told that the Raan Biryani would not be available, but on requesting them, they said that they would be able to give us one plate of the Raan Biryani. (Oudh 1590 will be closed for a few days for renovation, starting tomorrow, and since the raan requires 24 hours of marination, they had not prepared the item today) Other than these, the Lukhnowi Handi Biryani and the Nehari Khaas are also quite good. 

We rounded off with Firni. 

All in all, a great experience and a must-try.

Awesome place. The ambience is ao beautiful, it takes you to the Mughal era. The restaurant has been tastefully decorated, from the cutlery to the washroom, everything has a royal touch to it. The food was amazing. I ordered murg something biryani, and chicken tandoori. The latter was the best. It was so amazingly cooked,the meat was tender and succulent. The service was amazing, and they were super courteous. Prices are slightly above average, but the quantity is too much, so overall doesn't affect much. Overall, a nice experience.

Since Calcuttans are biriyani lovers, a place like Oudh 1590 is a blessing for us all. This place has amazing range of scrumptious Biriyanis along with great Kababs. Locating may be a difficult but navigating using the maps provided by zomato or asking around helps. Once you reach the place is hard to miss and is as inviting from outside as is the food. Once you step in the decor and ambience are bound to please your eyes. I personally love to sit beside the wall made of wood and coloured glasses, reminds me old palaces. The lamps are very pretty and dim which is nice and comfortable. 
Coming to the food, the menu is long and self-explanatory. There is a range of Kababs as starters, Biriyanis, Rotis, Chicken and Mutton and Fish side orders and Desserts. For starters we have ordered the Kakori Kabab, the Afghani kabab and the Galoti Kabab. Kakori and Galoti are Mutton variations and both are delicious and I like them better than Afghani kabab which is a chicken kabab, tender and nice but a little bland. I must also mention the achars and chutneys they offer you at each table along with vinegared onions. There are four achars and chutneys to be had with kababs and mains and all of them are amazing. There is a sweet one which I prefer, and spicy ones and sour ones and all are good. The Kababs taste really well with these. For all the visits to Oudh (so far as I remember) I have had Biriyanis instead of Rotis or Naan. I have tried the Dum Phukt Biriyani which is delicious, however my favourite is the Chicken Purdah Biriyani. It is to die for. It comes in a Handi and the rice is perfectly blended with the spices and chicken. I recommend this Biriyani to all! 
I am usually so engrossed with the Biriyani that I barely remember which side I ordered. However their Rezala is quite difficult to forget. The Chicken is clean and tender and the gravy non-spicy and creamy.
Coming to desserts I have tried their Gajar ka Halwa and Firni. The Halwa was less in quantity so far as I remember but was extremely rich, a must try. The Firni is a very safe bet for desserts almost everywhere and here too the Firni is great. It has badam and pista added to it and is a good end to your meal. 
According to me a meal for two leads to a Pocket Pinch of 1200 including desserts and you will leave satisfied and happy. 
This place also home delivers, if the distance crosses 2km the insist that the minimum bill amount is 1200. 
A must visit. Enjoy.

Worst Biryani , Not Value for Money At all , People who understands what Awadhi Biryani is will never order Biryani here... Service was poor... Raita was served after our food was over almost , Raan Biryani was just a waste.. it was normal regular rice and mutton which was not actually Dum Phukt.. rice had almost no flavour.. Mutton was bit on the sour side which proves the chef put in more curd in the marination... and lotsa flaws to write.. only one Suggestion to every one.. if you guys love biryani never visit this place.. i being a Big Biryani Freak didnt at all like it reason being 1. Sour Mutton , 2. normal size regular r8ce where as biryani rice should be full aroma and flavour and very long , 3. poor service , 4. No difference between chicken and raan biryani both being equally bad 5. too highly priced for all the poor taste and service..

So, finally had the chance to visit this restaurant. The first thing you notice after you enter (after the door is opened by The man in The moustache) is the smell. And oh my god what great smell it is! Then you find your seat and finally have the chance to look around and see the eye-smacking wooden polished decor. With Begum Akhtar playing in the background I really felt like a nawab. Coming to food, we had Galawati kebabs for starters and the waiter suggested some parantha with it and so we obliged. Oh it was the best kebab I had in years! Then came the Ran Biriyani for main course. I expected something great, but sadly, all I got was an above average "good" biriyani. As Nasiruddin Shah tells us , good is the enemy of great. But then came the Shahi Tukra. Let me tell you, if you visit there, you HAVE to have this. It was heavenly! So everything was perfect but the biriyani. Hence a 4 is fair enough.

The ambience genuinely replicates the mughal era coupled with the classical Hindi music in the background. The biriyani was made from pure ghee unlike the general run of the mill kind of thing. The aam-panna is a must try as the tangy flavor cuts through the richness of the mughlai food. Will definitely visit again when I visit Kolkata! :)

Visited Oudh 1590 last week with my wife. The ambience was absolutely spot on. The ambience is exactly what we associate with the Nawabs and the Moghuls of the past era. Now, coming to the point for which we go to a restaurant..The food. We ordered the most talked about, Ran Biryani, Galawati Kebab and Murg tandoori. The biryani served in earthen pots was awsome. The taste is completely different from the usual biryani we had been eating from childhood. There was a very different flavours of spices in the biryani. The quantity of Biryani serves 2 persons. The Galawati Kebab was mind blowing as well as the Murg Tandoori. 
As far as desserts are concerned, we ordered Kesar Phirni...It was quite a dish. Completely different from the other restaurants. A must try. 
I have given a 4 star rating for Oudh 1590 only because of the location. For the new, it is a bit difficult to find the place. Otherwise it would have been  5 star.

Although we visited the place on saptami, when it was very crowded, the service was super fast and the quality of food was excellent. The kebabs melt in your mouth and the raan biriyani was truly the best biriyani I have had in a while. An added bonus are the fairly reasonable rates. Will definitely go again.

The kebabs here are something to look forward to. The waiter recommended us to try out the mutton kebab with parantha. They were delicious. 
Biryanis are quite worth its price and a plate of biryani is sufficient for 3 grown-up stomachs.
The place has got a very good ambience and the service is also very very good.

Great ambience. Great moustache man at the gate with a lovely smile. Excellent music, thumri mostly to my untrained ears. Copper bottomed thalis and glasses. Mango chatni as accompaniment, the place has its novelty factor. If you like to do it exotic, man this is your kinda place. 

Now the food. Galawati kebab is highly regarded by many above, but I like the chicken kebabs more. Had Lucknavi roti with the kebab. It was superb. Real dry parathas. Recommended.

Next we ordered Runn Biriyani with a  Mutton creamy dish whose name I don't remember. The Biriyani was cooked in pure ghee and is not for the faint hearted. The Mutton sider was equally heavy.

Overall good food, but too much of oil. Also we over ordered and had to carry food home. But then we are small eaters. 

Recommended, but with caution. Try out at least once, if not for the food, for the ambience itself. Food is not bad but pricey. Eat once and decide for yourself.

Went there yesterday with a lot of expectations. Was not much satisfied. We had ordered Zafrani kabab and Murg Pardha Biryani. 
The Kabab was just okay for me. It was not that juicy and the marination was just okay type. The quality of rice used in the biryani was poor. The rice grains were small and broken and at places were sticky. I do not understand why all food joints in kolkata are so over rated. The biryani was indeed different from the "traditional kolkata style" but was in no way close to awadhi style. The spices were not mixed properly. The chicken was well cooked though. In order to serve authentic awadhi biryani they have to go a long way.

Excellent food, excellent interior! We have visited here during puja. There was a long queue, but fortunately we had to wait for very little time. The interior reminded us of the dining room of a Haveli, aristocratic north Indian home. The light shades, the little tray for acher in the table, the wall hangings, the dishes and glasses, everything matched the theme. We have ordered Mutton ran biryani, tandoori roti and nehari khas. The food was exceptionally good. The biryani isn't like the traditional Kolkata style ( with a big piece of meat and half piece potato and rice). Rather it has shredded mutton mixed with the rice, nicely spiced. The nehari khas is a dish which has a very long cooking time and needless to say, tasted awesome with the roti. The bill was a little more than expected, but was worth the new taste. Overall a nice experience.

Have heard about this place quite often and too good things at that. Only a few days back when I visited this place, I was pleasantly happy to experience brilliance in terms of food, ambiance and service.

 We ordered Burrah and Galawti Kabab, Lucknawi paratha, Gosht Rezala, Awadhi Handi Biryani and Phirni. Needless to say each dish was prepared with just not the right ingredient but a sombre ounce of love, which came out well in the taste of the foods. 

Awadhi Handi Biryani is a must try, my love for it surpassed everything else, because of a light and flavorful aroma of ghee. 

Also, on their complimentary pickle/chutni platter their is an amazing sweet-tangy Mango chutney, which can be well considered as the star attraction. 

A must visit with perfect ambiance and lighting. However good the service is, it can be slightly notched up for an even better experience.

The Raj darbari gets opened. Imagine few bugles are being played and ahem... Welcome to the quintessential gharana of the great Nawabs of Lucknow. Begum Akhtar has just begun her soulful set of ghazals and thumris. Now Sit back. Look all over the traces of the Nawabs. Now you can check the menu. 
For the first timers, a platter Galawati kebab and Lucknowi paratha is a must have. The kebab just melts inside your mouth. The  traditional Lucknowi flavour  will make you feel 'woooow'. At least, that was the first word came out of my mouth, after gulping a piece of the kebab.  Then we decided to go with the Gosht Handi Biriyani. But, please don't wish anything like our Bengali counterpart of it. It gets served in a clay pot, hot and steamy. And is sufficient for two. The taste is something rare for those of us, having a 'Bengali stomach'. The smell of pure ghee delights your nose and the minced meat is what you actually will fall in love with. 
The staffs are bit lazy, but that again raises your anticipation for the food. Take any of the 'shorbas', you want. Enjoy the grand Nawabi feast. Don't forget to have the firni at the end. Trust me, you would want to visit again and again.
So, just go for it. Don't hesitate about the pocket pinch.

Murgh tandoori was simply EXCELLENT, so were the zafrani bhetki & Lucknowi biriyani.
I wouldn't suggest the veg galouti kebab though.
The end of the meal with a plate of shahi tukra was perfect.

Visited Oudh today with my friend...the ambience is definitely worth a mention...it has an old world charm....start from the bronze cutlery to the ghazals being played. Now coming to the food..ordered for their famous Galawati Kebab and Lucknowi Paratha...along with lime sikanji.the kebab just melts in your mouth and the paratha is paper thin and yummy.For main course we ordered Rann Biryani and it was one of the best that i have eaten in Kolkata.Its not your typical 'Calcutta Style Biriyani' but shreds of tasty mutton cooked in ghee...yes ghee and not dalda!! We did manage to save some space for dessert and ordered their Firni,it was a kesaria one and delicious as well...the bill came upto 1200...worth every penny!!

The restaurant is awesome. We visited the place to celebrate birthday of my friend and not to mention it was his birthday treat. It is just opposite Carmel Primary School in Lake Market which is one more reason I loved the place, as it is my school! The waiters are very well behaved, dressed in sherwani. All the utensils are of bronze, interior is dim lighted, even the AC is painted wooden to give a nawabi feeling. We ordered galawati kabab and Lucknowi paratha (as suggested by the waiter) followed by Rann Biriyani and Nehari Khas. Kabab was awesome, paratha is totally oil-free. rann biriyani is enough for two person. It has shreded mutton pieces but no egg and potato (it was not needed also) and the best part was the biriyani was cooked in ghee & not dalda. So there wasn't any oily or sticky feeling after washing the hands. Neagri khas had 4 mutton pieces. All the items were too good and the nawabi ambienece was so awesome that we wanted to stay more & so ordered firni. At last the provided finger bowl which contained lemon decorated with rose petals. Thanx to my friend who gave such a wonderful treat in nawabi style.

Terrific food,undoubtedly one of the best place to have oudhi cuisine,raan biriyani is too much,it's just heavenly,a small piece of humble request to Debaditya,if you really want to add value to the ambience by playing thumri/gazal in the background then please put a bit of your time and make a strict regimen on what is to be played on which day and the variation in it,otherwise it's probably reaching no where.for people like us ambience is a great appetizer too,and we have expectations from you,please do not let us down.

Location:- A bit difficult to locate for non localites. However there are few arrow tagging to help you out. You need to drop down at deshpriya park and walk by park till you see sharma sweets. Take a left turn into the lane nxt to it and walk straight you will find the restaurant.

Ambience:-
In one word its awesome. The interior are well decorated in old mughal style and paintings of kings in their coutyard. The whole are is illuminated with old nawabi style lanterns. Utensils are all bronze platted and waiters were dressed in sherwani.

Food:-

We ordered:-
1)Qalmi chicken kabab
2)Rann Biriyani
3) Murg irani

Qalmi chicken kabab:- large leg piece well marinated and tender and most importantantly tasty.

Rann Biriyani:- the biriyani are served in earthen pots. The biriyani is smoked in nawabi masala with chunks of mutton in it and just melts in mouth.

Murg irani:- its was a gravy item garnished with dry fruits with two large chunks of chicken.

Pocket pinch -1000 for two

Conclusion:- awesome place to dine in nawabi atmosphere. Though bit overpriced but worth it.

I visited this place during durga puja. The royal touch gives the restaurant an elegant look and therefore the expectations for the food were pretty high but it was kind of a let down. We ordered Galawati kabab with a lacha paratha. This starter was awesome and everyone must have this one if you visit this place. The awadhi handi biriyani was not so great , it was a mediocre biriyani and murgh irani was pretty much the same, the gravy just spoiled the taste of galawati kabab. Arsalan still remains my best place for biriyani. 3.5 star only for the starter and the environment.

Had a chance to enter this restaurant for lunch witha group of 4 friends on diwali. The music and the ambience will definitely take you back to 1590's. For starters we had Zafrani kabab(chicken)and kakori kabab(mutton). The chicken was tastier to me. In the main course we took awadhi handi biryani, gosht biryani and murgh pardah biryani and murgh irani and nehari khaas(mutton). Liked awadhi handi and murgh pardah biryani not to forget forget the gravy of murgh irani which was awespme of all. Yry the firni for desserts...i'm sure u have never tasted such firni before.

Yes I had been there and the experience is awesome. First off, superb ambience with awadhi style decor, music and furn. We have tried galoti and one more kebab as starters. Both were mouth watering. But I would keep Galoti inches ahead. And then the much awaited murg biriyani. Served from an earthen handi wrapped in foil. The aroma which first hit the senses was something that promised a superb taste. Its not like the traditional biriyani. It's different and a lot tasty with ample rice and chicken. One biriyani is well enough for two, although I was starving before that. The smell taste ingredients all were superb. The entire platter is a tasty treat. 
Ambience 9/10
Service 9/10
Food for 10/10
Price 8/10

Though its a bit on a higher side as far as price is concerned. But its worth it. My first visit was a too good an experience. Eagerly waiting for the next date with Oudh :-)

The wooden decor and turkish lights attract your attention, till you get the whiff of awadhi cuisine served inside. The food is awesome, worth the price you pay for it, which is a little north of what you shell out elsewhere. The nooks where they make you sit sometimes are too dark though, so no luck with photo sessions with friends.

This is undoubtedly the best biryani in the city. If you are a biryani lover and reading my review to find out if the place is worth it, then don't waste your time, rush to Oudh, they will not dishearten you. I went to this place on a saptami afternoon.Well we had to wait for 1.5hours but it was worth it. We had the galaoti kabab with the laknowi paratha. The kabab was of great quality and exquisite taste. Then we had the awadhi handi biryani and it was simply divine. This was a handi biryani with shredded mutton at it was enough for three of us. If you visit this place do not miss out the awadhi handi biryani because it is marvelous. I tried the firni one another day, and it was good but not magnificent.

A bit expensive , but definitely worth it. 
We tried Galwati kebab ( melts in your mouth ) and Rann Biriyani ( with shredded mutton/ chicken). 
Staffs were wearing traditional Mughal attire and the security guard had a huge but funny moustache. You will have great ambience and great hospitatlity. The manager himself comes at times to find whwther there is any difficulty. 

Not pocket friendly, but you must try it, as they will serve you the best Mughal food in town.

One day my bestie calls me up to day that a restro has opened near deshapriya park whuch serves cuiseines belongig to the mughal era. Awadhi food they serve. And they call themselves OUDH 1590. It sounded quite interesting, period dining in kolkata, seemed quite appealing to me. But awadhi would mean a lot of spices,  loads of oil and that does not suit my appetite.  Considering the connoisseur in me, both of us set out for thr cafe. The google map did help and we found the cafe. Just opposite deshapriya park on the sa
rat bose side. Oud 1590 struck us. And the outer look was appealing with all jhopri work. Entering it. The first thing that I notices were the guards looked like pathan pehredaars wearing surma. An amazing concept to give the whole feel. First day we could not enter as the kitchen was closed. So we planned to come back the next day, and this time we hurried. Finally entered. Amazingly done wood work all over. Mirror. Colourful chandeliers. Coloured belgium glass. Wooden worked furniture. Even the air conditioner had a wooden outlook. And beautiful mughal court paintings. You felt like you simply entered Akbar's court. The music played suited the whole ambience. Hindustani classicals, raag maalkosh was being played, thumris in iman filled my ears and my heart brimmed with fullness. 6 out of 5 for the decor and ambience. Then on opening the menu we saw experimental dishes in mughlai. We were thoroughly confused. The owner dressed in a black pathani suit , turban and surma turned up. Amazingly he was a bong. He suggested we try out galawati kebab with lucknowi paratha. The food arrived in copper utensils. Galawati kebab as the name suggested melted in the mouth and the non-oily lucknovi paratha made me feel that I was on cloud nine reqching for the heaven. It was amazingly great. Then we wanted main course, the owner then suggested us to try rann biryani, but I always stay away from biryanis,  so we went for lachchha paratha and nehari khaas. The nehari khaas used to be very light. A breakfast of the moghuls. The broth of the mutton with butter and cream made me feel ecstatic.  The awesome sweet mango chutney just complimented to it. We were full but hearts not being filled up with the great taste. Ordered for a shahi tukra. Its the best shahi tukra I have ever eaten in kolkata. Better than arsalan I would say. What I hate about mughlai is the excessive amount of oil and spices. But the food here had just the rigt amount of everything and it was non greasy and not so rich in spices. The mouth freshner that comes in a wooden box has 4 types of masalas in them and all of them equally tasty. Impressed, the next time I took my parents for dinner. We had burrah kebab. Theae were mutton chops with herbs and spices in the right amount.  For main course we had gosht kundan kaliya. Which eas amazing . Golden and creamy mutton and that went really well with the lucknovi paratha. Then of course we ordered for another speciality, the brain masala, made from the mutton brain. And it was amazing. This was the first time I had tried this and this tasted heaven. To end up with mom preferred firni. Loved it. I could not find out a single negative point about this restro. Full marks for authentic period dining,  quality of food beyond excellent,  ambience and decor is amazing and staffs overtly courteous.  I am going back again. This time for the sikandaari rann. I need atleast 6 friends to go together as it requires 6 people to finish this off and 18 hours of marination. See you soon. Waiting for 6 more hands.

AUTHENTIC is the word should be used to describe oudh 1590 ... 

ambience - an absolute winner, mughal theme kind of ambience with those dim light, and slow gazal type music on background , it sets the mood actually :) you will love this restaurant before having the food only for those ambience .. 

food - we took one raan biriani ( rs-395), mutton rogan josh ( rs- about 280) 1 naan ( rs- 65 )

quality and quantity - "one raan biriani is enough for 2 person " thats what they said to you but trust me it was not, you have to take side dish and atleast one naan .. though quality of the biriani was super tasty with shredded mutton leg pieces , aromatic and perfectly done, and i would say it was the 1st time that after having biriani i didnt have to wash my hand with soap to get rid of those excess smell and oil , love that :) , mutton rogan josh and naan was also very good , but biriani was the champion 

pricing - these cost around 900 for us, expensive for the quantity they serve , but no doubt about quality .. 

ambience - 5
food quality - 4.5
food quantity- 3 
pricing - 3

overall , not for frequent visit place for the college going person like me , but definitely deserve a try.. i love this joint and surely will visit again 
recommended :)

Unfortunate I am. Such a highly acclaimed Restaurant in zomato had my expectations soaring sky high. Went with my parents to treat them to the Moghul Era, as they say. Ordered the Nawabi Kebab Platter and Awadhi handi biriyani as per zomato reviewers. The Kebab Platter was excellent. Specially the Mutton, excellent! I was very satisfied. Chicken was also good and the Prawns too. The aroma and taste was yummylicious. Then came to earthen pots filled with the Biriyani. In my family we take Biriyani very seriously. I carefully served us all and with the dim lights I had a doubt the rice was overcooked but I didnot jump to conclusions. i wanted to taste for myself and comment. And alas! The rice was indeed overcooked so much so that, it was sticky n soft. What a turn down! What a disappointment! We barely went through the First Handi n tried the second to see whether it was better than the first handi or not. More disappointment. This one had a sour taste almost a bit stale to our palette. It was time to call their waiter. I did. We explained and asked them to taste it for themselves. There was no contempt. Not even a single apology. Now this behaviour was too much to take. I expected they would see it for themselves and offer a new handi as it was 80% untouched but all they did after visiting kitchen and discussing with chef (may be) was to come back and ask us, would you like to order anything else. We answered no and then to our shock he said, Shall I pack this biriyani for you! My father gave the apt reply -- We cannot eat it here, there is no question of taking this home.
The 2.0 marking is only for their ambiance and mutton preparation which were good even in the biriyani. If I am to suggest this place, it will only be  for the mutton dishes alone. Hugely disappointed otherwise.

After i had seen advertisement and praise for this restaurant i took my parents to taste the awadhi/lukhnowi biriyani. But we were very much dissapointed as the biriyani was same as kolkatan biriyani with a potato in it. The tandori roti was burnt. The chickenside dish was good. The ambiance was appreciable also the behaviour of the stuffs.

Finally visited this place after a long wait. Having heard such killer reviews about the place , my expectations were a little on the higher side. We had the Kakori kabab , Galawati kabab and Raan Biriyani.
Loved the Galawati kabab. However was a little thwarted to taste the biriyani , cant blame me I was told that it was the best biriyani in town. However something should definitely be said about the setting. Imagine yourself in the 1920s in a Babu's Lucknow Haveli and voila you'll have the interiors of Oudh. Also , beautiful classical music.
Food : 2.5/5
Ambience : 4/5. (Plus 1 for music (: )
One should visit Oudh just for the period dining feel if not for the food.

Oudh is one of those treasure troves which you happen to dig out in an otherwise neglected lane in deshapriya park . The concept of period dining was enticing enough . The ambience was awesome . The decor and music pertains to the nawabi them . So is the cuisine . We ordered for Qalmi kebab , murgh parda biriyani , phirni , gajar ka halwa and shahi tukda . Was slightly dissappointed with the biriyani but it was not bad either . Rest of the dishes were awesome . Would love to come here again :)

A cuisine choice that is not found round the corner of every street, Oudh serves "Awadhi" food, that constitutes beautiful flavours from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Right from the starters to the dessert, all preparations use a mix of ingredients that would initially make you ponder over whether or not to go for it but ends up surprising you pleasantly.
I would definitely recommend this one if you're having spicy meat and kabab cravings. The wide range of biriyanis are to die for!

Oudh 1590 - good but not so great food.
The Fish zafrani kebab was good unlike the galauti kebab. The Biriyanis were nice and different. Mutton was done quite well
 The service however is worth a mention....amazingly horrible, even if you are shelling out quite some amount of money, you will feel as if they are doing you a favour by offering you a table. Well the foodie that I am...I think I will manage to find some other restaurant where we feel welcome. As Vir Sangvi once wrote it's not the food that is memorable it's the service and the people managing it.

Galawati kebab,lucknowi parantha, Awadhi handi biriyani,raan biriyani -all these dishes are worth dying for.Infact, all their recipes are mind blowing still the most important point which I would like to mention here is I have been to very few places where the staff is so courteous.

**Location = Deshapriya Park, just beside the Carmel Primary School.

**Brief = It was panchami and we were pandal hopping. I was accompanied by 5 pretty ladies and we tried for a reservation but they said as because of puja rush,they are providing First Come First Serve.We reached there at about 3 pm and had to wait for 30 minutes to get a call inside.

**Ambiance = The decoration is awesome with a awadhi theme everywhere from the lights,walls to the cutlery. But I found the place a bit dimly lit.

**Things tried = We were very hungry and the waiting made things worse,so we directly jumped into the mains skipping the starters.
We ordered butter nuns,paneer rezala,murgh irani,awadhi handi biriyani,jheenga biriyani along with fresh lime sodas for each of us.

Awadhi handi biriyani(mutton) and jheenga biriyani were superb and had huge quantities. They came in claypots and it gave a nice look to it. The nuns were very buttery. But the stealers was the paneer rezala, after long long time I have tasted such brilliant rezala, I still remember the taste :P

We thought of having the shahi tukra in desserts but they said in the puja menu they dont have it and can give only firnis.The firni was good and tasty.

**Recommended = Awadhi handi biriyani, rezalas,kebabs.

**Purse check = Our bill came around Rs.2500/- inclusive of taxes. I would say Rs.900/- for 2 people will be good.

**Overall = Oudh has made a special place in my heart and will be visiting it more often now. Cheers !

We were pandal hopping during this year's puja when we decided to visit this place for lunch. The thing that lured me to this place was gelauti kabab as I have not found a good place in kolkata serving gelauti kabab.
As I entered the restaurant, I was greeted by an ambience worthy of the name and time. It has the perfect mughal look with nice song being played in the background.
We ordered gelauti kabab, raan biryani, nehari khaas and paratha. The kababs just melted in the mouth. I have had gelauti in few places in Delhi and this was simply at par with them. The other dishes were also very good.
I would go to this place again. The staff was courteous and apologized for the late service due to puja rush. Overall excellent food and great value for money.

I went for Shosthi lunch in Oudh 1590. 
Atmosphere: I understand that the dim light environment goes according to the theme, but it should enlighten corner tables also. As I got the corner table, it was really very hard for me to make out the color of the food.
Food: I have ordered Mutton Galawati Kebab, Raan Biriyani, Gosht  Roghan Josh and Firni. Last two dishes were really awesome, but the other two were not up to the mark.
Service: The staffs were cordial and service was prompt.
I had very high expectations from this theme restaurant, but Oudh 1590 couldn't reach to that level.

After my first visit I was deeply overwhelmed with oudh.
Fantastic  food with  amazing ambience put forwarded a greatest combination.

After my second visit it was the opposite reaction.
the biriyani was not upto the mark.And the kebab was horrible.
I am extremely disappointed with this outing.

Heard about Oudh from a friend and went there following his recommendation. The decor well, lets say the management has gone several extra miles to ensure the period dining experience is an experience in every sense of the word. We started with the galawti kebab and went onto awadhi handi biryani. The meats were tender beyond imagination and the flavour...(my friend who is sitting beside me right now has officially egged me again to visit Oudh again this weekend)... Rarely have I had Dum Pukht cooking made truly the way its ought to be made. Having tried biryanis across the town and across the length and breadth of the country including the fabled hyderabadi versions I would rank Oudh as one who can give any biryani a real chase for the money but then again taste is as subjective as it comes. There is more, the mutton roghan josh. It was a bit of a let down because i have had roghan josh which quite frankly was as hot as the surface of mercury. This one was spicy as well but less. No questions raised about the taste. It was 10/10. The enchanting bit was the phirni. I myself gobbled down 4 of them. It is AMAZING to say the least. This place is right up there in my list of restaurants. Kudos to the management and staff.

Pujo and food are 2 words with the same meaning for us bengalis..we even go to the extent of calling it 'Pet pujo'...this one time of the year when we dont follow a diet chart and the best thing being we are not even guilty!
Oshtomi celebrations for me started at around 8pm...yes dinner time! Coz i am not fond of pandal hopping..and the only thing that motivated me to move out of home was food..
Oudh 1590 it was....after all the rave reviews.
Our waiting time was almost 2 hrs..but the food later made up for all the grievances.
For starters we ordered 'Shahi Tangri Kabab' succulent pieces of chicken legs marinated in an aromatic masala, slow burnt and tipped with mild rose water.
'Zafrani kabab' though i am not a fan of fish but this was just right ...juicy pieces of grilled bekti most importantly ,fresh!
'Galawati kabab' mince meat pattys i believe what Oudh 1590 is famous for..i am not a meat eater but according to my friends it was absolutely tender and delicious.
For main course we ordered 'Jheenga biryani' a very light, fragrant biryani with generous pieces of fresh prawns..it was the best i had so far..lip smacking. We ordered 'Murgh Irani' to go with the biryani ( though the biryani itself is so good you really dont need anythn else) which was equally tasty..the gravy was thick and full of flavor just about appropriately seasoned.
The famous 'Raan Biryani' was also ordered by my friends, the meat was tender and well spiced.
We ended the lavish affair on a sweet note 'Phirni'..brilliant way to end.

One of the best restaurants to provide an authentic awadhi flavour in the heart of kolkata.. Right from their starters- the chicken zafraani kebab, you get the feeling that this is the food for a royal family.. We had murgh pardah biriyani, which was sumptutuous, to say the least.. However, remember, there is no potato in murgh pardah biriyani, so beware of that.. 
Overall, i would have to say, Oudh 1590 gives you food which you won't forget easily..

After our first puja outing we decided to have our food at this place..heard a lot about it..the food is outstanding and even the ambience..me with my bunch of friends waited for long as there was a long waiting list for lunch..

we had butter nan,paneer rezala,murg irani, awadhi handi biriyani , jheenga biriyani ,with soda shikanji to quench our thirst...each item was deliciously made..biriyanis were out of this world..i have become a fan of their biriyani..even murg irani and paneer rezala was awesomee..and their complimentary raita was tastyyy.awadhi handi was one of a kind..jheenga with those fresh river prawns are a great combo..in the desserts we had phirni..it was too good to be true..great food..i would say finger licking and lip smacking ones..

service is great..staff is friendly,cordial behaviour..lovely ambience..i loved the food..had a gala time..will be coming here soon..!!!

My only regret: they have a huge fan following so, the waiters there soon start to hum-ho about the time you take to eat. We started at 1pm (the service) and we were done by 2pm. Another 10 mins we took to clear the cheque and to wash our fingers. And then! The staff suddenly became so restless that one of them asked us "are you guys done?". After a blissful meal at Oudh 1590, this isn't what you really expect. All the aromas and the spices seem to just wane with that particular 'poke'. Eating food at any restaurant, these days, has become an experience. A little patience from the staff would've meant a lot to me and my friends. Oudh 1590 won't really lose its loyal customers, but when the staff start to take them for granted, then, the downfall has just started! And oh! Did we tell you? We had a hair in our Gilauti kebab? Although readily discarded and were served a fresh plate soon.
And I don't really buy any argument that there were many outside waiting to eat. My point is: we weren't really having a free lunch there. However little or big amount we spend, we are spending our hard-earned money and you are also earning it through hardwork. So please maintain that spirit of good food experience. My earnest request!

Looking for some great tasting Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines with a dash of royale feel , then Oudh 1590 is your destination. 

Located in the juncture of Lake Market and Manoharpukur Road just close to Carmel Primary School , the management have genuinely tried creating the old age heritage Mughal feel. Be it the ambience,dim lights,the distinctive old age tunes and songs (which you only relate to hearing in the fort and fighting medieval movies),interior architecture, the hugely big & heavy menu card, the brass glasses or the kurta wearing waiters, you feel like you have come into quite a number of eras before.

We ordered Galouti kabab with ulta tawa ka paratha and soda sikhanji, followed by Raan Biryani and firnis. The taste of the food was outstanding. Totally prepared with ghee and 1 plate enough to meet the ends of 2, the Raan biryani is just awesome,the tender mutton pieces still makes me yearn for it. The firni too was very nice.\

The waiters are polite,service is quick to medium and the pocket pinch is from mid to high. 2 people food costed me 1300 ... but overall i can say its just PURE BLISS!!!

Definitely coming back !

================================

Just edited this piece below , after my 1st visit as mentioned above i have had food here for more than 3-4 times . One thing that you definitely cannot miss is their Tandoori Chicken, the best i had till date. Too good. Not to forget the zafrani kabab too. Also 1 thing i would like to mention is their Badam Sharbat, not sure if they serve it all year or it was only during the Biryani Festival held last month, but whatever it was,it was heavenly. 

Will keep on coming back !!

I had picked Oudh 1590 for my Birthday dinner this March.  The restaurant interior is beautiful, however it's comparatively quite small. The decor is nicely done and the lights and ambiance give a rich sort of Mughal feel to the place. We ordered the aam panna drink which was followed by:
1. Lamb Galwati kabab which is accompanied by the Lucknowi paratha - The kababs were soft and melted in your mouth, but it was the paratha that stole the show. Thin and crisp and beautiful baked.
2. Awadhi Handi Biryani - One handi is enough for 2 people. Delicious meat pieces and fluffy fragrant rice.
3. Dal ghosht - Sumptuous and the mutton was tender
4. Nahari Khaas - Their signature dish, really well-coked Nahari I must say.
5. Gajar ka halwa - YUMMY!

The last to come was Shahi Tukda..but that came as a surprise birthday thingy..they served it up with a candle and didn't charge us either :D Also loved the 'masale ka dibba' they offer after the meal..a four-caged box of mouth-freshners and palate cleansers

Verdict: I would definitely go back again. The food was delicious, well cooked and not too spicy. Service was very good and the servers were polite and well-informed. The pocket pinch is on the medium-to-high side but nothing extraordinary. Definitely going back.

Excellent taste and ambiance, had dinner like a Nawab.. Lucknowi Paratha and Galouti Kabab is a must try. For biryani lovers, this is the place when you are tired of Arsalan and Shiraz. Authentic Awadhi biryani and you can literally find the smell of ghee and saffron. Waiters are really helpful and guide you to take the best dish. Only problem is the space, so expect to wait during peak hours. Hope to come again soon..

This place was in my checklist for quite a time..we went there Saturday night for dinner.. Almost waited 1 hr for the table. 

We ordered two mocktails with chicken reshmi kebab and gilauti kebab..and then pardah biriyani and luknowi paratha with kadai chicken.. 

Loved loved  n loved the mocktails.. The reshmi kebab was soft and perfectly done.. Pardah biriyani is just a fake.. They really doesn't cook it like that.. They just put a piece of dough covering the biriyani and then while serving dig that and serve the biriyani.. So that was not quite pleasing but the biriyani was good.. As in healthy with less oil..

But since the place is too small and waiting kills my eagerness to eat I think it remain a single time visit for me..

Very hospitable.. The place is little small and gets crowded. Long wait can be an issue. The management isn't bothered to solve that. I wasn't excited after having food. Something makes you feel that the food quality was not up to the mark. I believe quantity is questionable for the price.
More so the host don't seem to listen to it's customers nowadays. People have filled their ears with false praise and they have become too proud to even listen. Beware of them being pretentious and bring in a raw dough wrapped biriyani.

The Murgh Parda Biriyani was amazing with the right flavours and pices of chicken in it were tender and with right amount of spices. Loved the ambiance and the over-all experience was extremely nice. The behavior of the staff was also very nice and food was served in exactly 20 mins from placing the order. Don't miss this one!! (y)

So randomly ordered after a friend recommended a few months ago. I ordered a mutton handi biryani. Brain masala. And a nehari. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the quality of food provided. The brain was fantastic. One downer was that the curries had a lot of oil which i had to drain out. Else it was super awadhi food.

Bliss! One of the best places in the city serving mughlai food! For starters it was galauti kebab and that's better than what I have had in Lucknow! The reshmi kebab was soft and yummy :) we had the parda biryani and some mutton preparation for main course... The biryani has become one of my favorites! The mutton was good too... Last but not the least... Shahi tukra and yes it was outstanding! The only thing that was sad was a veg galouti kebab packed for home! But yes it is definitely worth a visit!

Been there yesterday for dinner..what a waste...talking about the ambience...its traditional with Lucknowi decors but nothing extra ordinary as seating space is very compact. And ambience doesn’t matter if the food is not good. For starters we ordered Galawti kebab and Afghani  murgh..it was okayish..next we odrered Murgh Purdah Biriyani,Pea pulao,Murgh Irani and Chicken Rezala for our main couse out of which Murgh Purdah biriyani tasted good but nothing out of the world..then comes Chicken rezala which was really bad..besides.. all other food items were average..Food over here isn’t worth the money(considering the pocket pinching price)..had really  good food in different restaurants  at relatively low price..I am really amazed that people are writing good stuffs about this restaurant...not going to visit it again...thumbs down from my side.!!

This has been on wishlist for quite sometime now. Finally managed to drop in there with the gang of friends. Liked the ambience at the first look, do not have too many covers, hence was nice and comfortable, interiors would take you back to the old era. For the food - of the lot we ordered what stood out for me was Chicken Zaffrani Tikka and Chicken Pardah Biryani. While the former was soft, non spicy and melted in our mouth, the Biryani acted as a complete contrast to what we fellow Calcuttans are accustomed to, it was juicy and spicy and light on our stomach at the same time. For the main course we settled for Murg Iranian, which was nice but didn't stood out of the lot. Services was very pleasant from the time we reached there.

The only negative was the background music that kept playing found it a bit irritating and disturbing when one is out for dinner with friends, as its not only the food but the quality time spent with friends as well. ????

Have eaten and ordered from Oudh 1590 several times. They have been consistent in overall taste of food and have always served tender big chunks of good quality meats. The must orders include:
1. Raan Biriyani
2. Galouti kebab
3. Nawab Kebab Platter - consists of mutton burra and kakori kebabs, mahi tikka and zafrani and murgh afghani. Love the concoction of aromatic spices and meat / keema bringing out rich flavours of Awadhi/Mughlai cuisine!
4. Gosht/Murg Chaap- Rich and flavoursome, compliments the Biriyani perfectly.
5. Murg Mussalam- For the kind who like it on the sweeter side, this leg of chicken is stuffed with dry fruits and cooked in a cashew paste. An absolute delight! 

Mostly, we ve been so full with the food after every meal that we haven't ever had space for their desserts! Service is prompt and courteous. This is on my 'list of places to visit' every time I go back to Kolkata. By far, I would rate Oudh, the best in terms of Awadhi cuisine when it comes to providing a wholesome fine dining experience. 

Pocket pinch : Rs 2000 for two

My take on Oudh 1590

Ordered for ( as advised by the waiter)
1) Galwati Kabab: U will be getting 4 kababs. Best to eat with Lachha parathas. 
2) Lachha Parathas: They slice it into 4 pieces. One paratha is good enough for 2 people as a starter
3) Rann Biriyani: It has shredded mutton which makes it a bit different. 
4) Murgh Irani: It has 2 big chicken pieces. 
5) Nihari gosht ( was suggested but we didnt order)
6) Shahi Tukra as a dessert: Too sweet and probably the most overrated item in the menu

Food Quality: Good but nothing exceptional
Pocket Pinch: Considerably high

Service: Good

There are 3 things which i feel must be reviewed by the management:
1) Ambience: The place is dimly lit and small. Space is a big issue. The waiters are made to wear black kurtas to fit into this awadhi atmosphere but i felt that their clothes were unclean and was a big setback. Otherwise service was quite prompt and the waiters were very friendly.

2) Plating: They really need to improve their plating. The plates looked unclean and i felt as if i was being served at a local biriyani shop. Plating the food is an art in itself which needs to implemented in this place. The biriyani cme in handi which was covered by an aluminium foil. The shahi tukra could have been plated in an innovative way.

3) Price: The food was extremely over priced. I would rather visit Flame and Grill or BBQ Nation to get thrice the quantity at a similar price range.

The only reason for such rating is for a simple home delivery i had to call them 4 times. 2 times they didnt receive my call.. and 2 times that they received ny call they said that there was a lot of pressure so they cant talk they will call back..after waiting for almost 10 mins they called back and took thw order. delivery was on time. ....the mutton awadi biriyani was good. .and along with that kakori kebabs and galouti kebab which i feel ahould have been cooked well because i could smell the raw spices.. 
hope these few thinga will be taken care of ..overall...biriyani worth trying. .

Food was excellent but was a little concerned with the seating arrangement , request all staff not to consider favors while seating but treat all on first come first serve basis or phone and net reservations....
Food served was not planned as had to wait 15 mints for next serving order management was hopeless even with no rush however it was improved 100 fold when another staff was deployed which was most efficient...
The Kababs were par excellence......the dum briyani had the authentic aroma and flavors ...one of the best fine dining available with ample room for improvement on the service side

To startwith the positives the Kababs were out of this world, moist, succulent and melt in your mouth including the mutton ones (we had the Burrah kabab), the Murgh Irani was simply brillint with the delicate flavours of the spices shining thorough a rich yet not palate-killing gravy. 

What disappointed me was the Awadhi Handi Biriyani, with a slightly strong aroma of Kewra / Atar kind of over powering the other fragrance of the spices, and a wee bit dry considering it's supposed to be a Dum -pukht. More-over since I had the Lucknowi biriyani from Arsalan just a couple of weeks earlier, Oudh (as far as only the Biriyani is concerned)  had a  high expectation to live up to. Same goes with the Firni, good but you've had this umpteen times before.

Service was average-good, nothing much to wriite home about. Overall  a good experience, would definitely suggest a visit, but maybe  avoid the Biriyni trail. The bill of about Rs 2800/- felt money well spent for four of us.

Oudh 1590 gives you a feel of 'Shahi Khana'. The food is of Lucknow style. We had been planning to visit Oudh for quiet sometime and finally it was successful. Now Let's talk about the food. Galawati Kabab (mutton) is their speciality, that we had ordered for starters. And it was just wow. Its my favorite dish by the way. It's soft, melts in the mouth as u take a bite of it. Not very salty. It's a must try when u come to Oudh. Qalmi kabab was also very good. For main course we ordered Awadhi Biriyani. That's their speciality as well. It was more than enough for 2 people. Comes in a small pot. Not at all spicy not very oily and very yummy. To end with for dessert had an awesome Gajar ka Halwa. That wasn't available when we had gone but was made on a special request.
The ambiance is very soothing, the soft music the dim lights makes the place looks perfect. 
But I had to take away half marks for their sitting capacity which is very less and their service. It's very slow.
But still I am ready to look over all the cons n definitely going back to Oudh 1590. 
Bon Appetite !!

The ambiance is nice does give u that feeling of the royal feeling but the seating is the opposite not very comfortable well the entrance door  gives you the feeling of the olden days but to you surprise ???? the restaurant is smaller than a person can think but who's complainin
The food however is verrrrry  yummlious the kalmi is a must try dish, the quantity n quality of the food ???? is worth the money and between the drinks the aam panna is again a must try the galauti kebab is mouth watering (mutton)
Overall a great place to go for awadh delicacies
The only place the lose a bit is in seating
My earlier review was of 4.5 now it's 1.5 reason it's quite a shocking one
When we finished our lunch we asked the staff to pack the food  that was left, to my shock the staff tellz me he cant pack the food  as it's jhoota(half eaten left over food)  I was shocked  but still said no problems get me a container will pack it myself he said shamelessly it will be charged at 7rs I still said ok no problem
The next thing he does is gets it n just leaves it on the table
Atleast he could have packed it but he did not he was just interested in getting the bill payed
I mean such a thing I have never heard that "we don't pack leftover food " this really pathetic very very cheap it's shocking for such a restaurant  to do such cheapness and behaving in this manner
Really people next time if u guys go n want to get sum food that's left over packed think again
Even a 5star restaurant  or even a roadside food joint would pack the leftover food
Well all I have to say that a small roadside food joint also would not do such cheap behaviour
A restaurant of such high standards did not expect this at all really saddening.......

After a hectic puja shopping me and my wife had a lunch here. The place designed to look like Lucknow on those days( most probably :) ). The food is just awesome. We ordered Soda Shikanji, Galwati Kebab (heavenly and  for me its a MUST for next time), Rann Biriyani and Nihari Khas. Rann biriyani is beautiful. On the comparison Nihari Khas is bit average.   



Service is good and quick. Price is bit on higher side but as per the quality and quantity matters it's ok.



 Today there was a get to gather of a group of ladies and they were actually ruining the ambiance of the place. So one request to oudh management- please try to separate the place in case of large groups because every wants to enjoy their meal. 

Overall - Good experience.

This is a themed restaurant. The place is designed to look like the Lucknow of those times. The waiters are also dressed for the occasion. Just a point, the place is small. The dining area is very cramped for space. But the food is nice. Loved the biryani, which they serve in a earthen pot. Also the gulati kebab and the paranthas. They are to die for! Overall a nice place to visit, even if just for the ambience.

Finally the search for a good Biriyani in Kolkata is over.was planning for long to visit this place but made it happen today.The amm khass was refreshing beyond imagination.Biriyani was neither too oily nor too dry,perfect Lucknowi style.The Gosht Kundani Kaliya,although oily was yummy and the meat was well cooked and tender.FInally the Firni,it literally melts in your mouth.The Nawabi era environment and the soft sound of Thumri made this a complete food experience...!!

This place was on my wishlist for a long time.
Finally managed to drop there last Sunday around 2.00pm. 
2 of got place without any waiting. 

Ok . Lets go sequentially.  
Location: the place is located at Deshapriya park just opposite to junior section of carmel convent. The ground floor portion of the building that has been converted to Oudh 1590 appeared much like a durga puja pandal from outside to me. The mouchwale uncle at the door suits the decor. Lets come to the inside of the eat out junction. The decor is pretty with colourful glasses, dimmed lighting, metallic crockeries.  Can't resist from mentioning the chutneys and accompaniments were just awesome. 
We ordered Galawti kebab and lukhnowi paratha and that was better than my expectation!Crispy parathas n mouth melting kebabs make the perfect match. Just awesome! Our hearts were already soo happy we had lime soda to move on to the next course of the day.
We ordered dum pukht gosht biriyani and irani murgh. Irani murgh was too spicy for me though. The biriyani seemed perfect with mild spicing and delicious aroma. Loved it. We were too full to try firni. 
To summarise:
Food : too good 
Price: slightly on the higher side,still makes one happy !

Excellent food, very well served and extremely courteous staff sums up the experience.
I have been to Oudh 3-4 time now and have found the experience to be superb everytime. My order normally consists of Galawati kabab with Parantha, Murg Parda Biriyani and phirni. True to its name, Oudh prepares the best Galawati kabab in town. I have studied in Lucknow for 2 years and have tasted the real Galawati kabab. No wonder both taste almost same, except oudh does it in a much better style. And for those who swear by Kolkat's biriyani, let me start by saying I find it quite ordinary. Before challenging this statement of mine, try the murg Parda Biriyani served in Oudh. I have challenged many a friends to this already and have come back victorious (and happily content) everytime. The aroma of the biriyani and the taste is unlike anything served anywhere. Try it to believe it...

Ambiance is real good. Little smaller in size. Somehow, I felt, the waiters doesn't know, after eating starter, the plates are needed to be changed for the Main course.

I had a plate of Tangri kebab and Mutton Awadhi Biryani. Food was good in quality, but taste of Biriyani was not satisfactory to me. I had Birwani in almost all A grade Mooghlai restaurants. Dawat-e-Shiraz stands far ahead of all. Even considering Oudh 1590. Oudh's biryani was missing the quality of Rice I see in all good quality mooghlai restaurants. I had, Biryani in Arsalaan, Nizam, Amenia, Naushijaan, Alibaba. Being a connoisseur of Biryani, I had great expectation from Oudh, but they failed to come to even closer. Mutton was not of very soft at all. I am really dishearten with my experience.

I wish to visit once more to tryout other items although.

Oudh 1590 is an authentic food joint for biriyani lovers. Situated near Deshapriya park, it is inside a small lane right opposite to Carmel primary school. Now the main thing, food is just too good. We had Runn biriyani and Galwati kebabs, which were equally mouth watering and delicious. The ambience and decore will give you a vivid glimpse of nawabi culture. The biriyani is too good to be missed. Wide range of kebabs and awadhi delicacies will surely satisfy your mughlai appetite.

ever since i had their food am dying to write a review. what food man! the small seated extremely well decorated restaurant is a gastronomical delight. its situated opposite to the carmel primary school, i.e around the lake market area. if i have to describe their food , delicious would be less said. we have taken tangri kebab! i still relish its taste. then we have ordered murgh biryani. they serve 2 pieces of well cooked chiken in it along with a potato and its quite sufficient for a normal person But those who eat unusually :p i would suggest awadhi handi biryani or raan biryani...the quantity of rice is huge in them. if you take one it would be enough for 2 people. As side dish we took gosht kundan kalia. Trust me i have had never tasted such well cooked aromatic spicy yet light mutton recipe.  Even their sweet lime soda is somewhat different. The waiters are extremely courtetous and friendly.  They help in suggesting food and actually they suggest good. The atmosphere is quite aesthetic...but i would not mind if they brighthen up the place a bit. I would suggest people stop running to parkstreet and for once be here you will forget the rest of the world.

Worst experience till date. They maintain a VIP  culture where if you know the " boss " you get a seat else be prepared to wait for at least 1.5 hours and see " boss ke friends" getting a seat before you. The waiters are not at all groomed especially Partho guy who thinks he owns the place. If the "boss" of Oudh 1590 is reading this then it is my sincere request that please take note of my experience and take necessary actions. Moreover, dear fellow (prospective) customers please think at least four times before choosing this place for some quality family time. It might turn into a nightmare!

The quaint little 40 seater awadhi cuisine restaurant is a gastronomic delight, especially for non veg people. Set in a laid back south kolkata locale off sarat bose road, oudh 1590 has full value for money . Satisfactory service & ambience ensure that the outing is a pleasure. The pinch on the pocket makes sure one goes back time & again. Rating 3

I have to write the review of this restaurant!!! Do I have the audacity enough to rate this joint?? I believe I surely don't have it.. 

1. Ambiance- Okay nothing is better than Indian Culture and Tradition.. wherever you may be, whatever culture you have adapted yourself to, if you have an Indian root you cannot be of any other culture... You admire it, you respect it...but u'll always be enticed by your roots... This is what Oudh 1590 has made me realize.. the tradition that they portray there is simply fantastic!!! Everything there is simply traditional and nostalgic... The crockery set, wall designs, lamp shades are enough to make you nostalgic... u'll start relating yourself to your History Books (that are now in a pile of dust)...of the big nawaabs and rajas!! Those who haven't visited this joint yet, start reading the history books... you will relate yourself better.. Be seated there and u'll b pampered as the same!! coming to menu card I have just only and only one thing to say!! this is by far the heaviest menu card that I've ever carried! :P ;) :P 


2. Food- just a sentence........ ITS JUST AWESOME!!!! NO OTHER ADJECTIVES ARE THERE TO DEFINE IT... AND I WON'T DEFINE IT EITHER.. visit this place and mesmerize yourself.... get the true taste of naawaabi food and just for an hour or so be a naawaab.. :) whats wrong in dreaming?? ;)

Hi foodies,
Well visited this joint on a recommendation of a friend, and am glad I did visit the place. The food here is awesome. There might be a space crunch if you go in a big group of 10, but the decor is pretty nice. Now coming to food, we ordered Galouti kabab, Fish Tikka and Grilled chicken for starters. Each of the three were really good. For main course, we had Moti Biryani, Mutton nihari. Excellent quantity and joy for taste buds.
Service was swift and good
Highly recommended !

the first and foremost thing which i like mention before giving any broad description is that Oudh 1590 is amazingly mind blowing. We entered into this joint around 2.30 on 06/08/2014. It was quite hassle free at that time as it was a busy weekday afternoon. This restaurant is truly classy and elegant as far as its decor  (internal and external) is concerned.  They maintained a elegant Awadhi touch on everything, infact the attendants also put up black Sherwani.. They used dim light for their decor inside  and entire  furniture which is wooden was perfectly complimentary to its decor and Indian classical music ( Luckhnow ghrana) at the backdrop will definitely give you a good feelings. Later, I noticed that they used designer brass utensils. 

Now coming to the food. We had Qalmi Kabab as a starter. It was prepared with the help of white cream and it was not so spicy. I must accept the fact that it was really perfect as the chicken was soft and tender and well marinated. Then We had Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Murfg Irani. Awadhi Handi Biriyani was served with Raita and it looked perfect. This biriyani had been served with two mutton pieces and two eggs and the colour of this Biriyani was light saffron. The taste of this Biriyani was perfect and the mutton was soft and  easily edible. The Murgh Irani was soft and juicy and I must accept this fact that the gravy was out of the world. Then we had Firni which was also equally satisfying in terms of taste and smell. 
Staffs were truly hospitable and took care of every thick and thin. In fact they suggested us to have Murgh Irani with this Biriyani.  
Our total bill was 1093 with VAT and service tax but, it is value for money. After having such a sumptuous meal, you are not going to repent for a single penny.  I really did not find any flaw and the time was perfect. I  did not click any pictures as I was enjoying the atmosphere. 
A special Thumbs Up for this restaurant.

One of my friends returned from Delhi and we were roaming about DP when we came across this place and excess hunger threw us to this place instantly. The ambiance is of the old nawabi style and was very much stylish. The food is exceptionally good, spicy and masaldar. The raan biriyani is just excellent and exquisite. The quantity is not very much, but the quality is fulfilling and can very much content you. A mouth-storming Lucknowi cuisine with the Lucknowi parantha......was just brilliant. I believe this place should be checked at least once and should be on the list of every foodie across Kolkata who likes and just loves to explore their taste buds.

I had the chance to go to this place a few days back after some word of mouth and I must say I made the right decision. We were able to get seated immediately led the their manager. The menu book is huge. I m not a mutton eater at all and I stay away from it. But the waiter recommended we try it. We ordered gelawati kebab with lucknowoi paratha. The gelawati kebab was out of this world. I could eat it all day(though it will not b helpfull)....it melts in your mouth. For mains, we ordered awadhi handi Biriyani. A single one is more than enough for two people. Don't ask me about taste as I can't differentiate biriyanis. But my friend told me it was lipsmacking....! I m going again there this week to enjoy d dlcs food.

I wanted to have a taste of Murg Mussallam... so i went for Oudh as people on suggesting me to have mughlai food from this restaurant. The quality of chicken was very poor and the dish was half cooked. Biriyani is so so... couldnt come close to Arsalan. The mutton kasa we ordered was also half cooked. I would not recomend anyone to go and eat Oudh s biriyani. Instead u can go to Arsalan.

I am writing this review after couple of visits to Oudh. On my first visit, we had Galawati Kabab, Fish Tikka, Lucknowi Paratha, and a couple of other items from the chicken and mutton main dishes section. We were very much satisfied by the quality of food & service and hence decided to pay in a second visit. This time we tried Mutton Biryani & Chicken Chap. Though the biryani was made quite well, everything was spoiled just because of the fact that the quality of the rice was poor. It is the normal rice we eat at home, not the thin long grain rice we generally use for Biryani. The chicken chap tasted too sour because of too much generous use of curd. Overall, if I again pay a visit, I will stay away from the biryani dishes.

After going through all rave reviews on Zomato I decided to take my mom and dad to this restaurant for a Sunday lunch. We reached around 12:30 and delighted to see the restaurant reasonably empty. Staffs were courteous and offered us a table in the corner. We had already decided on the our choice and ordered the following
- gelawati kebab
- luckhnowi paratha
- burrah kebab
- handi biriyani
- nihari khas
- firni
I am a big fan of kebab and liked gelawati kebab. The paratha was thin and tasty. Burrah kebab was ordered since my dad didn't like gelawati. Burrah kebab was nice. Bihari khas was really tasty with appropriately rich in spices. I also loved the biriyani which different from the kind of biriyani we get in Kolkata. Biriyani portion was good for two. Lastly firni was perfect desert for this sumptuous lunch. Overall food was really tasty. To add to this service was prompt. I will surely revisit this place to try other delicacies listed in the menu.

Shahi tukra was fabulous.the place is too small so long waiting time.there is no need to put a gatekeepeer with such a moustache who only thinks of tips and his attitude tells that.the three points i have due to food.again went on 2nd August and had nihari khaas raan biryani and kebab platter.kebab platter is excellent and right for two people.nihari khaas was good with lucknowi parantha but the biryani was different and mind blowing.The only sore point is that people there needs to understand what to serve at what stage and not hurry.another is whatever you create if there are bad people who behave rudely will slowly give a bad name to the place like the pan shop besides it who behaves like a local dada.when a car parks in front of the he barks as if it is his right and no one can park any vehicle there and i have heard he is supported by the owner there.throughout the country i have seen all paan shops near any food joint want people to park their car bikes near their shop.anyways probably it is the attitude of the people of this city. Only good thing is food and the courteous behaviour of the servers rest all is mediocre.

An evening with friends + desire to have some authentic Awadhi cuisine + hopping near Gariahat = Oudh 1590. It was my 3rd visit to the place. Honestly the decoration of this joint attracts me a lot. The hall, lights, paintings, music…everything is in its own way creating the impact. This time, we ordered Lucknowi Paratha, Nargisi Kofta and Moti Biryani for the main course and Shahi Tukra for dessert.

Lucknowi Paratha and Nargisi Kofta: outstanding combination. The dish was mind blowing tasty.

Moti Biryani: different in every way than the regular ones we have in Kolkata. It was good though.

Shahi Tukra: the showstopper. In the end you will just remember how beautiful it was..

Thank you Oudh.

"Awadhi Delicacies" ll be the perfect phrase to describe the place from ambiance to food. I was keen to have kebabs and biriyani which would be different as well as scrumptious. So one of my friends suggested me to visit the restaurant. The 'nawabi' ambiance with soothing gazals ll drive you back to the nawabi days. We didn't book though, but booking is recommended. We ordered Mutton Galwati kebab(a special preparation of mutton keema paste with spices) with paper thin lucknowi paratha, murg zafrani kebabs(boneless chicken kebabs prepared with special spices n zafran), mutton raan biriyani,nehari khas(preparation of mutton along with gravy). All the mutton platters were perfectly textured aand tender and essence was out of the world. A complete satisfaction of your taste buds with soul. All the biriyani and kebab lovers please go n explore the cuisines. . :)

We are greeted by a man with big mustache near the door. As we enter the ambiance is like the Nawabi era ,huge paintings, wooden interior, huge jewellery box as show pieces and thumri as the background music. Coming to the food. Perfectly cooked kebab, biriyani...... just yup...... will go back soon again..

The decor and ambiance makes one feel like a Lucknowi Nabab which gets indulged by the extremely courteous staffs. Equally delectable are the Galawati Kebabs, Zafrani Kebabs, Lucknow Paratha and Moti Biriyani... These were the items I tried and felt in love with. I am sure the other items are equally good. If you have a slightly higher budget to afford, don't miss a chance to savour the foods at Oudh. It's a must visit for food lovers...

Unlike most people who regard Arsalan and Shiraz as the emperors of biryani I believe nothing beats Oudh. 
Expensive for sure but the ambience and food is worth every rupee you spend on this place. No wonder this place is super crowded during lunch and dinner hours. I've come here twice and both the times I ended up ordering almost the same thing. Once u enter this place you feel you are in some other era. U are treated like royalty.
They serve this amazing melt-in-the - mouth pardah biryani which beats any biryani I have ever had. The anaras raita is one of its kind and yes the Afghani Kebabs are heaven. 
Like I have mentioned before this place is expensive buy worth trying

This place is sheer brilliance.

an ambience to throw you back to the nawabi days... with a gastronomically chosen menu... and food for the mind and soul... this south Kolkata restaurant should be on the list of every foodie in town.. try their galauti kebab.. bt only with the paper-thin Lucknowi paratha... the raan biryani was out of this world... each of their biryanis carry an unique flavour which is different from the earlier... the kakori kebab is the less spicy brother of the galauti... and last but not least shahi tukra is ouhhh so goood..

One of my foodie friend returned from Mumbai after one year. And he was keen to have kebab and biriyani, could have chosen any other north Indian restaurants popular for biriyani but as a zomato user and based upon ratings I choose this place for evening dinner and received complete satisfaction of soul. Like a good movie which keeps impact on your subconscious mind how good it was or some of that movie's scenes appears in your head after you have left the movie hall or ended the movie, like wise a true foodie would get the impression of food which he had. The essence, the texture, the taste. Well, If you want to keep that soul knocking taste of Lucknowe cuisine, on my recommendation just visit once here.

I phoned them 1.5 hr prior to reserve the table and to check the availability of food but as it was starting day of the week so they confirmed we will easily get sits over their, so didn't had to reserve a booking.But If you are planning to visit on weekend I will strongly recommend you to pre-book a table, form the deshopriyo park If you know the location of tamarind restaurant it's in the same gully, just walk to the last. from the outside it looks like a Lucknowe palace well decorated. Impressed.

Once you be sited in the table and look around the decor you would feel you are in a Lucknow palace with soothing royal music, the ambiance was great. Loved it. And the next the service part, well I found each and every service person are very much polite and well aware to tell you what you want to have or which dish is suitable for you. It's their menu in your hand and they are taking orders and explaining the dishes not forcing to have specific dishes.

Kebab and Biriyani and the royal magic:
=============================

Qalmi Kebab :
----------------------
A lukhnowe style mild spiced version of chicken tengri kebab. You can feel the all the spices and flavors present in the soft tengri pieces.

Galawati Kebab :
-------------------------
They serve 4 pieces of kebab in one plate. I never had this type of galawati kebab before. Amazing is the one word to explain the taste. Speechless. With lukhnowe paratha (soft crisp papad feel like) we had those wonder mutton kebabs.

Mutton Bharrah kebab :
-----------------------------------
Big 3 pieces of kebabs completely cooked soft and tenderised. Even big naming restaurants won't provide you this kind of kebab. Again stunning.

After having too much kebabs with paratha we just gone straight to "Mutton Raan Handi biriyani", What can I say about this amazing biriyani completely cooked with ghee, full of aroma and spices and full of mutton pieces that you can feel and chew in each byte you have. I can say till now in kolkata this is the best "handi raan biriyani" I had. It can't be compared with any other biriyani's in the town its different and so tasty that we just stopped talking and concentrated to finish biriyani from the plate.

After the royal treat, with rose petals and a lemon piece finger bowl appears and next a jewellery box with 4 segments consists of mouth fresheners appears with the bill, never seen this any other restaurants ever before.All's well if the end's well :)

Looking forward to revisit again!!

A fantastic restuarant with a great ambience. The food price is easily affordable especially for working class. The food too is of high quality. I always wanted to try "The Handi Biriyani" after reading about it, and trust me it lives up to its reputation. The phirni too was very good, it was creamy unlike most other restuarants where they just give you a solid chunk to eat. 
The only thing i didnt like is the cramped place, because when its full the place kind of becomes too noisy. Otherwise its a great place with great ambience and i recommend everyone to try the Handi Biriyani

After a long search for authentic galauti kebab, I ended up here...in oudh 1590
I guess the availability of DUM BIRYANI is scarce! And guess what? They also have the option of soda shikhanji with other aerated drinks which is a must with mughlai dishes! The decor is good but the lack of space dampens the interior. It is a little cramped up which results into a long waiting line... But then its worth it. It is any day better than Arsalan , shiraz or zeeshan. A little expensive but who cares when you are with your parents? Service is impressive and they are well aware of the dishes they serve! Phew enough of it. A must have is their zaafrani fish and with lucknowi parantha. Main course is obviously either raan biryani which will be your favourite if you love ghee or else awadhi biryani for mutton lovers combined with chicken irani.
In the end leave behin ice cream or brownies, go for shahi tukra

A perfect theme based and period eating destination. Staring from mustached security guard to ghazals playing in the background to internal decor to utensils, everything will give you a perfect environment for a period dining. Food was very good and awesome. Personally I liked Murg Musallam, it was finger licking good. Biriyani and kababs were also tasty and good. This is the second best chicken biriyani and murg musallam I had after Aalampana inside Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad.
Now, the price, which is also reasonable - a thousands bucks for 2 including taxes.
So, in a overall note, I must say, it's a nice restaurant to visit if you have desire for mughlai and oudh khana.

At last this goes off my wish list. Its granted, and it goes to my 'been there' list. I am impressed; I am impressed by the decor, by the behavior, by the turn around time, and above all by the food. We ordered zafrani murg kebab, awadhi gosht biriyani and murgh irani and sweet lime soda. All were delectable experiences, but I would like to spare a few words on the biriyani. Prepared by the renowned dum pukht style as they say, the mutton pieces were as soft and melting as jelly. The spices mixed ended up in a mysterious aroma with what preceding over what was left to my imaginations, but whatever it was, it made my day.

This place is simply perfect, perfect matching oudh-i interiors where you see wooden air condition, a hookah in the washroom, where you are served in bronze plates and glasses and treated just like the king in the oudh dynasty! The service is very nice where you are provided with many informations about this restaurant and the warm and vibrant nature of the waiters stands out!
The good things does not end here, their food is equally delicious and i bet you will have to come here again and again to try the rest of the items on their menu! I have been to this place for some 4 to 5 times and everytime I did order their galawati kebab, its so soft that it literally melts in your mouth. you can pair this up with their lucknowi parathas which are so less oily and so different from others! I also tried their tangri kebab which is pretty decent and i must mention the salad they provide with the kebabs are mixed in some pickle or something that gives it a special taste. And at the main course I had their Moti biriyani. This one is served in a handi and is sufficient for two people. The shahi tukra was good too, but a little bit on the sweeter side.
And then with your bill comes the magic box of mouth fresheners. It is almost a jewellery box with 4 segments and has one segment full of dried rose petals, i have never seen in any of the other places.
All said, I would definitely visit this place time and again for their galawati kebabs!

Heard from friends about Oudh 1590 restaurant at Rasbehari - Lansdown Crossing ( Deshapriya Park ) … so on one fine evening went there to taste the ORIGINAL OUDH DELICACY  …
On entering we found the staff are very helpful and guide us through their long range of delicious items..
As starter I must suggest Galawati Kebab .. Kakori Kebab and Zafrani Kebab are also good ..
For main Course we tried Awadhi Handi Biriyani and Gosht Roghan Josh ...
Along with the main course we had ordered Badam Sharbat …
For all these .. and specially for the Biriyani just one word is enough – Awesome
And to end the dining we had tried Sahi Tukra ( only this item was not upto the mark ) …
The staffs are very helpful and courteous … The ambience and decoration is good enough …
Overall, Dining at this beautiful Restaurant is really a Memorable experience .. and I really want a re visit soon ..

To reach Oudh one has to turn right at Desapriya Park crossing if coming from Gariahat or turn left if coming from Rashbehari. Then 2nd left and voilà!
The door man is wearing a heavy moustache which reminds the childhood days use to visit Bedwin with my parents. Unless you are going for lunch during evening one needs to wait around 30 mins or so before entering the Awadhi times.
The décor looks marvelous like palace restaurants in Rajasthan but not that grand architecture. Waiters wearing black ethnic dress which goes with the theme. 
We tried Galawati Kabab along with Lucknowi Paratha. Kabab is minced mutton which just melts in your mouth. Partha is paper thin gets prepared like rumali roti on reverse tawa which very less oily and makes amazing combo with the kebab. Raan Biriyani to me this is the best biriyani I ever tasted in my life. It’s full of shredded meat cooked overnight and rice is so aromatic. Mr. Pal our server while taking our order was giving history behind each dish. 
In the background we can hear thumri playing to make it more authentic Lucknowi style. After your lunch again we were amazed to see the finger bowl with warm water along with gandhraj lemon and rose petals. Full of royalty and elegance. Service was lightning fast. Bill was INR 850.

However, the exception was restaurant manager Mr. Arnab who is extremely rude person and made us stand outside for 30 mins while letting people enter first even though they came after us. Our fault was we were only 2 people and they had only bigger tables available. On top of that they don’t accept reservation. His justification was that he needs to make money fast rather thinking of customer satisfaction. He is so uneducated doesn't even have know that without customer satisfaction there will no return business. We have seen in other establishments such scenarios are handled much subtly. We could have easily walked out but that will be injustice to the owner who brought such an amazing period dining experience for food lovers like us. 
Due to this experience taking away 2 stars. Hope management will do earliest rectification as bad word of mouth doesn't take time to spread.

A transportation back to the grandeur of the nawabs of awadh...right from when the hugely-moustached doorman greets you inside and you step into an elaborately decorated durbar with minakari wooden tables with brass and copper cutlery.Opening the menu, with begum akhtar's voice wafting around,i decided on qalmi kabab,gilawati kabab and lucknowi paratha as starters,accompanied by aam khas.The gilawati kabab is beautiful,and the thin and tasty lucknowi paratha works harmoniously with it to create a wonderful symphony of flavours.We ordered gosht rann biryani,murgh irani and gosht kundan kaliya for mains.The mouthwatering flavour of pure ghee greeted us when we opened that pot of biryani,which came with a complimentary bowl of raita.The kunan kaliya was a delight,i was absolutely floored by it,though the murgh irani was nothing exceptional.
For dessert,we picked the shahi tukra which was again marvellous in its kheer-i texture embellished with nuts.
Overall,a place worth returning to,if only to experience that gastronomic high as I stepped out into modern kolkata,again.

Umm Truly the best in class!! The 'all-wooden' entrance gives you a feel of a Lucknow Haveli. A place with impressive interiors, wonderful hospitality & mouthwatering food. The decor was truly mesmerizing. We started with the Galawati Kebab with Lucknowi Parantha. The raan biryani was a bit too sour in my opinion, but Nehari khass was excellent. Agreed that the food was finger licking good. It was our marriage anniversary and “Pal babu” the senior management stuff became one of our family members. He  to us, was one of a few good people we rarely ever meet. He was polite and sincere, never felt like we are in a restaurant, we felt like in a Lucknowi Haveli. Thank u Pal Babu,for making our food and the day more memorable. Hope every restaurant have a person like u.  It was a true grand affair.

My first and till now,only experience of Oudh 1590 was a few months back. The ambience, inner decor is superb.I tucked into oudhi biriyani and mutton minced delicacies and they were very very good. However their lack their lack of beverages is alarming. They have this one aam panna , fresh lime and coldrinks to choose from. The steward serving us was very casual in his approach to take orders as if  he was working on a roadside dhaba catering to truck drivers...also their turnaround time was almost 20-25 mins for any order ..from a aam panna to fresh lime. I liked the food but their service was not up to the mark as expected from an uptown restaurant.But yes ,I would recommend the restaurant for a change of taste and change from the regulars.

Oudh 1590 is definitely a must visit for all Kolkata foodie's who dig into awadhi cuisine. Though weekends can get really crowded and more often the waiting period can be testing, however, it is worth all the effort. The decor is wonderful, though dimly lit. The lilting classical music at the background adds well to the ambiance. The food is worth every penny that you spend. The galawati kebabs with the lucknowi parathas (suggested by the staff) were a superb beginning to a wonderful experience. They melt in the mouth, and the staff were friendly enough to explain why they are made so (as in melt-in-the-mouth kind). On another occasion we ordered for the Qalmi kebabs, which were equally good.  The awadhi handi biriyani was lovely, accompanied by Murgh Irani. None of the food is spicy, and yet taste great. The staff need a special mention for their hospitality. They make good suggestions and are extremely cordial. It's a lovely experience and hope they continue this way.

I personally prefer continental cuisine above any other but I decided to give Oudh 1590 a try keeping in mind that my mum is a hardcore Indian food lover. So, this little place was easy to find and the moment we entered it was a nice feeling. The wooden decor, the warm lighting and the thumri music playing at just the right volume made us happy at our choice. We ordered the Murgh Pardah Biryani, Murgh Irani and Tandoori roti. All of it was delicious! Special thumbs up to the biryani which we thoroughly enjoyed. The service was prompt and courteous. All in all we left the place happy and satisfied. A place worth going to.

Last week my uncle, aunt and myself decided to go for a quick dinner at Oudh. Since its a ten minute walk from my place, I could make it on time ispite of being informed at the last moment. 

Just a quick word about the decor and location - Oudh is located on the second left turn on sarat bose road, close to the carmel junior section. I think they made a good job decorating the place - and once you walk in you would be reminded of walking into a restored heritage building. They have even done up the ACs to go with the decor. The place is minimally lit and there is  music playing in the back ground.  

Since we had a reservation we were given a table immediately. We ordered two plates Galawati kebabs for three of us along with the lucknowi paratha (if I'm not mistaken). The mutton in the galawati was of veru high quality, extremely well marinated and prepared and it simply melts in to your mouth. The paratha cooked on reverse tawa is top class. It's crisp and the dough is perfect - goes very well the galawati and kakori kebabs. The only drawback here was that the galawati tasted slightly salty. 

For mains we ordered three keema parathas with gosht  Sahi Qorma since we were in no mood to have biriyani. And we ordered a Awadhi Dal with it. The Sahi Qorma was very tasty, the mutton was fresh and it had gravy, a touch spicy. The keema parathas were average and pretty heavy. The awadhi dal is nothing but dal makhani - slightly heavy and they had put in a lot of cream. Tasted well but if you are worried about your calories you can avoid it!

Rounded our dinner with phirni and kulfi falooda. Phirni is made in house and it was excellent. The kulfi flooda wasnt bad either. 

A word of appreciation for the staff - very polite and courteous. They know their dishes well. In fact one of them was very kind to explain us the concept and history of galawati and kokori kebabs and why the mughals preferred lucknowi paratha on a reverse tawa! I was fascinated. So thank you for the hospitality and being a kind neighbor I shall be back for your biriyanis soon!

i am yet to visit the restaurant hence, can't comment on decor, service and anything related to the restaurant. however, i order a home service and this review would be based on that. i called them up and they informed me they can deliver to jadavpur from deshapriya park, no extra charges needed expect packaging charge. i was impressed. the order taking process was smooth, no hiccups regarding item not available or any other tantrums. the delivery boy came within 45mins, which was reasonable considering the time to prepare the food, pack it and deliver via scooter. packing was excellent with no leakage or spillage.

coming to food..we ordered - qalmi kabab as starter. this is chicken leg pieces grilled into kabab with white creamy sauce, nothing great, but quite ok. next was awadhi handi biriyani, which came in a handi, nicely decorated. the rice was fine and the spices were smelling nice. however, i felt it to be too dry for my liking. along with that we also had the brilliant murg musallam - a full chicken prepared in white creamy gravy with cashew and all. this is a must have if you love awadhi cuisine. we ate with simple tandoori rotis which were soft and well grilled.

i would love to visit the restaurant next as i have seen few nice photos indicating the decor ambiance to be very good. will update the review+rating once i go there. overall - food is good, but they should improve the biriyani. it's very dry.

This particular place has been in my Wishlist for quite a long time. Finally, I made it to this place on a fine weekend with my friends. The first thing that amazed me is the ambience and decoration inside. Songs by Begum Akhtar is playing all throughout which will give you a feeling that you have entered the time of the Mughals. Now coming to the menu, they have varities of dishes which have got the authentic Awadhi taste. The first thing I ordered is the Galawti Kabab. The waiter insisted that I should take a lucknowi paratha with that. Initially I said, but finally I thought of tasting it once, and I never resented my decision as the combination of Galawti kabab and lucknowi paratha is awesome. We decided to try something different rather the Biriyanis and the chap. So we ordered 3-4 varities of kabab both chicken and mutton. Tandoori rotis and varieties of chicken and mutton side dishes.
Undoubtedly Galawti kabab is their best, followed by Zafrani kabab, Qalmi kabab, Afgani Kabab. In side dishes you must try Murgh Irani, Murg Mosallam, Shahi Gosht Qurma, etc. Even more tasty is the varities of pickles and chatni that they offer you.
I have heard that the taste of the biriyani is too god so will definitely try that once.

Oudh comes across as "traditional dining"! Thus the ambiance of the place is of immense importance and it scores full marks in that department. :) Even the washroom & the AC is done up keeping the "period" theme in mind. Coming to food, the first to mention is the galawati kabab & the parathas. The finely minced mutton galawati kabab will give you FOODGASM . while the parathas served with it are thin and melt in your mouth! That was followed by one more round which was followed by AWADHI biriyani. The dessert was amazing as well. I went there with my family for my parent's anniversary and the delicious meal simply added to the happiness . One more thing which deserves a mention in the review is the hospitality. The attendants were extremely helpful and well mannered. Everyone in the family was so happy with the place that another visit SHOULD be round the corner. :D

It was a very special day for me so me and my fiance were in the mood to experiment and not surrender to our prototypical habit of visiting Park Street. Tanmoy on several occasions has uttered this name which sounded quite interesting to my ear drums..."Oudh 1590". So we cleared our taste buds to engulf upon this new gastronomic journey. What took me by surprise apart from the Lucknowy interior of chiseled wood craftsman was a pan shop which was too a part of the restaurant and ones who have been to Lucknow can totally relate to it's significance. When i entered the Restaurant i was suddenly transported to The Nawabi era where the lighting gave you a feeling of Candlelight era....the combination of heavy wooden decor and Awadhi Paintings is perfectly in symmetry with the theme of the restaurant and then you hear the gothic voice of Begum Akhtar singing  in the background....Its gospel in the making. I fell in love with the seating arrangement as being true to the theme the serve in copper plates and glasses even the spoons are made of copper. We ordered a Galawti Kebab which was four portions of tender minced meat kebabs with herbs and fried over the grill with pickled onion and carrots. The kebabs where juicy, tender spices blended in properly but i thought the clove made the kebab a tad bit bitter than required otherwise it was delight to taste. Rating 3.5/5. We ordered a Murgh Biriyani, Mutton Rogan Josh Butter Naan for main course. The briyani was not the regulars we have in Kolkata it was a perfect combination of spice and moistness and it had 2 juicy chicken pieces cooked to perfection which no matter how a BIG FOODIE i am i cannot cater all alone. Best part is it comes with complementary Raita. Rating 3.5/5. The curry of the Mutton Roganjosh was perfect in colour and the meat was cooked immaculately but i found again the clove and ginger to be o the higher side which gave it a litle bitter taste also a little sweet could cut the monotone of the curry. Rating 3/5. The naan was the softest i ever had and was huge...huge...the butter was drizzling through its luscious body and was atreat for your eye as well as for your mouth. Rating 5/5. For the Ambiance i give 5/5 because it was perfect. The service was very fast and it felt that they enjoyed serving us. Also what takes an extra cookie point from me is that as condiments they gave pudina raita,aam ka murabba and a mixed pickle...which just surprised me of their galore. Over all a good evening spent over good food and An ambiance fit for Kings

This was in wishlist for a long time, but was never made it there. Last Saturday, to celebrate the good doctor feedback for eye-checkup of our 1.5yrs old kid,  we went there in lunch. It was little last around 2.15pm, and the resto was nearly empty apart from 2 groups.

The decor of the resto is very beautiful and it reminds of nawab time. The tables were of wooden, and plate / glasses were also customized. The details have been looked into in so much details that the even the indoor A/C has been colored brown to match with wall decor. That was nice.

Coming to food, we ordered Zafrani Kabab(Chicken) to start with. It was served quick, and chicken was soft and tender, It tasted good as well.

Next was Gosht Biriyani with Murgh Irani. Biriyani was very nice, with good abount of mutton, potato. It was neither spicy nor very light. Overall, it was good, and 1 biriyani was good enough for 2 of us.
Murgh Irani was also good.  We took an extra butter Naan, to go with Murgh Irani.

Overall, the food cost was 875 bucks, and after adding taxes, it came to 1045 bucks.

We plan to visit again to this place.

I went here yesterday for dinner and the sole reason for the plan was all the hype surrounding this place. We were greeted well. I liked the ambiance a lot and the cutlery as well. I also liked the dress code for the staff. The inside of the restaurant is not well lit which I liked. The music was good but I got a little irritated by it after some time. It was very monotonous. Anyways the staffs were good and well behaved. 

We ordered for Galawati Kebabs, Raan Biriyani and Murgh Iraani. The food tasted good but not living upto the hype. They served 4 kinds of chutneys with the kebab. The meat was indeed very soft and tender. I must say that the chicken was a bit under cooked as well but the gravy was delicious and 1 plate of biriyani is good enough for two people.

If u ask me, i will give it 6.5/10 overall.

i went to this place yesterday evening..
space was very small and layout of table was such that even waiters find difficult to serve food.
decor of the place was good but such clumsy space made uncomfortable..
service was average and waiters stretched during rush..food was average.we had awadhi kabab which though soft in texture was not much special in taste..veg kabab had saltish taste..did not like it..
awadhi chicken biryani was good and not very heavy..veg palak biryani was interesting..
but i liked lucknowi paratha which was soft and less oily..this should be tried out..
chicken kasha was another dish which was good..
overall food was good in parts..prices bit on the higher side though..did not try mutton or fish dishes ,so cant comment on them

10mins drive from my new locality. The ambiance , staff and the panoramic view of the restaurant is perfect. Reasonably priced and delicious foods. The background music makes you feel that you are sitting in a Mughal Darbar. For starters chicken seekh kabab & mutton shammi kabab. For main course awadhi handi briyani, gosht shahi korma with lucknowi paratha, murg kassa with tandoori roti and finally phirni.
The above items are the best i felt in Oudh. The chefs did their justice to the dishes.
 Ambiance :4.5/5; Food :4/5; Quality : 4/5;
P.S : Very courteous staffs

This rainy afternoon, I and my wife visited Oudh 1590. The ambiance of interior was Nawabi, with soft lights, well decorated furniture, delightful ghazals and well dressed staff. We ordered jafrani kebab, awadhi handi biriyani (full) and firni. We wanted to enjoy murg tandoori and falooda, but the staff cordially expressed their inability to provide these orders. We tasted the kebab, it was so soft, smooth and delicious with flavour of jafran. The handi biriyani was good, less spicy but could be better in preparation. Firni was awesome. It was less sweet component, with full of nuts and really worked as a beautiful dessert for us. 
The cost was approximately Rs. 1000, as observed in web page.

Surfing the net for good Awadhi resturants , this place was suggested. Located near Deshapriya park. The place has that authentic Mughal appearance with big iron gates , the darwans at gate and heavy interior decor. Dim lighting,brass plates , wooden pannels , yester years lamps and paintings all takes you back to Oudh at 1590. The food only matches up to the hype thus created. For starters they have kababs , the Zafrani kabab worth every penny. For mains they have the Afghani Handi Biriyani , Mutton Biriyani and A certain Prawn Biriyani. Went there with my parents and dad doesnt have meat so he ordered the prawn biriyani. Though an unusual combination of flavours I must say it tastes awesome. One portion of Handi Biriyani is sufficient for two. For sides I would suggest the Murgh Musallam. Firni at the end finishes you Awadhi dinner on a high note. The price might be a  pinch in the pocket for some but every once in a while Oudh 1590 justifies it .Maintaining the authentic ambience they have a pan shop right by the side. Though I haven't had the pan but I have been told thats its good.

Space crisis, if your family is big there's a big table for that(like the ones they show on celluloid where maharajas have food) but the fallacy is that there is just 1 such big table. There are 2-3 smaller tables, not very small.
Closes down the kitchen around 9,so.. that may be a problem for some late night diners .

This place had been on my wishlist for quite some time now and it's good to finally take it off the list. Though I knew they offered Awadhi cuisine and a vegetarian like me wouldn't have a lot of options to choose from, yet I wanted to give it a try cause of all the good reviews.

The first thing you'll notice about this place is the decor, both interiors as well as exteriors. A lot of effort has been put in designing and it shows. The lighting and the music adds to all of it and successfully transports you to a different place and time. All good with the interiors except the size. Its too small and can be claustrophobic during the rush hours. 

I went there with a friend and we asked the waiter for suggestions. He recommended Galawati Kebab for starters and we happily went with it. But after some time, another waiter came and told us that some other kebab was better and would be served faster. We found it really unprofessional cause we could clearly see that the suggestion wasn't based on taste rather it was based on their convenience. I am still not sure which kebab they finally served. It was too spinach-y for my taste. 

Having learnt the lesson, we dint ask for suggestions for the main course. We ordered Veg. Biryani, Paneer Korma, Romali Roti and Lucknowi Paratha. It was the first time I tried Lucknowi Paratha,and loved every bit of it. It was the highlight of my meal. Paneer Korma was good and my friend thought the Romali Roti was Ok. We had the biryani at last and found it too heavy on the stomach. They were more than generous with the use of essence while preparing the birayani.

As I mentioned before, the service wasn't upto the mark. They were fast in serving the dishes but the waiters seemed to have a 'couldn't care less' attitude.

The entire meal costed 700 bucks which was pretty decent. Apart from the meal, I really liked the mango chutney and pickle which they placed as sides in the beginning of our meal. Also, I liked the way they brought in the check along with a big box of fennel. 

Overall, a vegetarian wouldn't have a lot of reasons to give this place a second visit.

We had a family dinner at Oudh last Saturday. Though we had heard a lot about the ambience of the place, we found the restaurant very noisy with diners shouting and chatting loudly. The basic problem was that there were too many tables packed into too small an area, which left a very small open space to move. While the arrangement might bring more profit, it certainly does not make the restaurant the best place to relax. Begum Akhtar playing in the background did not really help improve the ambience. We complained that the place had become stuffy and the waiter politely informed us that the air conditioners were running at full blast. In short, they had little more to do.
    Coming to food, service was pretty quick. The galawati kebab and lucknowi paranthas were simply superb, may be the best in the town. We even tried veg kebabs and they were equally good. The moti mutton biriyani and the chicken biriyani however did not live up to the expectation. I failed to understand the hype around Oudh's Biriyani. However, the Nehari Khaas is a must try. The mutton is cooked to perfection and taste is heavenly.
    Service is a bit spotty though. We did not get any of the mocktails/jal jeera in the menu. Similarly, most of the items in the desert menu were unavailable. We took phirni which was good.
    The waiting time for us (table of 6) was around 15 mins at around 8:45PM on a Saturday evening. We had to wait on the footpath outside the restaurant. So that might turn you off if you are out for a fine dining experience.

To me this place is one of the finest eateries of kolkata,especially for Muglai -cuisine lovers
..loved the ambience with beautiful paintings,lights and mesmerising choice of gazals played there..Inspite of reading some negative reviews i thought of visiting there with a friend...but things turned really opposite for me..i fell really happy that i chose to visit the place...place has wooden finish.... beautiful brass utensils....as for the food the staffs helped us a lot in choosing the starters and both of us  really loved galawati kebabs with paratha which was oil free....raan biriyani with raita was more than enough for two of us..and we ended with delicious firni...even the fingerbowl with a ring of lemon and few rose petals was refreshing..i would love to visit the place again......

Anna Thomas had once said, "We all eat, and it would be a sad waste of opportunity to eat badly." Remembering this phrase much better than the maths table we set out to let loose the glutton residing in our hearts only to see them settle right in the lap of Awadhi cuisine that Oudh 1590 has to offer us. Your first step inside this period dining eatery and you forget that you live in Calcutta. This place just with their ambiance has the power to transport you to the life and times of the Awadhi culture. Starting from the glass painting adorning the walls, to the wooden furniture along with the wooden finishing on the walls and even the AC, the dimly lit place or even the lights and lampshades. The place personifies attention to detail with a beaming heart. The Thumri playing in the background nibbles to engrave a clear spot in your soul. The decor kept us mesmerized till the food came in. 

The food just rolled in to keep us dazzled. A sneak peak to what we ate:

Galawati Kebab with Lucknowi Parantha - the first time I had them was in Delhi a couple of years back. Since then I was on the hunt keeping my eyes on any eatery (in Kolkata) that would entice me with this kebab as much as Delhi did. Ahhh thank God for Oudh 1590, I finally found my solace to quench my Galawati craving. The Lucknowi parantha was soft and crisp, just the right amount of lightness that would not overpower the taste Galawati exudes.

Fish Zafrani Kebab - the taste of betki can never go wrong in a city like Kolkata where a Bangali's meal is incomplete without their favorite piece of betki resting peacefully on a warm bed of rice. So this fish kebab came oozing the burnt aroma of the grill with a hint of saffron. All you need to do is take a succulent morsel of fish dip it in the thick and creamy yogurt and get lost in its taste. Oh did I tell you that you need to keep your eyes closed as well? 

Awadhi Handi Biriyani - what good is a North Indian meal for a Bangali if it does not have biriyani in it? We being no different had our platter of biriyani. The rice had its own distinct taste and the aroma kept us enticed. I'm very particular about my mutton since eating out for me is incomplete without a mutton dish. The mutton in the biriyani was succulent and was extremely juicy. Clearly an indication that the biriyani was cooked well. The portion serves 2. 

Lachcha Parantha - I love nibbling on hot and crispy lachcha paranthas because of the distinct taste it offers. Unfortunately the ones that they served here were definitely hot but not crispy. Sigh! But nonetheless it tasted delicious. 

Gosht Kundan Kaliya - Give me well cooked red meat and a soft spot for you will be engraved in my soul. Oudh 1590 finally managed to nail it with this dish. Thank God I saved the best for the last. The gravy was thick with spices, the color was enough to bring a twinkle in my eyes and make me slurp uncontrollably. Talk about drooling over succulent pieces of mutton dipped in rich gravy, I did it all much to the embarrassment of my friends. 

My heart craved for a sweet ending but my tummy forced me to raise my hands to ask for the cheque. Haven't we always loved a chest full of goodies when we were kids? Oudh 1590 knows how to spoil us rotten and with the cheque came a chest full of myriad types of mouth freshners. Keeping up with the Awadhi times, the chest came in its wooden finish allowing me to shuffle with it endlessly as the monetary transactions continued in its own pace.  

Oudh 1590 is royalty indeed so gear up to take your date to experience period dining with a stroke of royalty.

had been Here last sunday.
Got info about OUDH from my colleague.
I must say... An excellent environment created and amazing interior .
The wooden tables are well curved and create apt setting for a fine dining .
Now coming to the food- Its nothing less than the nawabi khana from Jaipur or Jaiselmair...
The taste still Lingures and I have never matched such taste in any restaurant I have been so far.
there is not a single item over cooked.
The Service is good and the price does not matter.
When You get the satisfaction from the food you eat, You never mind about the price attached to it.

Will visit again..!1

We had heard that this in fine dining, and the pocket pinch was something we were a little skeptic about. But this place gives value for money without compromising on quality. The best part is that the food is rightly flavored without the overdose of spices, making most of the dishes even kid friendly. Now coming to what we ordered --

Galawati Kabab -- This melt in the mouth kebab may appear a little funny in your taste buds at the first bite. But then try again with the pickled onions they are served with. You shall fall in love. 

Raan Biryani -- One portion is good for two. The quality of rice served pleased even the super picky hubby. The meat was succulent and could be easily separated from the bones. 

Nehari Khaas -- The thick gravy with tender meat pieces left us licking our fingers. 

Daal Goshth -- A wonderful medium spicy concoction, best enjoyed with plain paratha, naan or chapati.

Murgh Musallam -- Although heavy on pocket (800 bucks), it is enough to serve 3-4 people depending on appetite. It is rich (gravy has cashew pastes and the likes) and sinfully tasty in an addictive kind of way. Comes with two eggs and loads of raisins to balance the spices. 

Lachcha Paratha and Butter naan -- Just as they should be. 

I would like to add that we ordered Palak Awadhi Biryani and Vegetable (paneer) galawati kabab for my mom who is veg, and they were superb. The palak biryani needs special mention for its taste and flavour.

Last Sunday we gave a visit for lunch. The ambience was very much peaceful, wooden and crafted design, colourful glasses, paintings, chandeliers,  brass utensils and cutlery , classical thumri as background score last but not the least staffs dressed in black sherwani completed the theme of Mughal Periodic style. 
***Gate keeper with big mustache was missing at our time..Shayaad for hoty weather and we had to help our selves.
When they gave us the Menu book, my 1st reaction OMG it was very big and heavy. As I and my husband always are a safe player about food, we ordered Onion salad, Murg Tandoori, Awadhi handi biryani, Roomali Roti, Ghost kundan kaliya (G.k.k suggested by staff). They served 4 types of  chatni (mango chatni is seasonal, its yummy), including raita with it. Awadhi handi biryani tasted good than Aminia,  mutton pieces were perfectly cooked, aroma was nice and quantity was sufficient for 2 persons if you have the starters, otherwise not. Tandoori was soft and juicy. Ghost kundan kaliya….it was delicious…with four pieces of mutton..mouth watering taste. Our pocket pinch was 1250/-. I don’t want to mention the price of items…because if you are in zomato…u will check the price in menu before u step into the restaurant. I like to explore different restaurants so next time u can read me on other restaurant reviews..till then bye..have a good time.

There has been a lot of hype about a certain place called Veda on Park Street. In my opinion its just a fancy place serving average food. This place however, has bot received its due share of hype. Excellent valu for money, great food and pretty good service. The decor too is very nice.
You will be welcomed warmly in to the restaurant by a burly old fellow with a huge moustache and you are going to love that.
We walked in this last Thursday evening. Car parking was not an issue, thankfully. We ordered three Aam Khaas' and one Soda Sikanji. Aam Khaas was made with one of those ubiquitous aam panna crushes and the soda sikanji at Shibuji is way better. We opted for the Kakori Kebabs, Galawti Kebabs and fish Zafrani Kebab. Each of these kebabs were simply delicious. Their aromas, look, textures and taste were all fabulous. We wanted to order lachha parathas but our server insisted that we take the Lucknowi parathas. We relented ultimately but we did not regret. In fact we thanked him for almost coercing us to order that. Amazing texture and taste the Lucknowi parathas had. The shahi daal was brilliant as well. The spices in which the brain masala was cooked were delectable but the presence of brain itself was too less. 
I skipped the dessert but my fellow diners liked their kulfi and shahi tukra. Post dinner we were handed a box, a treasure chest almost, it contained two varieties of mouth freshners. A nice touch that.
Overall an excellent place at the given prices. A must visit.

a total waste of an evening.i went there seeing the good reviews and was totally disappointed. firstly the manager   was very discourteous.the moment we asked for a table he just said ""dedh ghanta lagega (will take one and a half hour)"" in a very discourteous way.we pointed out to him that in that much time almost all the tables in a place are re-cycled and his waiting list showed only 4-5 sets of people waiting. we waited for 15-20 mins and finally got a seat after much haggling.it was long before somebody attended to us and again showed complete lack of interest in what he was doing.
the food that we ordered can be totally written off and was just about edible and nothing else. the breads  were cold and wen pointed so they refused to even replace them.sheer arrogance which will surely take them down. i would have rated them zero or minus 5 if there was such an option.

The interiors of 'Oudh 1590' are amazing. Right from the lavish and large front of the restaurant to the inside, it is classy. There is a lot of detail work done on the interiors. You wonder how much the owners spent on it. Yet, it is the work of a designer and not a person who has put gaudy decor every where just for the sake of it like you see in many Indian restaurants. It is terrific. An experience in itself. 

The atmosphere is great too. Old music. As it has a lot more non vegetarian food, there are more Bengalis who come. A lot of the folk are wearing the kurta pyajamas, nice ones at that. Even the guests add to the atmosphere. :)

The best part - the food is amazing. While I am a vegetarian by choice, the waiters assured me the non veg and veg kitchens are separate. While there are limited vegetarian options, there are around 10-15 items, so it is not like there is zero choice. We ordered a hariyali kebab which was soft, delicate and delicious. The kali dal was rich and super tasty. I absolutely loved the dal though my wife thought it was a bit too rich. The paneer based kofta was fine. The parathas were soft, tender and delicious. We thought of ordering desert but were so full, we just couldn't! 

For the the experience and the food, the price is very reasonable. Along with two soft drinks ordered, our bill came to just Rs. 1000 including taxes. No hard drinks is the only weak point of the place but that didn't stop guests from coming here, nor will it stop me. 

You really do feel transferred to Awadh of 1590. 

This was the best dining experience I have had in six months or so. Loved it.

an absolutely wonderful experience of authentic Lucknowi cuisine. This is probably the best in the city when it comes to kebabs & biriyani. To add to it is the ambiance, music (ghazal  by Begum Akhtar playing in the background) and a very well behaved staff. You got to experience the galouti kebab with a lucknowi paratha and then try out any of their biriyani..a special mention for their raan biriyani as well as moti biriyani. The aroma is just so perfect that you will start thinking why you tried the other mughlai houses all these years...this is one of the best addition to the town simply because they serve a cuisine which is light on your stomach. the good news is that they will open shortly in salt lake which will save me a lot of travel time...

Ambience is great at this place. Dimly lit. Wooden finish.  You will be served in brass utensils. You will actually feel like a nawab..
Though this place is supposed to serve authentic Awadhi cuisine it does fall short of that. It is a Sort of Calcutta influenced Awadhi cuisine. Visit this place for its great ambience but don't expect to much out of the food. 
N.B.- i had ordered Afghani Kebab, Murg Pardah Biriyani, Nargisi Kofta, Kulfi.

Among the best places near Rashbehari Deshapriya park area for fine dining. You'll be thrilled by the ambience for sure. The way they've touched each and every minute detail of the ancient palace-like charm of awadh is indeed commendable. Dimly lit,walls beautifully painted and decorated,the condiments,especially the mango chatni,the brass crockery,even the watchman with the thick moustache,every single thing is worth mention. The food quality has thankfully matched the standard of ambience here. I really loved their chicken qalmi kebab with their recommended lucknowi paratha. And this place is famous for their biryani,it's a must try. You get a good variety of biryanis to choose from,the awadhi,the Bengali style and even with prawns. Eagerly waiting for their next biryani festival!

After hearing a lot about this place, I finally had the opportunity to visit this fantastic period dining restaurant. Firstly worth mentioning is the décor which makes you think that a lot of effort has been put into finding the pieces from the wood finished air conditioners to the straight backed chairs. The well chosen music also complimented the evening. Going to the food, I experienced some fantastic Kababs. The must try is the Galawati and the Kakori Kababs with the Lucknowi parathas. All vegans must try the Corn sheek Kababs and Shahi Dahi Kababs. In the main course I recommend the Rann biryani and the Jheenga Biryani. Both the mutton and the prawns were both well made in the traditional Dum Pukht style of cooking. I began with the Aam Khaas and ended with the Badaam Phirni

We reached the Deshapriya Park outlet by seven thrty pm and since it was big group of twelve people we ended up enjoying the slow wait for the food to arrive. But if you are going in few numbers be prepared to have wait longer since Awadhi cuisine does take time to get the taste and juices blended in the food. I would urge all those people who like Awadhi and Lucknawi food to give this a try.

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon when both of us were hungry and we wanted to have some traditional food for lunch. After a lot of brain-storming one name struck on my mind, having read a lot  about the reviews I was  quiet sure the place has to be this and withing 30 minutes we were standing in front of OUDH 1590. The place impressed us even before getting inside as it lives up to the their theme of "Period Dining" , the entire house front was custom made as the Mahals we see in Jaipur or Lucknow and also the guard with sporting a long royal mustache resembled the Royal Guards of Raj Durbaar. 
one we entered, it seemed like the outer modern world of 2014 shut behind us, as we felt to be in the dining hall of some Mughal King. Beautifully done decor resembles to the Mahals, as mentioned earlier,all the tables and chairs beautifully carved with royal taste and glamour, all that hanging lampshades, wall paints, dim lights, light through colored glasses took us 200 yrs back like a time machine, specially the classical music playing in the background to perfectly set the mood.
the staffs wearing black glamours kurta-churidaar attended us with warm gesture. food served in steel plates and water in small Matka like brass glasses.
once we were settled , we ordered for Soda Shikhanjee and Zaffrani Murg Kebab.  Our nostrils filled with the smell of Zaffran as it was served, it tasted yummy too. each plate serves for peaces of chicken, but the pieces were huger than other restaurants. The drink was good, a bit extra lemony though. We had Gosht Bhuna and Butter Naan in the main course. the Naan was perfectly baked , it was so soft and light that i ended up having two Naans which lot more than what i can eat and the mutton ... Oh! so yummy. The thick gravy had so much of taste and flavor that w wiped off the bowl till the last bit. 
then came my favorite Shahi Tukra and Phirni as dessert it was too good.
We paid rs.1380/- (including taxes and other charges) which is fair enough.

it was a wonderful experience and I cant wait to bring my entire family of a lunch or dinner.

Oh! one more important thing to mention, there is a Banarasi Pan Shop adjacent to the joint, watta perfect way to finish a royal meal.

THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY FOR ALL AWADHI FOOD LOVERS....

One to the Owner/Manager - Please include Shahi Kaali Daal and Jeera Polaw in your menu.

This is one of my most favourite eatery of the town in recent times. In last month and half I have been there for at least 3 times along with some home deliveries. I would consolidate all my experiences and create a combined review. First thing - the ambiance, the moment you enter the period dining place you would be transported to the havelis of the sultans. The look, feel, decor and sound is just perfect. The staff is very courteous. Coming to the food. I would elaborately describe a few which I think is my pick from the menu.
Galuti kebab - A very old awadhi kebab which is supposed to melt in your mouth, the one served in this restaurant does melt in the mouth. Along with a Lucknow parantha...it is an absolute must.
Dum Biriyani - Another classic from awadhi cuisine, cooked to perfection. Must try. Serves 2.
Nihari khaas- An excellent gravy combination for dum biriyani. 
Raan Biriyani - Another classic. This has the mutton raan and rice cooked in dum biriyani style. Must try. Serves 2.
Murgh Parda biriyani - I always considered that biriyani is best cooked with mutton, however, this one changed my concept a bit. Try it if you r not allowed to have mutton.

On the whole this is the place to be if you are a biriyani lover. If you have been there you would need just a reason to revisit, if you have not GO NOW!!!!

UPDATE 06.10.14 - Not going back. Roomali roti was cold and chewy. Mutton pieces in Handi Biryani were dry and tough. Chicken Qalmi kebab was undercooked. Did not serve us water after asking repeatedly. Only Chicken Kassa was really good. But not good enough for me to return. The staff werent impolite but it was clear from their body language that they would rather be somewhere else than serving us. No longer going back.

It's super frustrating how restaurants in Kolkata completely lose it with their service and food on weekends and rush days. The effort that they have put in trying to offer authentic Awadhi cuisine to us city of Biryani & Kebab lovers is commendable...but it's falling flat on their face. The interiors are fantastic without a doubt. However their food and service is highly inconsistent. I had last gone during their Biryani festival couple of months back. We had reached around 8.30 but were only seated at 10. We had to wait on the pavement in front of the restaurant for an hour and half in the heat. Their Handi Biryani is quite good most of the time and I don't usually order anything else (I'm happy with just my plate of biryani in any place with decent biryani). Service has been questionable on previous occasions, with a few exceptions. This day we ordered Quail biryani, a chicken biryani special on offer and paneer rezala. After making us wait more than an hour for a table, they took another 45 minutes to serve our food. The paneer was spoilt with a district smell and sour taste. The meat in all the biryani dishes were over cooked. The quail biryani was just disgusting - they have possibly ruined quail for me. It was evident that the entire order was haphazardly thrown together in a hurry with a desperate attempt towards novelty and authenticity. There was a feeble attempt towards an apology by the staff but I'll cut them some slack as they were only trying to cope with a mad rush that evening. I am (was?) a fan of their handi biryani and has gone with high expectations but left the place disgusted, pretty angry and feeling cheated. Their property is a small place and despite the noble intentions, I'm not sure organizing a food festival was a wise idea. It will take a long time for me to will myself to visit this place again. Rating them 3/5 purely on interiors and Handi Biryani.

This small place is located near Deshapriya Park West,and is decorated beautifully!The major problem is that the space is not that big and I had to wait for almost an hour.The thing they recommend is to reserve a table beforehand,or come in weekdays if you don't want to wait that long!All this aside,I must say that the restaurant is well decorated to give you a traditional feeling!Even the plates and glasses and everything are of steel,and not of glass as one would expect!However,the food quality of OUDH 1590 is exceptional!One should try their Galawati Kabab and Moti Biriyani!This place is here to stay,and hopefully they will expand their restaurant a bit more!

I have visited Oudh 3 times now.

Positives:

Biriyani - Rann & Avadhi. I prefered Rann as the proportion of ghee in that was perfect to my tastebud.

For Avadhi there was9 too much ghee, was not up to my expectations, but GOOD.

Galouti Kabab - Found differently prepared on different visits. Proportion of masala and thickness of

kebabs varied.

Lucknow paratha & Shahi tukra - BEST I ever tasted.

Ambience - Ghazal raaga music adds to its fantastic ambience. Don't miss to spot the wooden colored AC.


Negatives:

Biriyani - Moti Biriyani was dry, mutton balls were drier, few on content. Regrettable.

Reception & Management - POOR. If you are going with aged members of your family on a day of occasion,

beware of long wait as they operate on a poor and slow manner. I even noticed they took names of people standing outside,

even though they chattered inside that they wouldn't be able to serve them as they close at 10-30 pm.

On the whole their cook make up for their lack of management skill and courtesy.

After hearing a lot abut this place, gave it a visit few days back. And it was worth it.. The moment I entered the restaurant, was pleased! Nice decor with a royal touch, as described in earlier comments, the AC has been painted brown too to keep it in sync. To add to the decor thumri was being played. Now coming to food, being and out an out biriyani lover Oudh was an absolute pleasure. Our order comprised of Kalmi kbab, Moti biriyani ,Chicken Irani, fresh lime soda. Kebab was delicate, and of melt in mouth texture. They serve 4 types of sauce/chatni with it. Now that is something new for me.
Moti biriyani was outstanding! The Mutton balls were perfectly cooked, aroma was nice and quantity was sufficient for 2 ppl of more than average apetite( P.S. We had starters b4). Chicken Irani could have been better yet not bad. Service was prompt and staffs were helpful. Coming to pocket pinch, its a theme rstro and expctd 2 b a bit costly.. Biriyani itslf was 290..Our overall bill was something around 1200. Overall a nice dining experience.. Planning to visit again

We were in for a pleasant surprise when we found the kitchen open before 7pm. I had an instant liking for the decor of Oudh. Although there is an obvious space crunch, the seating arrangement has been done cleverly. A few tables around the corner enjoy the much-needed privacy.
The restaurant has a dim lighting, which adds to the romance. The wooden tables, chairs, walls etc accentuate the old world charm. With the right amount of color in the decor, the place looks very appealing. 
The aam sherbet was really refreshing. The galouti kabab with the paper-thin paranthas served as a great appetizer. The rann biriyani and qalmi kabab were equally delicious. While the portions were slightly small, it more than made it up in the taste department. For desserts we had shahi tukda. However, it was not the best shahi tukda we get in kolkata. There is some scope of improvent in the dessert section. 
Service was prompt and the ambiance was very impressive. Overall, it was value for money. Good food, good ambiance and good service explain the full house on a weekday night.

One of the best place in Kolkata to have authentic Mughlai and Lucknawi cuisine. The restaurant is situated on a quiet bye-lane near Deshapriya Park-Sarat Bose road crossing. The decor is done in a 'Haveli' style and has a wooden look through out. The waiters are polite and courteous and the service is quick. The food is delicious with the kebabs almost melting in your mouth. Galawti & Kakori are the best ones the menu, which goes well with Awadhi Naan. Amongst the biriyanis, Raan & Awadhi Biriyani are the best and one portion is good for two people. From the dessert menu, Shahi Tukda is a must try. The only drawbacks would be that the food is a bit expensive and that the restaurant itself is very small, which translates to long queues outside.

The restaurant theme was smartly done. However, issues started when one enters inside. We went on a weekday evening when it was not at all crowded. The person  at the reception will make you feel that we are not wanted, and also did not confirm the time it might take to get a table, upon asking he replied it may take any amount of time like a hour etc which he cannot confirm. 
Anyway, the main strength of this place is they have a variety of mughlai dishes and offcourse prepared in the correct order.

Well though my friend owns the place, I am gonna try and be as objective as possible. The ambience and music have been carefully decided and spell class. The food is almost up to the mark- some items on the menu leave you wanting for more while the others disappoint slightly. Being a pescetarian, I didn't have too many options while visiting Oudh, but the kebab was memorable. So is the fish chaap- I hope they still have that on the menu. a must visit for Mughlai cuisine lovers.

Yesterday evening I along with my family members went to Oudh 1590 . There was rush in the restaurant and we had to wait out side for about 15 minutes. However we were offered  a table at about 09.20 pm.  The  inside was not having ventilation. After entering we felt comfortable. After some time feeling uncomfortable,  we noticed  that the AC in our side was not working though it was kept on. I asked the concerned person regarding the non-working of the AC. He told us that the machine was not working since morning and nothing could be done till next morning. They apologize for the mistake for informing us about the same and they did not want to change our seats. More over we ordered for a plate of salad which was not served along with our main course of food. Though asked them serve the same , the same was served  at the time when our food was almost over. However they took it away and did not charged for the same in our bill. But one thing the food was very very good. Galouti Kebabs are a must try and the Ran Biriyani. Price is O.K. For food the rating is 8 out of 10 and for hospitality 5 out of 10.

Been to this place a couple of times. The security guard's thick moustache is worth a mention. The interiors are completely in line with the old Nawabi culture. A lot of wooden work. The air conditioners are also painted to look like they are wooden. Very good ambience. The service could be slightly better. Now coming to the main part, i.e. the food. The Biryanis have a lot of variety. Their dum biryani is excellent. But the Kebabs make this place particularly worth coming to. Their Mutton Raan is very well cooked and extremely juicy with all the right spices. Also try their Galauti and Kakori kebabs which simply melt in your mouth. All in all, a very good experience.

Couldn't get in because of the thugs hanging around outside the restaurant, including a paanwalla who wants you tell you where to park, in case you interfere with his next spitball machine. And they won't take reservations, not even for dinner. Now, that is fine dining avadhi style. Avoid at all costs and go down the street to Tamarind or Aminni - much better evening and probably not as oily food.

Its a restaurant whose ambience matches with its name right from the doorstep of the restaurant to the interiors, to the mouth watering dishes that they offer..
The galawati kebabs, lachha paratha, moti biriyani and shahi tukda among the desserts are worth a try.. 
The portions served are fair enough to suffice a couple of people together..
Had an amazing experience..

Staffs are very cordial

Badam-sharbat , Soda - sikanji ,Aam khaas is all they have ,apart from soft drinks, when it comes to the thirst-quenchers .. they need to have more varieties i feel !
Starters - SUPERB !  Galawati &  Kakori kebab are something that one SHOULD NOT miss here...
Biryani - HUGE when it comes to quantity ... easily can be shared by Two people .... Moti biryani was something I really LOVED.
Lucknowi Paratha also a MUST try...

I feel one Surely Must Visit OUDH 1590 !!

We decided to visit this place after reading about the biriyani festival that was going on.We arrived at the restaurant at around 8.45 in the evening and were quite surprised to see quite a big crowd  near the restaurant.We were told thwt we would have to wait for around 30mins but dat turned out to be almost an hour in the end.First thing that strikes you when you enter the place is definitely the interiors which have a royal ol world charm and the beautiful smell teleports your mind to the days of the nawabs.However the lighting is very poor and it looks really dark inside due to the dark interiors.We were handed the menu cards which were a little too big for me.We decided to go with their galawati kebab for starters.Since the biriyani festival was going on we ordered 3 different types of biriyanis .1.Raan biriyani 2.Keema biriyani 3.Kanthal biriyani(which was quite unique)and their shahi daal.The starters arrived wuite quickly.the galawati kebab was simply heavenly ad melt-in-your-mouth.the finely minced meat was tender perfectly spiced and cooked to perfection.simply awesome.however 2 of the 3 biriyani s turned out to be disappointing.The keema biriyani hardly had any keema in it although the taste was ok.Nothung special though.Next the raan biriyani was an even bigger disappointment.It was greasy and someone had thrown in bits and pieces of left over mutton.Tasted similar to d previous one.The kanthal biriyani was quite different and tasted nice as well.The stand out dish was the shahi daal.Mind blowing.best daal i have had in my life.For dessert we tried the classic kulfi which was quite nice as well.service was fast and staff where really attentive.Overall a good experience.

The food at Oudh is amazing.I mean you rarely find restaurants that has such detailed and conceptualized Awadhi cuisine in Calcutta.The Galawati and Kakori kebab is sure to tempt you into asking for more & the handi biriyani is a must.The food is exquisite and the kebab simply melts in your mouth.The flavours were quite good and I am sure once you finish your food you would definitely want to go there time and again.And if you have a sweet tooth you should definitely try the shahi tukra. The service quality may not be very good but it is a new restaurant and it needs some time to attain perfection but all in all I quite enjoyed my experience at Oudh.

I was appalled at the complete lack of service. Yes that is what comes to my mind when I think of Oudh 1590. The staff are completely lost on their own, amidst the classical music you get to hear chatter and shouts from the kitchen. I went there for a take away and in the 1 hr they took for the order to be done, I was not even offered a glass of water. But that was still not the shocker. As I was seating there waiting for the order, another guest comes in to choose that particular table and guess what? they just ask me to get up. Yes that is the treatment they offer cause it was just a take away and when I pointed that out..they didn't even bother to apologize. 

Apart from this, the food is good. The depth of taste is very much evident . The AwadhI Handi Biriyani and Galouti Kebabs are a must try. The decor is very nice. The price is moderate to steep!! All in all a good restaurant wid disastrous service quality!!

zomato order alert: beware of you order through zomato as this restaurant delays service after confirmation and if there is a rush they will just say that people went and couldn't find your house/ no one was there. NEVER ORDER!!!!!
However, in the restaurant it's a different story. Nice decor.... Being inside an alley had three obvious advantage of having a lot of parking space. Though I don't think they have valley service.
The foods especially the kebabs are quite nice. Rice items are OK but I will recommend the kebab players with naan.

This restaurant has received lots of poor reviews but still me and my family decided to visit this awadh themed restaurant, as i have heard that its a small restaurant and remains overcrowded in peak times so we went there on a friday at 7.30 pm.. the giant moustached man opened the door and welcomed us in to the nawabi atmosphere.. In that time all the restaurant was empty except one table which had 4 people, we got a table at the corner and the waiter suited in black sherwani gave us menu card immediately.. i noticed that there are 46 seats which is by no mean small, there are many restaurants in kolkata which has less than 50 seats, the place is not that cramped also, i have seen many restaurants which are even more cramped than this. Ambiance is gorgeous, mughal crafts, scluptures and design are everywhere and the AC machines are also painted like wooden box, absolutely wonderful environment.. they use brass utensils and cutlery..  i have seen in the reviews that most of the people order same items like galawti kabab, moti biriyani, murg irani ,lucknowi paratha, even though according to many people those items are not so good but still people continue to order those items only so i have decided to order other items and believe me there are plenty of items there to chose from.. i ordered murg zafrani kabab- extremely tender and tasty chunks of chicken, fish tikka-little bland but still fish quality was good, butter naans- big, soft, little sweet, with wonderful aroma of butter but still not at all oily, one of the best naan in the city,  awadhi dum aloo- cheese stuffed potatos in delicious gravy and daal ghost- rich daal with mutton.. service was quick and there were enough number of waiters to serve all the tables in peak hours.. all the food items were excellent.. may be we fortunately managed to order their good items, skipping the bad ones or may be they have improved their cooking-whatever may be the reason but we loved every item we ate there ..the price range is moderately high, not pocket friendly but not reaching the sky also..We loved the food very much and hope to visit it again, may be  in some weekend lunch hour to see in peak time whether their quality or service falls or remain the same...

Finally got a chance to visit this theme based restaurant 'Oudh 1590' ,the name of which itself resembles to the early Mughal periods ,which was on my wishlist for a while and the visit was worthy.. Had a great time at Oudh..
Though it is not situated on any of the main roads but it is easy to find as anyone in that area would tell u  the location if asked.. We were given a warm welcome.They helped us to find a table as the place was a bit crowded. The interiors are beautifully decorated as if one has come to dine in the historical times.. We settled down for a while before the server came with antique glasses of water and a laminated menu card which itself is one of the attraction.. The AC is even colored brownish to remain identical with internal decoration.The waiters are dressed in black Sherwani to resemble the  Nawabi atmosphere.They are also well mannered and friendly.The service was bit slow..Had to wait for about 20 minutes .
Coming to the food we (a group of 2) ordered Awadhi Handi Biriyani , Qalmi kabab ,Murgh Irani and Firnis.. The waiters were helpful enough to describe each of the items ..According to them the Awadhi Handi Biriyani is the only one in the menu that serves 2 while the other types of biriyani serves a single person. But i found that even the Awadhi biriyani is not enough for 2 adults ..It is enough only when u take side dishes and starters along with the biriyani. We had ordered the Qalmi kabab and biriyani but had to order Murgh Irani later. So, had a bit of confusion in the beginning but the food was worth the visit ..
The Qalmi Kabab  (served with pickled onions) tastes simply awesome ..Chicken leg pieces grilled in creamy sauce makes it succulent and every bite of it characterize the spices mixed ..The Biriyani comprised 2 eggs and 2 pieces of mutton but the rice quantity is not enough for 2 if u r planning only for a biriyani visit.You might have to take another one. Anyway the biriyani was great and is a bit different and one would definitely crave for more. It is served with accompaniments raita ,mint chutney and pickles . Awadhi Biriyani  is their star dish served in 'Handi' wrapped in aluminium foil.. Murgh irani was not as such special albeit the gravy was spicy and tasty ,which went nicely with the biriyani to complete a full meal...
The experience was overall great to dine in Nawabi style but the prices are on the higher side.. Still i would like to visit again to taste the other kababs as they are extraordinary..Qalmi kabab is a  must try and the biriyanis are well recommended.

Its a small little place which has been turned into a theme restaurant. The food served here is Awadhi cuisine, I had expected a lot from this place but after one visit i do not think i shall be glad visiting it again. The galauti kababs are nice... but not great. The parathas... well they are again average. Highly priced this place has created a hype for sure but people who are real foodies and know the real taste of awadhi food would agree with my review for sure.

A fantastic fine-dine restaurant. The first thing that is definitely going to impress is its ambience. The decoration of the place coupled with soft tune of gazal playing in background recreates the royal charm of the then Oudh. We have tried Galwati Kebab and lucknowi paratha. The parathas were oil-free, crispy and fine...a very rare concept introduced in our regularly known North Indian cuisine. Charges are also very reasonable. Right from the beginning till the end you will be experiencing a badshahi feel. Must be visiting soon to try-out their biriyani.

Lets go back in history.Not to a place called Oudh on the map of Hindustan.But my 1st experience of trying this theme restaurant.
On a busy Saturday night i had gone to try some authentic Awadhi cuisine.Not only was there a sea of people waiting,chances of getting a table was nil too because they had system failure that day and everything was in a mess.After waiting for over an hour i decided to order take-away. Thank god for the food. Once i took a bite of the Galawati Kabab, i felt calmer. And the irritation of waiting for over an hour evaporated. We had also ordered Naan, Afghani Kabab, Chicken Iraani, Shahi Tangri Kabab, Firni with it. Each one had a unique taste.And we loved it. Delicious, succulent meat and perfectly cooked kababs. What more can one want.
 And therefore we decided to get their food again. This time the Gosht biryani, Moti Biryani and the Kebabs. To be honest the Biryani is average. For me the best experience here requires, tasting of all their kebabs with some hot assortment of naans.

I give a 8 on 10 to Oudh solely because of the Kebabs

Indeed an Awadhi treat to my mother. My words will be definitely short to explain the heavenly delight I experienced sitting right in the middle of this restaurant. Oudh 1590- you took me away to your era and made me feel no less than one of the royals through your food, decor and least to mention the courteousness of the waiters. Mutton Galawati Kabab with Lucknowi Paratha and Awadhi Handi Biryani with Chicken Irani and Nehari Khaas made the day. All the preparations were precisely as its supposed to be, tender and perfectly marinated. Oudh- you greeted and treated me more than i really expected. A sure visit very soon with my friends!!!

"Oudh 1590"

The name itself projects a picture of some old Nawabi place, isn't it? Well rather than googling it we gave it a shot. Sudden B'day treat and sudden selection of the place... 'Boom'

From the first sight itself the place seemed very interesting, and why not.... a huge figure with a perfect Rajasthani moustache  guarding the entrance !!! Got feeling like entering any Empire's castle .. !! 
The interior extends the story even more. Not so huge place, but fully decorated as if we were in 1590 or so. The lights, the ceiling, the walls, paintings... and don't forget the ancient AC's, they are colored not to be odd men out. The seating is also perfect in the picture. Pure Nawabi style. Moreover the crockery and cutlery were collected from any Museum I guess. :)

Then comes something which astonishes more, the menu card. A heavy encyclopedia of nawabi dishes. ( No need of googling, menu book gives an introduction about 'Oudh 1590' itself )
We ordered for Chicken Afghani Kabab, Qalmi Kabab and Zafraani Kabab. All were superb, but I liked Qalmi Kabab most, worth a try.
In the main course, we had Moti Biriyani and Gosht Biriyani alongside Murgh Irani and Gosht Bhuna. Both the Biriyanis were good, Moti Biriyani comes with some delicious mutton balls. Mutton was good, but Murgh Irani was out of the world for me.
After this superb 'Nawabi Dawat' we ordered lime soda to finish with, but unfortunately that was a disaster. It was very salty!!! 

Nothing to complain about the serving, people were well dressed and mannered as well as very efficiently guided us throughout the meal.

I would say price is little bit in the higher side, compared to the other places of the same standard. But somehow it is worth it by serving some authentic Reign of Nawabi food. 

Final Verdict :

Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Value for money: 3.5/5

Overall: 4/5

Must Try !!!! :)

Oudh 1509 didnot live up to my expectations at all!

We ordered:Qalmi Kebab,Irani murg and mutton biriyani.

Qalmi kebab was supposed to be a chicken tangri dish covered in a creamy sauce.However what was served to us was like a normal chicken tangri dish.I even asked if they have placed the correct order and the waiter said:"Yes this is qalmi Kebab".


The quality of rice used in the Biriyani was like a normal quality rice which we eat at home.
It had oddles of rose water(which I absolutely hate)

The gravy in the Irani Murg dish was tasty but not impressive.
The chicken pieces were so hard that I being a chicken lover couldn't finish a single piece.

Service here was the most disappointing experience for me that afternoon.
We had to wait for like 20 mins to get a seat,which is ok,
The gatekeeper asked us to get in and ask if our turn has come.That was utterly disgusting.WHY would I go in and ask?
The waiters were pretty okay.Dressed in balck sherwani they surely looked royal!

The ambience of this place is nice,,a lot of effort has been put to decorate it.
Even the ac was painted to match the table colour. :)
But personally i found this place a little cramped.

We paid around 1k for the 3 dishes we had ordered,which didn't even taste good.
I don't think I'll revisit.

I went with a large part of my family- cousins included on the 1st of January. We were expecting a huge crowd and we were okay waiting for a table. But after waiting for as long as one hour, you wouldn't like it much if the staff at the restaurant do not know how to behave. The service is absolutely atrocious. The decor is great, but the place is way too cramped. However, the food will make me go back there again and again. The Galawti kebab melts in your mouth, the mutton biryani is an absolute stunner. But what stole the show was the prawn biryani. I tried it purely to be experimental but it was one of the most unique things I have ever tasted. A must visit, though the low standard of service is a serious concern.

Had a wonderful experiance at Oudh 1590 ! The interiors are indeed beautiful (as is evident from the photographs on Zomato). Since we went in the afternoon for lunch, it was mostly empty. The place looks grand without being over-the-top. I personally liked the dim lighting and the soothing classical music in the background. The staff were polite and helpful....actually we had pretty much decided on what to order from the reviews on Zomato ! For starters we had the Mutton Galawati Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha. It arrived pretty fast with accompaniments of mint chutney and raita. The kebab (round shaped patty of minced mutton) was packed full of flavours...served with pickled onions. The Parathas were completely oil free it seemed (not that I mind  a bit of oil in my mughlai food) ! A piece of the paratha along with the kebab, dipped in the mint chutney, made for a delightful bite. :)

Next, for the main course we ordered the Awadhi Handi Biryani and the Murgh Irani. Loved the way the biryani is presented in a covered earthern pot at the table ! A full plate would be sufficient for two people....with two pieces each of mutton and egg. The dominating aroma was that of the ghee unlike other biryanis that I've had. A bit different, but still delicious. The Murgh Irani turned out to be a bit sweet....I guess I would have preferred something a bit spicy. Well, it was average at best. I rather enjoyed the biryani with the  raita ! 
In the end we were offered different types of mouth freshners in a wooden crafted box. And yea, the finger bowl contained rose petals along with the lemon....a nice touch. Overall....an afternoon well spent ! 4 stars from me. :)

A over-hyped restaurant. Aroma of ghee was there in mutton biriyani however quantity of biriyani is not much.. Galawati kabab was good but can not considered be the best, quite sour, seems over marinated. Fish kabab was fine so are the less oiled parathas. Service is very shoddy so is the person whom I called over phone for direction. Doorman is dressed as royal sentry and probably he is courteous to royal customers only and not to commoners like us. Had difficulty to park and no help extended. Probably management is heavily dependent on interior décor & other paraphernalia, which is also nothing great. Not very impressed except biriyani & parathas.

I have been planning to go to Oudh 1590 for quite some time now and finally, last Sunday, I got a chance to visit this place with my family! Firstly, it was quite tough to locate their exact position and so, I had to call them up to know where they are located. It's in a lonesome street from the first left turn to Tamarind. I had seen photographs of Oudh 1590 and I simply loved the interiors and hence, I was so much excited about going there! I must say that my first impression was nice. As soon as I entered the restaurant, I found it out to be a amazingly crafted one. The wooden finished walls (even the AC's were painted with the wood textured colour!), the comfortable seats, the slow carnatic classical music playing at the background! Everything seemed to be cozy and perfect! Next, we had to order our food. So, we wnet for Galawti Kebab, Dahi Kebab (in veg) with Lucknawai oil free paratha! The first bite of the Galawti Kebab and we couldnt eat further! It was too bitter to taste! O knew that Galawti Kebabs were Oudh's speciality but it came as a big turn off for us. No one of us could finish it up and when I asked the waiter what's wrong with it, he told me that nobody else complained about it but me and hence, they can't do anything about it! Anyway, for the main course, we ordered Murgh Biriyani and Awadhi Handi Biriyani! The Murgh Biriyani was BAD ! I have had better biriyanis than this before. The chicken pieces were not at all tender. I was very disappointed with the food. However, the Awadhi Handi Biriyani was still better! It tasted good but still I would say 'nothing great'. Even the Lime Soda which we had ordered at last was too much sweet! I had great expectations from this place and it turned out to be a big turn off for me! The service wasnt good. We had to wait for quite a long time to get our food. The waiter wasnt even able to serve the food nicely. While serving the Biriyani, the egg came out of the handi and fell on my mom's lap! Can you beat that? And the waiter couldnt even say a sorry but smiled at his dumbness! May be it was a bad day for them or for us to experience something like this at this place. I don't know when I will visit this place again but I hope if I do so, I do not get to experience somthing like this again! However, I would give the interiors of this place absolute 10 on 10!

So oudh 1590.... have been told by many to go and try this place and i finally gave it a shot... 

upon entry the first thing that a person notices is the interiors which are very well done up... the seating capacity is less whcih is something i really liked cause it means less noise of people around.... the staff is very courteous and prompt.... its like they hide in the shadows and the moment you say "excuse me" they are by your side.... to the level of that they will tell you not to call for a particular item if it is not good in the place...  the only problem with the place is that the lights are way too dim and gives it a gloomy feeling...

now the food... we called for 2 starters... the dahi kebab and the guwalati kebab... both veg dishes... both very very very good to taste and i had no complains with the same... but in the main course the biryani did not live up to its expectations at all... it was about average and they used small rice to make it unlike the long basmati used in the best biryanis... the taste was good but over all it was very heavy.... 

i would visit this place again to check on the other dishes but as of whole the food is pretty good if not extra ordinary... and its a fair change for the normal indian or dhaba looks of places around kolkata...

taken point away for the dim lights and the average biryani...

Today I went to Oudh with my friends. 
As there is a saying in hindi "sabr ka fal meetha hota hai"... it worked today. We had to wait for about 20 minutes and after that as we had entered the restaurant,  it gave a royal feeling. A moment I thought I landed to the mughal era. Lights were dim and gave a warm feeling. 
We quickly ordered Zafrani kebab and Awadhi biryani.  The food was served quickly. The biryani was yummy and the kebab was good too. The hari chutney and raita served was too good. The quality of the mutton was good. 
After eating they served the wash bowl with rose petals which was unique and also served a huge but small treasure chest kind of box with four types of freshners.

I would suggest everyone whoever are biryani lovers, please go and try it.

The Galouti kebabs and Shirmal is good by Calcutta standards (there are not too many options in any case) but will pale in front of the Lucknowi Tunde Kebabs and Shirmal. The Biryanis (whether the Moti Biryani or the chicken biryani) were quite average - the rice was more and the meat was less in proportion. The place in itself is very small - home delivery is a must but that also takes time. Service standards need to go up or this place will fall by the wayside.

Being a food lover i rated this restaurant GREAT! but a restaurant has to have many factors to attract foodies. Ambiance, service n of course the food served together make a restaurant special. Unfortunately despite of being a very traditionally decorated place and serving a classic cuisine from Lucknow the service is extremely poor.   

The place is too small and that's a primary cause of mismanagement. We waited outside the restaurant for a fairly long time but when a table was available it was given to some other people who came at that instant and happened to be knowing the restaurant authority well and they were given the table. We had to wait for another 20 minutes. When i talked to the manager about this he seemed to be least bothered and behaved arrogantly.

After all this agitation we finally got a table and the good part was when we left the restaurant we felt happy n full.Thanks to the good food. We ordered kakori kebab and galawati kebab for starters and trust me the galawati kebab just melted as soon as it entered my mouth. It was followed by awadhi handi biryani which is one of the best biryani i had till date. Absolutely delicious with minimum oil in it, truly "dum pukht". Anyone visiting the place must try the lucknowi parantha ,extremely thin and fried in ghee. The sides murgh irani and bhuna ghosht were not any extraordinary.

Thus, despite of all bad service before entering the restaurant would like to conclude saying the food quality and taste totally justified the pricing which makes me say yes i will visit the place again :D and would expect some good service for sure.

Visited Oudh 1590 last evening and was pleasantly surprised to experience authentic Awadhi culinary . Started with succulent Mutton Galawati Kebab & Fish Zafrani Kebab with Lucknowi Paratha. These Parathas had almost no oil and thin paper like. For the main course we ordered Moti Biriyani (had mutton balls in it) and Mutton Nehari Khaas & Murgh Irani. Biriyanis quantity was quite good and it tasted and smelled too good. We ended with Firni and Kulfi Falooda which was ok. 

The staff was very courteous and had helped us to navigate through the long Menu in consultation with our taste and preference rather than trying to sale anything forcibly. Thanks to Pradip Babu, one of their senior staffs who had been always attentive and cordial. The Décor is unique and perhaps speaks of the period. I found the price to be reasonable. 

I am intrigued to know why Oudh 1590 as Awadh dynasty ruled India between 1722 and 1858.

The negative side is Parking space. Although this is off the main road yet the lane is always chock-a-block. Will definitely recommend this eatery to every food lover..

My boyfriend and I went here for our Christmas dinner! This place takes you to another world! What with the melodious songs from the times of yore to the mild gleam of honeyed light through tinted glass lamps, everything makes you feel like you have come to a different era! The decor is amazing and very authentic! The food - even better! I love mughlai food! My grand mom makes briyani at home which will make many a restaurants run for their money! But the biryani here was so different that it makes me want to come for some more! For the starters, we went for the Shahi Tangri Kebab! It's aroma was not the only thing we savoured! The chicken was succulent and juicy with just the right amount of awadhi masala! There was this remarkable chutney as an accompaniment to the starter - a funny mix of mango and tamarind! With the biryani, we had the Murgh Irani. Had i some space left in my stomach, I would have gone for more! As i said, the food was remarkably different from what I've had earlier in similar places. it was more authentic and flavoursome! What added to the aunthenticity of the place was the giant moustached gate keeper! It seemed like he was one of those watch guards to a big Lucknowi haveli! We later also savoured on paan prepared by the paan wala perched near the restaurant! All in all, a place to come back to again! Soon! Will be here for my mom and dad's 24th anniversary! :)

We went to Oudh last weekend. The interior was nicely done, but felt a bit cramped and adjacent tables were too close for comfort. The waiters were well mannered, though sometimes went OTT with the talk. We had galauti kabab, qalmi kabab and their special paratha for starters. They were nicely done, but not really unique except the names maybe. For mains we had Awadhi biryani and Chicken Irani. Now I have had more tender biryani mutton at weddings and there was no "aloo"! The Chicken preparation was good. The one item that I loved was the sweet mango achaar served with the food. All in all nice experience but not enough to lure us back to the place.....

Visited 15 days after it opened, the decor is over the top and still had the smell of paint. Remember the kebabs were decent.But the aam pana was made from whats available in grocery shops, artificial colored nonsense.  It tasted worse than anything ever. Very roadside. Its overpriced restaurant. Service was so so then.

Its an amazing exp to be at Oudh 1590. This is the first time I visited the place with my family. The ambiance is really nice.. Flavor of Mughals by their ethnic decor which is exceptionally good. The food was incredible. Ordered Lucknowi paratha (oil free) and mutton Galawati kabab. Both were heavenly !! Then again paratha with mutton rogan josh.. That was also mind blowing. Assistance of the staffs are really appreciable..if you are going there for first time then pls don't hesitate to take their help. location is also easily accessible for any new comers. I am really looking forward to have some more delicious dishes from this place.. If you are real foodie pls explore the place with affordable price as well.

The moment you step into Oudh 1590 you can’t help but gape and admire the regally elegant tastefully done décor. The scent of the wooden interior with paintings framed within an intricate wooden border, the soft glow of light that ensures privacy, ease and comfort transports you to the land of the Nawabs of Lucknow. The ‘khusboo’ of biryani dominates the ambience and you just can’t wait but want to dig into your favourite flavour of biryani without further delay! The food is awesome, piping hot biryani in the right quantity for a person who loves her/his meal big or it can be shared between two persons with minimum appetite. Being a vegetarian I must recommend the Veg Biryani brimming with chunks of paneer along with the accompaniment of peas, beans and carrot. The Subz Kofta Qalia in rich creamy garvy will make you slurp and burp for sure. Three things that stood out for me was (1) the set of spicy achaar, mint and yoghurt chutney and mango pulp chutney a feature on every table, each with their distinct taste can be tried simply alone! (2) The finger bowl comes with a slice of gondhoraj and rose petals! And (3) the most important reason that I would like to revisit Oudh 1590 is for the personal attention paid to each customer from warmly inquiring about their opinion on food satisfaction to constantly ensuring that the customer feels at home. Oudh 1590 works for me as it hits the bull’s eye in the arenas of quality of food, pricing of food, service and the ambience.
P.S. Wish there was more vegetarian options!

What we got after hearing so much about this place was really disappointing. Finding it was not difficult with a gps tracker. Once we arrived it all seemed fine even though the music made me feel like I was inside a Durga puja pandal and the light was too dim (I prefer being able to see what I am eating, even if the ambient light is low it is usually not a problem). The servers were courteous and prompt. The order did take some time to arrive. And I won't say it was worth the wait. My friend saw a mouse. When we reported it the waiter mumbled something about how it must have come from the outside when someone opened the door. We were thinking about leaving but stayed put a)because we were famished b)we were hoping the food would be great. The zafrani kabab was okay. The murgh irani and awadhi handi biryani were absolutely average. It was overall a downer. We were glad we didn't order anything else. We left in a hurry to get paan from outside which settled our stomachs after that unexpected experience. I am really amused that a place which has been hyped so much has food like that. I can ignore everything else in a food joint if the food is up to the mark.

Very good ambience. Courteous staff and good service. And of course excellent food. The fish kebabs and keema parathas are definitely worth having. The mutton rezala was also cooked very well in a splendid gravy. The soda shikanjee is also a must have if you're going in summer (or even in winter.)

Oudh 1590... a very unique name and an exclusive place indeed. It reminds us of the historic era of kings and queens and the thick wood curved decor with paintings on the walls,  actually makes us feel as if we are dinning out in a royal kitchen.

 A very small place though but the impeccable interior of the fine dinning hub.... and the dim lights coming out from the chandeliers actually creates a magical effect which diverts one's mind successfully from the size of  the restaurant to the  grandeur of the by gone days.

The menu card is very striking. Cased  in plastic channels, its indeed a thoughtful way to preserve the pages yet looking very elegant. The service guys are extremely courteous and thorough about the cuisine. Quite well equipped to handle questions regarding ingredients and cooking methods. The service quality is good and prompt. The attire worn by them reflects the detailing and research that might have been done by the restaurateur. Everything seemed just in the right place..... the dark brown ambience... the colored glasses... the cutlery that's being used... etc

Finally the food was a real delight. Awadhi biriyani is something that is strongly recommended with nihari kaas. I didnt had time for the kebabs and so straight way started with the main course. The desserts are yummy but not much of an option to offer. Price is perfect too.

On total its a place which fulfills all  your expectations and the hospitable staffs will ensure that you remember the place and visit again. I have loved the experience and quite impressed with the place.

After finding it in the top 25 and desperately trying to locate an authentic awadhi cuisine joint,thought of giving it a try.The starter as Afghani kabab was excellent.10/10.The main course of ours comprised of nargishi koftas and chicken kassa.The koftas were a let down with all eggs and minimal of meat coating.One place where the chef will have to work out.The kassa was good but a little sweet which is more Bengali than Awadhi..Ambience was good.Location perfect.Before I leave one more point to add,the place needs to be little more lit up as the present lights very making it difficult to read the menu.Overall was not a regret.

Didnt plan on it at all...just landed up. My girlfriend wanted to have mushroom tikkas at Chawlas...but instead we ended up landing at OUDH against her wishes...thanks to a sudden memory flash of a colleague of mine suggesting that I must try Oudh.. :)

It was quite late already (around 3:00pm)..i logged onto zomato's app and got the address and also saw the kitchen closes at 3:30pm!! So we rushed in..and found a lovely place infornt of us. The decor is really nice..something that my Mom really enjoys..specially the wood carvings on the walls...however I felt it was a little too small a place. Also, I had a tough time locating the exact place...they really need to have signboards at the entrance of the alley pointing to the restaurant!! 

We were immediately seated. While I was admiring the decor, I was hit with the first negative of the place...the AC was not working! For such a small place it is imperative that the AC work...caz you really dont want to suffocate your customers!! We had to order fast since the kitchen was about to close in the next 15mins...so we didnt really have the comfort to browse through the menu at ease.

Since there were just the two of us...we ordered just one appetiser and two mains. We took Chicken Zafrani Kebab in the starters. It was YUMMMMMY!! Just what you want from a perfect kebab...soft, succulent, full of flavour and can force you to close your eyes make objectionable sounds...MMMMM.... :)

For the Main we ordered Murg Irani and Awadi Mutton Dum Biriyani. Being bengalis and strict lovers of Arsalan's Biriyani...we were quite apprehensive about trying a different version of biriyani...but then again we wanted to give Awadi biriyani a shot...and we were not dissapointed!! It was great..cooked on dum...mutton was nice and tender..and unlike our regular biriyani it was not oily..which was a pleasant change. The Murg Irani was also nice...nothing out of the world..but quite good non the less. The quantity was the plus point also...quite enough for two...so much so that we needed to miss dessert...which is really my most favourite part of any meal... :(

Prices are not extremely high...but it is not easy on the pockets either. Service was average.

My Scores:

Thumbs Up:
- CHICKEN ZAFRANI!!! (10/10)
- Nice decor (7/10)
- Great Taste (8/10)
- Good Quantity (8/10)
- Not bad service (6/10)

Thumbs Down:
- Malfunctioning AC (0/10)...which I hope by now has been repaired!!
- Space...a little too congested (4/10)
- Very hard to locate...need signboards!!

All in all...a nice experience...great tastes...great interiors...I would definitly be returning there to try out the other awadi specialities and will NOT miss the dessert this time!! 

Happy Eating!!

After reading so many great reviews in Zomato about this place, I went to have lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. When we called the place to know the exact location, they told that this was on the lane beside Tamarind, so we could very easily identify it. 
Well, the building gives a very apt look for the concept they had tried to maintain in their place. Almost like an old building, superb interiors, with matching music in background and dim-yet-perfect lighting. Was happy to sit and get the feel here. The menu book was heavy and big in size. We ordered Mutton Galawati Kabab, a mutton handi awadhi biriyani, and murgh irani. All these items were ordered as per staff suggestions, and also by the reviews I had read in Zomato. Since we were only 2 people, so I guess this was enough for lunch.
Coming to the most important and waiting part, the taste bud section.. I was really not bowled or "wow" ed with the taste I got. The kabab was average, tasted better than these before. The biriyani was good but not great, mutton pieces should been been softer. The murgh irani was better among these, however it must have been boneless!
If I have not read not so good reviews about this place, may be I would left a bit closer to satisfaction. But, it was not close to good, and closer to average. I was wondering why people were raving so much when you can get better options at least in food taste.
The staff was very polite and excellent. I hope they seriously give a look into the guest suggestions and improve the same. Pricing is bit on the heavier side, like other posh restros of the area.

In the end, I was confused whether to go back or not!

Yes, service needs to improve, but we were lucky to have checked in at around 0730 in the evening on a weekday. So the place was empty and we received the best suggestions from the floor manager. I was really looking forward to this place for months and was not disappointed. The place is a bit cramped but the food more than made up for it. We started with the aam khaas, gelawati kebab and some lucknowi parantha. While the parantha was ok the kebab was awesome. Almost compared it to the tunde kebab from azimganj market in Lucknow. Then we moved to the ghost biriyani which was good, the mutton pieces were tender but not anything like the Calcutta biriyani (arsalan,siraz etc) , it was more dry and spicy. You need to have a gravy dish to go with it. We were offerred the nargisi kofta, which if not tasted, is genuinely a miss. The nehari khas was also good, but by that time we were so full, could not do justice to it. I would prefer to have this with plain steamed rice instead of the biriyani as the spices in the biriyani kind of overawed the subtle taste of the dish. We finished it with a bit of shahi tukda and must say that it was also pretty good. Overall must visit. The pan shop outside makes fantastic benarasi mitha paan too. Will be back soon.

Oudh 1590.. It is located in Desapriya Park in a lane on the left side just after Lake Mall while going from Rashbehari towards Gariahat. In spite of being in quite an isolated place it is quite well known. In the pictures on Zomato, the restaurant looks huge though it is a very tiny place with seating capacity of not more than 25-30 people. The interiors are quite well done and a big thumbs up for that. Coming to the food, this place is not for Vegetarians like me. There are hardly any things on the menu in the Vegetarian section and I have to say that whatever was there on the menu, and we ordered was quite average. The service is good. But there are a few drawbacks that salt & pepper are not kept on the table, they do not have Papad on the menu at all, and veryy limited choice for Vegetarians but I've heard from my friends that the Non Veg stuff is great.
Two and a half stars from me.

The best part if our lunch was the ginger bowls. With the regular hot water and lemon the finger bowl had a few wilted rose petal that was bought in 1590!

Food was horrible, was server half hour after ordered, the waiters were simply not interested in doing what they were supposed to do, I would have had a better lunch at a road side dhaba.

Had heard a lot about this restaurants from my friends and decided to give it a try when I was in Kolkata during this Durga Puja. I went there with my husband and another friend for a Saptami dinner and we reached within 8pm but the restaurant was jam packed. We had to wait for half an hour for our turn. But as soon as I entered I loved the decor and ambience. Though it is a small restaurant but the ambience was just perfect for some good Lucknowi fare. We settled down quickly and ordered Mutton galawati kebab,Fish zafrani kebab,Moti biriyani,Naan and Chicken Irani along with Fresh lime soda. The food arrived pretty soon ... And we all fell in love with the Kebabs.. They were melt in the mouth and had a unique taste and flavour. The Moti Biriyani was wholesome and quantity was good. Chicken Irani was full of flavour and tasty. Naan was good too. We had a great dinner and I must mention during Pujas also they maintained their quality above standards unlike most of the restaurants in Kolkata and that impressed me the most.. Service was quick too. For the 3 of us the bill came around 1600 and we were very happy with the dinner.. Will get back soon once I am in kolkata again :)

The place is just fabulous, serves DELICIOUS food and the ambience is excellent. We odered Awadhi Handi Gosht Biriyani, Mutton Burrah Kebab, Chicken Zafraani Kebab, Nehari Khaas and Chicken Irani. The biriyani and the mutton Nihari was a delicasy. The biriyani is undoubtedly the best I have had in this city till date. It is a hell lot better than Arsalan and the quality of the mutton was excellent too- perfectly cooked, tender n tasty.The kebabs and the chicken were great too. I dont know about the rest of the dishes but I'll certainly visit this place once more for the biriyani.

Date of visit - 11/10/2013 & 19/10/2013.
Decor: 3
Seating Capacity: 2.5
Service Time: 4
Food: 2
Items ordered & how they taste :- 
1) Qalmi Kabab - Only dish which was very good to taste. The leg pieces were tender & very succulent.
2) Afghani kabab - It is written in the menu that the kebabs are barbecued in creamy white sauce. Basically the kebabs were neither barbecued properly nor marinated well. The chicken pieces had not been washed properly (having blood inside).
3) Kakori Kebab - This mutton kebab was too much dry & lacks salt & other spices. 
4) Galawati kebab - This kebab was horrible. It was tremendously sour in taste.  As I tasted the Galawati Kebab in Lucknow, it disappointed me very much. 
5) Handi Biriyani - Having 2 pieces of half done mutton & 2 pieces of boiled egg, the biriyani was not at all good. 
6) Veg Biriyani - The dish was full of paneer which were raw in taste.
7) Lucknowi Paratha - Parathas were very much sticky in nature & not at all layered (as claimed in the menu)
8) Murgh Irani - It was also a very sour in taste. 
9) Ghost Rezala - This particular dish was definitely cooked by a chef who never cooked any dish before. 
10) Subz Makhaan Masala - It was a plain mixed veg type of dish with no great taste. 
11) Subz Kufta Qalia - It was a Ok Ok dish. 

Above all the Waiters were very much unprofessional in nature. An example may be given in this respect. An waiter told another to take an order from a particular table, but the 2nd waiter replied - " Dhur ! parbona ! tui ne giye.. " It was horrible for a so called ' Period Dining' Experience. After the 1st horrible experience of Saptami of Puja, we gave it a second chance today. But I will never give it a chance in future.

GO AHEAD AND PAY THEM A VISIT IF YOU WANT TO SPOIL YOUR EVENING!!!

Let me elucidate my HORRIBLE experience here while attempting to have a period dining experience. Firstly when they say 1590, I think they want to honour those who have been waiting to be seated in their cramped up sitting space since 1590. We were no exception. We waited for 45 mins only to realize that they were allocating seats to other people behind us in the queue as we were not acting like we were trying to board a local bus by crowding the entrance.  i am sure the staff who looked like they have been recruited from public transport services were clueless. abd even I would be if I was running a restaurant for the first time.

After 45 mins and at least 3 gentle reminders we were told that our table was given to somebody else and so we had to wait some more. When we raised our voice the staff, ex conductors from WBSTC, asked us to meet them outside. as if we were settling a brawl in a beer bar. All this while our family was waiting for a fun evening out together. Finally we decided to go somewhere else. Thank you for spoiling our evening.

To rate one needs to be able to sit here and eat. The person outside took our names and asked us to wait 10 mins. The 10 turned to 20 and 30 mins with no place in sight. On check8ng the status inside the place we realized  they had been giving places to everyone who came after us. Quite disguting when u are made to wait 30 mins and then realize that the restaurant staff ha  not just ignored u inspite of standing in front of their faces all along but all lost ur names. PATHETIC.....HORRIBLE AND A BIG NO NO JUST FOR THE TERRIBLY INCOMPETENT STAFF.......Spoiled an entire evening for a family.

To be short and crisp- Superbly dissapointed. 
Cramped setup of tables, gazals playing too loud in desperate efforts of injecting the "period dining" experience.
Non festive season, saturday evening, their so called speaciality - awadhi handi biriyani reminded me of perboiled rice served in AMRI whilst my short stay there. 
Further more, 8:30 pm I was denied a serving of ghost chaap which is a regularity of any awadi resturant since 1590 till date.
Only respite was the galowti kebabs and the cold drinks...
If you havnt been here yet and are planning to do so, look for a bank which insures you against bad quality "period" dining at the cost of a fortune.

I went to oudh 1590 with my friend on the night of ashtami. it was around 12.45 at night and the place was full. location is good. even if I didn't stay nearby I wouldn't have problem locating. ambience is excellent. food tastes good, especially the kebabs but still a bit expensive. service on the other hand is disgusting, it actually hindered my overall experience about the place. waiters are unprofessional, with the "I am doing this just for the sake of it" expression. even if u call them they respond late if not at all! overall my experience was a notch below satisfactory.

This place does not need a good review on zomato to lure you in, you pass this restaurant by once and by the sight of it, the guard standing by the door with his traditional awadhi attire and the long mucchi makes this place truly traditional and unique.
I believe that food along with the ambiance should be considered equally in case of these kinds of restaurants. I was very much impressed  with this. You walk in  and you feel like you have stepped back in time ! The walls, the chairs and even the AC ! all reflecting the nawabi touch. Beautiful :) 
The food. Delicious. We ordered, zafrani kebab, shahi tangri, awadhi handi biriyani, butter naan and bhuna ghosht and kulfi falooda. We were four people and we were stuffed after we finished ! One thing that perhaps impressed me the most is that they don't use fancy cutlery and fine dining plates, traditional plates like they did back in the Mughal era. The kebabs, authentically prepared, not overwhelming the senses. The biriyani, gosh, fragrant, tasty although maybe for spicy food addicts for me a little lacking in punch but then that would differ from individual to individual. The naan soft , and the gosht was the perfect accompaniment ! Tender pieces of mutton in a mouth watering tangy gravy ! To finish it off, kulfi falooda with this rose water hinted syrup was simply heaven :) 
The pocket pinch with taxes was 2000 something. Worth it. Completely. (Plus it was my friend's birthday so I did not exactly feel the pinch you know ! )
Amazing experience, will visit again.

After so many positive reviews on Zomato and recommendation from friends, a visit to Oudh was on the cards for quite some time. Finally i landed up at Oudh with my colleagues on 14th October (Dashami/Dussehra). 

Location and ambiance: Oudh is located at a close proximity to Deshapriya Park. Follow the lane adjacent to Sharma's near Tamarind, a 2 minutes walk will land you in front of Oudh, right in front of Carmel Primary school building. The doorman was dressed in black with a grand moustache who welcomed me in. I reached the restaurant by 1.15 in the afternoon to avoid the puja rush. Upon entering I was quite delighted to see the interiors. I must say that the interiors are quite impressive ! The lighting is dim which brings out the grandeur of the decor. The walls are filled with paintings and mirrors signifying Awadhi heritage. Brown dominates the interiors with multi coloured glasses and impressive lamp shades. Even the Air conditioners are painted which blends with the interiors. In terms of area, the restaurant is not too big. There are around 8-9 tables which can accommodate hardly 30-35 guests. The reception desk is placed inside the restaurant which is kind of clumsy. It should have been placed outside. The place was almost full when we reached and had to wait for around 30 minutes to get our table. There were few chairs placed outside the restaurant for people who were on the waiting list.

Food: We ordered 1 plate mutton Galawati kebab, 1 plate lucknowi paratha, 1 plate zafrani chicken kebab and 1 mutton Awadhi Biryani (full plate). The Galawati kebab and the Lucknowi paratha was served within 15minutes. The Galawati Kebab was melt-in-you-mouth good. It was very impressive, personally i found it at par with Tunday Kebabi ! Priced at Rs260+tax, 4 pieces of Galawati Kebab is quite filling and goes great with lucknowi paratha. One plate of lucknowi paratha consists of 6 slices of ultra thin parathas. Next up was the Awadhi Biryani. Priced at a steep Rs350+ tax, a full plate bryani consists to 2 mutton pieces, 2 boiled eggs and enough rice for two. Though I am not a big fan of biryani, but I simple loved the Awadhi Biryani here. Since it is made with ghee, it tastes different and tastes unique. The mutton pieces served with the biryani was well cooked and tender ! But there is no potato included ! ;) 
The Zafrani chicken kebab was served next. This one was also very impressive. 4 pieces of chicken cooked to perfection with a strong aroma of Saffron (Zafran). I personally liked this preparation a lot. 
All of us liked the food a lot and as we still had some space left for some more, we decided to order another round of galawati kebab. Around 3-4 types of condiments are served on the table to enhance the taste of the food. In short, we enjoyed the food !

Service: Service was spot on. The waiters were quite courteous. Even in peak lunch hours we were served within 10-15 minutes. The second round of galawati kebab was served within 2 minutes flat ! Billing was also done in a flash. The finger bowls contained rose petals along with lemon(gondhoraj) slice and hot water ;) . One thing I did not like was that the restaurant offers tissue papers on the table instead of cloth handkerchiefs which is not expected in fine dining restaurants. 

Final Verdict : I was thoroughly impressed with the whole package. Especially maintaining such great standards and food quality during Durga Puja. Though the menu was limited and the rates inflated as we ordered from the Durga Puja menu, the food quality and taste totally justified the pricing. 2 plates of Galawati Kebab, 1 Zafrani Chicken, 1 plate lucknowi paratha and 1 full plate of Awadhi Handi Biryani was billed at Rs 1350. A meal for two should not cost more than Rs900 + tax. I would recommend the Awadhi Biryani and Galawati Kebab to everyone ! Free parking right outside the restaurant is icing on the cake ! :) A 4.5 for Oudh !

worst possible service. we went in the evening & were asked to wait for the table. After sometime we were told that some items are finished & we cannot guarantee you the food. After a while we were told by the restaurant manager that you might have to wait upto 12 midnight though there were only two families before us in the queue & the time was only 9:30 P.M. This is not the first time we experienced such horrible service. The waiters are very unprofessional & they lack sense of simple courtesy. If you are planning to visit this restaurant pl. think twice before you step in. We came to know that all waiters are local boys & they do not have any training of customer service.

On Saptami afternoon, Oudh 1590 was jam packed, but we waited for a table and got it after half an hour's wait. Thankfully, chairs are kept outside for people who are waiting, so most people do not have to stand or loiter. On entrance, we were taken to a table, and our waiter quickly took our order of Tangri kabab, galauti kabab, Awadhi biryani, chicken Irani, Lucknowi Paratha as our main course. Food came in very fast, and we loved the decor. The rates were quite at par with the quality of the food, and during Pujo it is difficult to maintain standards, but they have done that well. Service was fast and nice, and we ordered desserts. The firni was okay, but the Shahi Tukda was excellent. Our bill was quite all right for 3 people eating a lot of food.

there's this one problem with theme restaurants-they serve  average dishes at unreasonably high rates. its the same here,in oudh.from the exteriors and the dimly lit interiors you can make out the tangible effort to simulate an era long gone.capped with those heavy metal dishes and glasses of yore and the seemless playing of old age ragas that set the tone of the awadh those days,and are reminiscent of  nawabs of awadh as cultural benefactors of those times. the staff linger around you in case you need something and the ground manager tries to settle for banters now and then to keep you engaged.we had awadhi biryani,bhuna gosht and zafraani kebabs.they all tasted good,but weren't superlatives.ther's nothing to be said about them,no intricate detailing comes to my mind.we ordered soda sikanji.they didn't have that on ashtami,so served us fresh lime,but charged us for soda sikanji(rs 90 instead of rs 50)we spoke to the waiter,but he gave a cock and bull explanation not mulling over to see if he has made any sense.it was a festive mood,so we didnt' pursue the issue further.now,on perusal,i think i should have spoken to the ground manager,and see if he tried to sort this out. anyways,i feel this place could be ideal for a single visit,specially with your spouse/fiancee/beau.

And most importantly..you just cant justify the exorbitant price for such ordinary foods! In zomato its written cost is around 800 for two.. but we paid 2000 for two! ordered for 3 kababs..all tasted d same, peshwari paratha, biriyani, and bhuna ghost and one more dish! 
overhyped!

Was looking for some place near deshapriya park when my friend suggested this place...as we entered through the wooden door,the sweet aroma of gandharaj lime greeted us in.The place is dimly lit to suit the décor..we decided to go for safe options, shahi tangri kababs,moti biryani,murgh biryani and irani jhinga masala along with some soda sikhanji.Should admit,this is the best biryani I have tasted so far,with no oil dripping from the pot or dalda sticking with the plate.And the meatballs were simply eathreal!The Irani jhinga masala was as good.. If someone wants to taste some nondaldafied good biryani, this is the place to go to.The price might indeed be on the higher side but the quality makes up for everything. Would visit again to try their galoti and kakori kababs.

There have been so many reviews (good) in the newspapers recently about this place, that i was really excited about our family visit last night. But the excitement started evaporating step by step, as soon as we walked in.
Though the decor was good (though nothing new), the place really lacked in space. But still then i hoped that the food would be great as promised by the newspapers. We ordered Galouti kabab, irani kebab, fish tikka, moti and mutton biriyani, lucknowi parathas, irani ghost, bhuna ghost and murg kasha . The food tasted pretty ordinary. Kebabs are much better even at Arsalan.
Service was quite untrained but ok. The high prices certainly doesn't  at all go with the food quality.
Much hyped i would say

A family dinner I wanted to eagerly experience and what better than the new and very much talked about place which supposedly is a “period dining experience” and serves up some truly traditional as well as mouth-watering Lucknowi fare from that era? Right? 

No. The first thing we noticed was that the waiting “period” for a seat for five was EXTRAORDINARILY long (nearly an hour), which did nothing but increase our appetite drastically. That marked an increase in our expectations from the place as well. But Oudh 1590 not only did NOT meet our expectations; on the contrary, they fell short on many fronts.

Starting with the good – The first thing which struck our eyes was the décor, which was very pleasantly done in accordance to the historic period which the restaurant wanted to put forth. The polite doorman with his extraordinary moustache provided pleasant company during our long waiting period. Coming to the food, it was not really up to our expectations. Do not get me wrong, the food is not bad, not at all, and they had a number of quite good items on that menu (Lucknowi Paratha, Chicken Qalmi Kabab and the Awadhi Handi Biryani comes to mind) but considering the high price of the items, some of them were not upto the mark.

Coming to the bad – The service was appalling. I haven’t heard or seen very many complaints regarding this, but we personally, had a really tough time with the service and it tested our level of patience during the entire course of the meal. Our waiter had a really stuck-up attitude – which included in him forgetting some of our orders, and then denying vehemently that we had even ordered that particular item. His behavior was quite annoying and we were really frustrated at times. And he even denied that he hadn’t told us about the credit card problems there machine was having.

Overall, as far as the food alone goes, it’s good, though pricey, but as far as a “period dining experience” goes, its way average with a couple of decent highlights.

I checked out this place yesterday. Located in an end of a lane, with its Earthy decors, it gives you that feeling of passion driven business. The ambience was very tastefully done. However, I found the staff having very negative attitude. Their favourite word seems to be "NO". It was the first time I was made to feel that being vegetarian was a big crime. They made sure that I should regret being green at least 3 times in my entire 60 mins spent there. The mid age man with moustache taking our order (who seemed to be the main guy) there was bossing around the whole place. He greeted us by saying that we don't accept credit cards. I rushed to check the mirror if I had a sticker of VISA/Master card on my face. We asked for Chat Masala, he said we don't have. Papad, we don't have. Chopped Salad, we don't give chopped salad. With each NO he went on adding that sir this is a Lucknow food station. I made sure I googled for Lucknawi food every time I asked for something in order to save myself from the frowning face of that gentleman. The Vegetarian option was limited. We ordered for whatever they had Veg and the food was good in taste. The Lucknawi Paratha, Biryani and Dal was very well prepared. The rotis served were cold and upon our insistence they re heated the same and served us. Overall I would like to say that it is a very nice step of having something different in terms of Restaurant and thinking out of the box. But would also like to say to the owner that please do not spoil the show by having an attitude like that. Kolkata, specially Bengalis are very sober people and like to connect by heart and then mind. If you lack in that, your going gets tough. I would never go this place again.

Oudh is perceived as "period dining"! So the decor & the ambiance of the place is of great importance in which it gets full marks! Even the washroom & the AC is done up in sync with  the theme ;) In the food, the first to mention is the gilawati kabab & the parathas. The minced & beaten mutton gilawati kabab is awesome in taste  & soft like butter in texture. The parathas are thin like  a tissue napkin & soft like cream!! Another round of kabab & the biriyani followed which was also good. I was so filled up with the quantity that i could not accommodate desserts. Next time i will have them along with just the parathas & the kabab !

Oudh is a good place. It has got good food. Kababs are really nice. The biriyani leaves a taste of ghee in your mouth, if you like it that way, you ll love it. The decor is nice. In fact better than nice. You can just go there to look at the beautiful woodwork and lamps. Such a medieval feel. Yes it is a small space. People might have to wait outside. You cannot blame that on the waiters or the manager. How can they help it? What they can improve on however, is the service. I was made to wait for over 25minutes for a drink! I had to keep reminding them that I had ordered for soda shikanji. Thats why I am not giving it 4. I would recommend you to visit oudh on weekdays. Weekends are too crowded.

To be able to have kebabs and biryani with hands without feeling embarrassed or pretentious is probably the best thing about Oudh. The decor is perfectly in place with the menu and keeps up to the whole aspect of period dining, including the crockery. 
Oudh is definitely THE BEST Lucknowi restaurant in town. The Awadh Handi biryani is one of its kind. The best part of it being the biryani Bengalis like to have unlike Hyderabadi ones. The meat in the biryani is succulent too. The kebabs and desserts are as good. Though much cheaper firnis are available in Kolkata, it is absolutely worth having it here. 
 Oudh is an extremely promising restaurant with a lovely location and makes it worth the wait for your turn. Being a JU-ite, a rock adda is something that runs in my blood and I love the fact that the waiting area is done in the most casual way outside the restaurant. My montessory and primary school days have been in this area and I am so glad that Oudh is located here.

Frankly speaking it would have been better if Zomato can allow users to give negative markings for some awe full experiences that we sometime face. And in Oudh 1590 I faced exactly the same. One of the most embarrassing moment happened  with me and my friend just today. 
We went their for lunch today to have some authentic good food and when we entered the first impression was awesome. But then one of their staff told us that currently they don't have tables for two people,so we have to wait for at least 15 to 20 min. We were standing there and saw that group of 3 or 4 people were coming and they were easily getting their tables. But me and my friend were standing stupidly at the passage and it was quite embarrassing for we two. Then after 15 min when we asked the manager that for how long we have to wait; he told "the table would have been available for you if you are more than 2 persons, but as you are two so you have to wait for 10-15 min more"....
How one can say that? how can we know that tables will not be available for two persons???? 
I guess the food they serve are good in taste but due to such embarrassing situation we miss the opportunity to taste those dishes and we walked out..... Overall Its a VERY BAD experience!! :( :( :(

The location of Oudh 1590 is perfect. The ambiance is good and so is the interior, though few might feel a bit claustrophobic. We went on a Saturday night so had to wait a bit. Coming to the food,we ordered Awadhi Handi Biryani,Lucknowi paratha,Gosht roganjosh and Afghani kabab. And I would rate all of them 5/5. Finally the service was good as well. Will be visiting again.

SHOCKING

To day 15/09/2013 I along with my family went for dinner at about 8.00 PM. We enter into the restuarant, OUDH1590 and told our requirement to the restuarant manager.
He toid us that there is no seat available and we have to wait outside though we saw that only about 30% seat are then occupaid by the customer.
The reason of this is better known to the manager.
The most shocking thing is that there is no arrangement for waiting customer inside the restuarant.It is quite embarrassing to wait outside on the foot path along with the family members including my wife and daughter.
However I did not have the oppertuanity to taste the food,as I have to left the foot path where we were waiting after wasting for 15 minutes and nobody bothered except the gate man.
MAY BE THE RESTUARANT IS FOR SOME VERY SPECIAL CUSTOMER!

I have stayed in Lucknow and I must say I love Lucknow as much I love Kolkata, somewhere more than Kolkata...Lucknow is an integral part of me. Just like I like the place, I love their food too. But as life keeps changing I have also shifted my base to Kolkata, but, I would keep on missing Lucknowi cuisine until get back there again!! Finally, I got to taste the great awadhi cuisine once again in Oudh 1590, yesterday.  Great food and great ambience. I would rate them 4 out of  5. The food here has the perfect Lucknowi taste and its just great. The only difference here and that of food in Lucknow is that there food is more hot as they use more chilly, but, the extreme temperatures there is a reason for that. In Kolkata's weather this taste suits perfectly fine, people here cannot eat that hot food!! I have been missing Lucknow since the day I came back. Thanks to Oudh 1590, I missed Lucknow a little less yesterday.... :) Keep it up!!

I just walked out from this restaurant. Inside my car as I am writing this review. First things first; couldn't have waited for another time.

Oudh 1590 is perfectly located in the interiors of Landsdowne (ie adjacent to Carmel primary school). Even if my house wasn't so close, I would have found it without any help. Coming to the ambience first; Its very standardised. Well, its the best we can expect from a restaurant of such standard. Its better to come on a weekday if you are not willing to wait. We had to wait for about half an hour even after coming at 9:30! Usually its very reserved on weekends. For food we straight away ordered main course, Awadhi Handi Biryani & Chicken Shahi Irani. Both tasted exquisite! By the time we finished our dinner they had run out of all desserts hence missed out on that. Service was impeccable. Immense hospitality by each & every staff, I must admit! (even the gate personnel). Even the manager came and asked us whether we needed anything. This did please me a lot apart from their 'excellent' food. It was also very economical. All dishes seemed reasonably priced considering its standard. Overall, a very pleasant experience.

 The only one thing that pulled me back from rating it a '5' was the absence of WiFi service which evidently, Zomato lists it. Otherwise they are perfect in all aspects! I positively look forward to my next visit!

Good Going Oudh

food was excellent and so was the environment. situated on a narrow street opposite dks, this restaurant really is worth the money spent. must try nargisi kofta and mutton handi biryani. one of the very delicious biryanis of Kolkata which can be compared to arsalan's. the service was also excellent. except the washroom which needs a makeover for the taps, this restaurant is really worth multiple visits.

We went there for a family lunch this sunday.The first thing that made us exclaim wow! was the ambience. They are marketing the place as a period restaurant and are trying really hard to create that aura. I must say they have succeeded so far.The dark wooden beams on the ceiling, the heavy wooden tables and chair, the lighting, the copper utensils, and pearl strung wooden menus,the paintings on the wall, and the multi coloured glass jharokhas all add to the old world royal feel of the place. and with soft ghazals playing in the background and faint ittar smell,we were altogether charmed.
The place was quite empty at 1pm on a sunday and we were a bit surprised.We ordered galawti kebab and kakori kebabs for starters.Pricey, yes!! but melt in the mouth delicious, both of them. so flavorsome, that you wish to relish till the last morsel.
5/5
For mains we ordered moti biryani, lucknawi parathas, bhuna gosht and nargisi kofta.
The biryani was light, delicate, without the smell of usual scent and with aroma of ghee instead. delightful. quantity was enough for 2.The motis (koftas) were a bit dry though
4/5

the parathas were wonderful,soft thin crisp and absolutely oil free.my mother would have killed for the recipe.
5/5

The nargisi kofta were eggs wrapped with mutton keema in a gravy. not too spicy, but great taste
4.5/5

The bhuna gosht has 4 pieces of mutton a spicy gravy. We were a bit disappointed with the dish. The pieces were very bony and when we bit into it, the mutton was cold inside, as if it was out of fridge, put into the gravy and not heated properly. That is not expected from a place like this!!
2.5/5
overall the bill came to Rs.1695/- including tax.

a dimly lit and beautifully decorated restaurant which offers authentic awadhi cuisine which is a rare sit in kolkata. the ambience was good but the lighting was too dim for me. inordered the galwti kebab , nargisi kofta along with naan. for drinks we had to settle with soda shikanji as aam khas was not available which was a dissappointment. the food was delicious. I would definitely visit again to try out their other dishes. The best part was that their prices are inclusive of tax.

Good sense prevailed & we went there on a weekday, immediately got a table. A pleasant experience. The mutton galauti kabab was tender, but a tad too spicy. The Chicken Afghan kebab was succulent but why does it have bones? The Irani Chicken was also nice but 2 pieces in a serving. The Lucknowi paratha was lovely, oil-free & wafer-thin. Worth visiting. Service was average though the staff is polite, but assume its going to be a turmoil on weekends. Ambience, decor splendid.

Last week, I went to Oudh to give a long awaited treat to my friends.No special occasion, just the bill was on me. I had heard a lot about this restaurant and as a matter of fact, had eaten home-delivered food by Oudh previously. It was extremely good, by the way, but not even close to the experience of eating the food in the restaurant itself.

The decor is in a very rustic Awadh (or Oudh) setup, very traditional and pleasing. We, a vegetarian bunch, thought that we will be like a fish out of water in a restaurant stocked with non-vegetarian items in its menu. But nonetheless we ordered. The starters, Galawati Kabab and Corn seekh Kabab, were delicious and struck the right chord for the main course. Wasn't too heavy, and very delicious. In the main course, Subz Makhan Masala is a MUST try. Rarely have I come across a dish that goes perfectly with everything you order. Dal Makhani was good, the breads- Lucknowi Parantha, Butter naan, Roomali Roti, very well prepared. I was a bit disappointed with Lasooni Palak though. But the best of all was the Vegetable Biryani. Best vegetarian biryani I have had yet. Period.

The pocket pinch? 2200 for a company of 5. Very very reasonable and value for money meal. Also, its in Deshapriya Park, a pretty good location. Heavily recommended. 

Happy Feasting.

This restaurant is probably best avoided during weekends. Not sure if you can call them up and make a booking but in case you land up on a weekend without having made a booking then you are trying to push your luck too far! We reached there around 8.45 and were told we will have to wait for approx. 25-30 min. That stretched to well over 2 hours and by the time we were allowed in, it was almost 11 PM. This, mind you, after we realised that a big group had apparently got dis-satisfied and left in a huff without having eaten their fill. If they had decided to continue, God knows whether we would have actually got a seat or not that evening! 

The food however, taste-wise, is quite good and this is probably the reason for its popularity. The waiters though have a lot to learn in terms of serving and making suggestions to guests regarding choice of food. Since it had got already got late, we decided to go by the waiter's suggestion, only to realise that he had ordered for mutton biriyani without checking whether we took mutton or not! 

The ambience inside is like that of an old "serai" of the Mugal era! Not too bad but one needs to equip the waiters with torches for those who have a difficulty reading the menu card under dim lights! 

Would like to go there once again for the food but this time, I will make sure that I make a prior booking!

We had our dinner this Sunday after a long queue of 45 mins outside the restaurant. The Decor is pretty good as the ambience.... but if you really want to enjoy it visit in weekdays when theres not too much rush (as informed by the gate attendant).............. At least you would be able to listen to the ghazals which surely adds up to the catchline "Period Dining Experience"

Now coming to the food.............

Its a bit overpriced no doubt but the quality is excellent.... The Mutton Galaughti Kebab (4 Pieces Rs 235/-) is awesome and so is the Awadhi Handi Biryani (Rs 350/- but more or less sufficient for 2) is excellent. The most important thing to note here that you wont get the typical Dalda smell which you get elsewhere..........

Note:- You wont get Half Biryani as mentioned in the Menu......

AMBIANCE:: No doubt, the ambiance amazes me at first sight. From the doorman (the man with the big mustache) to the interior decoration,  it surely give you a Lucknow-Nababi feeling. The inside space is not so big but neatly decorated. 

SERVICE:: The waiters are well behaved, happy-to-help and polite. They explained every the food items clearly. Just the food delivery is little slow that they should be.

FOOD:: If you want to taste the real mughlai dishes in kolkata, you should visit Oudh at least once. It is one of the best in Kolkata. The chicken afgani kabab is the best chicken starter I ever had. The other dishes are also delicious. You can also try Ghost bhuna, Ghost biriyani, Qalmi kabab, and specially Murgh Irani. But the only drawback I've seen in food quality when we order Soda Sikanji (Fresh lime soda). It is too disgusting that we couldn't finish it. 

NOTES:: 
1.  Space is less.
2. Only try mughlai items.
3. Price is reasonable.

With strong positive reviews and being a consistent performer in the top 25 restaurants oudg has long been in my wishlist. A mere 5 min walk from my place I have gone past it many a times and longed to try it once. But thanks to the very orthodox mindset of my friends who never dare to think beyond Arsalan when it comes to biriyani my plan of trying oudh 1590 has always fallen through. Finally the stars aligned and with my family we visited oudh for a Friday lunch. At 2'o'clock in the afternoon the place was pretty deserted with two other occupants ( the restaurant doesn't take any reservations and is strictly on a first come first serve basis). The decor was very much lucknowi right from the doorman to the a/cs which had wood finish on them and the period dining experience is perfected to a T! But the restaurant is a tad small and a bit cramped up. Coming to the food we ordered a chicken afghani kebab a chicken and a mutton awadhi biriyani and a chicken irani salaan. The kebab was good the biriyani as good as arsalan. The salaan was also pretty tasty. But the place has lots of negatives. The kebabs menu had only 2 boneless options rest 4 were either minced or with bone. The salaans had no boneless option. But the biggest problem is that the food are a bit overpriced. At 360 if you get only 2 very small pieces of chicken that too with bone it is quite unsatisfying. Priced at 326 the biriyani was just sufficient to please my appetite. To a foodie like me who values both quantity and quality the place is quite disheartening but if you want a place that is high on style feel free to try oudh.

Opening and closing time for the restaurant may please be displayed. When we reached there around 6-15pm on 14-08-13, we found the door closed. Upon inquiry at the adjacent betel shop, it was known that the restaurant opens around 6-30pm. However, the door did not open till well after six thirty. Disheartened, we came to conclusion that the door has  closed for good, otherwise there is no reason for a restaurant to remain closed during a prime time . Actually unable to rate.

went that place at 15th august with wife. luckily got our table within 10 min. waiting only. when we get in the decor just amazing.  we ordered " zafrani chicken " as starter basically grilled chicken price rs. 260 plate ( 4 pis.). test outstanding.  then we ordered main course " awadhi mutton biriyani " " chicken irani "  & " tandoori rooti " cost. rs. 350, 230, 22 respectively.  awadhi biriyani outstanding easily for 2 person . but chicken irany not satisfied because chicken was not mixed with the gravy test. overall our experience was good.

As the name suggests "OUDH 1590" - a typical name of the Mughal era.  Once we entered the place we are really charmed to find the ambience along with the soft ghazal music being played which will be relished. As for the KEBABS are concerned they are mouth watering -specially the GALAWATI KEBAB, KALI MIRCH KEBAB & KAKORI KEBAB. But when we tried out with the HANDI BIRYANI, it was really pathetic, specially with the taste, it was not hot....and as same as other para biryanis..... 

We are disappointed with the main course and the prices are pretty costly. I would advice if you are not worried about your pocket fund you can try out with their mesmerising KEBABS.....

Went to the place on a weekday for Lunch.... Its a small place with hardly 10 tables... but the decor and ambience is authentic Awadhi... The music in the background was 'thumri' and the staff was dressed in neat black 'khaansama' style dresses.... 
Now lets come to the food... Based on earlier reviews we ordered Galawati Kebabs, Lucknawi Parathey, Moti Biryani and Irani Chicken .... For dessert it was Shahi Tukda ( It was the only dessert available)...
The Galawati Kebabs were succulent, spicy and certainly melt in the mouth... I would rate 'em just next to the Tundey in Lucknow... certainly a delight.!!
The Paratheys cud be a lil softer ... but still my friend who is more Bengali than Awadhi loved em coz of the slight sweetness... 
I repent not ordering the Dum Gosht Biryani... coz the mutton balls aren't soft... but the biryani was cooked really well ... Caution: it has loads of real ghee and spices... so people with weak stomachs  ( like me!!!) shud eat only till their tummy can bear... I didn't  :P !!!!
The Irani Chicken was awsumm!!! The gravy was tangy, spicy and sweet at the same time... My friend loved the dish so much that she decided that next time she's only gonna hv the parathas wid this dish!!
The crowning glory of the lunch was certainly the ' Shahi Tukda' ... it was just the best shahi tukda i have ever had... soft.. creamy ... i had to close my eyes while relishin em... to the chagrin of my companion...

Special Note: They give an assortment of Mango Pickle, Mango chutney and Pudina chutney on the side... nd I just love the Aam chutney!!

Well, had been to this restaurant just 2 days ago, and was not disappointed at all! This is the first time i had been to Oudh 1590 and was closely following the reviews in Zomato to get an overall idea of the food, ambiance and service. Initially a bit apprehensive given the numerous negative feedback it has received lately (some pretty scathing, with regards to food and service). But, i wanted to visit this place since the review came up in The Telegraph. Well, as mentioned at the beginning, wasn't disappointed at all.

When we visited it was not at all crowded (rather pretty empty) and food was served quite fast. I was very impressed with the overall ambiance, the interior decor, lighting and the overall period feel. We had ordered kalmi kabab, mutton galowti kabab, murgh biryani and mutton rogan josh. We ordered Phirni as dessert. I wanted to try out Murgh Irani, but my friend (with whom i visited) isn't too adventurous with food and had to go with the above choice. I LOVED the kalmi kabab, as well as the galowti kabab, which i felt wasn't that hot. The portion of the biryani wasn't sufficient for both of us, and was expecting a more generous quantity! But it was light (not that oily) and was tasteful enough. No special mention of mutton rogan josh, although.

Many people complained about the waiting time and the service. But i think it might be an issue during the peak hours. So, can't really comment on that. Would love to visit again, to try more variety!

The first time I went to Oudh 1590 in a " lucky " invitation during its initial days but since then this was on my mind , but alas our schedule at work wasnt permitting . So on Sunday I decided to order food back home for a small party at my place , the menu goes like this - Galawati Kebabs , Lucknow e Paranthas , Gosht Handi Biriyani , Nehar e Khas , Murgh Irani and Shahi Tukda . As a foodie who loves eating out everyday let me tell you the FOOD was KICKASS !!!! .... Very good Taste , and I guess after " Samarkhand " in Bangalore my best " Awadhi" food experience till date as most of the restaurants around are more of Mughlai , North West Frontier in nature and not typically " Awadhi " ..... !!!!

But as a Super Foodie who also loves to cook a few very minute feedback s which I thought I should write : 

1) The Galawati Kebab pieces was breaking , it has to be tender and still it cant break ideally . 
2) The Biriyani can be much better and should have more safron to it .
3) The Irani Murgh was cooked so well , the gravy did wonders , but the chicken pieces I guess was broiler ( even with a little bit of price hike use of Desi Murgi ) can do wonders . 

These are 3 minute feedback s and I promise by the end of this year I would taste the entire menu .... !!! ... But Oudh 1590 was something which Kolkata Needed .... Cheers to Team Oudh 1590 !!!! .....

Bad Food, Pathetic Service, over priced, long waiting, the people running the joint don't know whats happening where - clearly they are totally inexperienced in running a restaurant. Total waste of money. Everyone complaining. The only thing good about the place is the decor which is in classic Awadh style but that is not something which will keep the place running. For Rs 350 a plate of Biryani you dont expect cold Biryani ! The owner is counting cash in the back room and the place is being run by incompetent waiters. I am not going back to the place for sure.

The food is quite good.. But, its not quite managed well over here.. Agree with the other reviewees that the service is poor. But, I thought this has got to do with the amount of space they are having..

Would recommend going on weekdays as the Biriyani is good and to go with the Chicken Irani..

However, the price chart needs a review as well. A bit on the higher side for the overall experience..

One of the worst dining experiences. Had to wait an hour for a seat and another 30 minutes for the food. The management is awful.  They took 20 minutes to clear a table when there were at least 10 people waiting outside. I ordered an Afghani kabab only to be told ten minutes later that they had run out of stock. Same happened when I ordered firni for dessert.  And whatever food was available,  none of them could do justice to the hefty price tags they carried.  Overall this restaurant is one I would prefer to avoid in the future.

Visited the restaurant today with my wife and mother in law. We got parking right infront of the main gate. The decor is quite old school. We had badam sharbat, kalmi kebab, ghuloati kebab, awadhi handi biriyani, lucknowi paratha, irani chicken and fish champ. The food apart from the fish preparation the rest of the food was awesome. I never had such light biriyani. Almost all the dishes smelled ghee. Finally the sahi tukda was too sweet but too tasty. Only dark point was the mahi champ which seemed hastily prepared as initially they were saying they don't have it. 

Overall great tasty food. I'll recommend this to all.

In this beautifully decorated restaurant I did'nt found any thing special apart from the ambience. It is beautifully decorated with wodden interior of Awadhi style, paintings and Lucknawi Gazals are all there there to pleasure you ears. But when we Bengalis go with our "HOTEL A KHAWAR ECHA" we judge the place on account of taste, which was OK types in here. We ordered Gillauti Kabab and Zafrani murg in starters an Badam sharbat(which served when after 10 minutes of serving the starters) the Gillauti kabab was not having its authentic taste, but Zafrani murg was good. In main course Handi biriyani was excellent and Irani Chicken was good. In deserts we ordered Shahi tukra and It was really SHAHI IN TASTE. 
On account of service they are very poor. In this matter I would like to include that I brought a cake for my friend and handed it over to one of waiters to be served when we say him, but it was server after 20mins. I would like to conclude that this place is having untrained staffs.

as a part of my continuous exploration of the food in Kolkata i went to Oudh. Must say the decor was beautiful... even the AC matched the walls seamlessly without damaging the feel.
Coming to the food , the kebabs were soft and succulent... the lucknow paratha ws average... still i wd say u cd get bttr kebabs and paratha at a much lower price at Naushijaan. We ordered the Awadhi Moti Biriyani which ws a disaster. The muttons served were bones and the little meat ws hard to tear at. The waiter changed it reluctantly tho bt even thn it ws the same. Brain Curry was average again. Overall nothing great except the 1590 feel

Very disappointed with both service and food. Except for the famous Lucknavi Galouti kabas the food was oily and heavy. The curries all seemed alike. The chicken rezala was half burnt, the yogurt gravy had a heavy odor of something burnt (we were not charged for this item). We ordered two kinds of kabab and was told half an hour later that one of them would take a long time to be served!! So we canceled that order, which was clearly a relief to the waiter as they did not have the ingredients for it (we concluded)! The staff was not very professional: one left a stray of condiments which sat on the table for half an hour before I asked the waiter to remove it!  You don't serve condiments if there are no snacks to accompany them.  Even  the ornate decor, quite tastefully done, I have to admit, could not redeem the quality of food and service.  I have no idea why the Telegraph gave the restaurant such a good review.  Many of our friends had similar experience dining out at Oudh.  Never again!!!!

Oudh is a must visit place for those who loves the actual and authantic Lukhnow style. After getting into the 1st thing which will attracked you is the ambience. The music of Fareeda Begam , paintings of Nawabs , decorated walls will surely give you a different atmosphere. Coming to fooding part you can try Badam Sarbat to quench your thirst . At starter you should try the Oudh special  "Kakori " and "Galauti" kebebs , the fish lovers can try "Fish Tikka" and "Zafrani Kebabs" . In chicken you can go for "Kalmi Kabab" .

In main course along with Moti Biriyani/Keema Nun/Roti  should try "Mahi Chaanps" . I think only very few restaurents in Kolkata will give you a chance to pamper your buds with Fish Chaanps". 
In Dessert , Sahi Tukra is also good.
Keeping in mind the ambiene, quality, quantity and price I give 4.5 to this.

Note : OUDH is not applying any VAT or Service Tax.

The decor is nice though it was too dimely light for me. We went in early in the evening. Initially the service timing was great, but as soon as the restaurant filled up a little, the service got really delayed. This resulted in a big time gap between our starters and the main course. The food is really good and does not smell of dalda. It is said that all the food here is made in pure ghee. The staff seems well-informed about the food. The tax is not shown separately in the bill so I do not know how much they charged.

Well this is a review about what to expect on a weekend night at Oudh. When we entered we saw a few seemingly disoriented staff members roaming scurrying around. Nobody came to us in the first fifteen minutes. Then when we called them and told them we want to order for take-away, the person nodded and left... and did not come back. Then again when we spotted that person and asked him to give us the menu-card so that we could order( yes, we were in a particularly patient mood today), he mumbled something about the kitchen being closed and left. We had no option than to leave. I know they are new and it gets a little difficult to when you have more people than you expected, but this kind of mismanagement was a turn-off.
Would try visiting on some weekday. My rating is just for their (mis)management ( i didn't even get to taste their food).

Edit: Have been there since I first reviewed them, and absolutely love their food. But I still have an issue with their service.

The interiors are breathtaking but one can't go to a restaurant which has only ambience to boast of.
For vegetarian people like me, the restaurant doesn't have much choice. I ordered the seekh kabab and the galwati kabab..The seekh kabab was cold and tasted like salty halwa but the galawati one was just melt in the mouth and super tasty! 
For main course I ordered Dum pukht Biryani( best one i ever had) , Paneer qorma and roomali roti. the qorma wasn't somethimg to write home about. The roomali roti was simply cold and hard.
For vegetarians, a no-no

If possible I would have given a negative rating. I had gone to the restaurant after having read the reviews with some guests. It seems the restaurant is more interested to have film / serial shoots rather than serve food to guests. The state was so abysmal that the manager was not available for 10 minutes to address guests. There were others who had also come and were sent packing. The security guard was helpful enough to let us know the reality.
It seems money making and shooting are more important here than at least talking to guests and serving good food.

The first thing about this place which gets you wondering is the name of the restaurant itself..."Oudh 1590". At first glance, a strange name, with an even weirder number attached to it. After looking around online for some answers, I figured that the word "Oudh" comes from "Awadh". 

Wikipedia has this to say....."Awadh is a region in the centre of the modern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which was before independence known as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Also known in British historical texts as Oudh or Oude derived from Ayodhya, it was established around 1722 AD with Faizabad as its capital and Sadat Ali Khan as its first Nawab and progenitor of Nawabs of Awadh. The traditional capital of Awadh has been Faizabad and later Lucknow the capital of the modern day Uttar Pradesh." However, their menu card simply terms "Oudh" as the Lucknow of today.

So the number 1590 continues to remain a mystery. Well, I hear that it's simply the year 1590, to give this place a periodic feel, even though Awadh as a state was established in 1722.

Anyway, enough of boring you readers with facts and statistics about this place.....now lets jump right into the restaurant, interiors, and of course the food.

As you are about to enter, you simply can't miss the man with the moustache. He religiously guards the big wooden door, welcomes you in, and also helps out with the parking of your vehicle. It's always a welcome thing to have parking bang in front of the restaurant, in these days of space constraints, and traffic police harassment. 

The moment you enter, your eyes might take a few seconds in adjusting to the relatively dark interiors. But this dark and dim is a beautiful dark and dim. As it is, almost all the interiors of this place has a dark wooden finish which adds to the low light ambience. Even the air-conditioner was nicely camouflaged with a matching wooden paint scheme. Some might prefer a slightly brighter interior, some may not.....however, my wife and I seemed to love it. It being a Saturday, and us dropping in at lunch time, the place was pretty packed. Moreover, we hadn't booked a table. So we did have to wait a good 10 minutes before we were allotted a table. That was absolutely okay with us, however, one will have to go outside again to wait comfortably, as there is hardly any waiting space behind the doors of the restaurant. The moment you cross the door, the seating/ dining area begins. Not exactly a negative in my opinion, but it would have been nice if there was a small waiting area with a few seats. On a busy weekend when there are a lot of customers, the restaurant might appear very cramped...but it's supposedly a 55-seater which isn't too bad.

While we waited near the door, we simply stood there admiring the beauty of the interior design, and soaked in the feel of an era gone by. There was a soothing ghazal playing in the background, which added to this feel all the more. Soon we were seated, and a waiter dressed in a black sherwani came and handed us the menu card. In fact, it wasn't a card, it wasn't even a book...it was more like an ancient marble slate with the menu written on it.

After spending some time going through the exhaustive list of items on offer, we had to zero in on a few. In the meantime, 3 varieties of achaar were placed on our table. We ordered the following...

1. Mutton Burrah Kebab 
(The last I had gorged on this preparation was at Calcutta Club almost 3 years ago, and I've been looking for another place serving the same, ever since. Unfortunately, almost every place I've been to who offer this on paper, would not have it available. So when I apprehensively asked them whether Burrah Kebab was available, I was overjoyed when they said it is. The only rider was that, it would take around 20-25 minutes to prepare. My gustatory senses were so eagerly wanting to taste this, that I happily agreed to the waiting time, and asked them to serve the main dish instead...and told them that I'd happily have the "starter" at the end:)

2. Awadhi Handi Biriyani

3. Murgh Irani

4. A single Roomali Roti, to finish off the gravy of the Murgh Irani above.

Coming to the yummy gastronomic details now.....

I'll begin with the main course which was served first, as the starter was to be had later.....

A single plate order of "Awadhi Handi Biriyani" was just enough for the two of us. It contained 2 pieces of mutton, 2 eggs, and was served in an earthen pot. A decent amount of raita was served along with the biriyani too. What I figured about this was that it was partly, or fully cooked with pure ghee, as the moment I had my first spoon of this, there was this heavenly aroma of ghee...something I don't usually experience in most biriyani's of the city. At the same time, it didn't feel all oily, unhealthy and too heavy on our stomach. The mutton pieces were super tender and wonderfully cooked, and the eggs were the regular affair, and tasted like most eggs in a biriyani. Great start to the lunch:)

"Irani Murgh" had 2 moderately large and fleshy pieces of chicken, some cashew nuts sprinkled on top, and was submerged in a thick gravy to die for. After the biriyani and chicken was over, I spend a few private moments almost finishing off the gravy all on it's own...so tasty was this beautifully prepared gravy, while wife had the gravy with the roomali roti.

"Mutton Burrah Kebab" was brilliant in every respect, and maybe all the more, because my taste-buds were finally tasting this after 3 long years. As far as I can recall, the ones I had at Calcutta Club were  better...but I'm in no way indicating that these were less better. 3 pieces came on the plate, and I downed them myself. Some small areas of the kebab did seemed overtly cooked, but that didn't diminish it's mouthwatering taste. Yes, I was technically having this starter at the end of my entire meal...but it really doesn't matter when a starter is this yummy. "Starter", or "Later" doesn't really matter:)

After completing lunch for the day, allowing the food to settle down at the deepest recesses of our stomachs, and washing our hands in nice warm water given in finger-bowls.....we were offered 4 varieties of "Mukh Shuddhi" too. The bill for the day...Rs.857 only, which I think is a great deal considering that it's a weekend, a pretty posh restaurant, and that we had a pretty filling lunch. All cards and cash are accepted as payment.

Overall a great lunch, and lovely experience. Only thing I wanted to have, yet forgot to order, was "Brain Masala", another delicacy which I've had a lot during my younger days. However, I shall make sure I have it another day:) Didn't have any space left in our tummies for trying the desserts though.

Such a Mughal lunch would have been incomplete without a perfect "Paan". And lo and behold, as an extension of this restaurant was a "Banarasi Paan Shop" which seemed to be serving some excellent looking paans. Wife ordered a massive, yet juicy "Meetha Patta, Meetha Masala Paan" for me...and it almost lasted me the entire drive back home...such was it's filling and size. This just might become a regular paan-stop for me from now onwards, even if I'm not dining at "Oudh 1590" :)

Finally, the man with the moustache greets you with a lot of courtesy, yet again, as you are leaving. A healthy tip to this gentleman would be much appreciated, because he is the first person trying to make you feel welcome, he looks after your vehicle while you are enjoying the delicacies inside, and besides, it's him who would value this little money more than many others.

In my opinion, a great place to try authentic Mughlai and/or Lucknow delicacies, and not overtly expensive too. Highly recommended by me. And don't forget the paan-shop either, if you like your paans:)

(Have captured some photographs using my mobile phone, but most haven't come out well, due to the extremely dim lighting. Hope to have better photos next time, when I'll make sure to carry some better photographic equipment)

Went there tonight at arround 9:15pm with my family. Could easily feel the utter mismanagement with the waiters going arround like zombies...totally lost.....and the people sitting there complaining about the delay in serving food.The person at the  reception said that there is a waiting for at least 1.5 hrs.....which reaturant on earth has such a long waiting time. Anyway we decided to take parcel. When we sat down for dinner at home , found that they had given chicken rezala instead of mutton rezala (Difference in price Rs150/- more for the mutton rezala). I called up the resturant and told them what they had done. The person at the phone gave me a "plain sorry" and said that since there was rush, such a thing  can happen.......what utter rubbish, said they cannot do anything now, the manager will call me up tomorrow ( took may name and phone no). I am keeping my fingers crossed.....lets see if the manager calls me up and how he resolves the issue. Will post what happened later. Moreover the rezela was terrible....very very oily. 
Been two weeks , the call never came.
Dont get carried away by Telegraph reviews....the reviews are bullshit and the resturant is a disaster.

Yesterday evening I visited for a dinner with my family. I loved the food but few things to share. 
Its good that it wasnt raining, becuase they havent planned any waiting space and you need to manage that on road. Therefore fr July an umbrella (car may not be parked close to Oudh door) will be required till you get inside. 
Inside and outside decor is good.
Service need lot to do with, and improvement is possible. Few points i can share - 
a. Why they had panic look quite often
b. in loud voice the staff were talking among each other, and it wasnt so important 
c. Each table can be marked to some waiter / staff and not all should come down to ask about; because ultimately nobody served
d. Person (big mousache) at gate was trying to please all the people waiting outside. bubt his tips about empty table was not good and frequently people were again and again going in and coming out. The inisde guy was doing good work by coming out and calling people. 
Once food is over, please see that bill is issued fast. 

Regarding food - very good kebab and biriyani. Paratha was served cold, and no body could answer why they are cold. But i was too tired and already late to return it back. 
I will again come back for the food but will definelty book my seat. 
I think it will become a very good joint if they can improve service and maintain the food qualtiy. 
I wish you all the best.

I am a big foodie and generally eat out a lot.... hv travelled around the globe and hv eaten everywhere... for me food is a passion n i spend a lot of time reading aor watching programmes around food.
Today was my in laws 40th anniversary n we decided to celebrate over dinner at Oudh... We were 6 of us, me n my wife, my 8 yr old daughter, my mother n my in laws. We reached the restaurant at 8.50 pm n were told to wait for 30 mins.... The wait kept extending by 5 mins n finally we were let inside at 10pm.... By this time my mother, my in laws, all senior citizens were dead tired n exhausted... We had to further wait for another 15 mins till someone came n took our orders.. We ordered galauti kebabs, handi biryani, mutton chaap, chicken irani, naan n firni... The galauti was soft but had an overpowering taste of the masalas, handi biryani was ok, a little dry, not the ones we hv in kolkata or even in Lucknow... Chicken irani was v good, mutton chaap was v v poor.... Above all this i must admit the service was the worst I hv seen in my life, the waiter who took our order didnt hv a clue on 50% of the menu!!! 
While eating we saw an elderly gentleman complaining that he has been waiting for last one hour n he was told to wait for another 30 mins, to which he obviously lost his cool.... In my next table, my friend Oindrilla Dutt was having dinner with her friends n I saw her complaining about some wrong charge that was made on her bill.... This is so shameful... Which self respecting restaurant would do these things????
To sum up I would say my experience to Oudh was a nightmare an I really felt sorry for my family and especially my in laws for whom their 40th anniversary ended on such a bitter note.. 
I will request all my friends to stay clear from this horrible place coz THEY DON'T KNOW TO RESPECT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!

Considering I hadn't taken up my friend Shiladitya on his invitation to drop by and try his latest venture, I decided that the least I could do was a takeaway. Friday evening's office delivery consisted of just the real basics: Galawti Kebab, Fish Tikka and Lucknowi Parathas! These were undoubtedly first-rate and I promise to go back for the real things! The Galawti Kebab melted before I could spell out the word. The Fish Tikka was tender and spiced just right and the Lucknowi Parathas were soft, sweetish and thin, just as they're meant to be. A perfect sampler meal that only reassured me that if they had got it right with just these three items, there's enough reason to believe that there's much more that awaits us within Oudh 1590. Almost full marks to my friend! The guys just need to be a tad bit faster with their delivery service and ensure that the carry bag isn't handed over with the tubs upturned! Having to microwave lukewarm food just takes away half the salivation!

This is one of the best places to savour mughlai food in Kolkata. Period. Even after tasting biryanis and kebabs in almost all small and large joints in the city, I was blown away by the food of this place, especially the biryanis. Must to try dishes - Moti biryani, Awadhi biryani and the classic gosht biryani of course and mutton nihari. In the starters, Kalmi Kebabs were superb - very few restaurants in Kolkata serve good kalmi kebabs (excluding the 5 star ones). Galouti and Kakoris were also good but we had similar standards at Chhote Nawab. Good Moti biryani is hard to find, but was an absolute stunner here. Decor is also authentic, and tastefully done to get that old world Awadhi feel. Pocket pinch is reasonable for the quality of food served (approximately 1000 per couple excluding drinks). Waiters were polite and well mannered. 

The only point that made me deduct 0.5 points is the mismanaged service during peak weekend hours. Tip: try on week days. Also arrive early as seating capacity is not much.

It is a lousy place, notwithstanding the beautiful decor. We visit restaurants primarily for dining, for a feast for our palate, not for a visual feast. Visual delights can come as a bonus, but what should come first and foremost is  good and tasteful recipe. And it disappoints you from  the moment you try to place the order. And your ordeal has just started. The service is slow, even you have to literally grab the attendant and plead him to take your order. And when the plates arrive, you face the shock of your life. The chicken kebab ( afghani kabab) are cold! How on earth can you have cold kebab. Is that possible, unless you have prepared it sometime back and are just heating in microwave. You give him a benefit of doubt and ask him to get it heated, still it comes back, warm not hot. Then you realise you are deceived. You're surely in a wrong place. But it is late, already 9:30pm, too late to leave for a new place, besides, the main course is already placed.  So you assure yourself, the main course would be better. Why else some people have said good words about this restaurant. And the main course arrives, one bite and all hell breaks loose. Biryani is cold, ' zafrani kabak  chicken'is anything more than lukewarm and 'murgh Irani' is no better. My daughter is furious, she had spent hours trying to find out a good place on the net and this is what she got on her  last day before leaving for hostel and this is such a raw deal. She pushed her plate after a bite or two. The saving grace was Nan and paneer. We paid our bill and gave a mouthful to the man manning the counter. We promised him two things, not one- never to come back again and advice friends & relative not to come either. After all, there are restaurants in Kolkata who slog for you and give u a good time, decor or no decor. Who visits a restaurant for the decor in the first place?

Well friends this place is a must visit for all Kebab lovers. You would be blown off by the exquisite dining experience. Listening to the soft tune of the Qaawwali and gorging into sumptuous kebabs makes this place really special. The Awadhi cuisine makes it different from other places. The Mutton Galawati Kebab, Chicken qalmi kebab and zafrani fish are must to taste. Their biriyani especially the moti and jheenga one would give you the flavors of rich ghee and no dalda. At last if you want to have real good dessert then is the place. Try out their Shahi Tukra, believe me its out of the world. Yeah prices is on a higher side but still a must visit for all foodies.

Starting from the decor...to music...to ambience...almost everything is trying to please you and it does that quite well! The food as we ordered did not take much of a time to appear...the flavor of the food is real nice. The biriyani served to me did leave a mark on me. It probably is one of the better dishes that they have to offer and one of the better biriyanis that the city can offer. The service was good.The food had some great taste and flavours.A total delight.A lil towards costly...but you wont mind paying after you have had the food.

Visited the place today with friends.

Decor & Ambience (4.5/5) - beautifully done, liked the outside as much as inside. Loved the soft classical at the background. It suited the decor. Liked the moustache of the guard waiting outside :-)

Service (3/5) - Slow. Had to ask for water, menu card, assortments with the kebabs and spoons-forks for the main course. We entered at 2 o' clock and came out at 4. 2 hours for starters and main course was too much, had to wait for at least 30-45 mins after placing order for main course.

Food (2/5) - Service would not have mattered if the food was good.
There were some items definitely worth mention. Badam sharbat was so good, we repeated the order. Zafrani fish was perfect melt in mouth. Paratha was light and tasty. Firni was creamy and flavourful.
But everything else made us repent over the decision of coming to this place for lunch.
Soda shikanji was dull and can be made at home with jaljira mixed in sprite, aam khaas was nothing but tasted like the same old bottled aam panna sarbat. Very aam and nothing khaas.
Kakori kebab was dry, and galawti kebab nothing extra-ordinary(not bad though).Chicken afgani kebab was not bad but again nothing extra-ordinary, you can get something similar in any other restaurant.
Rezala(both murgh and ghosht) was the worst I have ever tasted. Gravy was very thick and tasted of  only butter and yogurt and nothing else. My friend got 2 of the 4 mutton rezala pieces mostly consisting of bone and very little meat on them. The chicken pieces from the rezala was hard and chewy and could not be swallowed even. Biryani was not that bad but not good either and keeping in mind the price we were paying for it, was very less in quantity.

Value for Money: my rating is 1.5/5(1 for the firni, badam sharbat and fish kebab, .5 for the decor)

Overall some very average food and some below average items did not deserve the price. Probably we were charged for enjoying the ambience.
Sadly only good decor and the 'so-called' fine dining experience will not be enough. Food has to be as good as the look of the restaurant promises.
My overall rating is 2.5

Came to Kolkata after almost and year and I was desperately searching for a place to try Biryani. Its when I came across Oudh. Though the name sounded a bit odd for a restaurant based in kolkata, yet interesting. Was not easy to find the place but their helpline service over the telephone made sure that I take lunch there only. Upon entering the place, got a feel of traditional and cultural dining. Staff tried out of their way to suggest the best from the menu. Afghani Murg was worth trying. The chicken pieces were soft and tender and with minimum spice. Their suggestion of having it with their paratha was also successful. Though the zafrani fish disappointed, yet the chicken kasha and murg biriyani made my day. Firni at the end garnished my lunch. Was pretty impressed by the presence of Diet Coke as most restaurants do not have them in their stock. Nice place to try mughlai among a nice decor and ambiance.

We had an excellent experience at Oudh 1590. The decor, ambience, cutlery, service, staff courtesy was exemplary and it did quite transport us to the Nawab & Badshah era. 

We ordered for Mutton Kakori, Mutton Galawti, Mutton Burrah and Zafrani Fish Tikka for starters. All the kebabs were succulent, tender, and perfect. Amongst the minced meat options my vote would go to Galawti rather than Kakori. I did not like the Lucknow Parantha that we ordered with Galawati but it did not match my expectations. I would rather have a Laccha or a Roomali Roti with Galawti. Please do not miss the Zafrani Fish tikka and Mutton Burrah, its a must for kebab connoisseurs. 

For the main course we ordered Mutton Handi Biriyani, Mutton Bhuna and Chicken Irani. The biriyani, served with eggs, was good, but I expected some bigger pieces of mutton. I personally did not taste the gravy items as I found them to be very rich. We did not have craving for a sweet tooth after the heavy meal but would definitely like to taste the Firni (looked tempting) on my next visit. I feel the best meal to have here would be the kebabs, accompanied by Laccha Paratha/Roomali Roti followed by Biriyani (if there is room for more).

One thing that bothered us was the background music. We did not quite appreciate the music and what was more annoying was that the restaurant did not have the option of turning the music off. The waiters said that it was controlled from the 'Head Office' and there was no option of muting the systems. This was quite strange as we were the only guests there, and there was no question of anybody objecting. I appreciate that Oudh was trying to give the guests a complete Mughal experience, but it should take into account the taste and preference of all the clients and incorporate some flexibility in their systems. 

With Kolkata now having some options for Awadhi cuisine, Oudh would not only be ranked amongst the best in the city but also give a run for money to restaurants in Delhi & Lucknow, serving Awadhi cuisine. Oudh: I will be back again, very soon...

I came across the attractive looking place while i was searching for an address near Deshapriya Park on saturday,  Had never heard about his restaurant, but the external facade was soo attractive that it compelled me to check it out and soon i noticed a traditionally dressed Security guard with a very big mustache and almost instantly i commented " moochche ho to nathu lal jaisi warna na hoo" :-) . I decided that i will be back with my friends next day to check out the food. The very next day i.e. sunday , we decided to visit this place for lunch and were mesmerized by the period interior and soothing classical music playing in the background . It has a very classy interior made of wood carving , the lighting is also very apt, A lot of detail has been given to every aspect, be it the wood carving , lampshades, the choice of music, the uniform of the waiters, the menu etc.. After taking some time to observe the details we finally order the food . Our expectation was already very high and i am delighted to say that it was completely fulfilled. The food here is awesome, slightly expensive though . The hospitality is good. Oudh being a lucknowi period dining restaurant, wanted to try their kulfi but they did not had it that day, tried the firni instead and as expected it was awesome. Will surely visit again with my parents this time . I am sure they too will love the experience.

The decor could have been better as far as the props are concerned. It looked too woody. Frontal view is excellent...so was the gateman's mooch hoh to ayeesa! Coming to the menu, the galawati kabab was awesome. The taste of handi biriyani was good but too oily (we ordered 3 handis), which could have been lesser. The mutton pieces were not at all standard and had mixed pieces which went to the extent of meatless in some pieces. I feel it could have been looked into considering the image of the organization.
Quality overall was quite good.

Great decor , good service and good food overall ! We ordered a Moti Biryani , Mutton Shammi Kebab , Galawati Kebab and the Lucknowi Paratha .... the Galawti Kebab and Paratha were spot on ... one of the best I have had in Kolkata but the real disappointment was the Shammi Kebab which was too dry and slightly on the sour side . The portions of the biryani were generous and the quality and flavour of the rice very good but once again I found the  "moti's" (actually a mutton kofta) too dry for my taste. We ended our meal with a firni which was very nice. Will definitely be back for more.

What could one ask for. The experience of Lucknow in the City of Joy.  Last week I went with my friends to OUDH 1590.It is in centrally located place near Deshapriya Park. The kebabs were lip smacking especially Galawati kebab. Biryani was soul satisfying.The rice used is of the finest quality.

Wind up your meal with another obvious choice - Shahi Tukda. Last and not the least ,the music was soul stirring and made us feel the royalness of the Era. The service is prompt and efficient. The food items are reasonably priced.

Great job. One of the best Awadhi food ever had. 
Kakori and Galawati just melts in the mouth.
Awadhi Handi Biryani, a must try....

Let me begin by saying I have just tried 3 items of their menu so far so my views are subjective. This is a new restaurant in town and I got to know about it when their home delivery menu was delivered to my house. I was quite impressed by their menu so I decided to try them out. I ordered a Murgh Biryani, a Mutton Kakori kebab and an Irani Murgh. 

Positives first - the Irani murgh was full of flavour and the gravy did them credit. The Kakori kebab was soft and delicate as it ought to be. They also packed a complimentary achari salad which went very well with the food.

Now the Negatives - The biryani wasn't good. It was dry and tasted more of turmeric than saffron. They need to improve on their recipe a lot. The Irani Murgh though otherwise excellent had a flaw. The chicken had blood stains inside it. They need to clean their meat properly. I have dumped several eateries based solely on this count although their food was tasty.

I believe this restaurant has the potential to be very good, so my advice is pay attention to your preparation and work on your recipes. I hope they are listening because I want to try out more of their menu.

BTW, Zomato has got the name wrong - it's Oudh not Soudh.
