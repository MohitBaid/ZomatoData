Had been to this place for a birthday party. It's located in sector 3 opposite to SAI. The white interiors adds to the sobreness of the place. The staff were courteous and served us nicely. We had chicken tandoori with fish fries for starters. The chicken was soft and was unusually brilliant but we were not much impressed by the fish fries. The main course food which had fried rice, chicken and prawn manchurian was okayish. A butterscotch ice-cream was also taken as a dessert. On the whole it's an average fooding outlet. Worth a one Time visit :)

Suddenly from yesterday evening liquor price has been increased dramatically. Those who can afford the price, welcome. For the rest like us, have to find new nest.

it has a grand feeling with great view and soothing coloured furniture but unfortunately the food was average. it is located right opposite SAI salt lake. usually this place is not much crowded , so u can spend quality time with friends over chit chats

I'd been to this place for a friend's birthday party. I had many chicken starters and had many helpings. The first round was delicious, just the right amount of spice. The chicken had been cooked to perfection in my opinion. The second round was the complete opposite and was just plain disappointing. The Dal Makhani and Butter Naan were amazing though, a must order if you're looking for a filling meal.

Me and my wife love this place especially for their comfy interior with a view of the road. We only tried their Chinese so far and found it quite decent. They definitely do not have a lavish spread of food; however this is definitely a place to go if you want a value for money where the experience of interiors is actually on the high end side.

A small, spik and span pretty place. The white interiors add to the beauty of the place. This one's located on the main road, easy to locate. Their fish items are really good. Try ordering Fish Punjabi. The drinks are priced reasonably. We had opted for their paneer cheese pakoras which went wel with the drinks. Recommended!
