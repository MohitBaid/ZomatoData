This is the best sweet shop ive ever visited.The yummy taste keeps me visiting there again and again.The quality of thier products are far better than any other sweet shops in north kolkata.No other sweet maker stand a competition to them.Price is okay as many shops nowadays charge a lot for their sweets specially chocolate sweets but fail to satisfy the taste buds,here the choco talsash,chocochips and black forests are really magical.The variety of sweets are huge and all pure ghee made,also their radhavallabi,samosa,paneer patties and other snack items are mouth watering.

This is a new sweet shop which has opened in Lake Town near Jaya Cinema Hall. The sweets are slightly overpriced but has air conditioning inside...which is a rarity for sweet shops. Had Baked rosogollas...in love with them recently. They came for 20 rupees each. Another delicacy which I tried here was Roshmalai. It tasted great. It was made of Kheer, which made it more tasty. Will keep on visiting here for more...with a heavier wallet next time :P

I have tried many sweets and dahis in there. The shop is very neat and clean which I liked the most. Behaviors of the people work in there are good enough. I loved misti doi, aam doi, baked rosogolla & rabri from there which making me visit there again and again. I'm so much glad to have such sweet shop providing good quality sweets for us.

I tried the baked rossogolla , malai chamcham and Dry rabri from this sweet shop. Their products are really good in terms of  both taste and quality. Priced at Rs 20, 12 and 40 respectively which seem to be on the higher side , still i would like to recommend their dry rabri to people who loves the taste of 'kalakand' , this one is a cup of pure love!

লেক টাউনে অবস্থিত মিষ্টির দোকান । পরিচ্ছন্ন পরিবেশ । সুন্দর ভাবে সাজানো । গোলাপ জাম খেয়েছিলাম । আরেকটু করা হলে ভালো হয় । ব্যবহার ভালো । পরিবেশন দ্রুত ।

***** My 800th Review ********

Anandamoyee Sweets the name is pretty old but few people have idea that their ownership lies with the famous and old Ananda Caterer. 

*****Location: 
On the lanes of Lake town main road towards Jaya Movie hall close to RB diagnostics.

**** Experience: 
Walked into their outlet last evening for grabbing some sweets for my grandmother staying at Laketown. While entering quickly noticed some of their special names of sweets among which the dry rabri grabbed my attention. After getting some malai chom chom and dhokla packed my heart craved for the dry rabri. 

I quickly ordered for a small cup of 100 gms of the dry rabri cost at 40. At first I thought its costly but the first spoon changed it all. It was Wow!!!! They just bowled me over the taste and deliciousness. 
I can bet on saying that this is the best in the city presently and totally deserves a recognition. 

The dhokla was fresh and packed with chatni with it and the malai chom chom was juicy and heaven for sweet lovers as well.

Service was quick and the staffs are very courteous and helpful.

 Will surely come back for more and have that dry rabri once again

For good sweets do visit this place. This outlet is much more bigger and has much more variety than its branch near Ananya Cinema Hall near Tobin Road. This place has a wide variety for takers of different kind of sweets. The chocolate sandesh, rabdi, aam dahi and everything is too good. It's situated just next to the lake town Spencer's.
