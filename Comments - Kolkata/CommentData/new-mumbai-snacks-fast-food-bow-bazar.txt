Excellent snacks center. I have tried almost all of their sandwich while I walk to and fro from this Street. Each of their items are delicious.
Their veg Mayonis sandwich tastes excellent, perfectly grilled and enough stuffs inside to give your taste buds tickles. Corn Cheese sandwich is another best item that I have tried here.
Being a roadside stall, and very small in size, it doesn't have a seating arrangement. But foods are really good.
