The place is located at the James long crossing of Manton, opposite to another restaurant, Hatari. The ambience over here is quite decent; however the place is a bit small, according to what a proper restaurant must have. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken hot and sour soup, which was pretty well prepared with right amount of spices.

In the main course, we ordered mutton biriyani and chicken tikka masala. We ordered tandoori butter roti that was fluffy and good. The biriyani was nicely cooked, and was not over spicy. The mutton was nicely marinated and presented. However chicken tikka masala did not come up according to our expectations. It was over spicy and the chicken was quite stiff.

But on the whole, it was good to land up in this place with your family or friends for small get-togethers.

So just now i ordered mutton dum biriyani from here. The biriyani was stale. And the mutton tasted so sour. They charge like 220 rupees for a plate of biriyani and I thought it must be good because they are charging a high price for it.
Utterly disappointed. Roadside 80 rs biriyani is better than this. 
I should have thrown 220 rupees in gutter.

Went here today with a friend. Expected a lot from this place. It was empty when we entered. Decor is good. We ordered - 

1)BBQ chicken- The chicken was really tasty and the amount was good enough for two. 
2) Cantonese mixed noodles- I didn't like the noodles. It was kind of sticky.
3) A dish of chicken which was quite spicy and undercooked. I can't recollect the name of the dish. Well, while I was having the food I came across a pin that was along with the food. As I complained to the waiter, he didn't say anything. And as we finished our food, the manager walked towards us and gave both of us complimentary ice creams. That gesture of sorry was really good. So for the gesture, I am giving 3 out of 5.

Though I was a bit turned down by the negative reviews regarding biryani..I decided to give it a try. So my friend and I went for dinner over there. We ordered chicken dum biryani and chicken bharta. Both  the items were very good..the waiters also took care to take our feedback regarding the food. The ambience is undoubtedly a feast to the eyes..hoping to visit there soon with my family. The reason I'm giving 4 and not 5 is because the waiters were too interested in the tv..and we had to look at them to grab their attention..everything else was fine.

Been there today with family. Very soothing ambience  with eye catching decorations. Now Shifting towards food, the food quality is finger licking , specially the Biriyani is very light with less oil,  the service and reception deserves a thumbs up. Overall a perfect place to treat your tummy at a reasonable price.

Haven't been to this place, but ordered food from here. the price is quite reasonable. ordered Dum Biriyani and it was awesome. Unlike other places they give two pieces pf chicken/mutton in a plate of Biriyani. I don't know about other dishes, but there biriyani was really good.

Been there once. 

Let's first talk about what I didn't like about it. 

FLIES.

Yes, Flies. Very irritating and off putting to see flies here and there. 

Also, I had to keep looking at waiter bcz they were busy looking at TV. 


Food was decent but little oily. I asked one dish to be made spicy but I found only chunks of red chillies here. It wasn't spicy it was red hot. 

Rest, there is nothing much to talk about. 

Flies has to allowed only after closing hours. This would help a lot.

Located just Opposite Hatari, a big restaurant with good decor. We ordered veg fried rice and veg Manchurian. It took them 30 mins to prepare the dish. The fried rice was bland and the Manchurian was burnt. The Manchurian was so hard that to bite it like a biscuit. Absolute worst. The service was good. Not going back again.

Royal Height should be renamed as Royal Disaster!!
Worst Chicken Biryani ever tasted!!! even roadside stalls make better biryani's than them...

just few hours ago ordered 1 Chef Special Chicken Biryani for 303rs (including tax vat discount and all) through swiggy!

Review - Worstest!!!!
the biryani contained 2 chicken 2 alu 1 & 1/2 egg and 1 small packet of curd/raita!
the rice had no flavour no taste no salt just yellow colored rice bas that's it!!
same goes for the chickens! no flavour no salt and taste!

When you pay 300+rs u don't expect something like this.. don't you? 

royal disaster just destroyed my Sunday!!

Located rightly opposite of hatari behala. It is a hotel cum restaurant. Carpet area is not that spacious. Staffs are well behaved. Well decorated, neat n clean. It has started its journey just 4-5 months ago. So, it is a newly made destination for the foodies.
      I went there with my parents for a dinner. We placed the order of chicken Dum biriyani, tandoori roti and chilli chicken. Though chilli chicken is a Chinese item, my parents still prefer it with tandoori roti. Paneer tikka was there as starter, which was good. Roti and chilli chicken was average. Biriyani served with raita was tasty though it was bit oily.
         In dessert they couldn't offer anything except certain item and we had to choose among them only. We ordered virgin mojito mocktail and masala cold drink. Both were ordinary.
         Foods were all okay with respect to the cost. But they need to focus on the quick service. Inspite of an empty hall they took 25 minutes to get the food ready to deliver. Overall a good experience.

"Pen is mightier than a sword"- Edward Bulwer lytton
On the eve of Christmas after a stomping fight at Park Street with the bustling crowd and a very hungry belly we finally landed to behala a residential place of all my friends and a schooling place of myself.The idea was to have a proper dinner and end this year's Christmas on a happy notation. But to our greatest regret would always have an Un-merry Christmas from the moment we stepped into Royal Height. As the name suggests this place is the height of mismanagement, miscommitment, disgrace,and is the epitome of what seems worthless. The menu served to us was a 6 pager eyewash. They said they specialized in Indian cuisine but did not have BIRYANI, neither pulao and the best part was they were not able to take any order on consisting of rice as the rice was boiling in their kitchen and had not reached the boiling point yet.Finally after a subtle laughter giggles between our friends we humble asked the waiter to suggest what was available which he would recommend and was edible,keeping in mind that the time was 10-45 and we were hungry. He suggested the dishes which were the quickest in preparation and guaranteed us that it would be served in 20 minutes. We gladly went with him and placed the order time#10-45. Tick tock went the clock and trust me I have not waited so restlessly even for my marksheet.Watching the clock biting nails and drinking water we patiently sat and convinced each other that sooner or later we would be redeemed of hunger and wait.Time # 11-30....Still waiting... Finally what we got was half the order which was 2 butter nun and 1 chicken bharta after 45 min..Even my GRANDMOM can cook faster than that.The rest of the order was still Work in Progress....So what began with  a thought of delight ended to be ROYAL HEIGHTS OF WORST PLACE TO GO FOR FOOD.  Guys read carefully with complaints from adjusant tables of rotten food , late service, fake promises, and I'll rotten waiters I guess you should try a some other form of business rather than opening up a Restaurant. I would humbly request all the readers not to go to this Royal Height of Embarrassment in any near future.
Conclusion - what did we see and what did we learn. 
We saw a new shining and glamorous restaurant right opposite Hatari and wanted to try something new.
We learnt that Royal Height is the worst place in Kolkata for a name of a restaurant.
P.S I am neither a professional blogger nor am I paid to write this..I am just a hungry person who expected some good service and quality food on Christmas Eve

horrible experience that I have ever had in a restaurant.  waiter and even the manager can't speak proper English.  nothing is available. not even rice. somehow we ordered food n had to wait for 45 mins when we finally decided to leave. a strong suggestion being a resident of Behala that do shut this down coz of ur INCAPABILITY to serve.  just shut that down. how can u ppl dare to open up with  such inefficiency that too right in front of  Hatari...  kuch toh sharam kar. nei doob mar... @abhirup roychowdhury @sampurna roychowdhury @romit ray

             5. Chef's Special Chicken Patiala- Now this one is the winner amongst all that we ordered. Boneless & succulent chicken piece wrapped in egg with a thick gravy. taste & presentation 10/10
             6.  American Chopsuey- Typical Authentic Chopsuey with the American flavor. The presentation needs to be highlighted here, the noodles, topped with the American gravy and on the top, the egg with SUNNY SIDE UP. Amazingly done. Taste 8.5/10 and presentation 10/10
             7. Lachha Paratha- Non oily, light and very soft.
             8. Jaljeera- The perfect appetiser with pudina & lemon.

Pocket friendly. Well behaved staff. Amazing ambience. Super Tasty Food. Best quality ingredients. What else would u want from a multicuisine restaurant?

"Pen is mightier than a sword"- Edward Bulwer lytton
On the eve of Christmas after a stomping fight at Park Street with the bustling crowd and a very hungry belly we finally landed to behala a residential place of all my friends and a schooling place of myself.The idea was to have a proper dinner and end this year's Christmas on a happy notation. But to our greatest regret would always have an Un-merry Christmas from the moment we stepped into Royal Height. As the name suggests this place is the height of mismanagement, miscommitment, disgrace,and is the epitome of what seems worthless. The menu served to us was a 6 pager eyewash. They said they specialized in Indian cuisine but did not have BIRYANI, neither pulao and the best part was they were not able to take any order on consisting of rice as the rice was boiling in their kitchen and had not reached the boiling point yet.Finally after a subtle laughter giggles between our friends we humble asked the waiter to suggest what was available which he would recommend and was edible,keeping in mind that the time was 10-45 and we were hungry. He suggested the dishes which were the quickest in preparation and guaranteed us that it would be served in 20 minutes. We gladly went with him and placed the order time#10-45. Tick tock went the clock and trust me I have not waited so restlessly even for my marksheet.Watching the clock biting nails and drinking water we patiently sat and convinced each other that sooner or later we would be redeemed of hunger and wait.Time # 11-30....Still waiting... Finally what we got was half the order which was 2 butter nun and 1 chicken bharta after 45 min..Even my GRANDMOM can cook faster than that.The rest of the order was still Work in Progress....So what began with  a thought of delight ended to be ROYAL HEIGHTS OF WORST PLACE TO GO FOR FOOD.  Guys read carefully with complaints from adjusant tables of rotten food , late service, fake promises, and I'll rotten waiters I guess you should try a some other form of business rather than opening up a Restaurant. I would humbly request all the readers not to go to this Royal Height of Embarrassment in any near future.
Conclusion - what did we see and what did we learn. 
We saw a new shining and glamorous restaurant right opposite Hatari and wanted to try something new.
We learnt that Royal Height is the worst place in Kolkata for a name of a restaurant.
P.S I am neither a professional blogger nor am I paid to write this..I am just a hungry person who expected some good service and quality food on Christmas Eve

horrible experience that I have ever had in a restaurant.  waiter and even the manager can't speak proper English.  nothing is available. not even rice. somehow we ordered food n had to wait for 45 mins when we finally decided to leave. a strong suggestion being a resident of Behala that do shut this down coz of ur INCAPABILITY to serve.  just shut that down. how can u ppl dare to open up with  such inefficiency that too right in front of  Hatari...  kuch toh sharam kar. nei doob mar... @abhirup roychowdhury @sampurna roychowdhury @romit ray

Ordered Chef's special chicken Patiwala,Masala Kulcha and Butter Naans..The Chicken preparation was very delectable.Succulent boneless chicken pieces skewered in the tandoor and enveloped in an omelette with a white gravy (butter,onions,bellpapers and sundry)..Something I had for the 1st time and it was delicious..Naans and kulcha was soft even though home-delivered..Fantastic experience..Hope the franchisee grows from strength to strength in the upcoming future..Keep up the good work and don't let the standards(quality & quantity) wise drop which is a common case in a Behala joint..




On the occasion of New Year I ordered Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani,Mutton Dum Pukht Biryani and Chicken Bharta fir home delivery...


Pathetic Biryani,the worst I have ever tasted in my lifetime.Chicken was stale and tough to digest,rice was bland,overloaded with spices,horrible.

Chicken Bharta - The menu stated 4 pieces chicken..It seemed vey confusing as I have always had a Chicken Bharta boneless and shredded..To my surprise it came boneless and shredded.Why is it wrongly described ??????
It had MUTTON FAT in it !!!!!! I mean why ??? Extremely spicy.

Horrible beginning to the New Year...

Waste of everything....Am alarmed at the standards falling so drastically within days...Please look into it.

Opposite of Hatari. We visited just after the inauguration day most probably on Astami. Food quality and quantity is not enough as compared to the price even there was no water in the Basin and Toilet. Hope they will fix these problems in future.
