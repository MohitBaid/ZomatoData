Exceptional home-delivery service. Very nice quantity and quality. Totally enjoyed the food with family. The home delivered food was piping hot too. Shall be ordering more often.

A disgusting place to start with. My order got refused because they thought the order was not "Proper". Minimum order was worth 100. So i did order above that. These type of places should not be on Zomato. Brings down the standard.

Was expecting better food quality by judging from outside.. Food taste is not at par with the pricing. Secondly the recipe is not standardised. However good part is that you get delivery services even a bit late as well .

Not a very high-fi restaurant i must say. Food quality is just about ok. Price is reasonable. Doesn't always serve fresh food thats a problem. Sometimes the chicken are like elastic and sometimes it is so soft that its just perfect.

If you want diarrhoea and other such ailments, you are welcome to this place. The biriyani was drenched in oil. The ambiance is asphyxiating, and the noisiness engulfing the place catalyses irritation.

Nice restaurant,air conditioned, I use to go there to have Chinese foods only and to avoid crowd also. This is not in barasat, it is beside BT college bus stoppage, new barrackpore, jessore road. Price is OK, taste is OK ..... Simple, casual dinnings in a prime location with almost no crowd makes me happy about this place. I never found rush here, be it any festival, but it doesn't mean that the restaurant is not good at all, actually there are some other branded restaurants nearby who are giving this competition, go enjoy the food without any hassle.

Very good food at good price! That's how I would like to sum up dolphin's food. 
I never sat inside the Restaurent and ate, but cross this place regularly. It's right on main road . Their home delivery service is excellent. My favourite is their crispy chilli baby corn and chicken tandoori which we regularly order for home delivery. Their and Indian both are good ! A saviour in busy times while entertaining visitors :)

I do visit this place very frequently as its nearby to my place.Its a very good restaurant if we talk about food.The food is tasty.I have order last time sweet corn chicken soup,fish finger,chowmin,chilly chicken.The quality is a bit less but its very tasty ðŸ˜‹.The bill is also very much pocket friendly.The staffs provides a homely atmosphere.I love to go.Basically the airport view from the balcony is also a high attraction.Preferably seat in 1st floor.

USP : location. You can enjoy the view of runway of Kolkata airport.
Food : strictly okay.
Secret: go to rooftop if they allow you. You will get a better view of Kolkata airport and the turn of Jessore Road.

No ambiance, Nothing much of a decor. The balcony is good, you can get a clear look of Jessore Road and the Runway. Coming to the food, The soup that we had ordered was not upto the mark, The veggies were old and frozen, the chicken was not Â soft and they use knorr soup or maggi masala. The chicken starters were nice, the sauce was good. Fried rice was not upto the mark. The quantity and quality of food is not at all good.

Don't jump over to Chinese cuisine but the chicken tikka butter masala is the best so far their kitchen has produced, and in veg paneer butter masala is good , and the best bread ????  you could order is naan .. That's all.
