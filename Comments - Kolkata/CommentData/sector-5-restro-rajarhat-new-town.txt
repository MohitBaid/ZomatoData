Initially,the delivery guy took 10rs more and didn't bother to return us back inspite of our complaint. Added to that, he didn't deliver the complimentary rasgulla which the zomato has offered us. Later on, they sent a delivery boy with the rasgulla and the money.

Other than that, this is a reasonably priced food joint. Mixed fried rice was tasty and the quantity was impressive . Manchurian chicken, kung pao chicken, both tasted good but the gravy was very less.

The rice was not properly steamed... and the chicken tasted horrible... chicken smells rotten and very hard to bite...

Located somewhere in Dlf1 rajarhat(complicated). Went to diz place on a lazy sunny afternun,on reaching there found that m d only one at dat tym.Ordered Chicken Noodles and Chilli Chicken & cold drink.The Noodles  along with d chicken preparation were quite tasty. The noodles was only a bit oily.The chilli chicken was perfect.The place is very pocket friendly.There was only 1 one server present who was busy with much other work also so a bit delayed service.                                     Conclusion:The place can be tried if you want it to be pocket friendly and you r nearby d place.The restro must provide proper attention to avoid hygiene issues in future!

NEVER EVER EVEN THINK TO ORDER FOOD FROM THIS RESTAURANT !! I REPEAT NEVERR !!I ordered Dal Makhni and Subz Tawa Masala, Dal Makhni was not dal makhni at all, and the sabzi was soooo oily that the packet in which food was delivered was immersed in oil and it spoiled the table on which i had food.

I could hardly swallow and therefore had to throw after eating 10% of it.

Bad Experience: Vegetarians Beware.

I ordered food at 1.30pm, and expected time was 1hour. when it was time to get the food at 2.30pm, the restaurent calls me and says that we will dispatch the order only after 2-3 orders of same location get collected. order will take time.

And when the order arrived after 1 and half hour instead of Veg order, it contained chicken.

Zomato and the restaurent arranged for the replacement which arrived at 4.40pm.

Well, the grades of a student might not truly reflect his or her talent â€“ and similarly, the Zomato ratings might also not truly reflect the true worth of a restaurant or outlet! And yes, this is the feeling I had post relishing my meal from this place!

Thy name (Sector V restaurant) might be misleading â€“ and they are definitely not based out of Sector 5, Saltlake â€“ rather somewhere in Rajarhat! I ordered an office delivery of their Steam rice as well as mixed vegetable, which was delivered pretty timely.

A modest packing charge was levied to my bill, which was truly worth it. Food packing and presentation â€“ both were great. The rice was not a basmati, but still a good quality one. However, the mixed veg was a stunner â€“ a perfect cocktail of all the seasonal vegetables â€“ peas, carrots, potato, cauliflower, beans and what not!

Steam rice went just too well with this veggie and the combination tasted something just out of the world â€“ nice to see that all food was still hot, although, their outlet is somewhat distant from my office and commuting to my place would have definitely warranted a decent amount of time!

They were kind enough to serve some complimentary salads also along with the above order.

My afternoon cost me just 210 bucks â€“ and gave me a delicious meal as well as several memories to cherish in return!

A heartfelt thanks to the management for this experience and loads of luck of luck to this place â€“ RECOMMENDED!

Today i have ordered chilly chicken gravy chowmin and other items. But when i opened the container it seems like there is no gravy in that item and it also tastes so bad that i can't even finish it. You should have improved the quality of this item. Next time on wards, i would think twice before ordering this item because in the menu card it is saying that it contains gravy but in the reality there is no gravy in it. Seems like hakka or fried chowmin. The image clearly says that thing.

Despite being pretty understaffed, the place definitely strives up to deliver quality in food and service. The owner is particularly very courteous and personally looks into every other table. The food is very good. The place mainly serves Chinese, but North Indian dishes are also available. The noodles are pretty up to the mark and the side dishes are delicious. The food quantity is sufficient as well.

The way I see it, the place can become a hit provided it continues serving its customers the same way as it does now.

The menu is diverse and the waiters and management team are extremely well behaved. We had ordered prawn chips,Cantonese mixed noodles and chilly chicken. Though the chips was slightly on the oilier side the rest were well prepared and tasty. The quantity was enough for two and quality was upto the mark actually very good.
