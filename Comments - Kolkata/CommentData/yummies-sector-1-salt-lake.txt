Visit this outlet quite often as it is very near to my house .The outlet is located in the garage area of a house near swimming pool in CF Block , Salt Lake . Some plastic stools are placed in the passage area of the house which act as the sitting area .Mostly visit here for their rolls be it egg , Chicken or otherwise . The paratha of the rolls is a long & thin one with generous amount of stuffing inside. They also have different kind of kebabs & rolls with stuffing of kebabs . The Dahi Chicken Roll is a popular variety & is quite good . Nice place to hang around with friends while having a roll of your choice .

Standing in front of Bancharam one would be gastronomically led through a kebabish smell into the backyard of a house. There you will find the magical cave of Alibaba which is a fast food joint called yummies. 
The aroma of Indian spices and tandoor will enamour your senses. I love this place for the awesome rolls and tandoor. Visually not that appealing but gastronomically addictive.

Serves one of the best non vegetarian rolls in Salt Lake. The kababs are also all worth a shot. Personal recommendation - Chicken Reshmi Kabab

Arguably the best roll shop I've been to. The rolls are large and delicious. Not much ketchup but awesome. The filing is also in generous amounts. Special mention to their dahi chicken roll. It's definitely worth returning to.

Rolls in Salt Lake tend to...suck. You're generally stuck with Ali Baba, or one of the random roll wallahs. This one's an exception. The dahi egg chicken roll was very good, and the parathas for the rolls are thin and flaky, not oily or too chewy. No home delivery yet, but it's definitely a place we'll be going back to. Hopefully they'll stay consistent!

I had egg dahi chicken roll and i found it fine. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
A new way to have roll and you will not find it everywhere.

A great fast food joint, one of the oldest near the swimming pool area.(10 mins walk from my home)
They have great rolls, kababs and chowmein.
Irani tengri kabab, chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tandoori,chicken roll, dahi chicken roll are must haves.
Staff are very nice and treat you in a friendly way.
Although they get a lot of customers, they are able to manage customer rush very well.
I have always loved this place since I first discovered it some 10-12 years back.
It has since been my favorite fast food junction.

Yummies is located in a garage, right beside Makhan Das in the swimming pool area. This had once been a popular joint for rolls and kebabs but fell away to sub-average food in between. Now, they've returned with great vigor! You must try the Kali Mirch Chicken Roll (75 for half). If you try the full version, it has one full plate of kebabs rolled into it and is huge. It has a lovely green chutney slathered over the juicy chicken with the perfect hint of lime. This is an absolute favorite! The other varieties of tandoor rolls are great too such as the Hariyali or Reshmi. Just be ready to wait for it takes a while for them to prepare the food.

You are near saltlake swimming pool and you ought to visit this place for some mouth watering kebabs,tandoori and rolls. In the Roll section the dahi chicken roll isÂ  very popular here.For kebabs and tandoori do try their chicken tangri,tandoori chicken ,hariyali kebab.we also has noodles and chilli chicken once.Chili chicken was not that great but for noodles the quantity they serve will do for two hungry souls.
Pricing is very decent.
Overall if you are a kebab / tandoori fan do try this place.

If u r in saltlake and want quick bites without spending much, u must head for yummies. The rolls are great in terms of size as well as taste. Dahi chicken roll is a wonder. Not only non veg , their veg rolls are also tasty. Not just roll they also are specialized in kebabs.

One of the most underrated outlets of good quality Kathi Rolls.
A normal egg chicken roll is pretty good here and the size is far better than other places.
I like the quality of the paratha here.
Two amazing things to try here, chicken dahi roll, something different and really good.
The kabab roll where instead of normal chicken pieces, the roll will be stuffed with kabab pieces of your choice.
The place is clean and they serve quite fast.

Craving for some tasty roll, we came across this outlet..the outlet is clean compared to other outlets that serve rolls and kababs..there are a variety of kababs and rolls.

I particularly liked the roll of this joint as the roti was crispy and the roll didn't have oil dripping from it..chicken in the roll was well cooked..the paneer roll was also good.

Overall a good place if you want to try something new.

Visited the place after hearing about the chicken dahi roll. It was innovative and worth trying. The service was quite ok, but lacks professionalism. For a place like salt lake yummies serves the purpose.

One of my favourite fast food destinations around in.salt lake. I wont say the price is cheap but after u dig ur first bite, the price wont matter. The chicken tengri, double chicken roll, n kababs, r just too good!! I would recommend all the food junkies to visit this place!!

The hygiene of the place is very bad.Once I ordered Chowmein and the man cooking it literally sneezed on the food while serving it. It must be closed down very soon or else many people would get sick.

Was a good place for rolls. Off late post the price hike, the paratha is longer and the stuffing lesser...Â 

Have to look for other options for rolls.
            

Update after recent buys: Go for double chicken rolls to get the meaty taste. Also tried reshmi kebabs but were too salty for my taste :(

I gave them 5 out of 5 because you get a good quantity/quality food at a decent price.

We can only consider this to be a good take away junction at salt lake. They serve diff types of kabab and tandoori. At Rs 240/- you will get a full plate chicken tandoori with 4 big size pieces of chicken with juicy flesh that melts on your mouth.  Kabab ranges from Rs 100-200 per plate having 5 decent sized pieces. They also prepare Chinese food but those are too average( just like street foods but only with good quality). 

I think if you are a big kabab, kabab roll lover, you should definitely try it once for rake aways.

If you find yourself near salt lake swimming pool for any reason do give this place a visit. I would not call this place exactly cheap, but what you give is what you get. The double chicken roll that I had at this place was enough to complete a normal foodies dinner and costed only 80.  A wide array of street food is offerred from rolls to noodles and shikh kebabs.
