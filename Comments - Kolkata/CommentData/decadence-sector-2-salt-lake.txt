I ordered a chocolate cake for my mum's b'day. I am glad i did because the cake was really awesome, it looked gorgeous and tasted even more delicious. The cake was totally worth it . I look forward to buying more cakes from here in future. Cheers :)

Decadence is my ultimate destination for cakes, brownies, chocolates and muffins. Must try it.

This place is totally worth the price paid.Â 
The cupcakes are delectable and a lot of different options are available.
The eggless variant in the cakes is a sheer delight for vegetarians.
Do order the big gourmet cakes for any part or ocassion.

Would definitely recommend to try it once.:)

I had ordered a cake for Christmas from here. It was a small cake which was charged 1000 and was totally not worth it.
The cake was hard, flavorless, and just plain nasty.
The butter cream on top was not properly whipped and one could actually feel the sugar granules not mixed in properly.
This was by far the worst cake I have ever had. Really brought down my confidence on ordering from boutique bakeries.
A work of a complete novice, please don't waste your money here.

I first encountered Decadence about 3 years ago. I was given a whole slab of chocolate brownie cake for my birthday ...deliciously dark chocolate, crunchy crust on top and perfectly moist inside. My friends and I polished it off in 10 minutes tops!

Since then, I've think I've tried every single flavour of cookie (delicious, must try), the tiramisu (very difficult to get a good one, especially in Cal, but Decadence nails it)  and numerous cakes and tarts (I'd recommend almond) . The cakes are always creative; either in flavour or design....I've learnt to give Siddhi (owner / pastry chef) a free reign. The benefits of it being a home business are that she customises cakes to your exact, and sometimes unconventional, requirements. 

The tarts are authentic French too! Solid flavours of fruits / nuts and not sugary sweet like most bakery products.

I'll definitely be patronising Decadence for all my bakery needs in Calcutta :)

I ordered a cake from Decadence and quite liked the friendly voice of the young lady on the phone. But when I went to fetch my cake I realized that this is no outlet, it is just a home with no signage.
The cake was a disappointment, in spite of the strong coffee flavour I had requested. It was hard and had not risen properly, the work of a novice.
Lesson learnt. I am never going to patronize 'bright' young things again.

It's my friend's venture, so of course I'm biased. Lol! But even if I was to leave that aside, I don't think I'd be able to criticize them in any way. Their chocolate pastries are a must-try. Occasion or not, you can't go wrong with Decandence. Can't wait to go back and try more.
