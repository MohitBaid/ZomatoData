A rather underrated place but serves excellent Mughlai food. It's connoisseurs (me included) can vouch for that, hand down. It's a treat to indulge in their Biryani, Chaap, Mutton Paya, Mutton Stew, Dal Gosht, Keema, Kaleji among others...

Located in a very crowded street...Mezban offers a huge variety of Mughlai food. We were in a hurry so packed an egg biriyani and a chicken chaap...
The food quality and the taste both were outstanding 🙂 would visit again if I get a chance. On top of that it’s extremely pocket friendly

Few days ago ordered their chicken biryani & chicken malai kabab through zomato and what delivered to me was pure delicacies.
Chicken biryani-if you like medium spiced & extremely generous portion of rice & chicken,then Mezban will hit the spot with their heady masala.
Chicken malai kabab-extremely soft & tender chicken kabab wrapped in cream.
 Give it a try, I am also looking for my next visit.

"Mezban" it's an typically muglai cuisine restaurant , situated near Ripon street bata more , its one of the leading biryani joints in Kolkata, I would not elaborate long coming straight to their food they make some quality biryani & regarding their pricing of their foods is quite cheap, I ordered one plate chicken biryani through zomato online delivery , the taste of the biryani was amazing not so oily , moderate spices & not to forget the aloo it's Kolkata biryani specialty which makes the best one.

I ordered food for my parents and to my knowledge it was sent way to advance of the specified time The food quality and quantity was amazing. Their Biryani is to die for, apart from that the Chinese dishes are too go to resist. Chicken Tandoori taste superb. Overall a 5 star rated taste. Will surely order again. the only thing I would suggest is the restaurant should start looking at the delivery time mentioned in the order. Price comparison is great to. Must try all.

Now mezban is a place that has been my fav ever since childhood as it is located near my aunt's house.  We have been seeing this place grow more and more since then.  From its chai to its biryani everything seems to be a blend of flavours and memories that this place holds.  In terms of fooding, it excels in the biryani and tandoori chicken.  If u are on the hunt for some real good masale-daar tandoori go check this place out as the chicken is cooked to perfection.  A must try place

Mezban was pending for a while. I had read good reviews about the place on Calcutta Times. Finally we ordered, and it was a good experience overall. Firstly, kudos to the restaurant for delivering us 21 packets of Mutton Biriyani, 21 packets of Chicken Chanp and 3 packets of Fish Tikka within an hour, and at a time when most restaurants couldn't. The credit should however be shared with Zomato too. The Mutton Biriyani had a great balance of spices. The taste had a lingering effect, remaining true to any Biriyani lover's expectation and excitement. The Botis were perfectly cooked and delectably juicy. So were the Aloos. We hogged without the slightest inhibition. The Chicken Chanp was too spicy. Ideally one should take a small portion of the gravy to balance the taste. However, the chicken tasted a bit flat, as it didn't absorb the masala amply. The Fish Tikka was a riot of taste. It stirred our taste buds, perfectly setting up the mood for a sumptuous dinner. It was also on the higher side of being spicy. Overall, the experience was noteworthy. No compromise on quality or quantity. Mezban is ideal for an impulse Mughlai-hogging experience. Long live Biriyani! Amen.

The Mezban Special Mutton Biryani .. 

Writing about a Biryani is personal for any food lover from Kolkata . Biryani is so much loved here in this city that each and every Biryani outlet has their own versions of one . And having this dish from various outlets is like getting to know a person every time . Each of them has a different story to say with their own versions of flavors and ingredients .

Mezban's Biryani is also loved and celebrated and today i had the pleasure of knowing the Biryani ( the person ) myself . The old and famous joint is located at Ripon street. If you are coming from park street then take the left turn from Mirza Ghalib Street and after walking a few steps you will reach the Ripon Street lane ( one that houses Arsalan and Koshe Kosha ) . Take that street and walk till the end for your destination .

Pros : The biryani is lightly spiced . It has all the features of the customary " Dharmatala " Biryani inspite of not being in Dharmatala . The potato will be properly cooked and super tender . But the biggest selling point of Mezban is their incredible mutton . The Mutton pieces in the Special Mutton Biryani were huge , tender and rightly flavored . Preparation wise it was the kind of mutton that was destined to be inside a Biryani . 
It is moderately priced at 270 rupees .

Cons :- The special mutton Biryani comes with a humongous amount of rice and no egg . Being lightly spiced , sometimes it can be a tedious task to complete the dish . One solution can be to use a rezala as a side dish or just take the normal Mutton Biryani. I used a thumbs up as an accompaniment.

It was really good knowing the Mezban Biryani and i believe it has potential to be in the list of decent ones in the city .

Near about one and half year earlier i had mutton biryani from mezbaan and yes it was very good. The quality of rice and mutton both were excellent. Yesterday i went to mezbaan again with great hopes. Again I ordered mutton biriyani as usual. This time all my expectations went in vain. Rice quality was much inferior, it was all broken and over cooked. The taste was pathetic. Mutton piece was really very hard. Overall I m never going visit mezbaan.

I went there to have biryani and I'm not going there again. I've had biryani in almost 2 dozen places in Kolkata, and this place comes in the bottom 5.
The chicken was dirty and the rice really freaking oily. It's a little cheaper than other places. I also had mutton chaap, which was decent. The 1.5 rating is for the chaap. The biryani gets a 0.

Mezban is a well known name in Wellesley area for Mughlai Food.It is located near 'Gol Talab'.Have tried their different dishes different times.Chicken Tangdi Biriyani is one of my favourite,highly recommended of them.Chicken tandoori goes well in starter.Chicken rezala is one of their key item,one can try it with the naan.I love their shredded Chicken Bharta too.The place is tiny but pleasant,ranges are fair enough.Ordered many times their Chicken Tikka Biriyani,it's terrific,give it a try.

Love this place have eaten everything from here from the biryanis to firni have ordered in numerous times and eaten there as well. Love the food and the service is great. Though I have heard people complain about the service before. Rated them 4 only because when I order in they sometimes forget to pack something. And it's happened more than twice on previous occasions. Also their decor is unsatisfactory but that is expected.

Nice restaurant , not at all difficult to locate ; tried them after years.
Once upon a time they used to make awesome biriyani but then their quality deteriorated.Had keema naan and murgh musallam , murgh musallam was pre-cooked (not at all expected) and the price was abnormally low at Rs 300 and also the chicken was exceptionally small.
Keema naan was not too well filled , and at Rs 50 each they were definitely half the size of what other restaurants offer.
Nice place for pocket friendly meal plans , but they definitely need to upgrade their quality of food .

Thanks to her for her suggestion. Indeed it was worth it. An old eat out in Kolkata. If you judge about the ambience I don't think they can be getting good review, but for food it's a big 👍 The Haleem cost is very reasonable compared to other places. The dal seemed very smooth and with the hot tandoori rotis it just slipped

And after calling , they didn't even bothered to say why they have cancel it and behave like nothing happened. Even zomato didn't bothered to solve my issue.

R u a biriyani lover?? Then, u ll fall in love with Mezban too!!
This place is a hidden gem. They serve one of the tastiest biriyanis in Kolkata. The side dishes r tasty too. The best thing about the biriyani is, it z less oily, the aloo is well cooked, tastes heavenly, n the size of the meat in biriyani will please u. The only drawback of this place is, the decor. It z not a good place to dine in. Rather, order n take away ll be a better option.
Recently, I ordered for mutton haleem n firni. The haleem was average.. But I loved the firni...

If you like light biryani then this place is right for you. The less spicy, non oily biryani that they make can easily find it's way to the diet of the health freaks.

I ordered a packet of Chicken Biryani. The restaurant is giving some "Chicken Biryani @ Rs.99" Ramzaan special offer. Although the total amount including tax, packing and delivery was Rs.133.

The quantity is good with one medium sized potato. The chicken piece could have been better though.

The order was placed through Zomato and the online order service was pathetic. Twice I was informed that the order has been cancelled but at the same time I was getting calls from the delivery boy for location direction.

Apart from this, the overall dining experience was good!

The Mutton Biryani with a fleshy, succulent piece of mutton and an extremely soft potato.

A hidden gem situated in the Wellesley area, Mezban is the most popular restaurant known for its delicious food.
Do not have a high expectation on decor but the service is quick and the food is just impeccable!
The chicken biriyani had the perfect blend of spices, the potato was soft and the chicken was cooked just perfect.
We also ordered chicken butter masala, which was tasty too.

But the best part? It's highly affordable price. 2 chicken biriyani, 1 chicken butter masala, and 2 soft drinks costs 490 only with no extra tax.
Also, the taste just keeps lingering for a long time.. Probably one of the best biriyani I've ever had, so I'll keep coming to this place :D

Located off Wellesley, Mezban is one of the most popular Restaurants in the area for Indian Cuisine and Kebabs.

Do not fancy the decor or anything and you'll have a pleasant time for yourself.

The must try over here is the Mutton/Chicken Chaanp, Chicken Malai Kebab and the Mezban Spl. Cheese Kebab. The Biryani is standard.

You'll receive a decent hospitality unless you ever dare to order a Vegetarian Biryani! :P

Worst restaurant ever... I ordered for a keema kulcha but could not find any keema in the delivered item,rather there were some cashew nuts which tasted awful. If any item is not available they should mention so or they should cancel the order for that item,why should they provide other substandard item?? Further they are charging for keema kulcha but not providing the same. I also ordered for Egg tarka but there was not even a trace of egg in the delivered item. Again the same thing they are doing,if egg tark is not available why not inform so or cancel the order?Further they are charging for egg tarka nd delivering plain tarka..also the food quality nd quantity is extremely poor. Chicken malai one plate had only one piece and a bowl full of gravy. Chicken lollipop had only flour nd hardly any chicken..
This restaurant is a thief... I would suggest pls never ever order from this restaurant. U are going to regret if u do.. rather action should be taken by zomato against these thieves...

On my first visit I was a bit disturbed by the children working there. . I usually avoid restaurants employing child labour. But on a recent visit there were boys working although older than the ones I saw on my first visit. Coming to food. Good stuff.  The biryani comes in a big portion. I liked the chicken malahi.  Roll was also good and. 
I would request zomato to mark restaurants which employ children so that people can boycott them.

Mezbaan is one of such eateries which had ups and downs, ultimately adapting to the needs of the time. It never was meant to be an restaurant but rather focused on home delivery and take away. However, it does have a seating area.

It is located just off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Street, very heart to Ripon Street and Royd Street. It has a rather clean and bright area where you can see them preparing stuffs.

I have been recently treated by a friend of mine by gifting me stuffs from Mezbaan - Mutton Chaap, Chicken Rezala, Laccha Paratha and Rumali Roti. It was a take away order from his side and I wasted no time in grabbing it hot.

The Mutton Chaap was exceptional and so was the Paratha. Even the Roti gave an excusite taste. However, the Chicken Rezala did not seem to impress me much.

Since, I didn't visit the outlet, it is unfair on my part to comment more. The entire rating above is based on the food and food only.

A visit is recommended.

In the lights of Arsalan, Zeeshan and Haji Saheb, people go unaware of places those remain in the shadows yet are effectively craving to be on the list. Mezban being amongst them. The taste buds get equally satisfied with the local mughlai touch in terms of kebabs and biriyani at a cheaper rate as to other famous ones. There is always an option for take away. Ambience is not lavishly entertained yet it has the subtelty for decency. An overall value for money with an equal value for graded mughlai food.

Today I ordered from Mezuban. Although the delivery was a bit late but the food was worth the wait. I ordered Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Chaap. The Mutton Biriyani had the perfect taste of Kolkata biriyani being mild on spices and really delicious. It came along with a large piece of potato and a pretty large piece of mutton as well. The mutton was juicy and tender and accompanied the mutton like a perfect couple. The mutton chaap was much better than i expected. The mutton was chopped into small pieces and it had a noticibly large quantity. The gravy that came along the chaap was very very spicy just as my liking. I literally felt full after eating the meal.
P.S. Dont forget to drink a bottle of coke or thumbs up after you had the meal as it will surely help with the digestion.

This place has the best Biryani by far.. Better than Arsalans oily Biryani.. The mutton in the Biryani is soft and juicy,  a nice big aloo and just the best flavors of long gained rice. We order from here almost once a week. You can't really sit there and eat but they do home delivery do no problem. I discovered a new dish the other day. Chicken Tandoori butter masala. Two awesome dishes in one..

The service was good as the order arrived soon. The quantity of Biryani was awesome and taste too. Chicken was well cooked and reflected perfect blend of Indian spices.

Mezban has been catering to the city of joy since the last 2 decades. They were the first ones to introduce the spicy biryani which was loved by the masses.
Recently had ordered some food via the swiggy app. 
Ordered chicken reshmi kebab biryani, mutton tikia roll and fish fry. The biryani was just off the hook. The tikia roll was also good. I was expecting a boneless fillet of fish but got it with bones. The fish tasted decent. Overall a lovely mughlai restaurant . Keep it up team Mezban.👌👍

One of my favourite Biryani joints in Kolkata. Their Biryani is just good and is better than some of the popular Biryani joints of Kolkata. Tried the Mutton Pasinda and Lachha Paratha as well. Both were simply amazing. The quantity of the Biryani was so much, that we were completely full. So we decided to parcel the Murg Musallam back home. The Murg Musallam was tasty, but I wasn't happy with it. We had all these, and the bill came to Rs 1025. Such amazing food and that too in such an amount definitely makes this place recommendable. The only disadvantage with this place is that it is a small restaurant and one might not be happy with the service. So takeaway is recommended for this place!

It Was Stunning The Layer Outside Was Crispy And The Chicken Pieces Inside The Roll Was Juicy. A Must Visit Place For Everyone. It's Open From 10:00am - 1:00am Midnight. Is It That Amazing. And I"m The 101st Reviewer For This Place Mezban. Located Near Tram Line Crossing 6, Ripon Street, Wellesley. Near Dustarkhwan, Wellesley. Thank you Mezban For Making My Day Very Special And Cool.😄😄

Mezban is a new entrant (as compared to others) in the Kolkata Biryani scenario and has already curved a name for itself in the market. Its a small shop tucked in Rippon street (the formal address is 6, Beside Dustarkhwan, Ripon Street, Wellesley, Kolkata ). 

Some people, unlike me, prefer the strong aroma of mitha attar and keora water in the biryani. Mezban is for them. They beautifully balance the strong aroma from getting overboard. Rice is long grained and quantity is huge. May not be the best but worth a try.

It was a little spicy as compared to some other mughlai restaurants in the city. Quantity wise no complaint considering the price of the dish.

At one point of time this was one of the the best places for mughal style cuisine, especially biryani and chaap. But over passage of time, poor administration perhaps has led to poor performance. Now they have diversified into Chinese as well. And the result is that both cuisine is just about passable. Nothing to go ga-ga about.

Mezban is located in Wellesley just beside Triangular Park. I have been hearing rave reviews about this place, so I thought of giving it a try today. After doing a four hour class at T.I.M.E.,I went to Mezban at around 1.35 p.m. The interior is a bit shabby and if you are looking for a nice ambience, you will not get any. I ordered one chicken biryani and one chicken liver. The food came within five minutes with complimentary salad. The  salad consisted of onion, cucumber slices along with diced beet  and green chilli. The chicken biryani was delicious. The rice had a nice aroma and tasted really good. The chicken piece was tender and juicy. The chicken liver was the star of the show. This chicken liver had a different aroma than the one served at Saima. The liver pieces were tender and succulent. The staff is well behaved as well. In a nutshell, a good store and I will visit again.

This is again a vey underrated Mughlai restaurant. Located in Ripon Street, the ambience is not very good, but their food is worth eating. I've visited this place a couple of times and always tried their #MuttonBiriyani. It's tasty and the quantity is fine.

Yesterday I tried their #MuttonKassa. I took it as a takeaway. The food was amazing! Even the pieces of mutton were great. It can be eaten with any kind of breads.

A cloudy noon at kolkata. a walk through Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and finally Mezban. while writing my feature ''Kabuliwalahs in kolkata'' in Bartaman, I came to know about this food joint but never visited before. So,decision was made about lunch. The decor was avarage and laminated menu card soon arrived. money wasn't very sound in my pocket so decided to have Mutton Stew and Roomali Roti.  The Roti was warm and soft,though the stew was metamorphosed form of spicy rezala. Taste was lip smacking.  Finally a firni made the day meaningful.

Mezban biryani is famous and we usually have takeaways whenever we have a program at our church just across the road. Some time back though, we decided to have a sit down meal and we were not disappointed. They have a separate family section, air conditioned, which is a good thing, since it was at the height of summer. Excellent food - biryani, paratha and chaanp.... yummy!!

Had visited Mezban during  a food walk organised by PANCH PHORON on the holy moth of ramzan . At first Mezban is very popular among the locals of ripon street /wellesley area and serves very fine biryani and other mughlai cuisines. Mezban ambiance wise has no great feeling , its has a regular eating restaurant like look which makes it pretty average in attractiveness but the food does the talking here more than the normal decor inside. Over here the waiters are very fast with taking orders and getting your food on the table which is  a good thing that i came across service wise . As we divided certain places for certain foods so from here the Firni was tried and as soon as it came it looked very appealing and nice so after a quick photo session of the firni we got our hands on it and from the evry first spoon it was yum and sweet and chilled making it super. But i felt  a little more quantity should be added as it finished in a jiffy making me crave for more . Taste & quality was great surely ,however quantity can be improved and pricing is good so not a bad dessert to try after a wholesome meal from here . 
A GOOD PLACE IF INTERIOR,S DONT BOTHER YOU AND ONLY IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE IN A NORMAL TABLE LIKE SITTING BUT IN RETURN YOU ARE GETTING GREAT FOOD FOR SURE ,SO KEEP THIS PLACE IN YOU LIST .

Really good quantity. A big whole potato piece and a chunky piece of chicken. The biryani gives a faint rose water smell but the taste is bang on. It is not at all oily.
I shared it with my sister.

Located near park Street, if you ignore the modest ambience here I bet you won't find any other complaints. The biryani and tandoori are top notch. You can also have a simple diet like plain rice with dal and mutton keema. The service is prompt (and if you're a regular there you'll get meat pieces of your choice 😋). Very pocket friendly. They also serve haleem, firni, paya soup etc on festive occasions. I almost visit this place 1-2 times each week without fail.

Intro : This is a mughal joint on Wellesley ,just opposite the small triangular park . 
We took take away , however we were waiting in the dining hall for the food - the interior s are decent , Good AC. 

Food : We took -
Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Rezalla , Mutton Chap, Tandoori Roti,Phirni

Mutton Biriyani - Decent, mutton piece was good, Biriyani was a tad spicy for our taste buds , Rice was of good quality 3.5/5

Mutton Chap - Really good stuff, Mutton soft , tender , juicy, overall great 4/5

Chicken Rezala - Again very good, tasty, Chicken soft juicy 4/5

Tandoori Roti - Very good soft and tender , and found "gota kalo jeera" , this gave it a different taste 4/5

Phirni - didn't like it 2.5/5

Overall - Good stuff , especially the chap and rezalla 3.5/5

I love mezban..the chaanp and biriyani is our staple order, the kebabs are great, we get quick service, absolutely consistently tasty food.Every time! highly recommended as one of the finer Biriyani joints in kolkata. the location is not so great, but thank god for home delivery :) We always get it delivered. They serve till pretty late.
 Full marks to their Chaanp and Mutton Biriyani.

This place provide good mughlai food at very reasonable cost. I've tried tikka & resmhi biryani, both of them are nice. They put 2 pieces of kebab in the biryani. And their firni is also nice to have. So if anyone want mughlai food at a reasonable price, surely go for this place.

My friends recommended me to get a home delivery done from this place as its a little shady for women. So ordered a chicken chaap and paratha and trust me it was literally out of the world. Chaap is pretty different than the other mughlai joints. Had biryani also it was good.

Mezban has compromised with its quality over the years and that is disappointing coming from someone who had always been a fan of its Mughlai dishes. The Tikia Roll continues to hold its place when it comes to taste and consistency, however, the rest have failed to live up to its once acclaimed fame in taste and splendor. The Chicken Tikka Kebab and consequently the Chicken Tikka Masala have lost the taste, become replaced with a lucratively oily version and the naans have gone down the non-buttery but burnt-greasy road. For a restaurant that asks for a considerable sum for its delicacies, the Biryani is just about eatable.

I am a vegetarian- however I had have good lot of "Khuska" from Mezban. 

"Khuska" is nothing but the Biriyani Rice & Aloo (saffron coloured boiled half portion Potato) - which I make sure of ordering as "Khuska with Double Aloo" whenever I order.

Ambience is not so upmarket when you would compare the price point, though.

However, taste wise this is one of the best "Khuska" I got to taste in Kolkata.

Mezban is one of those places I have been visiting since my childhood, this place makes some excellent keema matar, dal gosht,  chicken champ and also people who do not know they serve dal, chawal and muttom bhuna in the afternoon, barring these domestic menu they serve delicious yummy biriyani which has an very uncommon taste and is a real delight and if you happen to drop in during month of Ramadan dont forget to try out special mutton halim from here...
All together Mezban is delight for tasty mughlai food and if you are visiting with family please drop in at Dastarkhan their family restaurant.....

Had lunch here yesterday afternoon with a couple of office friends. Lachha Paratha, Tandoori Roti, Mutton Biryani, Mutton Pasinda, Mutton Rezaala, Chicken Chaap, Salad and Phirni. All items except the chaap were very good. The chaap did not taste good at all.Its not a place for Ambience seekers. Service is OK types. But the food and the price will make you happy. Our bill for all the above dishes came to ₹795 only including taxes.

This little gem is located by one of the not-so-impressive lanes at RAK road.
From outside the place may not be very appealing,but one should go inside to explore its potential!
Food: as there is not much to comment on ambience and others, so let's talk food;) The biriyani is just awesome, long grained moist rice, a healthy fat potato and succulent pieces of meat. Chicken tandoori is good. I like their chicken reshmi kebab too. 
Price: very reasonable, considering the portion and taste they serve. Just one shouldnt expect much of ambience (in that case one can definitely opt for take-away)
No doubt Mezban serves one of the best biriyanis in the city!

Looks can be deceiving. This restaurant with a quiet little front shop serves up food on par with the best in town. The Mughlai section is very good but the Chinese section really takes the cake. Portions are large and price appropriate.  Seating is less hence long queues are norm. A highly recommended restaurant.

Most of the reputed Biriyani joint in Kolkata has lost it's old charm (taste), not this one ! Neither the author, who can boast himself as a Biriyani buff with a 30 yrs + expertise, widely travelled, criss crossing the length & breadth of the country, with an eye and lip for this exotic dish . Mezban remained inside the dingy Wellesley, churning out the best biriyani of kolkata,day in day out , with same impeccable quality. I have thrashed Rehmania . Shiraz in Zomato , more from the pain of a "loss" ! But not Mezbaan ! I sincerely hope it remain like this through out !

Located on Rippon street , this restaurant has been on my radar for many weeks for their sasta me accha mughlai food. So me and my friends paid a visit here recently to break the monotony of eating biryani from Arsalan or Siraj.  The place was pretty crowded and the waiter was a bit slow.   We ordered CHICKEN TANDOORI , CHICKEN BIRIYANI and MUTTON KASSA . The chicken pieces were a bit small . The biryani was served with a huge potato and a lean piece of chicken , all of which were perfectly cooked. Finally we tried the PHIRNI and it was definitely distinct from other typical mughlai restaurants. Per head it costed us around Rs . 250.

I've heard a lot about Mezban’s biryani, so when my colleagues planned for ordering a lunch from this restaurant, I was delighted. I never expected them to deliver the food on time but they surprised us by carrying lunch for around 18 people bang on time from Wellesley to Elgin Road.

Our orders were simple; Mutton biryanis, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and salads. The food was hot, smelled nice and appetizing but I was doubtful, very doubtful about the quality! Later we unanimously agreed that we should order from this place again. The rice was soft and well cooked. Meat was juicy, tender and melting in our mouths. Perfect balance of aroma and spices. Potatoes were well cooked and juicy. And the quantity of each plate was more than enough for an adult (found it difficult to finish even after starving for 1 hour).

Next comes Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. This dish requires well marinated chicken and a proper blend of spices and flavours. Mezban passed with flying colours yet again. This restaurant is an underdog among biryani lovers; but I’d recommend this place to connoisseurs of biryani. The prices are reasonable (cheaper than many other biryani legends of the city).

We all liked the Biriyani, the quantity was enough for a person. Biriyani was not much oily yet so tasty, the kebab pieces were really good. The price of the Biriyani was also cheap, only 90 bucks!

Though it is quiet known among the Mughlai restro specailly near  the Park Street area, it is really disappointing to find an average quality food, & even worse ambience along with Service. The Utensils used for serving and keeping foods are real annoying due to hygienic issues. The place, having a few sitting arrangements, & the stuff busy walking around is really a vile place to dine. Coming to the food, well the Chicken kabas or the chicken malai worth mentioning, But the biryani is just no-better than any road side joints, oily, with smelly meat chunks.  The mutton items like Chap or the Kasa are pathetically unplatable. But surprisingly their counter at City Centre was quite an mouth-watering experience. This counter of Ripon St. really needs a proper supervisor.

Though it is quiet known among the Mughlai restro specailly near  the Park Street area, it is really disappointing to find an average quality food, & even worse ambience along with Service. The Utensils used for serving and keeping foods are real annoying due to hygienic issues. The place, having a few sitting arrangements, & the stuff busy walking around is really a vile place to dine. Coming to the food, well the Chicken kabas or the chicken malai worth mentioning, But the biryani is just no-better than any road side joints, oily, with smelly meat chunks.  The mutton items like Chap or the Kasa are pathetically unplatable. But surprisingly their counter at City Centre was quite an mouth-watering experience. This counter of Ripon St. really needs a proper supervisor.

Went to Mezban outlet today after a long gap, I used to be regular in this outlet in 2008 – 2009. We ordered ‘Mezban Special Mutton Biryani’ & ‘Chicken Chap’. Hugely disappointed with the taste and quality. The mutton pieces were all with too much bone and little meat. Though the Biryani was average but it lacked the quintessential taste which compliments a Mutton Biryani. It was a mere heartbreak, though they had coloured the rice full yellow but it was no saviour either. The Chicken Chap was too over powering with so much salt and oily taste.  I’m completely disappointed with Mezban, especially after going there with huge expectations.

2nd Visit (13/07/2015) (Rating Modified 2.5 to 3.5)

Our next stop was Mezban, Ripon Street, just beside Dustarkhwan, there we tried out Special Mutton Haleem, Special Firni and Tandoori roti. In this place haleem needs to be shared (or not, if you're a big eater). Mutton haleem was full flavoured, well-spiced and tender meat. If you're sharing, go ahead and order some mutton briyani and cold drinks too. The mutton haleem here was smoother than what we're used to, but it adds that rustic feel and mind-blowing. Both haleem and firni were toothsome.

One day I was just casually going through the reviews in Zomato( which happens to be one of my favourite passtimes now thays ;)  )I came across Mezban.The reviews were quite good so decided to visit.The location can be tricky .We took a cab straight to ripon street.Its  just on the crossing of two streets(Ripon street and Rafi Ahmed Kidwa) just besideDasturkhwan restaurant.

Nothing to talk about ambience.Its a very old place crowded by local people.Take away is a good option.
The best thing about them is the kebabs.Simly mouthwatering.Best kebab i had till date in town and in the given price.
We tried biryani also but its nothing special.Its like how biryani is supposed to be.
Service very prompt and food is served hot.

P.S:Place is not Air Conditioned so can be inconvinient in summer.

Went to this restro on Saturday after reading the reviews and seeing the rating. We ordered for Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Kabab and Chicken Butter Masala. The service was prompt and the food was hot :-) We loved the food very much. Now comes the justification why I am giving still 3.0. We were half way in finishing our food when the fan was switched off. The reason was that they were dusting the place. I didn't get the logic why dusting is so important while customers are eating. This service made me give only 3 out of 5 inspite of the good food

We hit the Mezban stall at City Center I Biryani Kabab festival twice in two days, and for the same bunch of stuff. I packed a Chicken Biryani, a chicken chaap, and split a chicken malai kabab on the spot with my friend. The Chicken Malai Kabab was a skewer of soft cooked meat with a coating of cream - paired with some mint chutney and onion-cucumber slices, and a wedge of lime. We loved dipping into it, and my friend P loved it so much that she packed a second plate for her mother. 

I got back home, heated the biryani and chaap up. The biryani was moist, but not oily, with a tender piece of potato and chicken breast and long grains of rice. My sister was gushing over the softness of the meat, and the potato. The chaap was light, and once we drained off the excess oil on top, perfect with a rumali roti that we had picked up from another counter.

And I got the malai kabab again today, because it was amazing. of course, with a bunch of other stuff from other stalls.

If you are a Kolkata Biryani lover, then you have not had it all until you have eaten at Mezban. This is one of the places to check out when eating Biryani around Kolkata, and while you are at it, try their chicken chaap. My regular order here is a Mutton Biryani and a Chicken Chaap, and if I can fit it in, the special tangri kabab. The other thing you should try here is the Mutton pasinda, which goes excellently with the Tandoori rotis. For those of you who wants to dine-in, people, this place does not have an AC so eat at your own risk. However, this place is, and will be, one of my must-eat joints for good biryani around Park st, so do try it out.

What can i say, this is the place where i learnt to love biryani and mughlai food. 

It is a small joint which is ideally made for a quick take away or a late night meal when you are hungry. Though the hygiene may not be really great but the wholesome food will surely give you nothing to complain about. The biryani is not too oily as is the case with a lot of places and they will also give you your choice of the piece of meat ........if you ask nicely of course .... This is a definite go to place if you love kolkata cuisine !!....

What can I say about  mezban.  I absolutely love the place.  Their Buryan is outstanding. It lacks the  greasiness of a typical biryani. However it is in no formal dry.  It's full of flavour and the chicken pieces are moist and juicy. 

The chicken chap and the  mutton tikia are both flavoursome but on the oily side.  But  it is supposed to be that way isn't  it?? 

Their malaise kofta is average but  the gravy is exceptional.  

Too bad their rumbling roti isn't that good. On the other hand their kulcha is one of the better ones in the city at the same  price. 

I order from here almost every week,  and will continue to do so as the food doesn't disappoint.

I have had food from Mezban practically every week of my life, since its just round the corner of my house... and whenever we want to eat mughlai food, we get it from here.
The biryani..lives upto the expectations. All the curries are fantastic too...my favourite being the rezala.
The kebabs are the best.. from tengri kebab to hariyali to reshmi to the awesomeee cheese chicken kebab... all of them are heavenly!
Dont miss their halim during the month of ramzan.. not the best out their but good never the less.
And ofcourse their brilliant mutton paya..which i eagerly look forward to during the winter.
The North-Indian food is quite good too... I love their palak paneer, paneer butter masala and dal tarka.
Their is ac seating accomodation just next to it.. the restaurant named Dustarkhwan.. the food though is the same that you get at mezban.
The only minus point would be the hygiene i guess.

But otherwise..its absolutely brilliant. So do visit this place!

As some of my foodie friend mentioned mezban means rich mughlai food. To correct him, it means the hospitality between the guest and the steward. It somewhat means like "Aiye mezban". Mezban is located in 6, wellesley Ripon street area. I had made a visit out here on 25th december 2013. As it was too much crowded, i had done a pack of chicken biriyani out from here. 

Coming to the biriyani, what i noticed was that the flavour and the essence of biriyani was lacking due to additional packet flavours added (thats what i noticed from the taste and the smell of the rice) . This was a very big turnoff because i like to taste authentic mughlai biriyani. The Aloo served inside is was not as tender as should be and it was hard to cut. The chicken was not tender at all which we always expect it to be. However, one thing which i would like to add was that the oil content was not very high. 

There was no such problem with respect to prompt service and the hospitality of the staffs. It was outstanding. :)

Overall, a satisfactory experience. I have had much better biriyani at Aliah, Arsalan, Zeeshan, Sabir and Aminia.



----- 19 Jul, 2013 -----

Location: Mezban is located in Ripon Street beside dastarkhwan which is a new place launched to dine in. I had visited there like a year ago. They are famous for their mughlai dishes and they also do offer some of the vegetarian dishes. The speciality of Mezban is the biriyani. Their chicken biriyani is sizzling and even their chicken chaap. The kebabs out here are served hot without any compromise. They didnot have the A.c. restaurant and for this reason, a part called the dastarkhwan was opened to fulfill this issue. It is basically, few minutes away from park street. 

Coming to the pros and cons of this place:- 
Pros
1) Food served here is sizzling hot. No compromise in the quality. 
2) Place is not cramped and decent seating area. 
3) Staffs are polite
4) Place is cleaned properly. No hygiene issue regarding to it. 
5) Kebabs are cooked in front of you and they come out sizzling from the tandoor causing no delay. 
6) Most of the time this place is crowded due to its speciality. 
7) Serves vegetarian dishes too. 
8) Quick service 

Cons
1) Food is a bit oily. 
2) The washroom is not maintained properly. 

Rest, all is well. :)

I stumbled across this place while shopping for paints and hardware in Wellesley. Its been almost two and a half years and it still continues to delight me. Their mutton chap will take you to the golden old days of Mughlai Cuisine in the City of Joy. When I took my dad their, he said he was its almost like Royal (in Chitpur) in the mid 80s. Although i must say their biriyani has lost some of its flavour from the early days that i used to go their. The downside I guess is their food is quite on the rich and heavy side. But thats kinna go with good mughlai food, its bound to leave some oil in your plates. Its indeed a hidden gem in wellesley. Biriyani is always recomemded with their mutton chap and finish off with a awesome frini.

When you discover places like this,you realise the real fun of Zomato!! I tried this place a few days back when after a largely frustrating day I felt like I just had to have some Mutton BIryani!! Reading good reviews about this place I decided to try it out and I was certainly satisfied.

This place is located at the crossing between Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Ripon street.Since I was not very hungry I ordered only a Mutton Biryani.It was really good.I felt it could easily compare with the more established places for biryani.The quality of the rice was nice and the piece of mutton was also soft and well cooked.The quantity was also decent.It was slightly oily but I honestly dont mind my Mughlai cuisine to be slightly oily as long as it pleases my tastebuds!!

The prices are quite reasonable although there has been a recent hike.The prices are about 10 to 20 Rs higher than what the menu here says.The service was swift.The waiters may not be the most well trained but they were very helpful and they will treat you very well.This I found very appreciable.

There is nothing much to write regarding ambience.It is not even air conditioned.The seating arrangement is decent.The hygiene and cleanliness is not the best as one would expect in a place like this.But the good thing is,to address these issues they have opened a new air conditioned restaurant just adjacent to this named Dustarkhwan.

Overall if you like your Mughlai cuisine this place is definitely worth a visit.I will surely be back to try some of the other items.

It HAPPENS TO be the centre point of wellesley , Wellesley hotel is in shambles and the street is lined with hundreds of Amby cabs , the wellesley street is very very dirty ,tram lines , traffic, dog shit ( take a morning walk you will know about the mess) . Skipped a vegetarian Marriage ceremony in Stadel to taste some authentic muglai stuff but left with mixed feelings. Cant say because of the weather , the food , suffocation inside Stadel or the Non VEGETARIAN Tandoori chiken served inside Mezban but had a terrible uninterrupted bout of Hiccups that refused to stop but suddenly vanished once I reached Dum Dum Airport premises the next day. Back to the food as a tourist in Kolkatta it is conveniently located as I was really very very hungry ordered Tandoori chicken with Tandoori rotis, the chicken felt nice properly cooked and the rotis were nice and soft, as I was eating the third piece of Roti suddenly it turned out to be cold and rubbery I questioned the manager he said ask the cook? I asked the cook he didnt bother to answer the question . ..... I stopped eating the rotis ordered for the bill  and then the terrible hiccups started .....
Anyways food was average the tandoori chicken was properly cooked location is good the AC was working fine but the management keeps on opening the door and AC has to work overtime. Rates are affordable , may be I might try  my luck some other time.

I would like to thank zomato for making citizens rediscover Calcutta's culinary heritage. I would have never visited this place if it was not reviewed by members of Zomato. Here I must thank Ruksana for mentioning a few dishes. It is always helpful to know about recommended dishes. Having the good luck of staying within 1.5 km of this place I went for a long walk to prepare my waist line for some rich Muglai food. 

As mentioned by some of my fellow reviewers this place is not an ideal sit and dine restaurant. It has some seating arrangement but was mostly occupied by what seemed like locals of the place most of whom lazily chatted away while sipping on tea. It is one of Ripon street's cafes if you will. 
Locating the place is easy enough. It is located where Ripon street meets Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road and if you are traveling from Ajc Bose road it will fall on your left.

I had previously planned my order and straightaway ordered a family sized mutton biriyani, chicken chap, mutton pasinda and tandoori roti. What struck me was the politeness with which the host greeted me and the polite manners of the servers. 

My bill was a mere Rs412 which was perfect for 3 diners. 

Now when eating Mughlai food one must keep in mind that it is a rich cuisine full of robust taste and well full of oil so if you like things light and subtle you should skip this place. It is also unrealistic to expect the food to be prepared with clarified butter at the prices at which the food is offered.

Now I would suggest eating it hot without reheating the food. I also made the mistake of ordering tandoori roti which by character becomes hard if not consumed immediately but the soft homemade chapatis go wonderfully well with the mutton pasinda. With mutton which is of a melt in the mouth consistency and the perfect amount of spices it was lovely but for the amount of salt, though I must mention that I take less than half the amount of salt that most people prefer. The chicken chap was done as one would expect from a Mughlai establishments. The Biriyani is quite good but a little oily compared to other Muslim establishments, but the two chunks of mutton were huge and that along with an egg makes it value for money.

Out of the Mughlai establishments of the City of Joy this one can keep its head high because nowhere else other than these Mughlai establishments of Central Kolkata would you get the taste of Calcutta's own heritage cuisine formed when a certain Nawab built one of his establishments in this very city.

Excellent food. Especially the biryani; It was really good. Quantity is very sufficient; better than its competitors in this sense. The mutton chaap was outstanding, it beats Rahmania & Shiraz both. The best part is, its very economical. Ideal for bulk orders. I again look forward to order their food. 

The above rating is solely based on food. I have not been to this place so commenting on its ambience & service would be unfair. However I hope to go there once, they have come up with their new renovated restaurant!     Food- a total Yes!

Mezban has been one of my all time favourite biryani joints in kolkata. I still rate Mezban Biryani better than Shiraz and Rahmania. I must have eaten nearly 25 to 30 times Biryani from Mezban since its so convenient from my place. The concept of including egg in special Biryani was pioneered by Mezban. Therefore for only Biryani my top 10 would be
Arsalan 1st, 
Mezban 2nd , 
Shiraz 3rd, 
Rahmania 4th, 
Golden Spoon 5th 
Ali Baba 6th
Zam Zam 7th 
Zeeshan 8th  
Aminia 9th
Briyani House 10th  
 
my analysis is purely based on quality of the food, the quality, the health and hygiene factor, service at the restaurant and wait time period. I hope other foodies also find this restuarants useful.

Mezban has been around for a long time and any biryani lover would rate the biryani quite  highly. Though I have never eaten in the restaurant I have indulged myself with takeaways for years. The special mutton / chicken biryani is excellent , chicken chaap , mutton rezala , and the mutton pasinda kebab paired with the tandoori or roomali roti is yummy. And if your in a sinful mood try the mutton mughlai keema or the mutton stew for breakfast in the winters.

thanks to fellow foodies for introducing us to this awesome place. they make one of the best low oil biriyanis in Kolkata. its not a family restaurant and there is no ambience, but if you want to enjoy biriyani sitting on your home sofa, dont even think of taking a parcel from any place else. While I was waiting for the delivery I even saw a waiter from the adjoining Dusturkhwan take a plate of biriyani for their guests. So this is also an option, sit down at Dusturkhwan and enjoy Mezban biriyani.

Have been a fan of Mezban Mutton biriyani for at least 10 years now !!! Does not hurt that i live quite close by and hence it is probably a fortnightly choice for me. We as a family have a habit of trying a lot of biriyani at a variety of places but the benchmark to which it is always compared is Mezban - Arsalan is a close 2nd but Mezban rules anyday.
