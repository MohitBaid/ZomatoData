Mumbaiya Ishtyle Chaats @ DesiKlub, Kolkata ☺

Whether we happen to be vegetarian or non vegetarian, once in a while most of us like to have a taste of tangy, spicy and tamarind chutney infused Indian appetizers called Chaat. 

DesiKlub, the recently opened quirky and relatively economical vegetarian eatery specializes in Mumbai style Chaat items, which are made of authentic, transported from Mumbai ingredients and are served with quirky fusions and/or presentations.

Like any other food item, different regions of India dish out their own unique brand of Chaats, which may be somewhat similar to those of other regions, or may be altogether different. Thus, a true foodie is always on the look out of local and authentic eateries that can satiate his/her urge of specialized food items of other regions.

No wonder, being the flag bearer of Mumbai street food, DesiKlub is the current go to place of most of the veg food enthusiasts.

Location: Upon entering the Magma House Complex, opposite the Post Office at Park Street, the first building that will fall on your left side, houses DesiKlub, the 56 seater restaurant on it's first floor.

It offers valet parking and constantly plays Bollywood music of the 90's, which drowns most of the diners into their own sweet wave of nostalgia. It also serves Jain food, as well as, alcohol.

Their menu comprises of the following food categories - Soups, Ghaas Phoos (Salad), Papad, Shuruat (Starters with 30 plus options), Pao-Shao, Rolls, Deshi Chinese, Tava Peejha (Pizza), Videshi (Italian & Msxican), Deshi, Garma Garam (Combo of two dishes), Kuch Meetha, Hot Drinks and Non Alcoholic Beverages (20 plus options).

In-house made accompaniments - Cabbage Onion Masala, Green Chutney and Mango Pickle are served with every order.

Approximately, a month back, they invited me for a food tasting & review session.The food items presented to me for tasting were - 

- Beverage -

- Peru & Kalingar (Rs.145 /-): It was a refreshing blood red colored guava based mocktail topped with enough crushed ice.

It was served in good quantity and tasted nice.

- Starters -

- Dahi Batata Puri (Rs. 175/-): 6 pieces of Dahi Puchkas were served, filled with a sprouts concoction and garnished with sev and seasonings.

These Puchkas were not the hand made ones that are sold on the streets. Instead, they were the machine made ones, that are available in disc shaped semi prepared form and are fried just before serving.

The bite sized appetizers were nice and ably set up the mood for the tasting session.

- Alu Tikki Chaat (Rs. 175/-): On a black circular metallic plate, 2 portions of crisp Aloo Tikkis were served, which were topped with chutneys, seasonings, a generous pour of curd and sev and garnished with chopped coriander leaves and fresh pomegranate seeds.

The Tikkis were well cooked and tasted good.

- Mini Idli Skewers (Rs. 125/-): 3 long toothpicks aka skewers came placed atop a big cup of Sambhar. Each skewer comprised of 4 Mini Idlis. The Sambhar cup was made of glass. A small steel bowl of Coconut Chutney was placed alongside.

It was a novel presentation of the humble South Indian Idli. It tasted nice.

- Paneer Roller Coaster (Rs. 225/-): 5 portions of fried Paneer aka Cottage Cheese Puffs were served on a mini roller coaster! The roller coaster had 5 bowl shaped seatings to accommodate the serving of one Puff in each bowl.

The cottage cheese filling was a heady mix of paneer, crunchy onions, green chillies and coriander leaves, which was wrapped in bread, deep fried and served.

It was a tasty appetizer with an amusing presentation.

- Utterly Butterly Baked Vada Pav (Rs. 120/-): A rectangular black tray came beautifully laden with 4 pieces of Vada Pav. Each Vada Pav was garnished with a solitary Chaunki Hui Hari Mirch and a handful of Potato Wafers were placed between every two Vada Pavs.

Usually, a Vada Pav is a Potato Vada served between two halved slices of a Pav. But herein, the Pavs were not halved and the potato concoction was filled inside the closed Pavs as a stuffing!

The Pavs were soft and fresh. The dish tasted good.

- Chitthi Aayi Hai (Rs. 240/-): Presented on an press iron shaped wooden dish, 5 portions of square shaped Roomali Roti Lifafas filled with spicy Paneer filling were served, topped with a scoop of Waldorf Salad and further garnished with coriander leaves. A small steel bowl of green chutney came placed alongside.

The Lifafas were soft and well cooked. The Salad had an excess of mayonnaise and not that many fruits, perhaps to pair better with the taste of the appetizer.

The dish tasted nice and filling.

- Chinese Bhel (Rs. 140/-): Placed on a mini wooden cart with four black wheels, a mound of spicy crispy noodles, infused with sauces and garnished with spring onions was served.

The dish tasted crispy, tangy and nice.

- Papad Bhel (Rs. 155/-): A long and slender paper cone filled with Kichiya Papad Bhel was served on a similar kind of mini cart as mentioned above. Three steel bowls containing Papad Chura (crushed Papad), Chilli Paste and Tamarind Chutney came placed alongside.

The idea was to pour the Bhel on your respective plate, add the desired proportion of the accompaniments of your choice, mix it all well and consume.

It was an intelligent take to save the Bhel from turning soggy before the actual consumption.

- Main Course -

- Maharashtra Chi Shaan (Rs. 186/-): It was a combo take on Misal Pao, the popular Maharashtrian dish, wherein a big boat shaped bowl filled with Misal curry came accompanied with two portions of Pav placed on it's one side and two portions of Mini Kulcha placed on it's other side. The Misal was garnished with enough Farsāṇ, finely chopped onions and a solitary slice of lime.

The Misal was spicy, the Breads were soft and fresh and the Farsāṇ had that unmistakable tangy-sweet taste that one gets in the Gujarat-Maharashtra belt.

The dish tasted good.

- Ghar Ki Baat (Rs. 245/-): Served on a mini charpoy or khatiya, it was a homesome and nostalgic meal comprising of two medium sized steel tiffin bowls of Dal Khichdi and Gujrati Kadhi, accompanied with small steel bowls of Papad Chura, Ghee and Pickle.

The dish was hot, flavorsome and tasted excellent.

- Do Dil Mil Rahe Hai (Rs. 305/-): An oval shaped sizzler plate came half laden with Tava Noodles and half laden with Bhaji. A cone shaped Papad filled with finely chopped onions was inserted amidst the Noodles and 3 Pav buns were placed upon the Bhaji, along with a lime roundel. 

Most of the kid party menus that I have come across have the mandatory inclusion of both the aforesaid dishes. So, I expect this dish to be a hit amongst the kid brigade.

The Noodles were slightly spicy and did not contain too much vegetables. The Breads were soft and fresh. The Bhaji was mashed enough to appear like a puree and was quite 'maska maar ke' i.e. laden with butter.

The dish tasted quite good and quantity present therein was more than enough for one person.

 You also get the option of additional cheese with this dish.

- Sizzling Chelo Kebab (Rs. 325/-): A similar sizzler plate as described above, came laden with Creamy Rice, topped with 4 portions of Paneer Tikkas with spicy marinations. One half of the plate was bordered with French Fries and the other half was bordered with finger sized and sautéed in butter carrots and french beans.

Rice mixed with cheese based sauce paired quite well with spicy Paneer Tikkas and Sautéed Veggies. French Fries were a nice and crunchy side dish to be nibbled in between.

It was an interesting combo. It tasted good.

The food items presented were a combination of Mumbai special Chaats and other dishes, as well as, popular dishes of other regions. But most of the dishes had quirky and interesting names. 

Since all of their spices are directly purchased from Mumbai, by default most of their dishes taste slightly spicy. However, if required, you can request them to tone down the spices and they will happily oblige. 

The staff is courteous and service is fast. 

Till you wait for your order to arrive, you can amuse yourself with their funny interior, that comprises of - a crockery rack made out of a scooter, the front of a truck embedded on a wall, a long list of rules, which amongst other guidelines, states 'No dumping girlfriend or boyfriend' etc.!

Overall, DesiKlub is a nice and comfy place with good spicy food and chilled out ambiance.

Food :3.5/5 
For starters, we called in for ‘Chithi ayi hai’ which was paneer stuffed in roomali rooti with mayo based dressing on top, it tasted good. 
For main-course, we ordered Pasta, Chole Bhature and ‘Do dil mil rahe hai’ which was a sizzler of Pav bhaji and noodles. Pasta was infused with dal makhani and it was on point, chole bhature was good too but the sizzler wasn’t good, the noodles were bland and pav was very hard to chew on. 
In drinks, we ordered for Jeera Masala and Paan, both were good. 
Ambiance: 4.5/5 
The decor is beautiful, the lighting and seating, the place keeps up with the name. 
Staff: 4.5/5 
They describe every dish before serving it and are very interactive.

Apart from the hookah everything was good. There was something wrong with the hookah we took. The smoke was not dense & the coal was going off quickly. However the panner tikka pizza was yumm. Kesar badam shake & choco sumthing was great. 

Service was good & staffs were too polite & prompt.

The quantity of each and every dish is really very less .... I'm really very disappointed with the quantity. The pasta was devoid of any kind of veggies and the expenses incurred on all these things is not worth at all .

Mumbai, the economic hub is a place much renowned for the history and the culture ride that it takes visitors who throng there every year. The city has amazing film industry, top notch restaurants, shopping markets and some amazing lip smacking street food to offer!. DesiKlub Kolkata has brought that street flavor with 90’s theme and music at the heart of city with some unique presentation!

Recently i was invited here by Parth to experience this place that screams desi street food with a twist of fusion . The initiative Desi Klub has taken to do something different and add a totally new flavour to the food scene in Kolkata all the way from Mumbai is worth mentioning. The fact is that, in the full of life zone of Park Street you come across all sorts of cuisines that has their own speciality, but what is food eaten if not done with a little fun and quirky presentation ? For that proper element of mixing fun and food ,you have to dine at Desi Klub. Over here you are absolutely going to love the new feel of a place,thanks to the impressive Bollywood inspired vibe and decor. Everything that you see here is ain't your regular sight in comparison to your visit to any other restaurant. The background music steals the mood and makes it addictive to be here with it's 90's Bollywood evergreen hit collection playing back to back . For a change than the regular Edm and heavy bass Hip Hop stuff that i usually prefer listening,i found the old Bollywood songs hit the right note for the day . 
The decor goes retro,trendy and cool at the same time.The seating capacity is very well divided quite spacious enough that makes it easy to pick your spot with your group . 
Coming to the part again of the food,drinks and presentation here,at first to say about the crockery and the creative part that they do is very attractive and makes one go click click click . The food that they offer here is all veg from appetizers to mains and all have their unique taste and identity as a dish. 
I have tried out couple of dishes and drinks from here starting from the appetizers there were MINI IDLI SKEWERS , BHAKARVADI CHAKLI CHAAT , CHITTI AYI HAI . All of these were simply wonderful however i was very fascinated with Chitti ayi hai which was a dish that had paneer wrapped in a portion of a roomali roti topped with salad,green apple & green chutney. 
Moving to the Mocktails i had PERU & KALINGER , PISTA KESARI BADAAM , RASBERRY ROSE,BUBBLEGUM MILKSHAKE and GINGER SPICE. Again to say the same here , the drinks were made very nice but the Peru and Kalinger drink could have been made better,however the best of them all turned out to be the Pista Kesari Badaam for me as it had milk with dry fruits and badaam in it making it a pure indulgence to stand apart from all . After these the Mains were tasted that started with SCHEZWAN CHEESE BALLS which was cheese balls tossed in schezwan gravy that went a little salty but spice flavour wise nice,then came the HAKKA NOODLES that was well made and nice on flavour balance, moving ahead the ARRABIATA PENNE PASTA arrived that was too spicy along with white sauce, probably it is supposed to be that way but lowering the spice or blending the spice seasoning could invite more people to have this dish but it did taste good i must say overall, next on was DELHI BELLY that was Tawa pulao with veg. patties & cheesa sauce in it which was pretty decent to say but well presented and had a good portion to feast. Last of the mains was the CHOLE TE BHATURE which was the center of attraction as a dish as it came on a mini rickshaw type of a food holding stand . It had 4 Bhaturas loaded on its seat and one glass filled with the chole curry .The Bhature was very good and soft and the Chole was well made but again an extra salt factor came in the picture , Balancing the food flavours and seasoning it perfectly is very important so that is my advice which should be taken care of and rest they are already making people happy with the extraordinary kind of spread . 

Before finishing my meal the last of the best eat from here has to be a dessert and they put forward the 5 ISHTAAR SIZZLING BROWNIE that had a Brownie with vanilla ice cream and 5 serving condiments along. I loved how the chocolate syrup and caramel syrup did the magic of making this dish next level. It is must recommended and two people can easily share this dessert. To end this review i must also give credits to the service and hospitality that they deliver which is very warm,helpful and appreciable indeed.

ALL THE BEST !

As one of the few vegetarian restaurants in the Park Street area which is a heaven for meat-lovers, DesiKlub is a favourite among those who don't want more than just tandoori paneer and cheese-stuffed mushrooms on their menu. 

I recently visited this place to attend an invitation by the management, and the first thing I noticed was its fun ambience. It has a 90's Bollywood theme, with the songs of that time, while the decor, with lighting and decor having many of the retro elements. 

I found the food presentation really unique and fun. They know how to create a visual effect with the food. My friends and I tasted quite a number of their items, including:

1. Mini Idli Skewers 

(Mini idlis with hot sambhar & coconut chutney)

2. Peru & Kalingar

(Watermelon syrup + Peru syrup, crushed ice & crushed Watermelon) 

3. Pista Kesari Badaam

(Milk with dry fruits, vanilla & kesar)

4. Bhakarvadi Chakli Chaat

(bhakarvadis in the form of a chaat)

5. Raspberry Rose

(Raspberry syrup, rose syrup, vanilla ice cream, milk)

6. Ginger Spice

(Mint leaves, lemon wedges, crushed ice) 

7. Chitthi Aayi Hain

(Minced paneer wrapped in roomali roti topped with Waldorf salad garnished with green apple & green chutney)

8. Szechuan Cheese Balls

(cheese balls tossed in szechuan gravy)

9. Hakka Noodles

(Hakka noodles)

10. White Sauce Pasta

(spicy White sauce penne pasta)

11. Delhi Belly

(Tawa pulao with veg. patties & cheese sauce )

12. Chole Te Bhature

(chole bhature)

13. Bubblegum milkshake

(Bubblegum topped on bubblegum milkshake)

14. 5 Ishtaar Sizzling brownie

(Brownies with vanilla ice cream, and 5 condiments)

I found their continental items better than the Indian and Chinese dishes. My favourites were the paneer envelopes, chakli chaat, hakka noodles, and idli skewers. I also loved the dessert. However, I also found most of the remaining dishes a little too much on the salty side. The bubblegum shake didn't for me either, though I loved most of the other drinks. 

All in all, I can say that it's a fun place to hand out with friends and family, in a filmy style. There are plenty of options to choose from. they are all really unique combinations and the effort in the kitchen is visible in each and every dish that reaches the table. Things will be just perfect if they pay a little more attention to the flavours and seasonings of the food. 

Thanks,

Situated just in between Hakuna Matata and Mamagoto. Well the location is enough to prove how much guts it needs for one to open a new restaurant in this spot. This place serves only veg, I mean pure veg dishes, Jain dishes also. Enough responsibilities for a restaurant that just opened 1month ago. I decided to visit and pen down a very detailed review because I have never been to a pure veg restaurant before and my expectations were very low. I had a conception that no veg item can be tasty. Man did they blow my mind away. I mean I was awestruck with what they served me.
A very well planned area with spacious seating arrangements and an ambience that perfectly signifies the street food culture. Colorful sofas and very interesting furniture selection. I just loved the interiors. The accompanying songs of 90's Bollywood create a strange nostalgic melancholy and sets up the mood. Very very very courteous staff and so nice people. They explained to us about every dish and took care of all our weird demands with a broad smile.
Cutting chai glasses as regular glasses and jam bottles as drinking water bottles. Man this place oozes a new vibe. A really really cool place.
Our menu comprised of
1. Mini Idli Skewers
(Mini idlis with hot sambhar & coconut chutney. Well the food description seems pretty dull but the presentation is just awesome. The mini idlis pierced in a long stick placed over the sambhar bowl along with a green coconut chutney.)
2. Peru & Kalingar
(Watermelon syrup + Peru syrup, crushed ice & crushed Watermelon. Guava syrup along with watermelon didn't go along well, but they did rectified it immediately.)
3. Pista Kesari Badaam
Milk with dry fruits, vanilla & kesar. A heavenly drink but a heavy one. Served in an earthen glass topped with thick whipped cream.
4. Bhakarvadi Chakli Chaat
Bhakarvadis in the form of a chaat. Served in a big glass cup that serves the purpose of a bowl topped with pomegranate seeds. A nice mix of flavours and textures.
5. Raspberry Rose
Raspberry syrup, rose syrup, vanilla ice cream, milk. From the top it's like a gradation of color red, from solid white color of vanilla it slowly turns pink and on the very bottom of the glass it's deep red. As beautiful as it looks, it tastes too.
6. Ginger Spice
Mint leaves, lemon wedges, crushed ice. A green coloured refreshing drink. Great taste.
7. Chitthi Aayi Hain
Minced paneer wrapped in roomali roti topped with Waldorf salad garnished with green apple & green chutney. It's all about the wonderful presentation. A small wooden boat decked with small romali roti envelopes along with chutney. It tastes awesome. Highly recommended.
8. Schezwan Cheese Balls
Cheese balls tossed in schezwan gravy. Great combinations. A Chinese twist to a North Indian dish.
9. Hakka Noodles
Hakka noodles tasted a bit flat but went well with the side dish as mentioned above.
10. Arrabiata Pasta
Spicy White sauce penne pasta. Am not a big pasta fan but I suggest everyone to try this dish. It's visually not much appealing but it doesn't taste great.
11. Delhi Belly
Tawa pulao with veg. patties & cheesa sauce.
12. Chole Te Bhature
It's just Chole bature as we have in Delhi or Bombay but served on a bicycle. The chole being served in a glass placed on the carrier of cycle.
13. Bubblegum milkshake
Bubblegum topped on bubblegum milkshake. It tastes like a Boomer milkshake. Nice
14. 5 ishtaar Sizzling brownie
Brownies with vanilla ice cream, and 5 condiments. The best dessert dish I have had in a really long time Both visually and as per taste this dish is some next level. A hot pan placed on a wooden block. On the hot pan placed carefully two brownie chunks above which are two scoops is vanilla and chocolate ice creams. The hot pan makes the brownies go hot and coincidentally melts the ice creams. It is further accompanied with chocolate and caramel syrup and garnished with choco chips and almond pieces.
I recommend every one in Kolkata to visit this wonderful place.

A good catch again on park Street. Street style decor and fusion Street food, that was enough to pull me in. The decor definitely needs a mention. They have wide menu with fusion of Indian and other cuisine. Tried their kadai pulav. Being from Mumbai, I have my bar set for this. It was good but a little bit dryish. Lacked the buttery punch. And they could have done away with the paneer. But they were kind enough to give me some melted butter. The staff was really polite and responsive.

TCF visited Desi Klub recently and here's the run down of how it went! 

Starting with the starters, there were:

Chitthi aayi hai - Which was basically some masalas packed in a pocket of roti and accompanies with a mayonnaise and green apple dip, together it just worked brilliantly, the masala was paired perfectly with the dip and helped give it balance.

Khichiya papad bhel - This was the classic bhel made in Desi Klub style, there was corn, beans, pomegranate, sev and the crispiness was brought by the Khichiya (A kind of papad) and was absolutely amazing! The khichiya remained crispy till the end and didn't become soggy at all!

We were served two drinks:

Pista Keshari badam - This drink was absolutely gorgeous and was topped with generous quantities of whipped cream! Usually I don't like badam based or Indian drinks for that matter but I'd have a million of these and not complain! Thick, smooth, creamy and filled with flavour. This is a surprise in its own right! You must try it!

Mango Duet - If you're a 90's kid, this drink will take you straight back to your childhood! It had a mango popsicle, some vanilla ice cream and even had a mango ice cream soda base! It was served in a beaker which seemed pretty cool to me!

The main course was really funky! We were served:

Do dill mill gaye hain - Which was a combination of noodles and paw bhaji, and I know that sounds bizzare! But trust me, it worked well together! It tasted superb!

Bombay style tawa pulao - This was the classic style bombay tawa pulao, vegetales, masala, cheese and served with some hung curd it made for the perfect main course item!

The desserts literally stole the show, we were served

Meethi yaadein : This dessert was beautiful both presentation wise as well as taste wise, a chocolate dipped waffle cone full of tutti fruity ice cream, airy chocolate mousse and 2 pieces of cadbury to remind you of your childhood.

The Chocolate Thaali - Now comes the BIG DADDY of all desserts ever, the chocolate thaali has 8, yes, 8 different chocolate elements to it. Chocolate swiss roll, chocolate truffle with dark chocolate dust, belgian dark chocolate soup, a blueberry and white chocolate candy, chocolate shrikhand, chocolate gulab jamun and chocolate ice cream accompanied with some chocolate khakhra. 

Above all, outstanding service, with amazing ambience and BEAUTIFUL selection of music just raise the taste of everything served at Desi Klub. Please visit this place ASAP.

After a lot of searching over Zomato, found this cute little place, recommended for vegetarians. We quickly zoomed in with friends, & we were there. DesiKlub vibe is so vibrant & positive, that you quickly get yourself comfortable to your preferred table (if available) & in no time you find yourself humming the same song being played in the restaurant. We wanted to try out some chaats so we ordered one Alu tikki Chaat, Dahi Batata Puri & Ginger Spice. The Alu tikki chaat was standard type, tasted good. Dahi batata Puri had very good flavor of batata Puri with chilled curd which reminds you of old school Raj Kachori, Tewari wala. Ginger spice was good too. In desserts we ordered, Hot Fudge Sundae which felt so good with strong flavours & butterscotch crumbs & pralines. This place, is highly recommended for vegetarians with good old 90s music.*

DesiKlub, a new pure vegetarian restaurant located in Park Street. Though being a non-vegetarian, i'm equally fond of veg. food. Took one of my friend to DesiKlub & we quickly placed our order with Mini Idli Skewers, Paan Pasand & Desi Burrito. However, Desi Burrito was the dish that blew my mind away! The rice in the burrito were full of spice (not chilli), mixed with paneer tikka and served with 2 chutneys, chips and salad. Very filling and so good. Paan Pasand tasted wonderful, essence of Paan in every sip. Mini Idli Skewers looked cute, tasted nice. I really liked the Sambhar though. We loved the interiors, 90s music playing continuously in the background plus my favorite tracks. It was a wonderful experience. Do try it out. Recommended.

I visited Desiklub today, with my friend, for lunch. Starting from the location, it is on the same floor, beside Spiceklub. Very easy to locate. The ambience is super amazing with the Desi touch, as the name suggests. The food was also upto the mark. We ordered :
Chitti Aayi Hai
Do Dil Mil Rahe Hai
Bubblegum Milkshake
Everything tasted good. Price wise also it is very moderate. Should definitely visit with family and friends.

Desiklub is located at park street, beside Mamagato. Desiklub and spiceklub are on the same floor. The ambiance is quite nice with a hint of Desi adda style. The service is very nice and they are quite fast also. What I liked the most there is their style of presenting the food. We had the followings:
1.Do dil mil rhe hai, which is tawa noodles served with pav bhaji. - It taste good, a little more butter would do better magic.
2. Peggy whiskey with soda : No! That's not an alcoholic drink, it's just the kala khatta syrup served with soda, which I loved it..
3. Pasta in Desi style: This is basically a tangy flavoured macaroni in an Indian butter masala style. It doesn't taste that up to the mark! But I would just to try some other pasta dishes from the menu.
4. Kulfi- one with gulab jamun and another with motichur ka laddu. Trust me you never had this kind of kulfi before. These kulfis are just amazing. It also has a frozen choco layer on it.
Kulfis are the must try at Desi klub!

We bumped into DesiKlub with friends, last weekend & it was a delightful experience. We really liked the 90s music theme playing & the quirky interiors. Glad, there was no hookah here. We ordered for the Indian Sliders - veg cutlets served slider style, bite sized delights to be popped in quickly, & Two Cheese Chilli Toast- toasts with green & red chutneys & a wholesome layer of melted cheese to that, how can it not be good. In mains, we ordered - Hum Saath Saath Hain-Tawa Noodles with Paneer Chilli, a must-have dish with good balance of gravy, noodles, crunchy veggies, felt like a 10 year old having hakka noodles with paneer chilly at mama's home in Delhi. I'm sure we will be coming here again to try out more items on the menu. Recommended.

The first look of starters around everybody’s table was so tempting that we couldn’t help but go all out with them. The Peri Peri Pakoda Platter, made up of exotic vegetables, was served in a rather cute trolley. Brownie points to them for the presentation! Two dishes which were fantastic and actually managed to meet the brand standards were the Paneer Satay and the Two Cheese Chilli Toast! The satay came wrapped in a very flavourful and exquisite and sauce. Yes! We obviously gobbled all of it within seconds! The highlight of the chilli toast was the green cheese which provided the perfect combination of spice and cheese to the toast. We’d definitely go back for these! Overloaded with the starters, we hardly had any room left when the classic Spiced Rice With Thai Curry arrived. However, we were glad we didn’t miss the Thai curry because it was amazingly cooked and tasted great with the rice! A shout out to all Thai food lovers to try this one! All in all, the place has great interiors, very interesting beverages, above average food, great ways of presentation and a delicious variety of side sauces! A good choice for families, this place could also make for a great hangout destination for young college-goers as well as new lovers. Go try, now!

Newest entry in veg. restaurants in the city & in Park Street. Been doing the rounds since few months. It's time i tried it with my friends, of course. One of my favorite street foods of all time is Sev Puri and of course it was my first choice for starters. For those of you who don’t know what it is: it’s a type of chaat that is very popular in Mumbai. It’s a crispy flat puri, topped with potato, green beans (moong) and onion, drizzled with coriander chutney and tamarind chutney and topped with sev (deep fried gram flour noodles). Basically it’s irresistible delicious. The Sev Puri served at DesiKlub has fresh pomegranate seeds and pineapple on it which makes it super refreshing and even more delicious. Definitely my favourite starter on the menu. Next was, The Pasta Desi Ishtyle (Macaroni in Makhanwala gravy) on the other hand was world-class. Being a big fan of butter paneer and a pasta lover, I often wondered how those two would taste combined. This combination of Indian-Italian cuisine is absolute comfort food and deserves to be called my favorite main dish at DesiKlub. Like most veg restaurants, this place doesn’t serve alcohol. We enjoyed chilled Ganna Adrak (sugarcane juice with ginger). Recommended.

Great place to chill with street food with a complete twist and turns. Went there with family and had a galla time with 90's music in the background. Had chelo kebab, missl paw, deelli belly, and brownies.. all where we'll prepared and tasted good. 
Best part is that it is easy in pocket too with good quantity and quality of food. 
Next visit will be soon

The food was pathetic, an entire mood and evening spoiler.. the nachos served were the worst I had at a restaurant, totally soggy, tasteless and with nothing else than rajma beans.. The rice was as bad as it could be. The ingredients included sauted creamy vegetables and fries, however what was served included hardly 2-3 fries and a few slices of bland veggies.. even the jal jeera drink we ordered tasted more like kala khatta than jal jeera.. totally disappointed. Hit hard on pocket, while we came out with empty stomachs..

The Kolkatan one is definitely not better than the one in Bombay both in terms of food and interiors. Located in the heart of the city it is easy on the pocket,however, the menu inclines more towards high tea items. We ordered the paneer roller coaster ( kind of paneer pakoda) and sizzling brownie. Sizzling brownie was very basic and is not recommmendable

This place is on the same floor as Spice Klub. Since they belong to the same family,I had high expectations from this place, but sadly they weren't met. The ambience of the place is nice and their playlist was really good. The service was excellent and so was the presentation of the food. However the most important thing, that is the food, was really average. We tried many dishes but nothing really stood out. The mocktails were really well presented but were below average. Most of the items in their menu had paneer which was quite irritating. Hope they improve the quality of their food so that we get a chance to visit it again.

I was eager to go to this place but what a disappointment. It's a pathetic place. We ordered Roller Coaster Paneer and Desi Nachos. The Paneer was fine and came in a Ferris wheel. We also ordered a Bubblegum Shake. The quantity was too little and it tasted exactly like bubblegum. The Desi Nachos was probably the worst thing I've ever eaten at a restaurant. It was khakra which wasn't even crispy on which there was just lots and lots of cheese. Is this your idea of nachos? This dish had no taste and no flavour. The service is pathetic. The servers don't know what they are doing, they were so confused. The ambiance is nothing great. Really did not expect this from a venture like SpiceKlub. What a disappointing place!

This restaurant reminds me of the song "aao twist karein" and how. With amazing presentation, comes lipsmacking food at such prices. The 90s music adds to the ambience, leaving you with a heartwarming feel. Plus, you can book the place or a section for birthday parties/ kitty parties & more. DesiKlub comes off as a refreshing desi place for the office-goers in/ around Park St. & for die-hard vegetarians who love to gorge on street food often in style.

Located inside the magma building, opposite Spice klub. The owner are the same for both restaurant. But its much difference between the two. Desiklub consists only street food basically. Staffs were friendly and courteous. Valet parking is available. Food was damn spicy, need to change that. Service was fast. We had ordered the following items:
1. Chitthi aayi hai
2. Chennai se china tak 
3. Aaj ka shorba- manchow 
4. Hum saath saath hai
5. Veg au gratin
6. Cholle de bhatura
7. Caramel nut lassi 
And many more but dont remeber the name. 
Sizzler was not all worth, dont know which sauce they add to it. Lassi was different, but good. 
The place is good to visit with friends and family.

Did not expect any thing like this from Spice Klub. Visited there new outlet Desi club and was thoroughly disappointed. Their desert called old school lollies trifle was a total cheating. They just put 2 mousee one on top of the other with some gems and 2 pcs of biscuits and they charge us Rs 345/-.
It is time that restaurants think what they are charging the customer and what they are giving to us. On the top of this price their is GST ALSO. We ordered one of the sizzlers and that was also a waste.I would never go there again and request others also to think twice before entering desi club.

Staffs are also not properly trained. They cannot explain properly in relation to the dishes they serve. Altogether a very bad experience. Waste of money.

It provides typical street food with some twist.

I would recommend the paneer roller coaster as it was delicious and served beautifully mash paneer with hint of capsicum mix with cheese make it a great & not to be miss dish.

Chloe te bhature was dam spicy & chola contains spinach which was very surprising oil in which bhature was prepared stinks 

Cocktail Fries was totally wastage of money as it was served very unmannerly, taste was not up to the mark so give it a skip  

Masala Jeera was decent tasted like boomer bubble gum on first sip, rest ambiance is good and staffs are well behaved as they do give description on every dish funny part description on the dish unavailable on that point not to be miss.

Need to work over its taste and on the price point will recommend only for the songs they play in love with the collection and the dish paneer roller coaster remarkable.........

Outstanding presentation and service and staffs were cordial enough but emphasis has been laid on presentation more and not the food. Tastes very average but light on pocket. Utterly butterly vada paw tasted the best. Worth a visit because the concept is different, they've added a twist to all possible street food items. Need to work over its taste, rest thumbs up.

A new cousin of the famous Spice Klub has opened in the city by name of Desi Klub.Housed in the same building and the same floor off Park Street, this eatery plans to target the veggie family crowd with reasonable prices.
The USP of this eatery is Indian Street food with some twist and has a good variety of Vegetarian dishes like BHEL,Misal Pav,Papadi Chaat along with continental stuff like Cheese Fondue,Pizza etc to cater to all age groups.
The plating and innovative food presentation which has become a trend nowadays has been well implemented here.
Most of the dishes have been priced below 200 which is highly reasonable considering the Park Street area.
Overall a very good experience with a very cordial staff and great music.

As it has in its name, it provides typical street food with some unbelievable twist.
I would always go for & also recommend the roller coaster dish.
It was such a fancy yet delicious item.
Drinks - masala sasyo was again treat to the taste buds.
They also had nachos in a very desi style - khakra is served with cheese spread over it - innovative yet yum yum :D :D
Loved it.
Newly opened ! All the best 😃👍🏼
