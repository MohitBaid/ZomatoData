We ordered one mutton biriyani and one chicken biriyani . 
In simple words the food was pathetic. 
Our astami got ruined cause of it. 
The rice was not well cooked. 
The potato in the biriyani was so damn hard nd not cooked well at all we literally had to throw it away. 
The meat nd chicken tasted so so a bit salty actually. 
We payed almost 475 bucks in total for both the dishes .
And it was a complete waste of our money  .
Not going back ever again .

This place has disappointed me today. We visited this outlet on 18.10.2017 and ordered tangdi kebab. It was too good, and given for such a cheap price, was indeed a great deal. But today when we ordered the same dish, the dish disappointed us like anything. The pieces were not good and it wasn't properly roasted. The mint chutney provided with it was like water, it's consistency was so so bad. I am attaching the pictures, just look at the images of the same dish but served on a gap of 1 day.

I used to like this place previously but during the pujas when I went to try some food from this place it totally disappointed me.
We went on panchami and the lake market food court was packed with people. After waiting for 30mins we got a seat and we went to order .
We ordered a combo that included butter naan and chicken.
The person at the counter told us to try the mutton biriyani as it was made fresh and is piping hot.
We were tempted at the offer and we ordered one plate of biriyani.
The naan and chicken tastes decent. 
But the biriyani. Oh my God. It was so salty that actually we couldn't finish it. It had one piece of mutton , one aloo but the rice!!!!!! It was greasy and salty and nothing tasted like a biriyani. 

I had previously loved this place but preparing a biriyani so wrong is not acceptable.

This Food outlet is located at Yum Street in Lake Mall , Rashbihari Avenue. It's basically a Mughlai cuisine food joint that can be easily recognized from it's name. We ordered for a Chicken combo meal which includes Vegetable Pulao, Chicken Kasha , Dal Makhani , Salad And A Gulab Jamun. Service was quite prompt. Quantity and quality was sufficient for one person. The combo is priced 290 RS including GST which is quite reasonable. Overall you can give it a try.

This outlet of Mughal Shugal is located in Yum Street, Lake Mall. 

They offer a variety of Mughlai dishes and kebabs. We have ordered for Egg Biryani from this outlet. 

The egg biryani was really good in taste with one piece of aloo and two boiled eggs inside it. The rice was also perfectly cooked and aromatic and I liked it. It was not much oily or heavy and was good for a light lunch.

Service is slow and prices are a bit on the higher side. Food was awesome.

Awesome Biriyani experienced at Maddox Square ground yesterday at 1 o clock Astami night. Large pecies of chicken they served with Biriyani which was melted in mouth with residue of exciting flavours. During Puja pandel hopping getting such good food in good price is really an exciting experience. And the staffs are very friendly and polite despite of such tedious and hectic service situations. You must try Biriyani here.
