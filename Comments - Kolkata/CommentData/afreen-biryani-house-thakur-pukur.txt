Tucked aside at a corner in the junction of MG Road, and DH Road, this small takeaway kiosk is a place to grab some descent  biryani at a shoe string budget. 
Apparently the shop appears to be a bit shabby, but the biryani is nice in taste and worth giving a go.

It is the most low cost biriyani house ,where biriyani is available at as low cost as Rs 75. The quality is awesome at such a price. The quantity is also good and appreciateable.

No fancy gimmicks. No seats. No tall marketing. But,  very good biryani. Definitely at this price point its not possible to tally with the giants and still,  its ready to compete. Should try. Isnt bad at all. Its authentic dum biryani

Kolkata is the land of the finger licking aloo biryani with almost every lane and cranny boasting its own fave outlet. Afreen is thakurpukur's jewel in the biryani circuit. It is a virtual  open kitchen takeaway, almost a hole in the wall. Yet the biryani is awesome, delicious, light and cheap. It is said locally that they use amul ghee to cook the biryani and not the heart-clogging, health - unfriendly dalda vanazpati which is used in most biryani shops, even the bigger brands in the area like haji sahab and raj darbar. 

That is why those biryanis congeal into lumps when they become cold and cause severe acidity. Afreen biryani is light on the stomach and has a fresh fragrance. You will never get stale stuff there as everything is sold off within minutes of preparation and fresh biryani is cooked again. 

The rating I gave is plain and simple for the biryani and not for decor, etc.

They say -Don't judge a book by its cover. Well this one truly defines it. Does not have a great appearance and very less items but what they have is worth trying.
Heard about this one from some of my friends and decided to give it a try. No seating available ,only take away. Biriyani is certainly better than some big names of the market. Chicken chap is good too. Worth visiting again.
Don't know why they don't have mutton biriyani or other mutton items. The way they cook , adding mutton would add extra points.

This take away joint is a small place opposite to Kali Mandir near 3A bus stand. The biriyani and the chaap is the focal point here. I am having biriyani and chaap since its inception.
Earlier there were varieties of biriyani such as mutton biriyani and few other items but those are discontinued. Here you would get a chicken biriyani and chicken chaap in a very pocket friendly price. You would have to shell out approx Rs 100 to get a chicken biriyani and a chicken chaap. Food taste have remained almost same throughout these years. You won't be disappointed. Both these items tastes quite good as far as a small biriyani shop is concerned. Food hygiene is something which you will not be impressed about due its location. But overall its fine.

Yes.. Its not a big.. Jst a small biriyani seller. In front of 3A bustand kaali mandir. But trust me.. Its great.. But please dont compare with other hi fi restaurant.. But it has a great taste. Not too oily. Best standard level.. Only chicken biriyani and aloo biriyanis are available. Cheap rate. But quality is good. Jst try it, you will not be dissapointed.

Bow down to this unknown piece of LEGEND and to their amazing Biriyani. This is a small take away joint near 3A Bus Stand which basically sells Biriyanis and Chicken Chaap. I eat from this place on a regular basis, never get bored of it, every time I feel I m having for the first time. Tried all their dishes. Even their Chicken Chaap is also good.
