Inarguably the best brownies in town! Rich and gooey! Still waiting to try more items!  Every time I've tried to order, Tanvi is over booked!

Got a block of fudgy, chocolatey goodness as a gift, and oh, my my! It surely made my day a much sweeter one. Rich and boisterous, their desserts are totally in my good books nowüòÉ

My father's friend gave a box full of brownies from here as a Diwali gift. I loved that he moved away from traditional gifts and gave something different. The brownies were of 6 types. Loved each one of them. Was soft and perfect. Highly recommended. :-)

This review is long overdue and I sincerely apologise for not writing it sooner ...so here goes...

Firstly, TG by Tanvi Ghai has to be one of the best (if not the best) dessert places in all of Kolkata. I know it may seem like I'm exaggerating but trust me, I'm not! 

Regardless of what I have ordered everything is absolutely, lip-smackingly "DELISHIOUS" üòú !!! I have personally tried almost everything on the menu whether it's the brownies, the cakes or the tarts, I have fallen in love with every single bite repeatedly. ‚ù§Ô∏è

My favourite thing on the menu? It's really hard to pick one but here's my list of what I love ...because choosing one single thing is like choosing your favourite finger or toe! (No kidding!!) 
1. The Walnut Fudge Brownies 
2. The Oreo Brownies
3. The Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake 
4. The Mudpie 
5. The Chocolate Chip Chunk Cake  
6. The Chocolate Pudding in a bowl (an eggless creation) 
And finally ...
7. The Mixed Nut Tart (which has to surpass almost all the decadence in this world!). Over the past year, every trip that I've made to Delhi, I've carried the Brownies and the Mixed Nut Tart with me without fail!

For my birthday she made a "Naked Cake" which was humongous, gorgeous and decadent! (It was a special request and not on the regular menu). It was "naked" because it didn't have icing all around it and one could see the actual layers in the cake. Flavoured with coffee and coffee liquor and decorated with fondant flowers. It has to be the the prettiest cake I have ever cut! üéÇ

Thank you Tanvi Ghai...i wish u all the success and opulence for the future! And if possible...the opportunity to open an outlet in the NCR! üëç‚ù§Ô∏è

Cannot praise enough and im surprised there aren't more reviews and ratings. TG you hit the right spots with your desserts. Coffee marble brownies literally still making my mouth water. Thank you for this delicious treat.

The first time I tried TG's chocolate fudge brownies, i was hooked on to it. The brownies were perfect with a melt in your mouth centre. I recently ordered for a classic truffle cake which was deliciously soaked in rum and was soft with the richest chocolate ganache. This is a must try from her menu. The cake stayed moist and soft for a good 4-5 days, which i found to be the best quality about her stuff. Her red velvet cake is to die for.!!its one of my favorite desserts and i can positively say that hers are the best around town! I would strongly recommend TG's for your next party order!
