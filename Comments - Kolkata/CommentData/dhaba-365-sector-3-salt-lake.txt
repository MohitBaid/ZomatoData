This is a roadside home delivery and takeaway joint catering to the residents of Salt Lake and perhaps beyond, particularly FD Block residents, located on the pavement adjacent to the FD park beside some other food stalls. Food here is pretty average. Ordered online a takeaway of rumali roti and shahi paneer via zomato; the roti was not quite 'rumali' but a bit hard to tear, force and pressure was needed to be applied in the task of tearing, while the paneer tasted almost bland (and definitely not 'shahi'), even a bit salty presumably for some. Overall food is not that good. Not to be recommended after a first try.

Horrible packing. Non veg chicken soup was spilled all over the vegetarian items which we had to throw away. Even what we ate was pathetic. Too much salt. Also, food was delivered late. Save your money, don't order from here.
