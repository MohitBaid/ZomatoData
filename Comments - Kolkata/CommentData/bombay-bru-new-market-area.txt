Biggest downside was the service speed and the not so professional staff. Food was quite good and ambience was above average.
But i didn't have a good experience marrwd mainly by the service.

Well.. Went there on a sultry afternoon.. Was expecting the same plc given in the pictures but came to know that they have recently shifted their restaurant from the ground floor( outer extension) to upstairs 3rd floor. The place over looks the road outside and is nice and bright! 
Coming to the food.. Alcohol is decently priced. We ordered a crispy chicken called something tai.. (I have a very bad memory).. Satay chicken and seasonal veggies.. It was good! Like really nice.. Portion size is around 6 pcs per plate. Main course was chicken strongonoff.. Lacking flavour a bit.. Spaghetti bolognaise.. Pretty nice ???? then mexican chicken and roast chicken.. Both really good.. I recommend the roast chicken highly.. Rice quantity in the strongonoff was not upto the mark.. Rest was yummy! ????
Service:  SLOW!!! They need to buck up.. It took them 1hr 15 mins to serve lunch... 

I recommend visiting this place to all!! Bon appetit!

I had a 2 day stay in this hotel while i was in kolkata.. Room service is good, specially the beds which they offer for a happy night sleep. Buffet lunch option is there and also you can have hukka and beverages with a comfortable sitting arrangement.
