Dont order food from Mughal Shughal by the way with number 9830022003 (no. not responded)..... First of all their services are one of the worst service...... I ordered a mutton biriyani , and the mutton was so smelling badly. I request them for exchange they havent. I thin k they supply beef instead of mutton. I am going toÂ  complain to police station about this. Mughal Shugal is their branch.

This eye-catching takeaway joint opened up near my friend's place during the pujas and I had been eyeing it for quite a while now. So one night when me and my friend were in desperate need for food and all the other places were shut because of how late it was, we decided to try this joint. Since we were a little sceptical of the quality, we decided to go with mutton biryani and egg biryani. But surprisingly it turned out to be really good. Not too spicy, but not bland either. The quantity was quite a lot and the pricing was not too high either.  Another thing I would like to mention is their containers, which is quite goodlooking. So you dont feel bad shelling out a few extra bucks for the packaging :P

Went there with friends for evening snacks. Quite a good place. The food quality is also very good. The service is prompt. Looking forward to go there again soon. A good pick for snacks and light food.
