Kolkata is famous for its street food and joints like this only add values to that aspect of the city. A very tiny joint selling only rolls of different fillings and the tastes are really awesome. Each customer is asked about their preferences of sauces and chillies. However, the roll sizes are quite decent and serves as a decent meal. the best part unlike other roadside eateries is, however rich the rolls might be, i do not fall ill, maybe for the oil they use, which might be of good quality.

Never tried vegetarian out here, but the chicken roll here is superb and affordable. Good quality oil is used along with fresh chicken and fresh onion. Once I was with my friends in tollygunje and we came all the way here just to enjoy shimnan's roll.

Decent place for a quick bite. Egg rolls are quite good.
