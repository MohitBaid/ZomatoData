This sweet house is quite popular for morning breakfast, kachori and sabji. Even sweets are too good. You will always find fresh items. Had tasted gulab jamun, kheer kadam and of course my favorite rasogullas. Just loving it...

It is a sweet shop just beside kaikhali more. You can also have puri and sabji in the morning. Each puri will cost you â‚¹4. They sell variety of sweets and snacks also.

Cheap sweets. But fresh always. Samosas are fine. Gulab jamuns are good. Several Bengali dishes are available. Dal kachori is a cheap but popular on the go breakfast.
