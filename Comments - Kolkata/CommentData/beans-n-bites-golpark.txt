A cafe in the Golpark area near Kotak bank. The cafe is a small spaced one but, the foods served is worth going there and spending money. The ambience is really calm, peaceful and soothing. The behaviour of the staffs are really good especially of the owner. She is very friendly. Prices are decent enough and affordable, specially, pocket friendly for school and college students. The quality and quantity of the food is really amazing and perfect respectively. All the food items are really good but if you are willing to go there, you should try their Pasta, Pizza, Sandwich, Combos ( Noodles with Chicken and Fried Rice with Chicken ) and surely don't miss their heavenly Shakes ( especially, Brownie Shake, Oreo Shake & Chocolate Shake ).
The only thing is you need to sit for a while so as to get your favourite items served before you and then enjoy the taste of your favourite food in a soothing atmosphere with light music/songs being played behind..

An absolutely amazing cute little cafe in Golpark. Really easy to locate. The owner is an extremely polite and friendly lady who helped us decide what we can have here. Coming to the food, we ordered Crispy Chicken Burger, Chicken Penne Pasta in mixed Sauce and Brownie Shake all of which were extremely tasty. Loved the ambience here and looking forward to visiting again.

This is a very cosy little place at the heart of Golpark. Situated just beside Kotak Mahindra Bank, this baby is only three months old. It's a well decorated place, with good lighting, music (as per taste) and very courteous staff. Especially the owners! They are very friendly and very tentative, as to see how their customers are liking their experience there and the food as well! But this place has no reason to worry as the food is top-notch.
I have been here a couple of times with friends and family, and both the times I have tried the Italian Fries, which is a delicious finger food choice. Mingled with cheese, these fries are tossed in garlic and oregano preparation which will suit anyone's taste buds. Then there were the Chicken Penne Pastas. We tried both the White and the Pesto sauce, and it makes your day. The creaminess, along with the tang of the pesto is very soothing. It is a very reasonable portion too, and has to fill your tummy enough for a couple of hours.
If you are looking for something more main course-ey, go for the rice combos, they do not disappoint you. Just that, their chicken side dish preparations could be better. Otherwise, yum. I'm looking forward to visiting this joint more, and trying the other lot of the menu! 

P.S : About the place, by cosy I mean, literally too cosy. This place is on the tiny side of the spectrum, so big groups - look out.

I'm a regular customer of this small Caf√® as this is a perfect place for college students or young aged people... It can accommodate 16-20 people max to max... I've tried most of their items... Everything tasted too good.. But I personally feel that the meal combo (i.e both the fried rice-chilli chicken and noodles-chilli chicken) should be more in quantity... The ambience is cozy... Perfect for dates or Hangouts with friends... But the owner of this Caf√®, the aunty is too humble as a host... She personally takes care of her every customer... The server is truly a gentleman... The way they manage their customers is something that would steal your heart...
Must try: Fish n chips, chicken pizza in pesto sauce, penne pasta, oreo shake and brownie with ice cream. It is very pocket friendly. It should be in a hit list to visit.

I am not sure if I am eligible to write a review of this place as the only thing I had here was a cup of tea. It was cardamom tea and maybI dare say it was one of the best I have ever had. The tea was strong,frothy,creamy and had a delicious aroma. For? Just 25 bucks.
I also liked the decor and the service too was very hospitable. Will definitely go back to try the food.

PS : They don't charge GST

The restro was very small but it was nice nd well decorated. The interior was good and the owner who was a lady was pretty good. There was only one waiter serving so we have to wait there if we need any help. 
I order a crispy chilli babycorn . First of all it was not crispy at all. But the taste was not so bad. It was decent. We also order grilled chicken burgur which was very oily. My hand was full of oil and it was so much oily that we I was eating the oil was droping on my dress. But the burgur was quiet tasty if I ignore the oil. 
 My experience was nice and the rates were cheap. I would like to again visit there and try something new.

** Location = It is situated just beside the Kotak Mahindra Bank at Golpark. The zomato maps completely sends you to another direction. Be careful, kindly call them for the appropriate direction.

**Brief = I have had come across some top reviews about them and it was high time for me to pay a visit, was in a mood to have two cups of coffee initially but it was much more than that. Its a newbie in terms of age(only 3 months old).

** Ambiance/Decor = Not much spacious, but what they lack in space they cover it up by their excellent customer service and behaviour. A gentlelady owns this place, and she guided me well since I was following the maps and could not locate them. The server was one of the most gentle guy one would come across and was very much cordial with their attitude. They also give cleanliness much priority as you can find hand sanitizers on every table.

** Things tried = I was accompanied by

This is one newly opened cafe situated at golpark.
‚óè Location: Opposite to Ramkrishna mission golpark, just beside kotak mahindra bank. A small entrance to this cafe which can accomodate 20 people at once.
‚óè Ambiance and Decor : Nothing extraordinary worth mentioning. A simple cafe properly managed by the friendly and courteous lady owner. Hand sanitizers were kept on each of the tables. A small passage to the outlet opens into a room with three tables and seating for roughly 20 person. I felt a bit congested though.
Now the main part
‚óè Food:
‚àö Chicken popcorn- This tasted average and the quantity was below par considering the price in mind.
‚àö Crispy chilli chicken- No complaints about this starter except for the crispy part. It wasn't crispy for anybody's liking. Not perfect as a starter anyday. The taste was fine.
‚àö Chicken pasta in mixed sauce- With every new food items ordered, the quality seemed to have improving. This one was perfectly cooked. But again the quantity of chicken disappointed.
‚àö Chicken pizza- The trend followed. No room to complain about. Soft crust and more cheese. This stole the show.
‚àö Chicken pizza in pesto sauce- Another remarkable pizza in pesto sauce.
‚àö Kitkat shake- Served in a normal glass with two half kitkat slices as a topping , the kitkat shake was nothing special to leave a mark. The quantity was good and at this price i feel there is nothing better that can be served.
‚àö Brownie Shake- We were suggested this particular shake as beans n bites' special. Again served with three brownies as a topping, this was no special to talk about.
‚àö Choco truffle pastry
‚àö Chocolate mousse
The chocolate mousse was a disappointing end.
We were provided complimentary lime soda. This was a nice gesture.
Our total bill-‚Çπ 970
We were 6 in number that visited this outlet.
Detailed rating:
Food- 3/5
Decor- 3.5/5
Service: 5/5
The owner of the outlet is one nice person always asking her customers about the food quality and looking for improvement. The service was prompt and satisfactory.
The pocket pinch is not too high.
We had to pay the bill amount in cash. Card payment was not accepted for some reason.
Give it a visit guys. I hope you won't be disappointed.

Located just beside Golbari at the crossing of Golpark. A recent one .. just about 2 months old. Sitting area not much bigger but if it‚Äôs not full then it‚Äôs a good place for a silent chitchat. 

The pasta was very good indeed. The sandwich was just abt ok ... 
brownie with chocolate sauce was good.

The only thing I felt was that the portions given are a little too less than the price charged for it. Even the breads of the sandwich were smaller. The pasta portion too was not much. 

But yes I will return to this place because of that Pasta ...

Dont judge a book by its over, 
This place stands straight for this well known quote. A small cafe, well lit and comfy place for a date or even a hangout for friends. 
Owners are extremely cordial and request for constructive feedback. 
Coming to food, 
Had tried chicken lemon salad, 
Fish and chips and Make your own pizza. 
The fish and  chips, is exactly what you are looking for, crispy crust and tender fish inside accompanied with mint aoili, 
The salad on the other side ia fresh, tangy and thankfully stands to its name. Its filled with olive oil and lemon juice. Not the mainstream creamy salad. 
Filled with veggies and chicken. Its a great palate cleanser.
The pizza is though dry but filled with cheese and topings. Nothing beats the stringy cheese. 
A great thumbsup, to this place. 
And, definitely a hidden gem.

This is a comparatively new Cafe in the area. It has a unique homely feel and a very cozy ambiance. The hospitality of the lady owner and the staff is really very comforting...

Had a chicken grilled sandwich and a Darjeeling tea. The tea was quite refreshing and soothing. The sandwich had a great stuffing and the mustard mayo dip was also too good!

The place is reasonable, and the food is worth the price! Would love to visit it again soon.

This is the first time I am adding a review, and that's just because of the fact, I am in love with this caf√©. The location is perfect, the ambience is super cool and the food is so amazing (wrt both taste and price).
Been there thrice already and it's already my favorite place to hang out with close friends.
I had chicken grilled sandwich, chicken pizza, crispy dry chilly chicken, masala omelette, french fries, brownie with ice cream, Choco truffle, caf√© latte, cappuccino(!)
Trust me or not, every food there tastes awesome, the amount being too generous for the price. 
The owner lady is gracious and welcoming.
(Being a regular there, I get free drinks or coffee as per my choice!üòã)
Go there asap and find it out yourself!

Located at golpark, this is a very cozy place run by a beautiful woman.
A friend of mine recommended this place and it was worth it
I had visited for around 5 times
Prices are very reasonable ! Very pocket friendly !
But the most important part is that they maintain their food quality.
You must try their fish and chips which cost 120 rupees only
Fish finger which is 100 bucks
Chicken burgers cost 75 approx
Pizzas are for 90 rupees
Pastas for 110 approx
Banana caramel shake for just 90 rupees
They also serve great cappuccino just for rupees 40 !
Yes you saw that right !
Above everything else, the best part is the woman who is running the cafe. She will take care of you and your food personally, she even sends her costumers home giving them toffees. Isn't that sweet?  She will greet you and treat you in a very warm manner !
A perfect place for people of all age .
Hope to see you people soon at Beans n Bites !

This newly opened cafe was in my bookmark list since it was enlisted in zomato and today finally got chance to visit the place for lunch. 
Location : This small cafe is located in Golpark just opposite Ramkrishna mission bus stop. You can easily find it. 
Ambiance : Firstly the cafe is very small. It's located at ground floor of a residential building. Though the dining space is small,  the decor and arrangements are pretty good. They have kept hand sanitizer in each tables that quiet impressed me. 
Foods : Our food journey includes,
* Grilled Chicken Sandwich
* Crispy Chilli Chicken
*  Mango Shake
*  Choco Praline
Firstly they served the sandwich and it tasted really good with perfect crispness. They served a dip with the sandwich that was very much well going with it. Next Crispy Chilli Chicken was served and I personally didn't find any uniqueness in this dish. It tasted just okay. They should make it more tangy and a little bit more crispy and dry. Coming to the shake it tasted just awesome. A thick shake with perfect amount of sweetness with adequate mango flavour.  Lastly in dessert we chose Choco Praline and it was a dark chocolate cake served hot. 
Service : The service is worth mentionable. The owner of this cafe was very humble and friendly. They also gave us a cold drink as complimentary. I really appreciate their efforts. Keep it up. All the best for your sweet little cafe.
I will surely recommend this place. The prices were very much reasonable and easy on pocket. The menu is all inclusive of taxes. No added tax on the final bill. So just go, seat and enjoy your food session with your near and dear ones.

"Beans and Bites", by name only it suggests that when you have coffee beans merge it up with some crazy crispy bites. We want to thanks for serving such good and freshly prepared foods. Two days we went, and the food was indeed amazingly good.
Till now, we ordered chocolate cookie cappuccino, cold coffee with ice cream, crispy chilly baby corn, crispy chilly chicken (dry), chicken penne pasta (white sauce), fish fingers, and fish 'n' chips. 
Good quality fresh filling foods craved to have more and more without thinking of long bill which adds upto 24% of GST but surprisingly this place doesn't charges any kind of taxes. Foods are all inclusive of taxes. Moreover, light musical beats gives a feeling of calmness and mood to have those excellent dishes.
I would say, it's a must visit for all of us as it is a student's friendly cafe ‚ô•
To fulfill your cravings of good food, "beans and bites" welcomes you with a big smile :)

This is a small place near golpark which I had didn't always notice but found out in Zomato. The decor is good and waiter was also polite, though the food took a lot of time to come. The penne pasta tasted very good but other than that I didn't quite like anything there. The Ceaser salad didn't quite taste too nice and I expect more from the pizza. The shakes tasted fine. The price of the food wasn't too high but the overall food wasn't quite satisfactory.

This cafe took me by surprise. After spending hefty, unjustified sums on cafes around the area, this place, with its tasty, quality food at real cheap prices is indeed a find. I loved their grilled chicken sandwich, which is filled with succulent chicken. Their burger is good, too. tried the cold coffee and the pineapple blossom. Both great. Even if you eat a lot, you don't have to brace yourself for the bill. The sweet, kind lady, who is the owner, adds to the charm. Will surely come back again and again.

It's a tiny cafe in the heart of Golpark.You can easily miss the entrance which is just next to the Kotak Mahindra Bank entrance.The very next building,right hand side if you're facing the bank.
The decor is warm & cozy with a few tables and a couch.The staff,extremely courteous & the owner makes you feel right at home with her smile and friendly chat.
I had ordered for a grilled chicken sandwich.4 pieces of sandwich,grilled to perfection and with a wonderful filling which had the correct balance of chicken,spices and cheese,was served with potato chips.Apt for a light bite for two.I was recommended to try the Pineapple Shake by the serving staff.It was on the sweeter side and quite yum.
The bill came to Rs 180.They don't charge you GST. I even got a free candy as a Thank You gesture from the management.
One feels comfortable and welcomed in this cafe.I just wish she had space to expand.Will surely go back when in the area.

Well, this cafe is going to be ur absolute savior if u are broke, but still need to satisfy ur taste buds with good food.
Located, in the main road in Golpark, just opposite to the Kotak bank is this tiny cafe..

The decor is pretty good and can accomodate max 15 people.
Now, coming to the food.
We ordered
1) CRISPY CHILLI BABY CORN
2) CRISPY CHILLI CHICKEN
3) CHICKEN SANDWICH
Firstly, the pricing of the food is really low and is very very affordable.
The crispy chilli babycorn was tasty and was sufficient for the 3 of us.
The sandwich was also satisfying. We were served 4 pieces of sandwich which had sufficient chicken and in the side there were a few chips. They also served mayo and sauce making the sandwiches more tastier ..
 The we took chilli chicken.. We were  served 8 pieces of chilli chicken which was  just for 85 bucks and tastewise, it was quite good. 

Our pocket pinch was just 255 bucks. And yes, they are not charging any GST now. Although we didn't get a chance to try on their beverages but i am really looking forward to this cafe.
Highly recommended!

Coming to the food,it was good. We ordered chocolate cookie cappuccino, chocolate cookie cafe latte, chicken pizza and blueberry slice. Every single item was tasty. Portions of Chicken pizza was enough for two and blueberry slice was 100% fresh. The prices are affordable and too cheap.They don't charges anything extra beside food prices.
P.s.-After entering to this place I found there is a bottle of hand sanitizer on every table. Generally I carry my own sanitizer everywhere because I am a little cleanliness freak. So I immediately fell in love with this place.This is a new concept and attractive too.

A cozy little place with a light ambiance and very courteous staff.

We ordered the chocolate shake, lemon tea, blueberry slice and French Fries.

The chocolate shake was beautifully created with the perfect, thick consistency which I absolutely loved. The lemon tea was as good as a simple cup of tea can get, nothing much to say there.The blueberry slice was indeed as fresh as promised and the blueberry on top tasted heavenly with the cream. The sponge was a bit dry for my taste but it tasted very good overall. The fries caught my attention as they had a tangy taste over the normal salty taste that fries generally have. They were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, and was served with ketchup and a spicy mayo which I really liked.The food was very good and the price was reasonable overall. The courteous behaviour of the staff really made my mood lighten up.

The chocolate milkshake and French fries, albeit being a really weird combination, tasted really good together. I'd suggest trying that.

One little attention to detail that I loved was that they provided us with a bottle of hand sanitizer at the table which is a boon for us lazy people who don't bother getting up to wash their hands.¬†

Loved the place. Will surely visit again.

I personally recommend 
Chicken pasta in red sauce and mixed sauce
Cheese chili toast
Cheese omelette
Choco mousse
Almost all of the food items are A listers.

This is a newly opened cafe in Golpark which I discovered while I was hungry of coffee and short of cash. So they serve tea and coffee in the range of 40-60 bucks which is pretty cheap and hence it attracted me. Of course, you won't get the latte here the same as CCD, but its decent enough for the price. Also, tried their pasta which tasted like the ones we cook and eat at home. This place does not charge GST yet. Also, the owner is very friendly and courteous. One can visit this place if a decent, homely and pleasant atmosphere over a cup of tea/coffee is what you are looking for.

The interiors are beautifully done. And the lady incharge is such a lovely and generous person to share some words!
This was my very first visit to this caf√© and this place has all my heart.
Had opted for a Chicken Sandwich and a chocolate mousse. The Sandwich was made with Brown Bread and was very well seasoned with mayonnaise plenty of chicken and some other veggies. The chocolate mousse was a bit too sweet for me since I prefer dark chocolate than milk chocolate.
This is surely a paradise for all the college students. The place can house 12-15 people at a time. And is too very pocket friendly. Definately coming back to this place!
Till then, Au revoir et Bonne chance!.. :)

Been there last week, opposite to golpark bus stand, small place with limited sitting capacity. Its just one month since it has opened, interiors are impressive, we ordered chicken cheese balls (which is yet to be added in their menu card) it had genuine cheese filling not mayo. Next was chicken pizza , hot brownie with ice cream was lined up next which was served to us in a unique way, it is a must try, last we had blue mountain. All the food tasted great. Friendly behaviour of the staffs and the owner was present there to tell us about which dishes we should try and she herself suggested us chicken cheese balls. This place is less know to people but can surely visit this place and is pocket friendly too.

Awesome cafe. Situated just at Golpark bus stand. Great to see young entrepreneurs. Behaviour of the owners are superb. They suggested us to try chicken pizza. It taste really good. My daughter loved it so much that we have to parcel another one for home. We also had cappechino. It was ok in taste. Next time we will try mocktails and sandwiches. They said that was awesome
