Last night we had a craving of eating some Indian spicy food. I ordered the food late at night. The food which i received was very less in quantity. This is the exact food which i received. Chicken Kasha without any gravy and daal makhani was out of daal. Thanks guy's for making me feel empty stomach at night. Really disappointed. üò°

Giving three only because their pesto sauce pasta was quit good. But the Peri peri chicken burger has nothing but a thin Patty with Peri peri powder sprinkled on it. It should at least be a sauce, and even the Patty was of processed meat, like a fat salami cut. Overall a stark difference between the two dishes. So order based on reviews I guess.

I ordered the chicken fried rice and the schezwan chicken. Both were equally good and the quantity was sufficient enough for two people. The delivery was on time and the packaging was also good.
