Yes its a great news for foodies of birati locality A1 haji opened their outlet in birati.so its time to visit the shop.
ordered chicken roll,mutton biriyani,chicken reshmi kabab,chicken kossa and rumali roti.
roll was awsome,good filling in a big lachha paratha.but their biriyani makes me dishearted.rice was undercooked,dry and small piece of mutton.chicken kossa was good but too much oily.chicken reshmi kabab also dry not juicy.nyways 1st impresion was ok.hope to try again.
