Evergreen is a Chinese restaurant located at Tangra.

Ambience & decor is simple,  with sitting arrangenents.

Service is bit slow. Staffs are nice.

Drinks are also available.

Tried Fresh lime soda,  Mixed Hakka Chow & Chicken Drumsticks. 

Fresh lime soda was refreshing .
Chow was nice with nice fillings.
Chicken Drumsticks was average.

Pocket pinch is economical.

I suddenly realised that I haven't reviewed this place yet. This restaurant was my first Chinese restaurant visit that too long time back when I was in primary school.
Located in the interiors of Tangra, this is a really small place (I guess that's what may appear to me). We used to come here regularly long ago and were kinda self proclaimed loyalists of this place which later got shifted to Beijing.
The Szechwan Prawn from here was something to bug for. As a child, I used to hog a full plate of it containing ten pieces of it like a beast along with a plate of Rice Noodles.
Don't know how is it doing these days. Haven't been here for a long time. I may not like the food here anymore as my ideas about Chinese food has broadened by eating out at places. But Evergreen will always remain 'evergreen' in my heart when this would come to a Calcutta Chinese experience. Happy Dining! :)

The food is good, ambience okay, orders are prompt to be delivered. The only drawback is management amd their people handling skills. As soon as the clock strikes 1030 they are going to pester you to eat fast...literally. But collegegoers should definitely go. Its pretty easy on the pockets.

The moment we got in, ambiance was good enough, and we started with a Pork dish which was so good... But moving towards the main course I don't know what went wrong, the food quality started degrading.... Hence the verdict would be that the place is good for starters and not the main course...no way...cheers!!!

Evergreen is a shabby old school eatery of Tangra. Recommend place only for college stags for cheap booze. Food is the weakest link here. We had Lemon Chicken, Sliced Chilli Pork, Chilli Prawn with Mixed Cantonese Chowmein and Szechuan Chicken.

Lemon Chicken was too sweet with no presence of lemon flavour. Pork was bland and chewy. Prawn had overdose of salt. Chowmein had less noodles but overdone with boiled tasteless vegetables. Szechuan Chicken was only decent dish on table.

Service was poor. Tables were not cleaned. Had to send back pork as it tasted horrible. Top floor family section was denied to us but saw drunk stags were coming out from the same section. 2% extra was charged for card payment and the waiter was one of a kind of shameless fellow kept asking for tips even before payment.

There is a saying - "Keep your circle small and your beer chilled" - just after a horrible 45 minutes in "Shun Li" with hot beer and tasteless chicken with veg, Evergreen was again the suggestion of

Basic china town decorations with red chinese lanterns.
Add to that red tables.

The food here is good if not the best, a setback comes in the form of too dry a fried rice but the other dishes like the chilli chikcen, green chilli fish and noodles do a fine job.

Quick service and a easier pinch on the pocket follow.
