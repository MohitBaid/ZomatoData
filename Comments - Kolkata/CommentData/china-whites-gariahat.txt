Visited China Whites suddenly. Had Tuborg strong and hookah with foods also. As I don't have any plan to join Zomato then I lack pictures. 
However, it's a good place both for refreshing and chatting. Rates are okay. Ambience is good. Items and service are also quiet praise-worthy.

China Whites is located on the Gariahat main road, beside the Prapti showroom. I had been to their hookah section earlier once which didn't please me. It was stuffy with no ventilation, so I never tried going back there again.
One of my recent visit was to the restaurant which is a completely different place. The decor was subtle and soothing. The service was courteous as well. We opted for both Indian and Chinese for food. The latter was better. They also have a well stocked bar.

I stay very far away from the place but if I visit this place someday, I'll surely visit this restaurant again. What is pulling me back is the delicious Chopsey they make, both the American and Chinese. I like Chopsey here over anywhere else is because in other places the fried noodles and the gravy thing are served separately making it hard to manage, whereas here it comes all mixed up, well platted and the taste is sure to stay with you.

Ambience: On the creepier side, with loud and cheap Bollywood music 
Crowd: Noisy groups, most in their late twenties 
Food: Not bad. I have been there multiple times and tried various things from their menu, quantity has always been sumptuous. 
Overall, if you are looking forward to fool around with your crazy gang, not a bad place, as you also get hookah and alcohol, along with Indian, Chinese and continental dishes. However, if you are with your family, on a date or alone, this is the last place, you would want to visit.

The only reason why this place gets atleast a 3.5 is because of its food . 
The ambience and hospitality needs major improvisation. 
Packing food is probably a better option .

Well never went there to have food, but yes i wont say that i haven't ate anytime over there... Both the food qulaity and the quantity is nice... And yes mainly i went there to have hookah... So i feel that the hookah which u find there is of a very reasonable price...

This was a go-to-place of ours during the days back when I was in school and hookah was cool. So many fond memories of this place. But nostalgia aside, the place has some pretty descent music, semi-descent if not a little overpriced food and of course a variety of flavours of hookah. And a bonus point, they let u lit up a cigarette provided u bring it.

China whites was a regular ordering place when we lived in kasba area. We liked the Chinese served here. But nowadays the food quality has been going downwards. They should keep an eye on the food they are serving since we are old customers it hurts us to serve something like this.

I came here so many times. It became my go to place when I was in high school. The place is perky. There are two sections on the ground floor. The private area and the one commonly flocked my the youngsters. I have always got a place there. 
It's dimly lit and also has a huge screen to catch up some sports or latest music videos. Also the hookahs were amazing and dirt cheap. They also used to give complimentary coke if you took 2 hookahs. 6-7years back, the crowd was pretty decent. They used to play good songs. But as I came over to this place when I was in college, I really got pissed with it's ambience. Cheap crowd. The management was poor. People shouting, the music played gave me headaches. The last time I dropped in here for hookah, it was 2 years back. The servers were aloof, the crowd were a group of young people with no manners. Throwing stuffs at each from one table to another. The management was least bothered. Also, the decent crowd which this place used to have shifted to other hookah lounges that have newly opened.

We come here regularly and order for Manchow Soup because they make it good. This was the first time when we were denied to give extra fried noodles. We told the waiter to give extra noodles 4 times and after 5 minutes of telling the manager Mr. Maloy Saha came and said that the chef has denied to give extra noodles. This is the first in any restaurant that we have heard they cannot go give extra noodles. This was really disgusting and moreover the manager was very reluctant to serve. We asked to take away the fried noodles since the soup had become cold by the time and the manager took the soup and the noodles away without any hesitation. We have never ever faced such bad service at China Whites before.

It boasts of being one of the best hookah parlour in town with peppy music,  mind blowing aroma of the hookahs and a charming ambience. This place also offers a wide range of Chinese delicacies among which pan fried chili fish is my most favourite one.

China Whites is located in proximity to the Gariahat Pantaloons. Irony is that after going to a Chinese restaurant for a Chinese meal we reverted to North Indian after seeing some comprehensive yet appealing menu.

Ordered the Chicken Lasooni Kebab and Fish Malai Kebab. The Lasooni Kebab was succulent but the pungentness of garlic was lesser. The Maitre d' recommend us Fish Malai Kebab and it was really delicious and both the starters were served in sizzlers.

In main course we ordered Veg Pulao and Chicken Lababdar. Both the dishes were quite tasty. But the pulao was enriched too much with butter.

The ambience speaks of Oriental cuisine and the staff are very courteous. Service is prompt. Price is a bit on the higher side.

Food - 4/5
Ambience - 4/5
Service - 5/5

We ordered a combo meal of 1veg rice, 1veg noodles and 3non veg sides from this place. The quantity was huge I must say and it was quite healing to have it in between your office works. The prawn in the combo was the main attraction, the size and the taste both was quite nice. The fish was also good. But which disappointed us was the chicken. Not that tender and the taste of the sauce (black pepper or something) was also not good that way.

One of the finest low budget Bars in Kolkata. Situated near the Gariahat crossing and almost opposite to Pantaloons. 

The ground floor is mainly the hookah bar area and they also serve few drinks and main course meals. Hookahs​ are cheap and probably the second most cheap in Kolkata after Fumi villa. (275+tax=300) for one pot. Drinks are also of the same range so that's not a big deal.

The ambience is good with a big TV screen just behind the bar counter for everyone to watch. Smoke and toxins are regulated by 2-3 filters so it's quite neat and good. A small place but never crowded as the seating is nicely planned and  can accommodate both large and small groups. Age proof is not a big deal as they allow people of many age groups and that's why it's becoming more and more popular. A budget of 1,000 is perfect for 2 people.

*Brain-freezer is one of the best flavours available and with the facility of one free coal change. Only 4 people are allowed per pot.*

Cons- No cons so far .

We came to this place to try hookah along with food. They have a terrace sitting area where you can have hookah. Food is good, ambience is okay but what disappointed was the bill they charged. As per GST rules, you need to pay 12% for non-ac and ac restaurant service is chargeable at 18%. When we asked the manager, he couldn't give any justification why our bill was charged under 18% GST when we had dining in the terrace area.

The location of this place is such that it is difficult to miss. The ambience is enthralling indeed. We were seated in the third floor A/C section. The decor is pretty good too. The service providers are pretty attentive and responsive....so the service ends up being top class. The menu has variety . It was hard to have any complaints against whatever we ordered. The food is captivating indeed and leaves you wanting for more. Only downside is that the prices are a bit steep. They would do well to be a bit more reasonable with the prices.

This is my favourite place for a booze as they offer great quality as well as a great atmosphere at a low price. The music is just loud enough to create that feel, since it is a small place and gets full most of the time. The specially curated playlists deserve mention. And the bar is quite good and they also have some good sides. I have always chosen the hookah-Mint, Double Apple and Royal Paan Masala are the most popular flavours. The Red-Bull based hookah is a bit pricier but you can have the Water or Ice-based ones. Kingfisher Ultra Max is the booze we always have when you want to go low...on the bill as well.  Not to mention, the reddish hues of light just add to the ambience.

This famous joint is situated on the left side of the road, just where the Gariahat flyover starts. The place has one part on the ground floor nand one open air segment on the 3rd floor. I entered the ground floor one afternoon and the place was not much crowded. They screen live matchs which is a good thing. I ordered mix hot garlic noodle along with hong kong chicken. The noodle was exceptionally good. I also liked the chicken made mostly with red chilli. Ambiance is good and service is fast here.

China whites is very conveniently located at the heart of south kolkata and consists of a hookah parlour at the ground floor , a dine in at the 1st floor and a roof top. When it opened way back in early 2000s it was a good Chinese restaurant with decent food. Over the years it has become more of a nibbling zone rather than a good dining restaurant. The food quality has subsequently decreased. The service is pathetic . It is quite saddening to see a restaurant which has such a great location advantage has become almost a -- if there is no option then only go to china whites-- kind of a joint.

Went there a few near New Year, because this place was closest to our friend's house who gave us a treat. 
Loved the konjee crispy chicken so much that we had another round. 
Their kung pao and Hunan chicken are good as well. Can't go wrong with fried rice. 
No compromise with quality but quantity didn't feel justified for the price. 
Ambience is nice, 3.5/5 
Food 3.5/5 
Service and staff 3/5
Price 2.5/5 because of quantity.

China whites is one of the best place i have visited till date.
The restaurant splits into three parts.
The staffs were courteous and well trained.The service was good but since we were the only customers so its not the right situation to evaluate.
The ambience was good with soothing music in the background. 
The hookah was quite good. 
Moreover, it was worth visiting this place.

I went to China whites a long time back. Located at gariahat. The ground floor is kind a nice with a dark reddish ambience  we had a brain freezer hookah, two chicken noodles, a chicken prep i don't remember, coke, fries. The rooftop bar looks nice in the evening. A average place good for students.

1. We went to the roof top. It was good ambiance-wise. But not sure how it would feel on a sultry Kolkata evening.
2. Drinks were a bit costly. There are many other places with this kind of aura with cheaper drink prices.
3. Food was average. Since we ordered just a chicken based starter, it would be harsh to judge them fairly in this section.
4. Service was also not fully satisfactory to my taste. They seemed to be in a bit of hurry to ask for the order, or ask for a next round for all even if just one in our group was finished with the drinks, or while cleaning the table as soon as we paid the bill. There were many empty tables, so it was not a scenario of rush hours. Not sure, but not a standard kind of service I am experienced to in other eateries. To add to this, they also were reluctant to even reply to my request to switch to another TV channel since there was a live match going there which I wanted to see.

I had to take my family out for shopping in Pantaloons Gariahat and was searching Zomato for a place to eat nearby. That's when I came upon this place and wanted to pay a visit.
We went upto the second floor which was pretty decently decorated and lit. We were received very courteously by the staff.
As far as the food is concerned, pretty decent taste...we were suggested Mee Goreng in the noodles section which tasted awesome...
The crispy baby corn and drums of heaven were quite nice...
Crispy chicken with lemon sauce was a little too sweet for our liking...
Overall, a nice experience and would definitely suggest this joint to others...

Right in the middle of the commercial hub of Gariahat, this age old place sill stands tall. 

Parking could be an issue for you but once you are over with it, you won't be disappointed. Restaurant split in parts, didn't ask why though but the part we sat was just about well lit and had a bar section that reminds you of the restaurants that we went to in the 1990s. Yes, this place as old too apparantly, this being my first visit. 

No complaints whatsoever with the food and I would suggest this place over many others in the city. 

In a nutshell, it's a good place to be to once In a while, if not very frequently.

On a Holi day , wanted to grab a glass of beer , so I called up almost 7 to 8 places , everyone was either closed or will open up in the evening , but China Whites saved my day 😊. Located nearby Gariahat crossing it has both open terrace and indoor restraunt. We went for the indoor one. Let's come to the point one by one.
The ambience was good , you can make yourself feel cozy and comfortable with light music playing at the background.
The food they offered me an off menu item with fish chicken and mushroom cooked in tandoor and served in platter , trust me the fish taste was awesome, and getting the beer along side just made me more happier.
The service was well upto the mark , and I couldn't expect a better place for lunch and drink than this on holi. A must try place for sure 😊

Location: Opposite Pantaloons, Gariahat, below the flyover.

Ambience: I've been here 3-4 times and have always opted to sit on the roof top, open to air. I love the warm ambience of the place, friendly staff, decent crowd and some soothing music.

Food and drinks: Hard drinks and sheesha are nice and priced as per any other fine dining restaurant, bit on the higher side. But, you are willing to pay the bit extra for the nice service and ambience.
Food is average.

A must visit place for a good time with your girlfriend or a group of friends.

The place was referred by my friend Anurag amidst setting out for a much fancy location. And you know what, the place has a nice hookah ambience to it. By hookah I mean yes, the place is a bit dark on the inside and the aroma of hookah flavour adds to its essence. Located conveniently right on the ending of the gariahat flyover, it's a decent place to chill out with your gang.

Been there on the eve of 14th Feb. We had to go there as most of the good places were packed or full, we tried ozora it was full, tried Smoke shack it was also full, Spice kraft had 1.5 Hr waiting, So ultimately landed here. 

Bad experience, really bad experience. Never try their cocktails. Service was the worst here, even the staff didn't know what cocktails contains what and the menu neither mention the ingredients for the cocktails.

Food was OK. Not overwhelming nor disgusting.

And the behavior of the staff was really unacceptable. Just a junior staff was respectful to the customer and was polite and of good behavior.

I had been there last evening with my fiancé . After hearing rave reviews about this place , we had decided to give the place a try. Located in one of the most prime locations in the city , opposite to Pantaloons in Gariahat , it is pretty easily accessible. 
The joint is a 3 storied one with multi level seating available. Also there is a roof top that satiates your open air hookah and drinks craving. 

It sounds very good , but last evening I was really disappointed with the service . The place was not too crowded but still then service was very slow. The waiter had to be reminded 4 times for serving us water. 
Food being served a bit late can be understood owing to prep time but food that is served after almost 15 mins and then it is bland , is not accepted. The Chilli Garlic Rice was totally bland, Thankfully the Devil's Chicken was a saviour as it tasted decent. 
We had also ordered the Hookah which was not UPTO the mark. We have had hookah at a lot of places like Aafraa Lounge, Aqua Java , Raize the Bar etc... So I know a good Hookah. The reason I am unhappy is that it isn't worth the price charged. 

Lastly, we took some parcel from them and when they did charge us for the packing they did not pack the food properly , causing the gravy to spill on the way back. 

It's a sincere request to you to kindly improve on these areas as it helps us to have a memorable experience at your restaurant.

Located right opposite Apollo in Gariahat. 
I've known people who talk highly of the hookah out here. But since I differ from that, I just stick to talking about the section above. 
We had steamed momos- quite basic but greater prices. So definitely not recommended.
Crispy chilli chicken- now I loved this. The only thing which I preferred having here.
And American Chopsuey- decent. 

The only glitch would be the prices. Its just too costly for the most ordinary food here. And if that is ignored, you can very well have a try.

Had been here a while back with an old friend. The name is China Whites. BUT it serves Sheesha on the lower floor and Indian Food (and Chinese) on the upper floor. It's a good thing and a bad. Probably should do something with the name. Because China, in no way tells me or anybody who doesn't know China Whites- about Sheesha or Indian food.

The interiors are okay. Nothing much to talk about. Its a decent place with decent food, ambience, service.

Decent place to have food and drinks. All drinks may not be available at the bar and the food is also pretty average. We stuck to regular Chinese and did not go for any exotic Thai food as we were not sure about the quality. But the noodles and chicken side dish was decent and the mocktail tasted like lemonade. 
If you are shopping in Gariahat and want some good Chinese with drinks, you can definitely stop by here.

The wantons were nicely done,it was crispy and the filling was very tasty. Chicken fried rice and chili chicken was good too. I loved the rice,it was really good but the chili chicken was not upto the mark,it was quite modiocre in taste. I wished i could give it 3.8 or something like that but it isnt available here. So 3.5 for this. Hope to visit this place again.

On our 1st visit at the family section on 2nd floor we had in our mind that the ambience would be so nice like 2nd floor but it failed us with its very very ordinary ambience of rooftop. But still Staffs behaviour is friendly. Service is very quick. Food quality is good. We enjoyed our meal.

Horrible place. Horrible service. Late in bringing everything. Pricey for no reason. The bartender doesn't know how to make long island tea or martini. They can't even make a decent mocktail. We had fruit juices which was spicy. The manager did nothing to solve our problem. Paying about six thousand actually pinched the pocket. Even in the best bars of Kolkata, you will get liit less than 750 rupees. Their liit was only rum. I wouldn't suggest anybody to come here. Only good thing was hookah. Disappointed. My birthday went for a toss. 
P.S. - I wouldn't have given any rating at all but Zomato forced me.

If somebody is looking for some relatively cheap beer and decent food (good quantity and moderately priced food) around Gariahat crossing, this is just the place. We usually sit in their rooftop. The food is nothing special but the dry chilly chicken is pretty good with a sufficient portion size. Overall, ok-ish and recommended for an adda session with friends...

Ambience - Really nice
Location - perfect
Staff - courteous and well trained
Service - Good , but we were the only customer so not the right situation to evaluate.

Now the main part ... FOOD ... as this was my first visit so ordered very basic food ..
Soup - the base which i would assume was brooth was not prepared well i suppose it had too much water in it , so when i was having the soup i was getting a feeling a that i was sipping hot water . But the seafood was there in sufficient quantity . So overall i would rate it average.

Chicken ( Chilly Oyster) - Quantity good ... but preparation was not good at all ... it was not at all oyster sauce it was more of a soya sauce or may be the cook wanted to make a combo of oyster and soya but landed up too much soya which completely killed the oyster. So i would overall rate my chicken preparation poor.

Noodles ( Singapore style) - Noodle was impressive good quantity , well cooked and tasty & light. I was quite impressed with the noodle.

Will visit again and hope the experience will be better with the food next time.

We divided our bill. The amount was 878 each, but the waiter swiped my card and entered 8,878 Nd went away. The owner of this place is extremely ill mannered Nd has an negative attitude. So friends plz be careful with your money wen u r visiting this place.

Sure it's a place for budget hookah and moderate rated alcohol but when it comes to food, this place would disappoint you.

The drums of heaven we ordered were cold, the mixed fried rice was spiceless and bland, the chicken side dish was nothing great, only the noodles were a little better than the other items.

Just for the sake of having alcohol or hookah in the neighborhood, one may opt for this place but the staff is very sweet and well behaved, although very slow

This was my third visit at this restaurant and I really enjoy the food here. The Chinese preparations taste delicious and the ambience is perfect for a sophisticated Chinese restaurant. The courteous behaviour of the staff is a big plus as they make you feel comfortable. The rice and noodles costs a bit too much in my opinion and should come in more varieties. Overall wonderful food and ambience.

Visited on a weekday for some hookah and dinner. Getting a place was easy because it was a weekday. Coming to the hookah, it was not good at all. It was not hitting and there seemed to be no flavour. In food we ordered a Chinese starter and Indian for the main course. Everything was just average including the service. The server kept a bottle of water on the table without any glasses! But the pocket pinch is on the higher side. Cost for 2 was around 1500! The place lacks a good decor, the place has plastic chairs and tables and food is extremely average. Keeping this in mind, the prices are exorbitant. Would definitely not visit again.

Well to start off with this review i would like to say my dearest friend had reviewed and he said its a great place to crash out. So me and my few friends headed off and reached there. Its situated in prime place in the city admist just off the gariahat bridge. Well we sat down in the hookah area in the ground floor and it just kicked in with the ambience they have created out there. Lovely music, along with professional staffs and there knowledge of  food as there menu is huge, so they guided us through the menu and recommended according to our choices. We ordered few starters like prawns and pork dishes. I must say that there serving size is worth the price they offer along with the taste of the dishes. I never tasted that good quality pork they serve and size of the prawns were big which we dont find in many of the restaurants in kolkata. Later, in the dinner we had mix pan fried noodles which i must say that everyone should try that whosoever comes for a meal as it was awesome in taste and it was very filling with lot of exotic vegetables and amount of meat they give with it. The captains recommended a new dish to our palate was fish in chilli wine sauce which turned out to be a table turning dish and i guess we had taken parcel for that dish as well. Finally, coming to an end they offered us to try a very new dessert they had introduced was toffee apple and toffee banana which was too good to compliment on that.

A big thanks to china whites team for making our reunion more special.

Date: 14.09.2016
Time: 9.45-10 PM (approx)

Prelude: The pujo got over in a blink and our group of four chaddi waddi friends wanted to finish the pujo pujo vibe with a bang. So after deciding on lot of bars, we zeroed in on this place. 

Main report:

Location: this place is located close to the gariahat more,  on the opposite footpath of the Pantaloons. One can effortlessly locate it.

Ambience: being the bhasan day and a Friday night at that point of hour , we never thought any of the bars would let us in, but surprisingly this guys did. We went to the rooftop. The weather was cool by that time. A light breeze and obnoxious Bollywood no.s welcomed us in. Comfortable seating arrangements, dimmed lights setup the perfect post pujo ambience. 

Service: after the pujo , almost every restaurant in the city goes in a reboot mode. But, I must appreciate, these guys were spot on. Right from enquiring of our needs, to serving the food in the no time , these guys were never slack.

Drinks and foods:

We all settled for beers and ordered the following:

A hukka: we ordered a pan rasna flavoured hukka. It was perfectly made: flavourful, cold and strong, just the way we liked it.

Chilli, roasted lamb, dry: we ordered 2 plates of this house favourite. This dish was an absolute knock out. Thick slices of lamb tossed in chilli's and Bell pepper were soft as marshmallows. It was perfectly cooked and spiced up and quantity was huge too. It was a ravishing combo with my corona. Infact, I don't remember to have tasted this much tender lamb, before that day.

Pan fried chilli fish: another house favourite, we ordered a plate of this. The dish looked absolutely seductive and again quantity was more than generous. However, it was sweetened extremely. Too much of the sauce and deep fry of the outercoating actually marred the total taste of the fish. I ended up disliking it.

Chilli garlic pepper chicken shreds: this was the worst of the lot. Dry , hard pieces of chicken tossed in an excuse of sauce had no flavour, at all. This is the 1st time I could feel their after pujo lethargy. However, I don't blame them , it was too late.

Cost: thanks to various taxes levied upon us by our central and state government, it'll be 1400 for 2 ppl.

Summary: it's a nice place, cosy, good ambience and more than okayish food! In a place like gariahat and after pujo I don't think I could have asked for any better arrangements.

On a recent visit to Kolkata during the Durga puja's had lunch at this place. Our original choice was to have Bengali cuisine however since most of the restaurants had long waiting queues we opted for this place. Didn't have to wait long to find a seat. We ordered Chicken fried rice, Chicken noodles & Chicken with soya garlic sauce. The food was good even though the pricing was a little towards the higher side considering the quantity that was served. Overall ambience is good but should exhaust a little bit as and when someone orders a sizzler kind of dish the resturant is filled with smoke a feels a little stuffy. The staff is very courteous and good service

China White rarely disappoints you . Unless its middle of the night in Saptami . 
It has a decent variety and decent taste for most of its dishes. Lamb sides are really good . Liquor variety is not great . 
Service : Average Paced 
Must Have : Shredded Lamb Chili Garlic 
Not So Great : Soups are not nice 
Note : 2016 Saptami night we have been delivered stale chicken sides. I have not considered that in this review as that is  Pujo and that happens with even more popular and expensive restaurants  in Pujo .

White Wash!!!

Well if someone asks me about the restaurant,I would say I am washed away deliciously with "china"! First the ambience of the eatery- it's really well seasoned. Clenliness is well maintained from roof to crockery sets-thumbs up. People can try out this place with their family, friends or special one. Comfort zone is well maintained..
Service was little late which is ignorable during rush hour and gets balanced when food arrives! 😉

Now comes the food. Every item was superiorly delicious with Authentic chinese flavour, whether veg or non-veg. People wandering for veg food(including onion) can try out China Whites once. Vegetable spring roll can beat any non-veg starter efficiently. It is difficult to contrast the taste of veg or non veg. Chilli paneer was drool worthy,it gives the feeling of chilli chicken! Vegetable schezwan fried rice was hot, mouth watering. The taste tells itself what real schezwan flavour is! For refreshment, fresh lime soda was really refreshing but would have been excellent if it was little more cold. Cost of the item is little exorbitant.
All in all its a thumbs up for me. Wish to try out some relishing non-veg items someday!

So,I had visited this place just recently. It was my first experience there,nd is definitely the last one. First,I ll be talkng about the hookah. Being a big hookah lover myself,this place didn't excite me at all. The overall taste nd fun of having a hookah wasn't there. As while having hookah,a person would want an AC area,so that they can make "rings" nd other tricks,but none of this is possible as it is open air. Even the coal finished very fast. Now,coming to the food nd drinks section, the drinks are over priced, than other bar-cum-restraunts. The food is also priced a bit high,even though the taste was a bit above average.

This is solely the review of the hookah area and not the restaurant which is located on the 1st floor of the same building.
You want shady?
China whites it is then. Red lights, typical Bollywood music blasting your ears, chairs( of red color) with low lying tables..that's the hookah area of China whites. It is usually comprised of college or school going crowd. The hookah is reasonable here. I had the brain freezer and paan masala flavor. Apart from that they serve you food as well and not just starters but proper main course too( why would anyone have a full course meal at a hookah zone is beyond me...but OK)
Among starters we had dry chili chicken and red pepper chicken. They were quite okay and sufficient in quantity.
We had tried the blue lagoon too which looked pretty. 😛
The staff could be more informative and efficient. They didn't seem to care much 😂

This is located just opposite to Pantaloons gariahat and is a very popular student hangout. I have been coming here for years now.This place has a ground floor serving hookah and food,a bar and restaurant on the first floor and a rooftop restaurant. I have only gone to the ground floor whenever I have visited. The hookah is priced reasonably. It is dimly lit,plays good music at a decent volume and has big TV screens where you can watch cricket and football matches with ease. Have tried a lot of the hookahs available here. Great place for adda sessions over hookah with friends. I like this place :-)

China whites: A student favourite. I have two very serious issues with this place: Firstly: the liquor (especially the beer), it's costly, and I don't drink, but my friends were complaining. The hookah, it's pretty costly as well. The rooftop is the smoking area, but looks very unpolished compared to the rest of the floors.

Secondly the food: If you love Chinese, China Whites is not for you. The taste is overall a little bland for the price they charge. It isn't budget friendly and the menu is pretty confusing. 

Would I go again? I would like to try out their Indian Menu. Maybe that would change my review for the positive.

Out of all the Hookah bars in Kolkata, I have a soft spot for China Whites - not only for the low price, but also for the actual recognizable flavor they provide. This has been a regular Hookah spot for me for many years now. With a nice ambiance, music on the PA and a sports channel always turned on on the TV, China Whites is the place to be at for some quality time with your friends and loved ones. Last time I was here with my girlfriend, we ordered Drums of heaven and Fresh lime soda with our usual Pan Masala flavor hookah. Thank you for a wonderful service.

Last evening, went to this place (after 2years) again,  to spend some time with my sister and saw this place got much better than earlier. 
As it was dry day yesterday(15th aug), we ordered grape flavored hookah, in mocktails we got pink panther and virgin colada. They were getting their restaurant ready for a party in the eve probably that was the reason for a very slow service. Anyhow, the taste of colada was over the top sweet! Pink panther was decent though.
The behaviour of the staff is very good here, just the kind of hospitality you need.
Did not try any food here, as we were already done with our lunch. But the menu was good with newer menu additions, looking forward to visit more often.

Presenting with a calm ambience, the inner section has a decor which diverges somewhat from the usual decorum of a restaurant. Dim lights add charm to it.
Isolated from hustle. Had hookah which was fine.
Kung Pao Chicken and Pan fried mixed noodles was savoury but the the quantity won't be satisfying you. 
All in all, a place that could get one lunch or dinner outta you, at least.

Located just opposite to Gariahat Pantaloons. You'll get Hookah, food and liquor all under same roof! A three storey restaurant : Hookah is served in the ground floor and top floor ( basically, a open terrace)... 1st floor is for fine dining. Food tastes good enough, food items and liquor are fairly priced. Waiter are courteous ! Perfect for casual dining !

Spanned over 3 floors this restrobars has 2 normal AC sitting area and a rooftop sitting area as  well. the speciality of the roof top being...shisha. the ambience is pleasant and the décor simple and charming. This place is more suited for a fine dining rather than a regular hangout zone. But the absolute bumer was the unexpected poor service..we had to repeat our order 4 times and even then we couldn't get it right... the waiter were amicable but kept forgetting one it or the other. Anyways food was good and highlight of the evening was the chelo kebab.

Suggested by one of my close friends, went there for a casual dinner. We chose the roof top for Hookah but it didn't have AC. Luckily it rained that day and the weather was comfortable. Outlet was clean, ambience was not bad although I would have preferred a bit more light over the tables. 

Pan fried chilli fish was awesome, best that I have tasted these days. The chilli chicken(dry), however, had a pinch of extra salt and soya sauce. Noodles and lemon chicken was as per our expectation, doesn't exceed it though. Hookahs were well prepared but the pan rasna flavour tasted more like mint. House staffs were polite but again, gave them nothing not to be.

Opposite to Gariahaat Pantaloons beside flyover this restaurant is divided in 3 parts. Ground floor Hookah place mainly for youngsters. 2 floors above a family restaurant and beside it a bar area for Gents. I been to family place only so other areas I can't say how they are. Though name suggests Chinese food but in this competitive market they have Indian mughlai dishes too. Nice decor. 40-50 seater. Bit costly compared to food quality but that may be it's a bar cum restaurant. Liquors are served in the family sitting too. We ordered Drums of heaven it was pathetic. Chickens were having raw smell and taste. But  along with that we ordered Pan fried chilli fish which was spicy and tasty. Crunchy outside and soft inside. In the main course we had China White Special Fried Rice which was OK. And quantity is bit small for 2 males. As women eat bit less so will be OK for a couple. They have mixed meat rice in the menu too which comes with prawn and chicken only God knows why the name. Then we had chilli Garlic Noodles. With chilli oyster chicken. These were good. We ended with Sweet lime soda. Over all it was ok but prices I felt bit high. For 4 of us the bill was Rs 1800. Food needs to improve.

Located just opposite to Pantaloons this restaurant has three floors, the ground floor being mostly for the hookah people, 2nd floor is a family restaurant and on terrace they have a makeshift arrangement, they play loud music and try to give a lounge effect. Food is good but not great.
Service is slow and inattentive, servers do not take the orders properly and are always in a hurry.

A hookah parlour in the ground floor and a restaurant above, I had some pretty high hopes from this place. A small and cosy restaurant, it has a good ambience. It was quiet and comfortable. The staff was attentive catered to our wants; I can imagine how difficult it probably is to take care of a bunch of young people on their reunion - during durga pujo. The food was good, but not worth the price. What disappointed me was the cocktail. As I've observed with most small restaurants that serve cocktails, the amount to amount of alcohol in the drink was definitely too small to taste or feel any buzz. It wasn't even too great to taste. After the lunch, we went down to the hookah parlour. We had to wait outside for quote some time before we could enter. The inside was horribly crowded and stuffy and noisy, and not in a lively, festive kind of way. We couldn't last 5 mins inside. Altogether, a less than average experience for most part of it.

They gave a well spread out seating area, with a hookah enclosure on the ground floor, a family dining area upstairs and an open air area on the terrace. I have always preferred their open air area on the terrace, be it during the day or at night. 

I love their crab dishes, and the fish ones too. Prices are a little steep, but the place and the food are worth it. However, the service can be an issue at times and they usually take a long time to get the food.

Have been visiting this place for years now. The hookah is great. The food is nice too. Decor and service are fine. Crowd management is notable. Never experienced a hasty service even when we turned up in really big groups. Beer, hookah and good food, all under one roof. We usually order golden fried prawn, spring chicken, crab pepper salt, garlic fish dry and chill garlic lamb dry. Tried mutton boti kebab once. It was good. What I love about the food is their subtle flavours. Neither too oily, nor too spicy, very intricate and nice.

Although renowned for its hookah, China Whites also does serve decent Chinese grub. However , the taste is not exactly top-of-the-range , service is slow and definitely overpriced in relation to the quality. We had ordered veg spring rolls, which were decent enough. The Fried rice and Noodles were below par and the least said the better about the Manchurian chicken. More a place to chill with friends.

This place is located opposite pantaloons in gariahat. This is a very popular hangout spot among the youngsters. The hookah lounge as well as the bar is downstairs. The ambience is amazing and so is the music played here. However, a lot of stuff from the bar menu was unavailable. The food here is decent but nothing extraodinary and kind of costly . I've not tried the hookah but I will :)

Three layers of table offering,this place was one of the earliest Shisha places in the town. At the ground floor they serve hookah followed by the third floor where there is the dining place and the rooftop too. Great place to hang out with friends and have a 'chill scene'.  The ambience & decor is quite good and can be also used for dining out with family.

This place holds a key significance in my life. My mum and dad celebrated their 25th on the rooftop. And I came here with my girl, for our first date. 

The ground floor houses Kolkata's one of the affordable hookah places and the dry chilli chicken is worth a shot. 
The first floor is the place, where you get authentic Chinese.
And then there is the roof top. 

I personally loved the Lat Me Kai, Manchow Soup and the Chef Special Seafood platter. 

The manager is quite receptive along with the staffs who are quite well mannered and courteous enough. 

Would definitely recommend visiting here.

There was no music inside and felt more like a reception or lobby of a hotel . We ordered for a veg steamed Momo which was pathetic and was served without chutney . When asked they brought us some ketchup . Chilly garlic noodles we ordered was not made nicely . All the noodles were broken . We then left with a full stomach but not satisfaction . Will not recommend this place

I have been visiting this place for past 3years. So many times I have been there for their hookah. A very pocket friendly place for the youth to hangout. The ground floor was famous for hookah but recently they have started serving alcohol there as well which is a great thing i believe. They have a family restaurant in the second floor which served really great Chinese food. I loved their noodle and fish recipes. 

Now comes the best part. The roof top. Whoah..... That is some place..... Hookah and booze together and you are allowed to smoke. This is the reason i love rooftop places. 
The staff is well behaved and the place doesn't dig deep into your wallet. For the people around south it is a great place to hangout :)

A very popular hangout and dining option to the south Kolkata locals, China whites is located just opposite Gariahat Pantaloons. They have 3 sectors, the bottom one being the hookah lounge ,the middle dining area mostly for the family and a aptly lit rooftop seating arrangement. With mild oriental music in the background and a nice décor the middle family area suits. Sort of liked the place. Ambience is nice. People were very polite. Food is yummy enough. Quantity and quality of the food is quite good. Rice is so tasty and light.

A calm, quite shady place shut out from the outside world of noices and busy traffic, with minimalistic Chinese decor offering both Chinese and Indian cuisine, an apt getaway after trudging along the Gariahat footpaths under the scorching sun in summer or after a shopping spree in nearby Pantaloons. We'd had veg hakka noodles and chicken reshmi butter masala with Kashmiri pulao. Food was quite tasty and appetising. If one's looking for some quite eating experience, then this should be one of the places to be in the city amidst the serene tranquility away from the hustle and bustle outside.

I really liked how they decorated the place with beautiful lights and pictures of sakura blooms! Really pretty!
The staff was really nice and courteous! 
Coming to the food,we had pan fried chilli prawns for starter, which tasted pretty good. The prawns were nicely cooked .
Then we had veg fried rice and tai chin chicken(in black sauce),which also tasted good. 
The best part was the dessert! We had darsaan,which comes with some crispy and sweet ribbon noodles,along with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.
A really good place to have some tasty chinese food !

LOCATION:

Main Gariahat under the flyover. If you are coming from golpark just walk towards pantaloons and keep an eye out on the left side. Its a complete 3 storied building with a huge red sign.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

China White's has been around for a while. It serves comfort chinese food and they have just ventured into Indian Cuisine. The ground floor houses the hookah parlor, the second floor houses the restaurant and the roof top has a terrace bar come hookah parlor. 
The interiors are pleasant. Don't go expecting much and you wont get disappointed.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for a round of regular drinks. They were served promptly with a helping of chanachur which is the typical thing in Kolkata.

We called for a helping of the Chicken in Garlic Pepper which was the best dish of the evening. It was well balanced and the chicken was well cooked. The Pepper was not overpowering but was still there to be tasted. The Manchow Soup was a disappointment. It had too much soya sauce which made it more sour than it should have been. Also, I think they got the flavor of the dish wrong. We also called for a helping of chilli babycorn. The babycorn was well fried but the sauce was too sweet which masked the flavor of the roasted chilli paste it should have had.

For mains, we had normal chilli chicken, Vegetable Manchurian and chilli garlic noodles. Chilli Chicken and Manchurian was alright but the Chilli Garlic Noodles was sweet and tasted of ketchup which was a complete "no no!". We asked for it to be redone which they did but it did not tick the boxes. Service was ok. 

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

They need to revamp their interiors. I found it to me morose and old. Also, there were so many people who were walking through the restaurant to get to the hookah cafe upstairs making noise which disturbed us. I am sure they can come up with a way where direct access to the terrace cafe can be made.

VERDICT:

A good one time visit. But they will need changes for the place to have repeat value!

Visited the place during Durga Puja.  You can imagine the craze and queue for food at that time.  But even at that time,  we could enjoy the tasty food and awesome beverages in that cozy atmosphere.  The ambience is wonderful. The restaurant is well decorated.  The cocktails were really enjoyable. Chinese dishes were well cooked and tasty. Service was very nice even at that time.  As a whole, nice experience.

A calm, quite shady place shut out from the outside world of noices and busy traffic, with minimalistic Chinese decor offering both Chinese and Indian cuisine, an apt getaway after trudging along the Gariahat footpaths under the scorching sun in summer or after a shopping spree in nearby Pantaloons. We'd had veg hakka noodles and chicken reshmi butter masala with Kashmiri pulao. Food was quite tasty and appetising. If one's looking for some quite eating experience, then this should be one of the places to be in the city amidst the serene tranquility away from the hustle and bustle outside.

I really liked how they decorated the place with beautiful lights and pictures of sakura blooms! Really pretty!
The staff was really nice and courteous! 
Coming to the food,we had pan fried chilli prawns for starter, which tasted pretty good. The prawns were nicely cooked .
Then we had veg fried rice and tai chin chicken(in black sauce),which also tasted good. 
The best part was the dessert! We had darsaan,which comes with some crispy and sweet ribbon noodles,along with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.
A really good place to have some tasty chinese food !

LOCATION:

Main Gariahat under the flyover. If you are coming from golpark just walk towards pantaloons and keep an eye out on the left side. Its a complete 3 storied building with a huge red sign.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

China White's has been around for a while. It serves comfort chinese food and they have just ventured into Indian Cuisine. The ground floor houses the hookah parlor, the second floor houses the restaurant and the roof top has a terrace bar come hookah parlor. 
The interiors are pleasant. Don't go expecting much and you wont get disappointed.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for a round of regular drinks. They were served promptly with a helping of chanachur which is the typical thing in Kolkata.

We called for a helping of the Chicken in Garlic Pepper which was the best dish of the evening. It was well balanced and the chicken was well cooked. The Pepper was not overpowering but was still there to be tasted. The Manchow Soup was a disappointment. It had too much soya sauce which made it more sour than it should have been. Also, I think they got the flavor of the dish wrong. We also called for a helping of chilli babycorn. The babycorn was well fried but the sauce was too sweet which masked the flavor of the roasted chilli paste it should have had.

For mains, we had normal chilli chicken, Vegetable Manchurian and chilli garlic noodles. Chilli Chicken and Manchurian was alright but the Chilli Garlic Noodles was sweet and tasted of ketchup which was a complete "no no!". We asked for it to be redone which they did but it did not tick the boxes. Service was ok. 

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

They need to revamp their interiors. I found it to me morose and old. Also, there were so many people who were walking through the restaurant to get to the hookah cafe upstairs making noise which disturbed us. I am sure they can come up with a way where direct access to the terrace cafe can be made.

A very popular hangout and dining option to the south Kolkata locals, China whites is located just opposite Gariahat Pantaloons. They have 3 sectors, the bottom one being the hookah lounge ,the middle dining area mostly for the family and a aptly lit rooftop seating arrangement. With mild oriental music in the background and a nice décor the middle family area suits the best during the hot summers however when we are in the mood for some hookah we opt for the rooftop seating. We mostly go for the finger foods along with a chilled beer and hookah and never really tried any of their main course. However amongst the finger foods, the chicken drumsticks goes the best and for veg options we stick to the crispy chilli potatoes. Service is very prompt all the time and very well trained. Recommended for both family dining and after office/college booze sessions in a descent budget.

Been to this joint quite a number of times, yesterday we went for a dinner at rooftop. The place is awesome with rooftop restrobar. An amazing ambiance that steals the majority of the rating for this restora. The foods are really good with a great piece of hospitality. All in all a decent, pleasant experience and the stressbuster romantic rooftop...

This place has been around from my high school days at South Point. Although being very close to my school, I didn't visit it until now. 
Now this restaurant has two floors + a rooftop. 
I went to the rooftop directly. 
The decor is simple.  Nothing much to say about it here, other than the fact that the view from rooftop looks nice. In the evening specially. 

Food:  Serves Indian and Chinese.  We ordered a Teen Paan Hookah and a chilli babycorn starter to go with it. Alcohol prices are steep. The hookah was strong and the babycorn spicy and crisp.  They give a free coal change too. 
To summarise, It's a nice place to hangout with a group of friends.

Not easy to locate ... But once you get there you are bound to love it ... Checked it out today .. Ordered Tuborg strong with crispy chilli babycorn followed by Chelo Kebab ... Loved the babycorn preparation .. Chelo Kebab also tasted well but not as good as the one you get in Peter Cat .. Ambience is soothing .. Staffs were prompt and courteous ... & it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket so to say ... Costed me around ₹850 for everything .... Only downside is lack of variations in starters ... Overall a very good experience & thumbs up to the management .. Keep up the good work ..

Have been to this place, a lot of times. One of the few places which serves food food, as well as hookah and good stacked bar. In the last visit, had beer, breezers. From food, we had burnt garlic fried rice, noodles, mandarin fish, chilly chicken, sliced chicken with Vegetables.
Rice and noodles, both equally good! 
Chilly chicken is tad bit spicy but the fish preparation is rightly balanced.

Hookahs in open air is such a pleasure. China Whites located near to Garia more offers an excellent rooftop dining. This one has a huge space inside, where dining is divided into several floors. Dining & rooftop sittings are nicely decorated.

About foods they have a lot to choose from. I had tried their Hakka Noodles & some other Chicken side dishes with it. However I didn't liked their food quality & quantity at all. The noodles were very thick & very lite. Where the Chicken dishes were somehow manageable. The prices for the foods seems very high as per their quality & quantity of food, but if counted their dining & rooftop sittings the prices somehow fulfills it.

A recent regular here. 
It's located just opposite to Pantaloons in Gariahat. Ambience is not that good. But coming to the food, the Chinese items are pretty good and well served. They serve huge quantity. The pan-fried noodles, special fried rice , egg-wrapped fried rice ,tsing hoi chicken were tasty. The Mongolian Chicken was disastrous though! 
Food + alcohol + hookah within budget. Overall its a good place to visit, specially on happy hours!

It's so bad. The food was just horrible plus seems really expensive when it comes to the quality. The interior isn't bad but the most important thing that is the food is really bad. The drums of heaven was like drums of hell, and then the gravy of Manchurian was like water and horrible and then the noodles was really not even worth eating. Trust me a waste of money.

We sat on the roof top. 
Ordered Tandoori items as well as Chinese cuisine. 
Was very much satisfied with food except for CHICKEN HAKKA CHOW which was completely bland. 
Rest of the items were superb. 
Hookah and millers was definitely a good combination. 
Staff attitude was upto the mark.

Had been there on one of my Friend's birthday. Since we were a group of 9, they asked us to avail their rooftop service.
'Rooftop' has always been interesting and pleasant to my ears. However when we went there, it was yuck ! It looked like a simple rooftop of any residential house, so it wasn't impressive at all.

However we had ordered hookah, the staffs were so untrained, one of my friends had helped him to make sure whether it has been made properly. How weird !
Since then, we had decided to leave as at every step, we had disappointments.
But as a matter a courtesy, we ordered some food which was again horrible.
Thus it was not appealing at all.

Hope to have some positive changes coming up.

We go there 2nd time yesterday for pre valentine celebration. 
1. We asked for Budweiser but sadly(surprising and disappointing too) it was not available. The waiter suggested Miller's.. thankfully it tastes good.
2. We ordered Chicken Sesame as starters. It was soft and tender but I'm not overwhelmed with the tastes.
3. We also ordered Special Mix Meat fried rice and Devil's Fish in main course. Both was outstanding in terms of taste and quantity.(4.5 out 5)
4. Last but not the least Blue Riband Gin accompanied the main course(specially for her)
5. Pocket pinch : 1443 including all taxes(Slightly on higher side).
Overall a good experience... !!

I have been visiting China Whites for a pretty long time, but today I was very disappointed at their service, attitude and management. We were a group of 7, and at the end they charged us for mineral bottles, though we received bottles which were not sealed and also we did not order the same. We ordered normal water. Mr. Malay Sen , the so-called manager was adamant that we had ordered the bottles, which we had not. For a bill close to Rs. 10,000 we will never mind paying Rs. 100-200 extra for the bottles but their behaviour was a definite let down. I along with my friends will never again visit this place because they should learn how to treat their valued customers.

China Whites, Gariahat. Same building as Balaram Saha. Located on the Western flank of the Gariahat flyover, beside GKB opticals.

Has an excellent rooftop seating with a closed roof. Lighting and music are average. Drinks a little on the expensive side. Which is fair, given the prime location. 

a hot and happening place on the weekends. If you do not get a rooftop seat. there is an indoor restaurant (and bar, of course). 

Hookahs & Smoking (cigarettes :*) allowed on the rooftop section. Reservation recommended. 

Recommended? YES
Will I visit again? CERTAINLY. I visit regularly.

Got acquinted with this place during my school days. We mostly visited the 1st floor for a drink and great chinese. Service is perfect on the 1st floor. However the ground floor that serves hookah, has rude staff. They have some terrible rule that you can't sit without a coal change after 30mins. There are far better hookah joints so just grow up China Whites! :)

4 points only for the restaurant on 1st floor.

A  Wednesday evening with some childhood friends. Mood for Chinese and adda!.. Had heard about China whites, but was uncharted territory for all of us. Quite spacious.the rooftop seating arrangement is quite a draw. Courteous staff and prompt service. Lots of options in Chinese cuisine. Had ordered 'hunan fish' which stood out amongst the other dishes. The chilli garlic noodles was quite tasty too. Might seem a bit pricey. Hence if On a tight budget one could avoid drinks\hookah,and go full throttle at the food instead. That won't be a disappointment.

Now few months back, they also brought the bar section along with the hookah part.. Initially, people were not allowed to have hookah, after drink, now they can booze and smoke, a bold move and a great one, hoping the crowd don't get over excited!! :P ;)

In the heart of Gariahat, this place is one of the best restaurants for Chinese. Last Saturday, I had a small house party and we decided to call for some food.
The delivery was quick and pipping hot. The quantity per item is good enough for 3 people. Try out the prawns and mixed fried rice. Reasonably priced and value for money. Recommended!!

Was quite excited about the rooftop ambiance when the plan was made. However, they have messed with the feel totally. The roof was entirely covered. The food was good though. What we ordered:
1.) Tandoori aloo- good in taste,but extremely less in quantity for what they charge ( picture attached).
2.) Crispy chilly babycorn- average in taste, a little more inclined towards the sweeter side. Again, less quantity for what they charge.
3.) Pindi channa- good in taste, but I've had much better before.
4.) Sabz jhalfrezi- pretty decent, tastiest of the lot. Perfectly spiced, aptly spicy.
5.) Breads including butter naan and masala kulcha, both were served totally cold and nothing was done about it. So that pretty much killed the experience for us. Plus, we were not told about the last order and we were denied more breads. So we had to leave our meal in the middle. Overall, an okayish experience for the prices they charge, nothing great about the quality that they can boast of.

We visited this place last Saturday night, 12th Dec 2015, ordered spring roll and mixed hakka noodles. We regret to share here that our experience was disappointing and far below expectation!! While the spring roll was below average, hakka chow was half-cooked, vegetables were almost raw, no trace of egg/chicken. we asked to redo it, they just re-heated and came back. Service quality and staff present that evening was poor too!! 
To top it all, while coming down the lift WAS NOT WORKING! We got stuck on the 1st floor and had to literally scream and shout for HELP till we got out after almost 25-30minutes!! They knew there was a problem with the lift still no "Notice" or sticker put up anywhere...they are allowing customers to use the lift. What a trauma it was. 
Pls be aware folks!

prices are very high.. frst time i went there wd my family and ordered fr gravy noodles and a side dish..quantity is poor. I went there for  second time with my friends.. we were really surprised soon aftr seeing the menu card ,as its prices donot match the zomato menu card..alcohol prices are high..the basic drwbck is prices are unnecessarily high in comparison to the quantity...

Its my first time in this restaurant. It was my family day during puja. Me n my cousins don't want to go for pandal hopping but to sit n eat. So they told me to go here. Decor is nice. They had a lift n like it .
We ordered drums of heaven and pan fried chilli fish as starters. Drums of heaven was ok ok. Fish was too good. it was soft juicy n full of flavours. We liked it so much that we ordered one more plate. Yum yum.
Next for main course chicken fried rice ,mongolian chicken and crab in chilli oyster sauce were ordered. We ordered three plates of fried rice. All were chicken. But when the waiter was serving I noticed that one plate has chicken other two donot have. I told the waiter. He took them back n return chicken fried rice. Rice was very dry as if no oil was used at all.
Both the side dishes were average. Nothing much.
I will suggest to try their pan fried chilli fish.. it was yummm

Last went during Pujas when they surged an additional 50% on the bill, a bit overboard if you ask me. Anyway, the hookah is average while the food is just ordinary. They do serve alcohol so it makes for an excellent place to unwind with a few friends.

When u r visiting china whites..always go for the terrace. Up there its a nice ambience and u'll kind of have a romantic feel of course if u r with ur special one. Though i was not there with sum1 of that sort still i felt so :P . neways food is good. Dry chilli chicken was of good taste. But quantity is where u would find urself cheated. The quantity they serve is too less. Hookah is average. And drinks are priced equally as any other bar cum restaurant.

HOOKAH BAR Review (ground floor)....
Ambience-it's good..but girls do shout a lot ;)...

Service-excellent. I loved it....

Location-easily accessible. Very convenient....

We had d brain freezer flavor with water base. It was good. And I don't think the time restriction exists.. Neither the 20 mins nor the 45 mins.. And it's pocket friendly..

As we met up near Gariahat Crossing,the excitement among us was almost palpable. With only a few days left for Durga Puja, you could literally feel the atmosphere charged with tension,anticipation and enthusiasm of the last minute puja shopping.We literally had to push through the crowd to get to a place we have heard a lot about from our friends- China Whites.We were on a very dedicated mission-get some hookah and great food. 
Seconds after the order was placed,the hookah arrived.And I fell in love with the "Brain Freezer". Though the food arrived after what seemed like eternity- Chicken Fried Momo and Crispy Chilli Babycorn.Even though the momos were a bit over-fried,but still delicious. But the Babycorn wasn't up to the mark at all.They were supposed to be crispy but somehow ended up being not crispy at all.I think the word I could use to describe that dish perfectly would be "lame".
The food was a bit overpriced considering the quality.But I do not have a thing to complain about the hookah.It was cold,smooth and perfect-just how it should be.
P.S- I liked the songs they played.
P.P.S- You can smoke here even if you buy your fags from outside.

Came across this place as a recommendation from one of my friend. An average place to hangout with friends. Usually emphasize more on hookahs which offer you flavors at a cheaper rate. However, much effort is not taken to improve the flavour( they mix pipe of all flavours with all other flavours ). Even the restaurant along with is moderate and serves average food in terms of taste.
Visit this place if you wanna hangout with friends and are on a budget.

The location is convenient. Its not a huge resturant but a medium bar cum resturant. We were sitting in the bar area bcz the resturant is in the rooftop without ac. We ordered hookah,the flavour wasnt good enough though it was my first time. But the hopkah was wuite cheap,we had one for 5 people. Drinks r very expensive. The ambience was okok. The waiters weren't professional at all.

To food. Veg fried rice,hakka noodles,schezuan chicken,chilo chicken were being ordered. The quantity was too little in respect to many resturants. The food was very ok nt good at all. And the chili chicken was floating in salt. Even one of us chocked from the salt. We gave back and they said they will cook fresh fr us. The later was nt same but almost same. 

Now coming to bill. They charge us twoce gor the chili chicken. Wow! But smhow they made a new bill again. So please check ur bill bfr leaving you never know. 

My personal opinion go for hookah but never for food in there please!!!! Im nvr going there ever 😁

Just opposite Pantaloons, Gariahat China White's is a place which serves Indian,Chinese, Drinks as well as hookah! The hookah is in the first floor and the second floor is the restaurant. Drinks are cheap and hence China White's is a great place to go with friends! The food is great. Good quantity, though I feel the Chinese is a tad bit better. Never had their hookah so can't comment on that. The service is a bit slow. Overall good location, okayish prices , good food and there is something for each and every one. One of the better places to hang out in Gariahat!

Short Story : Bad For Hookah only visit. Not recommended.  

Now if your'e interested, here's the reason for the above 'verdict' :  

Went to this place after maybe 4 years (!) on Nabami evening (last thursday). I remember the place having a much better ambiance back in the days, but now, a lot has deteriorated. We sat in the 'outer room'. The tables were lower than the chairs, this made seating really uncomfortable, especially for the girls trying to sit cross-legged.We didn't go for the food, only Hookah, and as a hookah bar only, the place was a big disappointment. The lighting was way too bright. They could have made the place a bit more dimly lit, with small ambient lights etc. And finally coming to the hookah, it still costs almost the same as it used to (around 250 back in school/early college days), but the quality isn't anything to recommend. Flavor didn't last much, and the table(again the table) being so low meant you had to lean forward to puff. Not very comfortable. So, yeah, if you are only looking for a place to puff some Hookah, I won't recommend this at all.

First things first. This restro is NOT RECOMMENDED. Ambiance - good, service- pretty quick, quality of food- very good, quantity of food- pathetic. And finally prices charged- sky high. We ordered 3 vrg hakka chowmein and one fish in Mongolian sauce and one chicken in Szechuan sauce. Side dishes were undoubtedly very good. But they served 3 plates of veg hakka noodles in one container. One look at it and you could tell that the quantity was pathetic. We had to order more to satiate our hunger and that was precisely what they wanted. However this is not what a customer expects n that too from a well known name like China whites. I was shocked and disappointed. Never going back again and will never recommend to friends and relatives. And again I felt prices were too much. Plus tax obviously. Much better restros are available in and around gariahat which provide better service quality food at reasonable price. Hated it.

China White's takes overpricing to a whole new level. The food was good but nothing exceptional. If someone criticises me for my bad review only because of overpricing, then please visit the place and see if you can find any justification for charging so much for the average environment, average food, the really bad quantity and the level of service that I'd expect from any renowned restaurant.   

But also I must say that the hookah was good and it didn't take long for our food to be served although some waiter complained because my friend had his girlfriend lay her head over his shoulder (god knows why). Bottom line: I don't mind paying that much for an exceptional piece of service, which they did not offer.

Today we went there for lunch and it was crowded. The decor is simple and good. The staffs are well behaved but the serivice is very slow. Food is very average not that good. We ordered chicken hakka noodles,mix fried rice,schezuan chicken and mongolian chicken. The pieces of chicken wrre very small and the vegetables of noodles were undercooked. Quantity is not satisfying at all. The price is pocket friendly.

Went to this place yesterday for a get together with old buddies.. we had opted for the rooftop seat .. the ambience seemed good at the first place.. but we were given a corner seat with no fans nearby.. the place started becoming quite stuffy and hot after a while .. the hookah was good but we thought the smoke was comparitively less.. we had ordrred a margharita which was good, the long island ice tea was very bad , tequila sunrise was okay-ish .. the food i would say was okay types.. we ordered crispy chilli babycorn which was quite good.. but the pepper chicken was a disaster.. egg wrapped fried rice was good.. butter garlic prawns were quite bland to taste.. the hunan chicken was also not too good.. food quality needs to be improved.. overall a good place to hangout but no big expactations from the food..

They are now opening a bar provision downstairs on the hookah zone. Anyways we went up the restaurant and ordered four breezers and chicken fried rice along with a chicken side dish. The rice was very good but the chicken was certainly not upto the mark. Anyways we got a discount...yehhhhh!!!! The ambience is calm and friendly.

I have been here for a couple of times and I like this place and their service is good. Firstly the place is made to appear serene with the abundance of white. The place was clean every time I visited and like I mentioned before, the services were good. With respect to the food firstly I should like to state that the starters must be explored, I can vouch for the fact that most of them will be enjoyed. Secondly the pan-fried items on the menu are also quite delicious. Thirdly perhaps the most important criterion for me is that the toilets are clean, tidy and well-maintained.
This restaurant should be treated as a good option to address your hunger en route a destination. You can stop here in and have a wholesome meal. The prices are pretty cheap so that college-goers can likewise afford the bills here. I always like to go to this place when I am around Gariahat.

China white has a very good ambiance with marvelous inner decor. This place is huge ,you must visit the upper 2nd floor if you want restaurant dine in segment because lower portion is for hookah. I would definitely say that staffs are very very polite and helpful. Foods were average but not bad but I would definitely say again about the staffs behavior,thy are so down to earth that I am very very impressed. I would suggest to every restaurant waiters of other restaurants should visit this place to learn that how they serve each and every customer with great care.

I had heard a lot about this place ohmygod the reviews are so misleading. The place is very very very ordinary. The food isn't great , the place isn't that great. It's below satisfactory all in all.
Recommended: Do not order the salt and pepper mushroom, it makes no sense, it's a doughy mushroom skin fritter with no mushroom flavour whatsoever. The Thai green curry is pretty good though , its not a Thai green curry like it should be but it's a nice curry still.
Thumbs up: They serve alcohol! ( so you can probably drink away the pain that the food causes you )

Went for Saturday dinner cocktail party with old time buddies!
I selected the place by checking it in Zomato, and it has lived up to our expectation and on items it has gone beyond the expectation! A great place to hang out with friends and family! We sat on the 2nd floor dinning area, with very subtle decor inside and moody lighting! Very relaxing indeed, only a suggestion like they could bring in couches instead of chairs, though chairs were pretty comfy!
They have a roof too seating arrangement as well, with music! Nice one for friends to hangout with!
Food - we ate a lot ranging from Chinese to Indian. And I must say the food quality, tastes are great for both the cuisines!
Exceptionally good are the following items-
Back pepper chicken, fish tikka kababs, chicken kali mirch kababs!
Prompt service, good food and ambience make this a recommended place.

I had visited this restaurant few times with my family. You can enjoy your meal in fresh air i.e. on the rooftop or in closed Air Conditioned room. Both has a charm of its own. If you interested in hookah then rooftop is the place whereas for decent and peaceful ambiance I will suggest the Air Conditioned Room. Here Chinese and Indian Cuisines are available. Generally we order Chinese. In Starters we order Crispy Chilly Potato which is very crunchy types, Drums of Heaven which soft and delicious,Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken which is little hot. In Rice we order Burnt Ginger Fried Rice which is different from normal fried rice and in Noodles Cantonese Mixed Noodle. In side dish we order Chilly Chicken and Chilly Paneer very hot and mouth watering. The service is good and the staffs are friendly. I would like to visit this place again when I get opportunity.

Me with my partner, went on a shopping spree at Gariahat. After 3 hrs of tiring endeavor, we visited this much celebrated joint. Initial impression about the entrance was not overwhelming. Neither the entry point, nor the lift gave a feeling worth remembering.

Anyhow once entering, it was a much better feeling. Nice soothing white ambiance, excellent service, and comfortable seating arrangements.

1. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup : Good quantity, split 1:2 . Quite tasty. I really love sweet corn, and it is one of the better ones I have had in recent times.

2. Mixed Meat Noodles: Being a die-hard fan of Hakka Noodles served at Beijing, China Town, I must say this would give a close run for its money. Filled with chunks of meat and prawn this was really tasty.

3. Tofu & Chicken in Chilly Oyster Sauce: I asked them to make it semi-dry, but actually it contained loads of gravy. If this is semi-dry, I wonder what exactly is the normal one. Anyhow, it was not an outstanding dish per-se, but not bad either.

Overall I would like to recommend this place, because it offers good quality food at reasonable rates, and considering the rush in Hataari at any time of the day, this can be good alternative.

Absolutely perfect to drop in with friends. They serve everything starting from various flavours of hookah to drinks. When it comes to food, they serve chinese as well as indian. Food quality, decor and ambience is upto the mark. The staffs are polite too. Starters are tasty af. Recommended.

I have been visiting this place since my college days for the hookah section . I always loved their momos and wantons. Today i went there with some of my friends and went to the rooftop.
our order were : chicken momo, crispy chicken and american chopsuey. We ordered paan rasna and lime sodas next. Paan rasna was good. I would recommend brain freezer if you want to go high  . 
P.s. they have north indian cuisine too.

This place offers you good Chinese food along with drinks and hookah at reasonable rates. The ambience and the service is good and they have separate places for hookah and alcohol. I personally love the seating arrangement on the roof which only serves food and alcohol whereas the hookah is served downstairs in the lounge and the restaurant is located on the third floor!. I have tried the drums of heaven, kung pao chicken/fish, steamed momos and the quality and quantity of the dishes are good. They have a pretty good collection of liquor and this place is a big hit among youngsters! :-)

Ambience is like as if sitting with below poverty line people. Sheesha is worst. Staffs are non corporative and rude towards customers. Though bar is fine and a decent place to be in. The visit reminds of a blunder mistake of even thinking to test such a low profile place. I would have ranked 0 out of 5 if zomato would have the ranking scale of so.

Nice place to have Chinese if you are near Gariahat. Situated diagonally opposite to Pantaloons, the entrance might seem a little crumpled (the lift too). Try the pan-fried chilli fish, egg-wrapped fried rice and the chicken side dishes... Awesome and pocket friendly.

china whites - located a lil bit diagnally opposite to pantaloons in gariahat area....offers food...hookah...music & alcohol. have been there many times earlier. dey serve quite tasty food wd good unchokable hookah wd diff flavours.... BUT .. my only reason of giving this place such less ratings- is there ambience & staff which just sux. being a regular customer- a prsn is not allowed there 2 comment on the crowd coming there. eventualy ven this place started...it ws too good 2 be given good rating...but as much as its getting its desrvd hype...d crowd & d ambience along wd the staff has bcum totally cheap. skul going kids come & take hookah....den vomit there...fall down...create scenes...& still the management rather dan taking strict actions...allows the school kids to come n have hookah even for longer period...& f8 wd other customers coz they are complaining abt ths. 
all in all a good place - depends - what type of ambience one is comfortable in.

China Whites is located just opposite to the gariahat pantaloons. I have visited this place with my college friends.It's a nice place and easy to locate.We tried crispy chicken and fried prawn in starters. Crispy chicken was delicious and delightful. Prawn was also fantastic. In main courses we ordered chilli garlic fried rice and Hunan chicken. Fried rice was excellent in taste and Hunan chicken was amazingly tasty and also mouthwatering.They also have a bar,contains plenty of drinks. 
Ambience is appealing and pleasant. Staffs are well behaved.It was a wonderful experience.

Yesterday five of us went for a hang out here. They have sitting options spreaded over 3 floors. We chose to go to the rooftop. The view of kolkata at night is just wow! We ordered for chicken tandoori, pan fried chilli fish, lat me kai n garlic mushroom (dry) along with alcohol. Mushroom was really delicious, but rest of the items were so so. We ordered 'pun thunder' flavored hookah which was really good and refreshing. It complemented the alcohol perfectly. The ambience was good. Staffs were co-operative and patient. We went for tequilla shots in the end. Cheque was pocket friendly too...... 1200 per head only. Overall, a nice place in the midst of busy gariahat. A real chance of improvement still lies there, especially in the starter section. As we didn't taste main dishes, I can't comment right now. Sorry for that.

It feels great having hookah, bar and food all together. Honestly this is my first time at there. Heard a lot about this place. I did not get to see their rooftop. I wished to. badly.

Located: opposite gariahat pantaloons, 2minutes from gariahat more. 

I found the smoking area with live sports screening very short. I dont like cram full smoking space. Ambience of this place could not satisfy me at all. Their prompt service is notable. We had to rush, so this time we missed the rooftop. They literally saved our time with their quick service. 

Besides hookah, they serve equally good starters at the ground floor. When food came i jumped over the food and my mates concentrated on hookah. They seemed very excited with blueberry. Well, me too. 

Budget just as they mentioned that is more or less 800 for two people.  

Will hit another day, This time maybe rooftop.

It is located near Gariahat Pantaloons. the place is spacious and the interior is good. The Manchow soup was really tasty but the drums of heaven was very disappointing as it was full of batter and hardly any chicken. I had ordered for a tuti fruity small and it was only made with pineapples and there was no other fruits. Please try to improve on these two . Otherwise service is very prompt and behaviour of the waiters are very good. Cost is on the expensive side.

The location is next to Prapti or M.P. Jewellers and opposite to Pantaloons near Gariahat crossing.There are three levels in this establishment. The ground level serves hookah. The restaurant on the second floor is family restaurant and bar and then a staircase leads to a covered terrace which and serves hookah and drinks. We visited the family restaurant and went for quick food. The food is well prepared and the quantity is ok for two if both are not hungry enough or eats light. The price is pretty high for the type of restaurant. The service is good and the staff behaved courteous.Since I am a local, the high prices owing to the location doesn't entice me much. There are better cost to quality restaurants around. But if someone wants to enjoy drinks and hookah then this is a good place.

Staff-horrendous. Ambience-horrible. Crowd-cheap.
Extremely disappointed in this outlet. The Menu shows a Water Based Hookah as 400 and an Energy Drink Based Hookah priced as the same. I fail to understand how that is remotely possible. This does not end here. Apparently the menu is a "mistake" and the price is 500,as said by the waiter. This is ridiculous. Either they were trying to cheat us or they were that dumb to not change the menu prices. Other high end hookah parlours have a lower price rate than China Whites which is practically a chicken coop. Terrible experience.

A favourite place of mine to chill with friends over some drinks, hookah n good food. They have it all. There are 3 sections and each section is equally spacious, and then there is a roof-top area which is my favourite. The place is extreme airy and they play good music which sets the mood for a great evening. Pan Fried Fish is a regular order for me and my friends there in starters alongwith Crispy chicken, Momos etc. Main course items are good too. They make some good cocktails and mocktails as well. Hookah is very well made and dsnt choke. Go a little early if you want to sit at the roof-top on weekends. Little on the expensive side, but China Whites is definitely  worth a visit with.your friends and loved ones.

Though I don't quite like Chinese food, visited this restaurant to try something different. The experience, thankfully, is worth sharing. We ordered hakka and cantonese noddles. While there was nothing new in hakka, Cantonese noddles raised the bar. The mix of vegetables in this noddles surely tempt any veg lover. In addition, the ambience was nice , the stuffs were hospitable and the price was light on wallet. Overall good experience.

The staff is quite courteous and hospitable.
The dining area is very well decorated and had good interiors.
Coming to the food , we ordered Lat me kai along with breezers to start with. For the mocktails we had bloody Mary...... Its just awesome and a must-try.
Then for the main course we had Hunan chicken with chilli garlic noodles, a great combination, a treat to the taste buds..
Overall it was a good experience......

An utter disappointment. The earlier taste has completely disappeared. Though the ambience and the hospitality is still top notch the food itself is bland and disappointing. We ordered drums of heaven and crispy chilli mushroom both of which had a underwhelming taste. 

We then proceeded to try the Indian cusine. The food though comparably better still lacked the kick. The naans were crispy though. Everything else had an overpowering ingredient.

It was more so a disappointment because of the exorbitant charges which left our wallets empty and our heart craving for more.

How come i never visited this place before...not that i am over the moon with the food or drinks but the open terrace ambience is indeed very nice and wat more, you can still enjoy it on a rainy day due to the sheds above...thats what we did exactly....the price is on the higher side with a 60ml drink coming up to about 360 with taxes and a starter close to about 300 bucks but the service is quick and efficient even on a sunday evening when it was full....if you dont mind to shed a few bucks extra, its worth a visit....dont have much to write since we just ordered a couple of chinese starters along with drinks and the food tasted good and obviously nothing can go wrong with bottled drinks...i wish they keep more variety of 650ml beer bottles which probably is the only grievance i have....

The place is pocket friendly, that said dont take your business delegatea there, its just a notch below for it. The food is good, try their crab based items, it should be good, course if you are a non vegetarian 😊...staffs are friendly and responsive...located very conviniently..ideal joint for south Kolkata...

China whites is located in Gariahat opposite to pantaloons.

We went and took our seat on the terrace since the weather was good and we wanted both drinks and hookah.

We ordered for the gum supari hookah and whiskey. Hookah was good and nothing can ever go wrong with whiskey.

But then we ordered food which was not at all good. We had ordered the lat mae kai and chicken chilly garlic fried rice. Both of them were very bland and not at all appetising. So we called the manager and asked him that we had ordered for the chilli garlic rice whereas the one we were served was neither chilli nor garlic. He did not agree with us and kept arguing. Eventually he took it and said il get it rectified. Too much harassment over a plate of rice. Then we called for the schezwan noodles which was decent but the mushrooms that we ordered was again so bad I can't even explain. Nonetheless we finished our food somehow and called for the bill.

The place is definitely light on the pocket as our bill was only 2350 for 4 of us including couple of drinks for all and hookah. I hope they improve their food quality else going here is not a good option.

Later the dishes took time.We took chicken chilli garlic noodles, golden fried prawns, fish chilli wine, garlic pepper chicken, chicken momo, and allong with that smirnoff and BP.
chilli garlic noodles was no doubt very good. golden fried pawns were not good. fish chilli wine was avg typ.the smell of fish was not there at all. garlic pepper chicken was very good and chicken momo was not extraordinary but was good.
Total was 3793/-. I think according to the taste its ok.A bit overpriced. But some dish tastes should be improved. liked this place.

I have visited this place on innumerable occassions...I mainly confine myself to the hookah lounge at the ground floor. The place also has a restaurant on the upper floor and it also boasts of an open rooftop restaurant cum bar. Coming to the the hookah parlour, it surely has to be the amongst the best in South Kolkata..it serves hookah at such a cheap price that only a very few hookah bars can match it. A hookah at any other place might cost around 350-450 bucks..here at china whites it costs only around 250 and you also get a complimentary coal change. The quality of all the flavours of the hookah are decent enough and does not cause any problems even for a beginner unlike some of the other places...overall a great place..but I am talking only about the hookahs...and as foor the food it genuinely needs improvements.

Located opposite to Pataloons Gariahat.. An ideal place to sit and relax after hectic shopping.. 
Today was one such day.. Tired and after shopping.. Wen we came came out of Pataloons it was raining and so we headed for this place without a thought... 
Well on entering the place.. The staff was courteous and lead to our seats.. The place was decently decorated with nice lighting.. 
We orders Garlic Pepper Soup, Thai Noodles,  Pan Fried Chicken Noodles,  Tau Si Chicken,  T'sing Hoi Chicken and American Chicken Chopsey.. 
The food was decent quality and quantity.. Service time was quick and good.. 
Amongst the food Tau Si Chicken tasted the best.. 
After food we thought of having some drinks and hookah and we were lead to the shedded roof with sides open.. 
The drinks were fine... Ordered Hookah and A mocktail of Green Iceland.. The mocktail wasn't that great and the hookah arrived bit late.. We ordered Royal Pan Masala and Double apple for hookahs.. Both were decent.. Only negative thing is that the hookah time is only 45mins.. Which is pretty less and also the seats in the hookah zone wasn't that comfortable as compared to other Hookah joints.. But again this is not a complete hookah joint so not complaining on that part.. 
Overall.. If you are hungry after shopping in Gariahat area.. Then this place is a very good option

Location: Opposite Pantaloons, gariahat.

Ambience: Perfect.

Service: One of the best i have seen in recent times. Although I and the friend were the only customers they were catering to on a Saturday weekend.

Food: Surpassed expectations. 
For the starters we ordered pan fried chilli fish and two 2 Virgin Blue Lagoon. The drinks were nice and the Pan Fried Chilli Fish was cooked to perfection...! Very. Very. Well made.
For the mains we ordered American Chopsuey and Tsing -hoi chicken going by Zomato recommendations. Both were good enough though the chopsuey was too sweet for my taste buds.
Sumptuous lunch on a Saturday and the whole affair seemed tad better since it was my friend's treat. ;-))))
Sorry, no pics!(too busy eating!)

Located in one of the most prime locations of South Kolkata overlooking Gariahat Bridge and Pantaloons this place provides you with a perfect ambience of Oriental culture with pipe music melody oozing through the sound boxes and a greatly made up interior decor!! The place is about universality where a person can go with anyone , from kith to kin and for romantic dates as well!! The staff are extremely polite and efficient!! 
There are no dishes which one may find insipid. The prawn and lamb dishes are a speciality of this place!! Cantonese noodles are also special for their various types and tastes!! 
A must place to visit for an aficionado of food!!
There is also a Hookah bar at the basement and an semi-open air Liquor Bar on the roof !!! 
You can choose as you like !!! But for winters and monsoons I would recommend the open air bar !!

Good tasty Chinese!

First time i visited this restaurant was late last year 2014 and i totally loved the food. Since then i have been here multiple times and each time have been satisfied each time.  The food here is tasty, spicy and will make you want to come back. 

Special mentions for the Schezwan chicken fried rice, chilli garlic pepper chicken, man chow soup.

If you are looking at a Mainland china type out, you may not like it here ,the food here is more saucy, tangy, and might attract people with similar taste buds. But then again i like both ! ;)

i dont like writing critics but i was compelled to write one here ! First time i
 visited today with a few of my friends and this was probably the most disappointing hospitality ever! We sat on a table puffing a hookah and wanted to shift to the sofa when it later got vacant but the staffs denied us by blatantly lying that it was prebooked !  barely an hour passed when we had just had our first coal change ,when they served us with the bill which we havent even asked for,and they constantly came to the table to collect it. The surprising fact was it was only 730pm and the restaurant was almost vacant. It still beats me why they were in a hurry or in such a state of bother. I would like to rate this place 0/5,but unfortunately for me and luckily for them there are no such option!

Ambiance is nice. Quality of food is worth a mention too. Ordered a whole lot of dishes at the time of our visit. At the starters we ordered drums of heaven, spring chicken, dry chilli chicken and pan fried  chilli fish. I didn't like the spring chicken much as it didn't have the right crisp. The sauces used in all the other items in starters has the right taste and chicken pieces were nice and succulent as well. In the main course we ordered chicken noodles, Manchurian chicken and fish in wine sauce. They were all well prepared though I had a difficult time in finding out more chicken shreds and pieces in the noodles. At desserts we had plain vanilla ice-cream and darsan. The prices were really on the higher side considering the quantity provided. 170 bucks for one portion of darsan is really not worth. Still overall had a nice experience here. Worth trying it out!

So, to sum up -

LOCATION - 4/5  
FOOD QUALITY - 3.5/5 
QUANTITY - 3/5 
HOSPITALITY - 3.5/5 
DECOR AND AMBIANCE - 3.5/5 
HYGIENE - 3.5/5 
VALUE FOR MONEY - 3/5

I went to China Whites last Saturday for dinner with friends. We reached at around 8pm and the place was quite empty, so we got a table easily enough. We ordered Red Pepper Chicken, Pan Fried Chilli Fish & Sweet Lime Soda for starters. The chicken was served quite cold and didn't have the spicy tang that Red Pepper Chicken should have. On the other hand, the fresh lime soda was served at room temperature, instead of chilled. We had to call the waiter for ice cubes to make the drinks cool enough. For the main course we ordered Singapore Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice, T'sing Hoi Chicken & Sliced Lamb Hongkong Style. The noodles were made with mei foon/rice noodles but were not as good as Singapore Noodles I have tasted elsewhere. The fried rice was nice. The chicken & lamb were also well-cooked and tasty.The portions were quite enough and the cost for two came to around 1100/-But unfortunately, something in that dinner didn't agree with my stomach and me & one other friend ended up getting stomach infection the next day. This was my second visit & the experience turned a bit disappointing as I didn't expect an upset stomach after eating at such a renowned restaurant. Now I would be wary of eating there again. :(

Had THE BEST "chilli garlic noodles" and "hunan chicken" at this place some months back. It was like a match made in heaven! Tied this combination later on at several other more renowned places, but nowhere has it been that good. Ambience isn't anything to write home about really, except that you get a nice view of Gariahat flyover if you are seated near the window.

I'm writing this review after the second visit to this place. The first time I visited this place, I had to wait quite a long time for a table of 6 people, but as it was on the Christmas eve it was considerable. As soon as we had entered the restaurant, the staffs welcomed us heartily and wished us a very Merry Christmas :) We took our seats and they handed us the menu cards. We ordered our food and it was served in no time. All in all it was a good experience and thus I wanted to visit this place again. :)

This time I was there with my cousins for a lunch and even this time it was no different. The staffs were friendly and the food was good. The place was less crowded this time and thus we could have all the attention of the waiters. I loved their Konjee Crispy Lamb and the Pan Fried Noodles and thus recommend them! :)

I happened to visit this place in a rush, before watching a movie. We had very little time for the show and needed to fill our stomachs ASAP. So we stuck to the basics : mixed noodles and schezuan chicken. The food tasted good but mild. The ambience is awesome there. Hospitality and food service is appealing too. I would like to visit the place again.

I've been to this place quite a number of times. It's situated just opposite to Gariahat pantaloons. A very popular outlet for hookah maniacs. The ambience is quite a turn off. The seats are not so comfortable. And the inner section is always reserved. You never get a chance to sit there. Music is pretty cool. Coming to hookah, it's one of the best you can get in Kolkata. I assure you that you'd love their hookah as they are both amazing and pocket-friendly. Do visit this place. You might not find the decor and ambience soothing but you'll love their hookah. 

Rest I don't know anything about the restaurant above.

The ambience is just a turn off. The A/C hardly works. They tried to make it look like an upscale lounge which is where it all went downhill. The food, PLEASE, we ordered drums of heaven, should rename it to "half cooked chicken with burnt vegetables on the side". The only saving grace is the hookah, which is standard fare.

The ground floor may appear a little cramped however the top floor solves the problem. Walls appear a bit dirty due to the smoke... I think they should work on that.

China whites is a place located in the same building as Balaram Saha saree shop just opp Ballygunge ac market. They serve indo-chinese food and is quite delectable. They also provide hookah and thus became very popular among youngsters of the city. Wat i like most is the ambience of the place..neatly done. Food is above average and you get better chinese in other restaurants also.

China Whites is one of those rare places in Gariahat area just opposite to pantaloons which serves delectable and authentic indo-chinese spreads..They also serve North Indian cuisine but if you are here do try out from their extensive array of Chinese dishes..The best part about this restaurant is their lovely ambiance..Just love the semi-open terrace seating on top..if u r here dont miss this experience..sets you for a romantic dinner with your partner..Also they provide quite an extensive choice for Sheesha..liked the royal pan flavour..One of their Cons, I feel is their alcohol is quite aggresively priced..Definitely they mix up some interesting cocktails but they prices are quite steep,given this place is not a lounge or nightclub..The service is quite prompt and efficient..courteous staffs..help u to select ur menu..I also liked the presentation of their cocktails..quite authentic,something not followed in many pubs..Overall Some of the recommended items are:Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken,SesamePrawns,Tsing Hoi Chicken,Crab in Hot Garlic Sauce and Devils Fish..
Loved the assortment of spices and balance of flavours in their dishes..cooked with high precisions..Overall do visit this place once if not for the ambiance..Last time we visit our total cheque including food,cocktails and sheesha came to approx 3800/- for Four of us..

China Whites. I have heard of this place many a time, before finally paying a visit a few weeks back. As we were gonna have beer along with our hookah, we were shown the stairway upstairs that lead to a roof top sitting area. It was indeed quite nice. 
We had Hookah, a few beers and fried baby corn. The food was quite good. The ambiance is awesome. The waiting staff are also very courteous. And of course, the location is really good.  All in all, its quite good without burning a hole in your pocket.

This place is in Gariahat nearby or we can say opposite foot of pantaloons. They have opened sitting on the terrace also. So went there with a freind. It's non AC on terrace but if the climate is good then nice place to go for. Nice music is there and enjoy your drink & hookah both out there. 

We ordered 2-3 snacks and every thing was good. Food preparation was nice and ambience also good. Will recommend this place to go for. Popular in youngsters more.

This is a sexy place exactly opposite to Peter England showroom of Gariahat, near Gariahat Pantaloons. Distributed on 3 floors.. The ground floor serves only hookah and food, second booked for food and alcohol and the terrace serves all 3. Rad place to be with friends. The terrace is well kept and maintained. The bar is good and decorations give a good ambience. The service is really good and polite. The hookah is brilliant. The variety of liquor is mind blowing and the food is of very good quality with amazing range and variety. Food did take somewhat longer to arrive but the hookah and drinks kept us pre-occupied. Smoking was allowed so that also came as a plus point. If you are looking for a good hookah joint that serves good food and alcohol, this is definitely the kind of place you must visit. Hang out with friends or have a quality time with your family or loved ones, this place serves it all.

Been there last weekend. Went to the section w/o hookah at the 2nd floor. Nicely set-up, well controlled AC. Surprisingly, everyone was having WINE. We were discussing among us as to what happened to Kolkata? I believe we are Whisky lovers. Never mind, lets concentrate on the food.
In the menu they served both Chinese and Mughlai dishes. We opted for the Chinese cuisine. In the starters, we ordered crispy Konjee Lamb. Well it was crispy but why on the earth it's so sweet? Trust me we had asked for chilli ketchup to down that. And not to mention, we ruined the dish. So we ordered a plate of some chicken starter on sauce and requested them to make it extra spicy just to offset the sweet tooth. It went well with JW Red label.
To start with, it was a turn off. Drinks were over priced. I had to settle for Red label at the price of Black Label. I mean seriously, 275 bucks for a 30ml Red Label? Thank you I am not coming again
P.S. Since we were too hungry we had to had the main course :(
One more thing, I have seen beers being served in wine glasses. That answered my suspense over bengali and wine..lol

It was suggested to me by a friend who used to frequent China Whites. The chicken served here satisfies one's non veg craving, without burning a hole in the pocket. I fell in love with kung pao chicken and hunan fish as well. I tried kahlua, the flavour of which was immensely satisfying. 
The open terrace was a bonus. If you want to have hookah and feel choked in a closed cabin, this is your place. 
Advisable for dates and a time out from general life.

With a gang of 10 friends we visited this particular restaurant.

At the first go, we were directed to the roof top. To make my emotions more clear, it was a sultry afternoon with a rate of high perspiration.

Then on came the menu list. The hookah price, if compared, the price in MANIAC was literally half of the price here. It is too costly considering the ambience.

The food was not extraordinarily good. Overrated restaurant it is.

China Whites is located at the heart of South Calcutta in Gariahat. The place has to offer something for everyone. It has a small hall below religiously for a Hookah Bar.
 There is a family section of the restaurant which is fully air conditioned on the second floor. There is also a rooftop option which is mostly for the young crowd where you can watch live matches and have food and booze.

The food quality is pretty good here. My favorites are the China White Special Noodles, the Kung Pao Chicken and the Konjee Crispy lamb. They have also got an option for Indian Cuisine if you want to opt for it, but I prefer the chinese there. The food tastes good and is more or less economical. This is a place where you can bring any group be it friends or family and you will have the perfect ambience for it. So Overall I give it 3.5/5.

Felt awkward to see a restaurant named China Whites serving north indian. Everytime I ordered Chinese and found the quality good with averagely standard price and above average quantity. Typical Indian Chinese. Taste was nice. Service was expert and friendly. As a whole, nice experience.

It's a shame that I didn't write my maiden review on China Whites. I have vivid memories of this place and each hangout plan was dominated by the staggering presence of China Whites. I've never tried eating out here, so it's a confinement for the Hookah joint beneath. This place is always buzzing. Owing to an excellent location, just opposite of the Gariahat Pantaloons, it attracts customers in the form of a swarm. The food here is decent, hookah has always been a delight and hospitality very good, despite a large chunk of people present all the time. This place actually sums up an integral part of my high school years.

Located off Gariahaat crossing, opposite pantaloons, near Prapti, this restaurant has a lot to offer when it comes to food and beverage offering. I have been visiting this place from last couple of years.  Whenever near Gariahaat this place offera a decent dinning experience.  You can choose your sitting depending on the mood of the day and the kind of group you are hanging out with. But my personal favourite always being the section located at 2nd floor.  That will give you feeling of a  full fledged fine dining experience. Menu consist of Chinese and Oriental delicacies.  Food will come quick and have a fairly priced alcohol menu as well. They have just started serving popular tandoori dishes as well with almost all the popular selection. Speed of service is one area they need to work upon. Ambience is nicely done with minimal decor and goes well with the overall feel.

We went there with a food coupon from groupon ! There was something like an anti wastage policy which prohibits you from wasting more than 50% of the quantity served(each item) !! It was lyk a goddamn punishment , the soup was extraordinarily sour and tasted horrible , starters were okay , but the main course was a disaster , ginger burnt fried rice was too dry and to accompany that came schezwan chicken , even that was dry !! Every food tasted horrible !!!!!! And ofcourse those rude waiters , I haven't seen such rude and irresponsible waiters !! This is the worst place in kolkata to dine in ! And with such mentality they do not even have the scope for improvement !!!!!

Hookah is really good at reasonable price, food is also good but a little bit on the expensive side. Lots of variety on drinks available but it is also a little bit pricey. I give it a 4 overall as its really good to hang out with friends or just to go out on a casual dinner.

Hookah's are awesome. And what more, you can choose this place for your regular hangouts. The price of the food, hookahs and the drinks won't burn a hole in your pocket. Instead it's really pocket friendly.

I went there on Saraswati puja with a friend. We were shown to their terrace seats.

I must say the ambiance of the terrace is beautiful. It was around 7 in the evening,there was a slight chill in the air and soft light all around us. I was simply enchanted..

They have a good serving time. The hookahs are flavorsome and food is tasty. The pocket pinch is not too much as well.

This was my second time there(first one was a group visit) and I loved it both the times. Anyone looking for a good time should definitely visit here.

I went to China Whites on the recommendation of a friend, only for the hookah. Being a weekday there was not much crowd. There is a only hookah section and there is a hookah + drinks section but I preferred the former. 

A Red Bull Base flavoured hookah set me back by about 500. They take prices printed on the menu, so I dunno if they are running an illegal joint or they figure in taxes first and then earn a bit over that. In any case, the menu says hookah for a max of 45 minutes, which sucks. But since there was little crowd, I was told the rule didn't apply.

The hookah was good and smoked well, and we didn't have to ask for fresh coal for 45 minutes. There was a bottle of mineral water provided alongside for which they didn't charge. 

The location is also quite central and you can see the place right opposite Pantaloons on the highway itself. So if you want to chill out on a weekday evening this is a nice place.

Good food at decend prices. The interiors are good enough for family and friends but its a small food outlet .
Main thing is food is good and good in quality but improvements are always there 
Chinese food is must to try for in this restaurant.
I am sure u won't be disappointed at all.

I had visited this place recently with a bunch of friends to catch up over drinks. We were a group of five, and we preferred to sit on the rooftop. 
The place was pretty okay, except the tables were placed quite near to each other, making it look a bit clumsy.
So we ordered Dry Chilli Chicken which was very good but the Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken was okayish. The Tandoori Chicken was soft and had a melt in the mouth texture we all loved. We had also ordered Blueberry Hookah which was fine but nothing great. This is one of the few places where I get my favourite tipple, Smirnoff Espresso, so we all ordered large pegs of it.
The Virgin Pina Colada was a total waste of money, with its synthetic  coconut syrup taste. 
The Fresh Lime Soda was like any other normal one. 
Even though the service was quite fast, the staff wasn't quite attentive and we had to call them a lot of times for ordering.
This place is slightly on the costlier side, because the bill came up to around 5000 rupees for all this. 
But definitey worth a visit.

Hookah=China Whites. Hangout=China Whites. Bored=China Whites. Birthdays=China Whites. Blind Dates=China Whites. Practically ANYTHING=China Whites.
Well that is what China Whites is to me. I was a regular at this superbly located place. Even now, whenever i get time, its china whites for me. Its very easy to locate. Exactly opposite to gariahat pantaloons. The seating arrangement is divided in two floors. The top floor is open air and serves alcohol along with the sheesha and food. The ground floor again has the regular seats as well as the banquet. All non-alcoholic drinks as well as food and sheesha is served here. I have had almost all the flavours in their sheesha, except the single fruity ones. Their hookah is one of the cheapest best available in town. The food is also really good. My favorite order is the crispy chilli baby corn. Perfectly made! The tangri badami chicken is spicy and tastes good. I dont like the tofu much but then i hardly like tofu much. So doesnt count really. And the list goes on. The sheesha is reasonable whereas the food and liquor are averagely priced. A very nice place for hangout. You would hardly notice the time fly. Highly recommended. Cheerie!

It's a place you would love your Chinese . They make good soups   ,good service and moderately prices. You can have a meal ,a full meal and still not feel the pinch on your pocket . The fish with garlic flavour was so yummy. It's not so popular among the group I move around but a friend who is working in Dalhousie area ,suggested me ,as they get lot of meal from the little outlet they have near the court s. Quantity wise also a good deal for money . Star Chinese food

Good place, good food, good ambiance.
Has a terrace as well which is quite cool. I'm not much of a hookah fan but they have that option as well which is good.
The best part is that they serve alcohol. This is the kind of place where you can drink and enjoy good snacks in a good ambiance without spending a hell of a lot of money.
The downside is that they do not have too many options in snacks, especially in non-chicken snacks. I have actually finished everything on their snack menu in just two or three visits. Hope they have added more by now.

I will talk about the rooftop here because that's where I've been several times and love being there! Kolkata does not have too many rooftop hangouts, and this place being in a comfortable location adds to my favourite places to hang out over hookah and drinks. I love their crab cakes and mixed noodles like crazy. However the fact that starters cost you almost double the amount of main course is quite depressing. Personally i feel the waiters and the managers can be a little more courteous!

After a lot of research on liquor and food,China Whites happened to be one of the bars that actually provided me with great choices in liquor and food.

The entrance of this restaurant lies in one of the over crowded areas of the city.If you have to visit this place,the ideal time would be the transition between the summer and the slow inflow of the winter.
In the peak season the place may get crowded,and with a limited seating capacity you may have to wait a little more.
Talking otherwise,the interiors are very appealing to the eye and the glass shades give you a full view of the outside street(I can term that a little clichéd).
The hookah bar in the ground floor of the restaurant,is an additional place of harem for the young crowd.

This is one bar that serves the Prestige Rum,has a wide range of Shooters and the best of wines like the Shiraz.
We dug in for the Crispy Lamb,the Chicken Manchow Soup and the prawn.
For the drinks the Mojito was pretty decent and the Virgin Blue Lagoon was one that always kept us going.
Main course food selection consisted of the usual Hakka Chowmein and Szechuan chicken.
All in all very neat for a lunch.

The bill literally burnt our pockets,but I had realized that it was actually worth it.
Some may say that this place is slightly over-rated and charges a lot.But in a city like Kolkata if you are to look for quality food and drinks,China Whites will definitely be one of my favourite picks.

As the rest of the people were saying......china whites has a great ambience.....hookah lovers can use the bottom floor. The ones who go there for the drinks and lunch,they can use the second floor. If you want both hookah and drinks there's always the open terrace on the third floor. I recommend the chilli baby corn as well as the reshmi and tikka kebabs.

My favorite thing in this restaurant is their interior. It's what can be called pristine. Done mainly in white with blue accents, the graphics of bamboo shoots on the door is sure to make you feel interested. Its is conveniently located between Gariahat and Ballygunj just off the bustle of the shopping destinations. The dimly lit restaurant gives you a very welcoming and cozy feeling. Staff are courteous and will make valuable suggestion for food.  The bar is well stocked but they serve beer in pints. Slightly costly than nearby options. But I could accept that owing to the pretty ambiance. 
Crispy Chili potatoes, American corn pepper and salt, Fired Chicken Wanton, Lat me kai, Sesame chicken are my recommendation for starers. Main course favorites are Crispy chicken chili honey sauce, delicate balance of sweet salty and spicy!! Fish in Chili wine is also good in being light and with just the right amount of spiciness. I like the burnt garlic fried rice, Chili garlic noodle  and Pan fried noodle. 
The ground floor houses a Hookah bar which seems to be quite the popular hangout for young people. They serve you starters and some main courses downstairs along with flavoured hookahs.
Overall, quite nice place and unique in housing an affordable hookah parlor.

My comment is solely on my pub experience. Affordable rates for alcohol, the one plus one offers on whiskey and vodka are helpful. but the problem is the uptight waiters, if you are planning to spend a night out drinking, expectations like waiters getting you pack of cigarettes from ship downstairs or playing non honey Singh songs for a change are met with cold shoulder. A little more friendly service and I will end up loving this place unhesitatingly

This place is located in the prime location of gariahat just opposite the "pantaloons". I have been visiting this place since i was in school. It used to be one of my favorite place to hangout. On the ground floor they serve hookah and various snacks and savories. It is moderately decorated and has a nuclear layout. The couches are quite cozy and comforting. The hookahs which they serve are quite cheaper in price as compared to other sisha parlours in town. The different snacks which they offer are also quite mouth watering. Some of my favorites are- chilli fish, crispy chilli potato, noodles etc. The bar is located in the 2nd floor of the building. It is also decently decorated and a well stocked bar. The staffs are quite friendly and helpful. The quality of the food served here is also gulpable. China whites is one of the few places in this area which serves hookah along with alcohol and quality foods.

Hookah ambience was great but music was not all up to the mark. The music arranger should change the taste of the music.

Food quantity was optimum.

Decent place right at the gariahat road. Easy to find. Basically one of many hookah joints in the city. Food is good. Nothing out of ordinary. Hookahs as my friends reacted to it seemed good. But it wasn't anything that stood out of the crowd. Overall a good place to chill with friends. Would not suggest for a fine dining experience. Service is on the slower side. So be slow on the hookah, use it as a intermediate for the food.

Elegent decor, fine service and the quality food are three main reasons to visit this oriental restaurant. One of kolkata's bests. Alcohol price is quite higher side and that seems only thinkable reason for the boozers whereas food quality w.r.t quantity is plus point.

As my visit over here, in starter ordered sesame chicken well it was just perfectly cooked with perfection and chicken pieces were served with separate red thai sauce which tasted really good. Chicken pieces were crispy and tasted better with the sauce dip. Suited well with drinks :)

In the main course had mongolian fish and burnt garlic mixed rice. Both were cooked well and tasted really amazing. Fish pieces were fresh and sauce was cooked very well, must try.

Overall a must try oriental joint in South kolkata. Next time need to taste noodles and other dishes.

For my Saptami evening I chose China White's as i was craving for good quality Chinese food without splurging muchh. And no I wasn't disappointed whether it was the Egg Hakka noodles or the crispy Chilli babycorn, the place lived upto my expectations. However, I feel the ambience could have been lively as the dim lights made it too dull. Otherwise I give this place a thumbs-up for all college-goers.

The ambience was superb and the service was friendly and non-disturbing. The food rocked man! 
Location is such that it will not take you a min. to locate. It is just above prapti showroom in gariahat. Opposite pantaloons.

I went there yesterday with some of my friends,it was my first visit and most probably the last one.We sat upstairs as they don't serve alcohol downstairs and some of my friends wanted to booze..the decor was not upto the mark.The beers which were printed in the menu was out of stock and the one which they had was not on the menu card,i do understand that during pujas most of the places make some changes in their menu,but atleast the menu card should be updated.Now coming to Shisha,while ordering they mentioned that one single shisha can't be smoked for more than 30 mins,which is ok,but they also stated that there would be "NO COAL CHANGE" which was kind of stupid.We just sat there till the time the shisha got finished and then moved to some other place,i would not recommend this place to anyone.

It was the day of the 7th Day (Saptami) of Durga Puja 2014. I went with my friend for lunch since the other places were overflowing with hungry people ready to eat like Kings and Queens. We had ordered Gold Fried Prawns, Chicken in Mongolian Sauce and Mix meat hakka noddles. For drinks, we ordered mocktails like Fire & Ice, Pink Panther, and lastly sweet fresh lime water. 
To be frank, golden fried prawns were not good at all. We liked the main course. Quantity was sufficient. 
The mocktails and the fresh lime water were worst of the lot. This place is not at all good for mocktails. So, guys please don't try and waster your money on mocktails at least. 
Ambience was good, service was quick as well, and the waiters were well trained and well behaved. 
Overall, good place to try out. But I must say that this is not an authetic Chinese restaurant.

I was a regular here for some time as it is quite close to my house. Thats not the only point. It has a variety of options to offer..delectable Chinese spreads with special mention of Chicken Lat me kai, Crab in black bean sauce,  fish pepper salt, fish chili wine and a whiskey based cocktail that could be best enjoyed if one is sitting in terrace. The terrace arrangement is a refreshing break from city life. One can watch a football match on giant screen in mute mode along with some lovely cocktails they have to offer.

I discovered this place in 2013, and was glad with my find, firstly, because it is easy to locate, secondly, it is friendly and spacious - a great place to hang with family and friends, and thirdly, and most importantly  - great food and booze at pocket friendly prices. 
Having said that, let me delve deeper into it:
I will document my awesome experiences here:

Day 1: I came with a friend who is a drinker. He was pretty damn happy with the vodka, pricing quality et al. I was overjoyed with my burnt garlic fried rice and T'sing Hoi Chicken, washed down with some happy gulps of chilled Cranberry flavored Breezer! We languorously chatted through the evening, the service was warm and non-interfering - just the kind you want.

Day 2: I got a group of friends, again 3 of them drinkers. They were pretty damn happy with the rum, beer, vodka and the rest. All of us were ecstatic with the generous refills of cheeselings. The Ginger Garlic Pepper Chicken was out of the world, and the Lat Me Kai was a close second. We giggled and guffawed and some of us sloshed, Service as usual was warm and comfortably distant. Pocket pinch was unbelievably low.

Day 3: It was Bengali New Year, and erm...an evening that needed to be a tad special. My mate ordered a couple of vodkas and LIT (ooooh LIT), and I got frozen strawberry daiquiri (and what a beauty it was). Both of us got sweetly high over the cocktails (OK so what if I am not a drinker, I know what a good cocktail is like). The starters that we ordered were lip-smacking as always. 

So the bottom-line being not only the food is great and inexpensive, the liquor is fine and inexpensive too. Service rocks! I highly recommend this place if you are game for some great Chinese food and fun! 

PS - There is an open air hookah lounge if you are youngish at heart!

We went there following a party and ordered Tandoori Chicken , Pan Flavored Hookah .. Cold drinks and Beer. We loved the tandoori chicken which was done to perfection. The paan flavored hookah was simply mindblowing . The cold drinks were priced too steep with a simple glass of cold drinks costed 95 which was a downer . The total bill came around 1600.

A rooftop restaurant at Gariahat the ambience is nice...I visited there last puja with friends and to all of our surprise the restaurant could provide us a six seater table immediately which I guess is great...the food wasn't dat good we had lamb,chicken nd noodles.... The lamb was over cooked and the chicken was horrible.... It might be due to the puja rush so m looking forward to visit the place....

Been to this place a couple of times... A big hope in for those who really like to chill in weekends... Specially in such location where people usually visit for shopping... This restaurant is basically divided into two parts the upper floor assigned as the restaurant where as the ground floor as the hookah bar.. A friendly and sober hospitality will surly make you impressed... Though some common drinks will always be unavailable when asked... Quite a good place to hang around with not so harsh on pockets... Suggested... And must try once..

The restaurant has a hookah parlour downstairs and the dine-in arrangement is upstairs. The attendants greeted us well and guided us to a seat for two. The setting in white was looking great along with yellow chandeliers. The table had a small bonsai plant which was eating up space.
We ordered PAN FRIED CHILLI PRAWN for starters and CHINA WHITE'S SPECIAL MIX MEAT NOODLES and the much recommended T'SING HOI CHICKEN. The starter was yummy. It had a brilliant aroma and a mixture of taste. The prawn was soft and well cooked. The chicken side dish was tasty. Shredded pieces of chicken with capsicum and cashew was a good combination. Though the dish has a chilli mark beside it on the menu it was not that spicy.
The chowmein platter looked awful and tasted similar. Thick strands without any distinct taste and adding to that boiled vegetables was pretty disappointing.

I must say alcohol is much cheaper here than most of the places I've been to. So whenever I was here my usual was beer and hookah never looked beyond that. 
BUT at times you are hungry and you need good food. 
Me being always apprehensive about food at hookah places, again it was a huge challenge for me what to order and what to not. 
And this place was a thumbs up ! 
Quick review. 
~ pan fried chicken mom was GOOD ! Avoid the sauce if you are not very fond of spicy stuff, cus that was SPICY ! 
~ chicken fried noodles was a huge disappointment. It was extremely salty and not at all well cooked. 
I decide to stick to the starters here.

Elegant ambiance with beautiful food is all you desire when you are in a mood to dine out in a good place. China Whites perfectly fits into this category. I always went for the chinese cuisine at this place hence have no idea about the Punjabi food. The starters are not only good in terms of taste but the quantity is apt and you actually feel the ROI is high. One of the few places i have been to in Kolkata where authentic chinese food is served. The main course is an absolute deligh. The Manchurian with an optimal amount of gravy is one of the best i have had.  All in all if you love chinese food, you want to go to this place.

Not a great place if you have a hookah date on mind.. basically a cheap tag place for young school and college goers.. the ambiance is a bit crowded and clumsy... nevertheless they serve good hookah.. should definitely go up and sit on the terrace, the environment there s definitely more sophisticated and mature.. it's been an on and off constant hangout zone for the last 6 years or so.. the pan rasna sisha, full tandoori chicken, crispy chilli baby corn is a must try.. they let smoke on the terrace, making it less crowded.. Carslberg is served here.. making this place an absolute favourite :D

I have gone to this place for both hookah and the restaurant. The place stood out when it first opened as it was known to less people, but with variety of crowd coming in, it was soon a turn off for the hookah part at least. The food is decent for non-vegetarians, but if you are a veggie like me, you can swipe for more options available.

Later when they opened their terrace area I instantly liked it. The hookah is decent :) but the food is amazing! They serve alcohol too and for people who smoke they are allowed that on the service.

Superb ambience at the rooftop with flavoured hookahs...great service, very polite people...quite a snug and cozy place for a relaxed and chilled out evening. Loved their mocktail pina colada. Huge quantity served in a portion which is more than enough for two. Great food and moderate pricing. I deducted half a mark in the rating as there are no sofas at the rooftop which could have been more cozy...and the music played could be better as well as the sound system. Loved the hookahs which are available on a flat rate of 300 bucks. All in all an awesome place to chill out with ur loved ones... :)

On a Saturday, me and my husband went to China White's in Gariahat. We wanted to sit in the rooftop. We ordered for 1 Veg Spring Roll, 1 Fried Chicken Momo & 1 Fresh Lime Soda. The order taker (probably the Manager) asked us if we would like to order any alcohol or Hookah.. on our denial, he said something which will refrain us from going there next time. He asked us why we want to sit in the rooftop when we are not ordering alcohol or hookah. Wow! so being an efficient revenue-minded employee, he very rudely said that. I am not going to this joint again as there are other rooftop joints in Calcutta who believe in a good guest experience more than the revenue!

The prawn pieces were decently sized and lat me kai looked and tasted good. We also ate chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and Devil's choice(a delicious veg dish). The quantity was enough for three people with average appetite. The seating was comfortable, and service quick. An overall satisfactory experience.

This place will not turn your mood off, neither will give you an urge to visit it again.
Staffs are really good and well-mannered.
Ambiance is fine, place was almost empty in both the times I visited there.
Food is really average--but yes the money you are paying you will not feel cheated--cheapest decent place for food and drinks around Gariahat i guess.
For regular visit you can try but for some special occasions you need to rethink.

Overview- so..there we were ...near around Gariahat flyover,pretty easy to locate...a random and sudden visit to a nearby hookah parlor from my house...worth a hit !
Ambiance - the best thing about this place would be...the terrace...i mean Kolkata does not rly hv many a rooftop alcohol-hookah combo joints...and this ones pretty less expensive compared to the other few options available in the south... !good enough music...although they could play better stuff,other than honey singh...tidy enough...and amazing on a rainy evening. !
Food-...well nothing special to be honest...finger food...okish...then again who s going there to have lunch/dinner anyway... although the hookah...was  smooth...the flavour cudv been put in a bit more...!
Service-friendly...and interactive...rarity in Kolkata !

This place is opposite to the Gariahat AC market right where the flyover ends. It is a bar cum restaurant. I had a lunch over here a few months back. They serve decent food, not that bad to put your mood off, neither anything extraordinary to lift you up from your melancholia. I did not like the lime soda over here, as it had a strange synthetic smell. If you are around here you will find lot of other better options at an even lower budget, but that is true if you are in a mood to eat only. To eat and drink I think this is the cheapest alternative around this area.

The place is poorly managed. The staff is not trained well to manage the place during rush hour. We were served Non Veg food when specifically ordered for Veg dishes. The waiter for some reason went to to kitchen and put in an order slip for chicken instead of paneer. According to the 'Captain', this was not the firs incident and we were aghast the way the entire staff treated the matter. They were very casual and did not understand that for us, as strict vegetarians, this was a very big deal. If the staff was so careless in producing wrong dishes to the guest, one can only imagine in what condition would they be running there kitchen !

Went for lunch on a hot and humid afternoon. Courteous doorman helped us into the lift, we were greeted warmly upon arriving on the 2nd floor, where the restaurant is. We were seated promptly and what do you know, they pulled the chairs out for us ladies! Heck, even my hubby doesn't do that ;-). We ordered shandy and we were told that they would order the ingredients and they will make it at our table since it was not available off the menu as such. The maître d was a young man, who suggested what we could order and also made the cocktails with much care. What's more, when the other unopened beer bottle had been sitting there and gone warm, he offered to switch it out for a chilled one. Gold star for excellent service. We ordered Konjee crispy lamb for starters. Singapore chicken noodles, kung pao chicken and prawn in butter garlic sauce for main course. All excellent, not overwhelmed in spices and sauce. Portion wise, what we ordered was good enough for 3 people. Next time we will also order dessert. Definitely going back to sample more.

I'd visited ths place last year during the pujas.. We wanted to have lunch at a restaurant where we've never visited earlier.. When I suggested the name of China whites, I remember my friends saying "oh no! We're nt going to a hookah parlor".. I literally had to force them to atleast give it a try.. But then after visiting, they were nt disappointed to find that the hookah parlor is downstairs and the restaurant upstairs :-) Thats one good thing abut ths place.. The service was good, the food was awesome n the behaviour of the waiterz was great too.. The prices are nt that high compared to the food quality and quantity.. The bill was around 900 for 4 people and we were more than just satisfied after the meal.. I would surely recommend ths place to those who love chinese.. Would like to visit it soon :-)

The wow factor for China Whites is........It is quite affordable.
The starters are good.
A nice place to hang out with friends on the open terrace with Hookah, drinks and Side dish.
And one bowl of noodle is sufficient for two.
The service provided is good.
Have been there twice.......Hope they maintain the same as it was....
Would love to visit there again, once I reach Kolkata :)

The thing about China Whites is that it does not any Zing or wow factor or USP in it. the food is good the place is good the service is ok and the price is good..

that's about it... no matter what you order you will never Go WOOW or excellent ... you will be like ya its good... 

there is nothing extraordinary in the place... it is a place one would probably go to when there is a rush every where else and there is no other option. plus they have a bar so that's a plus point. 

other than that its all the same. the portions are of adequate quantity and the the taste is just fine. 

all in all a try out place it is but nothing more than that.

The best thing about this restaurant is it's location and the add-on Hukka bar. (No Tera Pyaar Pyaar Pyaar reference :D )

Located at the heart of Gariahat, this a la carte restaurant serves superlative quality of Chinese dishes. The bar available also adds to its repertoire. 
Honestly speaking I am a bit emotionally attached to this place because I had my first drink here. Nevertheless, this place is extremely plausibly priced.

An absolute recommendation for all outings with your kith and kin. :)

Walked in with low expectations, walked out delighted. Excellent Chinese food, but the stars of the meal were the prawn dishes. I'm not sure how they are doing it but the quality of prawns being served here is simple brilliant. Especially at a price point of 250-270 rupees. The golden fried prawn, prawn butter garlic , garlic prawn are must haves. The golden fried prawn was the best I've had in a while even compared to 900 rupee fried prawns at fancier joints. The date pancakes were very good too. Overall a super meal for four (soup, 2 starters, 2 mains, 2 sides, 2 desserts , with a large Black Dog 12) came to Rs. 2800. Great stuff! I sincerely hope they maintain their standards because I'll be back the next time I visit Kolkata.

The T'sing hoi chicken is a must have.... ask them to make it less spicy.... and with that chicken noodles... well...it was simply awesome...! One bowl is enough for two....! The staffs are very friendly....and even they helped me to choose and was very patient and humble as i was really confused which one to order as i neither like too sweet stuffs...nor too spicy.....as same old garlic chicken....manchurian is such a cliche...! Good staff...good place...good food....and good price...! :) 
I really liked it.... :) would go again to taste that t'sing hoi chicken... :) That dish is on my fav. list now...! ^_^

This restaurant worked for me. Their portions were totally worth the cash and the lemon fish was pretty amazing. That apart nothing extraordinary. Probably it's important for the owners to carve out a niche so that the restaurant doesn't get lost amidst the 1000 other existing Chinese restaurants in the city. So please try and work on your segmentation and branding . and you should be fine!

Want to escape from the long lines and crowd in restuarant on weekend, then this is the place. Its a small decent dining place in gariahat  with seating capacity of nearly 60 people. The ambience is not so great but soothing to eyes because of the white decor. Four of us went there for dinner on sunday eve. We ordered kimchi salad and crispy chilly babycorn in starters. Both of them were well prepared. In the main course our table was served with veg Hakka noodles, veg fried rice and mild garlic vegetables. I would recommend every dish but people with spicy taste should go for schezwan sauce as mid garlic was very bland. We also ordered 3 kingfisher strong. In total we shelled out INR 1497. The service time was 5 to 10 minutes. The staff was courteous and served the food nicely. I would recommend this place as it is value for money.

Ambience- 6/10
Food- 8/10
Service-7/10!

China Whites -Nothing like Chinese. Pretty disappointment at your branch at CSC. 
========================================================================
Intro: 
To begin with, i went to CSC today to have some club food. However, China whites had a tie up with them with regards to the food. I probably had eaten before at China Whites and they have not disappointed me like they did today. The menu was exactly the same of China whites. I expected the quality to be also same which was not at all.
========================================================================
Ordered:

Schezwan Fried Rice- On first serving, the fried rice was veg fried rice with ginger filled all over. I have never expected the cook of China Whites to provide Veg fried Rice in the place of Schezwan Fried Rice. The most funniest thing was Veg Fried Rice with Chilli Flakes? Have you guys ever seen it anywhere? It surprised me. Not even a pinch of Schezwan sauce was hinted in the food. 
========================================================================
Conclusion:

It was altogether a disappointing experience. When told to replace, nothing but more oil was added and nothing was changed with respect to the rice. Not happy at all.


----- 25 Jun, 2013 -----

Location: China whites - located on the side of GARIAHAT flyover is a sheesha/hookah cum Chinese restaurant. They food over here is expensive and sheesha is moderately priced. Coming to the pros and cons of this place

2) sheesha is pretty good. 
3) prices are affordable
4) food is pretty good in quality 
5) ambience is nice
6) crowdy most of the times

8) provides combo offers too at times

Cons:-
1) smoking cigarettes is allowed wd hookah.
2) ambience can be improved
3) prices for food are high compared to the quality 
4) crowd is not good at times. 

Must try:- 3 paan hookah,Chinese basic same dishes

Recently: went there. Ordered teen paan sheesha. Was very avg.

i did not have a good experience here 
we went for our friends birthday part 
she had a gift card .but the staff there were making a fuss on accepting it ..we also had billing problems thanks to their mistakes ..............cant recall exactly what 
coming to the food 
only the noodle was the decent dish .it was nothing extra ordinary which people should expect judging from the name of the restaurant 
the honey chicken was too sweet .....too thin ...... and really like honey chicken i have had the same at many other places ,,,this was definitely the worst 
the prices are somewhat high
the menu has a very sophisticated countenance but sadly that attribute is no where to be found in their dishes 
the veg dish we ordered was so plain and simple like boiled vegetables 
the non veg was still okay 
the little moody staff were still cooperative i'd say 
people mainly like this place for the hookah bar
-------------------------------------
high prices 
nothing extraordinary about the food 
decent staff 
good ambiance

Been to this place a number of times and I have never been tired of the menu. If you had enough of shopping in the busy Gariahat area and want to give your tired limbs some rest and looking for some good Chinese cuisine then China Whites is highly recommended. 

For starters I have had chicken spring rolls, chilli baby corn and chilli garlic pepper chicken with a glass of beer. The fried items are fried to perfection! The spring roll is heavenly with the right mixes of veggies and chicken. For soup order the hot and sour soup or the chicken wanton soup or the chicken sweet corn soup. The soups are thick and heavy and the best is splitting one into two.

Main course....I have ordered the standard chilli chicken, manchurian, garlic chicken, diced chicken with cashew nuts and all of them are pretty decent. In fact the kung pao chicken is pretty good too! Well if you like lamb opt you can go for the crispee conjee lamb or shredded lamb chilli garlic - the latter I thought was slightly tasteless than the former. The noodles/rice are pretty staple...choose whatever you like...quality assured. I generally order a bowl of mixed fried rice and american chopsuey or singapore hakka noodles. The Cantonese gravy noodles is pretty good too!

The restaurant is easy to locate...bang opp gariahat pantaloons. They used to serve on the rooftop but I am not sure if they do so now. The decor is pretty neat and simple and the quantity of food is nice although the price is slightly on the higher side now. However I would still recommend this joint simply for its quality cuisine in the area.

This place serves amazing Chinese food! The chilli garlic fried rice...the starters...the chilly potato...the Manchurian... I love d food here. Being a pure vegetarian I generally face a problem of getting a sort of non veg food's smell from d food served in Chinese restaurants that serve both veg n non-veg.....I didn't face that problem here. :D

I had visited China Whites this Sunday basis recommendation from a couple of colleagues.

Surprisingly empty for a 1:30 PM on Sunday. However, the décor and ambience was nice with Oriental pipe music on. The stewards and waiters were well trained and hospitable.

Overall, the food was very nice - we had Wonton soup, Mongolian chicken, Ginger garlic chicken, Burnt garlic fried rice and Hakka chow. The Burnt garlic fried rice was exceptionally good and can be had just by itself. The Mongolian chicken was very spicy but had a novelty.

Definitely worth coming again.

I'd visited this place once during the pujas with 3 of my friends.. We loved the ambience.. 
We'd ordered chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian and we were pretty satisfied with the taste.. 
The service was pretty decent.. 
It can be easily spotted as its located just opposite Pantaloons..
It has 2 floors.. The ground floor is a hookah parlour and the 1st floor is the restaurant.. People who are not very fond of hookah can straight away go upstairs..
Overall, a nice place to visit..

Okay I've been to this place like millions of times. Never gets old.  A common hangout place for the youth. Thought I strictly stick to the hookah lounge downstairs. I really havent been to the restaurant. 

The hookah lounge downstairs is comfy and fun. I like the pretty japanese lanterns that light up the section. Music in the background and puffs of hookah is just good. But the chairs are super duper uncomfortable. I prefer the couch but there's only one in there.

With hookah, I prefer crispy chilli baby corn because they make it real good and the amount is overflowing and at times the complimentary coke gets me all happy and gay! :D

I really do not mind visiting China Whites with my friends because it is sheer fun. Do give it a try.
This place can give you a gala time without burning a hole in your pocket.

Happy eating guys.
Cheers! :)

The food is good and pocket friendly but used to be even better before with a larger variety of choice. They used to serve Lat Me Kai which was my favourite but dish wasn't on the menu the last time I visited.

This has been a hangout for me and my friends for quite some time now. This place basically has three sections. The hookah bar, the restaurant and the roof top. The hookah bar is mostly for the younger groups, a little cramped up and too loud music. The second floor is more like the family restaurant. If you want a quiet evening with your spouse, this is defintely the space. My personal favorite is the roof top where we can avail both hookah as well as drinks. Perfect place for hanging out with friends. Though be advised, during summers the place can be pretty fumed up which will eventually make you uncomfortable. All in all, this is a nice place, with good ambience and decent food worth your money.

Its really a good place for hanging out with friends and for dining also.
Its a Bar cum Restaurant on 3rd floor and a Hookah bar at the ground floor.
Ambiance is good in both.

The seating arrangement is a bit less comfortable , but their service is very good.
They've arranged the seating for us as per our requirement.

One more backlog is availability of washroom. There is only two (one for gents and another for ladies).
If there is rush, then one has to wait for a long. . .

Else I haven't found any cons. . .

Food quality is very good, Even I visit there on Nabami of last Puja, though there was crowd much, but they served very authentic and testy food.

It is a chinese restaurant and restaurant cum hookah bar located opposite Gariahat pantaloons outlet. The outlet was opened 5 odd years ago from the house of the owners of Bar-b-q. The main restaurant is not so huge and pretty compact. But the white seating arrangement and the decor in white and cream is nice and gives a good feel. The staff are warm and nice. Service is fast enough.

The restaurant is priced in the league of Flavors of China.

The food quality and quantity are very good. I love the Red Pepper Paneer they serve. Other starters are fresh and nice too. Th soups are nice especially the wanton soup. The main course dishes are also great. I loved their pan fried noodles. Deserts are good.

Pros:
1) Nice decor
2) Great food
3) Red pepper paneer is a must try
4) Descently priced

Cons:
1) A bit congested
2) Gariahat becomes a bit distant for a few

Please follow me to read my other reviews.

Situated opposite to Gariahat pantaloons outlet this is a hookah bar cum chinese restaurant.The food is average.The prices are on the higher side.The ambience and the service are okay.
The hookah bar on the ground floor is more popular than the restaurant.The hookahs are good.The prices are reasonable.The ambience is not bad but can be improved.The ventilation needs improvement because it gets a bit suffocating at times owing to the small space.The quality of the music can be improved.They only play a few popular recent hindi item songs.
Overall the restaurant is not worth recommending but the hookah bar is a decent option if you want to hang out with friends over hookah and you are a little concerned about the pocket pinch.

My personal favourite among restaurants near Gariahat crossing. A quite place on the second floor. The restaurant in very clean and the services are good. Chinese dishes are good with a wide array of drinks (happy hours 4-7 on drinks). The spices and tastes vary a bit from day to day, and occasionally I found their salt senses get unbalanced. Best place near Gariahat to take your fiancee for a drink.

I know of this restaurant from its very inception and have it seen it grow by leaps and bounds. Siddhanth Goenka , has been the key person behind this who has used his creativity and smart business skills to make a restaurant grow in Gariahat as if it were in Park Street.

Following are the reasons why you should visit China Whites :
  Ground Floor  :
a) Mostly for the youths . Has an extremely comfortable and casual atmosphere for them to chill and enjoy their food,drinks and hookah.
b) The food is economical and worth relishing.
c) There is an incredible range of hookah's which are priced at a rate, more reasonable than other places and much better in flavour.
d) The staff is extremely amicable and their service is quick.
e) English and Hindi music play in the  background which keeps one's spirits high.
 
Dining Area :
1) Once again, priced well and excellent food. 
2) Quick Service.
3) Formal setup/ambience. 

Terrace :
a) Beautifully made and maintained. You get your hookah here too and there is nothing better than sitting on the terrace and enjoying the breeze with your friends.

CHINESE FOOD @ CHINA WHITES
3 out of 5

China Whites is very popular among diners of all types - from youngsters to office goers to families- who throng the Gariahat area. The place provides a delightful break from your shopping spree. The ambience is very ordinary but friendly. The comfortable sitting arrangements and air conditioned setting provide much needed respite for those who drop in from their shopping errands. 

With this thought in mind, drop in there with my big group of friends for a luncheon. For starters, ordered their chilli baby corn, chilli garlic pepper chicken and lat me kai. Their starters were definitely well prepared, especially the lat me kai. The dishes were spicy without being too overpowering to the palate. 

We followed these with soups like tom yum soup, hot and sour soup and man chow soup. As side dishes, we ordered the following chicken dishes - tau si chicken, Kung pao chicken and tsing hoi chicken. The tau si dish- being a salty chicken dish -matched very well with the last spicy chicken item. To go with them, as recommended by our steward, we ordered lamb items like sliced lamb in hot garlic sauce and crispy conjee lamb. In both the dishes, the lamb pieces were very few, and this was certainly a letdown. Nevertheless, the few meat pieces that were in the dish were juicy and well seasoned. After having all of these dishes, we were still raring to go and ordered some seafood side dishes like butter garlic chilli prawn, fish chilli wine and Sichuan fish. These were followed by chicken fried rice and pan fried mixed noodles. Our luncheon was rounded off with desserts like toffee walnuts and vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce.

All in all, the place is extremely popular for its convenient location and moderately priced fare.

So I dropped in to this place with a date during pujas. And I asked her order. Whatever she ordered was bland and tasteless. Then I ordered. What I ordered was also bland and tasteless. 

Moral of the story: Everything here is bland and tasteless. Its premiumly priced solely for its location.

Visited this place yesterday. Located near Gariahat, this resto sounded nice. The ambiance is very ordinary and the seating is uncomfortable. The music being played was below average Hindi item songs. The environment was uncomfortable and filled with smoke and I felt suffocated probably because they dont have a good ventilation system in place. 
I had the crispy chilly babycorn which tasted very average but definitely burns a hole in your pocket. The pricing is at par with a BarBQ or any other park street eatery (God knows the justification). The crowd was young and its basically a hookah joint that fails to live up to any standards if you've been to Chai Break or Mocha. The Hookah pipe was not clean and the reason they gave was that it wasn't cleaned because of the Holi festivities. 
Would never visit this joint again. 1 star for China Whites.

I have visited this place yesterday for a dinner... This place was recommended by one of my closed friend.
Let me tell you guys what was our feeling :

Ambience : Neat & nice.. Famliy & Couples will really enjoy this place :). Music was soft. Sufficient lights but Dim in nature... 
Hospitality : Stuffs are good & will guide you well..

Food : I felf just OK. I will give them closed to 3 out of 5. Reason behind that was :
1. We got 5 spice chicken too salty
2. Fish in white wine is not upto the best of its class
3. Kung Pao chicken : the chicken was not soft.
4 : Special F Rice : Very Good
5 . Gr Noodles : Good...

The hibble part was the Tutty futty : It was just a 2- in - one with some canned fruits.. Yuk !!

I want to try this place again.. & if needed i will modify my feelings here.. till then Just & average oriental joint ....

Visited there first time recently and i was pleased. Food quality is very good,quantity is good and prices are moderate. For starters, i ordered 'Five spice Chicken' which was delectable and 'Pan fried chilly fish' which was delicious too. The 'chicken coriander soup' was superb. Hospitality is fine and staffs are courteous. The'chicken fried rice' was very tasty and 'szechwan fish' is good too. Ambiance is cool and very nice. Sitting arrangement is well. A bar is also available there. Sometimes there service becomes slow. It is located at the opposite of Pantaloons and below Balaram Saha Saree shop. I would suggest you all to visit there. You can dislike it too. i would rate 3 stars for it.

Golden fried prawns as starter.... just yum, with breezer. You will get loads of choices of food. They serve authentic Chinese food. Impressive ambiance, excellent service. One shortcoming is that the foods and drinks are overpriced. They also have a mind-blowing hookah bar. Must try it.
