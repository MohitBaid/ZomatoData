The go to place if you want to have fresh juices and are in the vicinity. They have a wide variety of fruit juices, as well as shakes and cold coffees. They make everything fresh after you place your order. I have had their juices many times and every time have been very happy with their stuff. They always have got the taste perfect and I feel refreshed after drinking their fresh fruit juices. Prices too are moderate and suitable to most people.
Surely recommended.

I'm an avid fan of the cold coffee of KJC, Elgin. And this is the first time I tried the outlet at Metro plaza. The coffee tastes the same, but what blew me away was the chocolate shake which was even better than Elgin branch. That said, I gave this place a lower rating as the price is higher here. The cold coffee and chocolate shake costs about 20/- more here. Taste wise, all good. But there should be synergy in the pricing policies.

** Location = Ground Floor Metro Plaza Shopping Centre, just opposite to Yum Tum.

**Brief = Have tried their juices on my visits to metro plaza shopping. They serve quickly and fresh stuff.

The fruit juices are prepared right in front of you and real fresh stuff is provided there.

** Purse Check = Around Rs.200/- would be good to quench your thirst.

**Overall = Nice and variety of juices available.Would like to try their masala thums up next time. Cheers.

Tried the Orange Juice here. The Juice was made fresh, right in front of my eyes. Tasted good, however I felt, the products here a bit overpriced. But then, being located inside a Mall, makes the place expensive by default. Didn't get to try any other variant, as I was running short of time.

If you want to remain hydrated in the sticky summer of Kolkata while you are shopping in Metro Plaza, try some fresh juices or creamy shakes at Krishna Juice centre... Prices are reasonable and the counter is clean!!

One of the most famous places in Calcutta for a glass of fresh juice. Anything that you order here is good. They've introduced fresh cream with fruits which is a must try. I feel prices are a bit on the higher side. Parking may be a bit of an issue considering it's location. A must visit place though.

This place has so many outlets all across the city. The juices are nice and fresh and a blessing during the summers. I also happen to love their grape and vanilla shake. I have never ordered something here and not liked it... probably cause i love juices and milkshakes and other cool things but still.

Location: Ground Floor, Metro Plaza Shopping Centre.

This is the second outlet of Krishna Juice Centre (the first being at Bhawanipur) which also serves freshly made juices, shakes and smoothies. As the name suggests, it is a beverage-only counter.

- All the juices are freshly made right in front of your eyes. I have sampled the watermelon, orange, pineapple, strawberry, litchi, pomegranate, sweet lime (mausambi), kiwi juices and all tasted good.
Your juice, your choice. :)

- They also have shakes & smoothies out of which the cold coffee was sampled, tasted good.

Overall a nice place to re-energize yourself in this scorching heat that too at a minimal pocket pinch!

Krishna Juice Center - Get the kick of Natural Juice's at the ground floor of Metro Plaza Shopping Center. A normal small kiosk.
========
Intro: 

Been there with a friend. Prices are very reasonable. Juice's are Good. Located opposite to the Yum Tum Food counter. 
========
Must Try:

Kiwi Juice - One of my favorite. Must Try. 
Orange Juice with Ice Cream - Tastes like the Citrus Kick of Juicy Fresh of Elgin Road. However, as they don't mix up the ice cream, the tastes differs. 
========
Cost for two: 200 bucks max
========
Conclusion:
A nice place for sipping up a glass of juice due specially during the afternoon times (12-2 pm). 
========
Note: 
1) Pictures will be updated shortly.
